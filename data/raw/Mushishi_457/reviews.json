            "content": "Mushishi is an episodic anime that has only one main character, Ginko.  Ginko's purpose is to travel from town to town, researching a phenomenon called \"mushi\" and their effects on humanity.  He also helps the different villages deal with any mushi \"problems\" they may encounter.\r\nStory:\r\nThis is the SINGLE MOST beautiful and original story I have ever seen, both inside and outside the anime community.  The concept of \"mushi\"~ an entity that is neither human, plant, or animal, that affects the daily lives of humans is intelligent and thought-provoking.  How Ginko deals with these phenomenon, whether he is just researching or \"treating\"them is even more compelling.  Mushishi's stories have great life lessons hidden within them, and they are brought to life beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nBeautiful.  Gorgeous.  Breath-taking.  What else is there to say?  The scenery art for this series is some of the best I have ever seen.  My only complaints about the artwork in this series, is the character art (other than Ginko's).  The different characters who appear episode after episode seem to be drawn identically, but just with new clothes and a name tacked on to differentiate them from the last episode.  However, this is easily over-looked because of the characters themselves (which will be discussed later.)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWell, I'm afraid my review will fall short here.  I'm afraid sound is not usually something I really pay attention to, typically.  I will say, however, that the OP song is one of my favorites (if not my favorite) among all anime I have seen.  Yes, it may be my age saying this, but it is reminiscent of the old 70's folk music that I love so much.  It really is a beautiful song.  I'm giving the sound a 10, though, based on this song, and the music I did notice through the series, which was quite appropriate for the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAaaaaahhhh...  the BEST part of the series.  Ginko... Ginko... well, he's just awesome.  Sometimes he may come across as one of your old \"monotone\" teachers/professors, but you get the feeling that he truly LOVES what he does, and the interest he has in researching the mushi is undeniable.  The way he sees mushi as neither \"evil or good\" ... they \"just exist, like we do\" is a testament to his character.  Another great thing about this series is the episodic characters.  Other than Ginko (and a doctor that shows up in 3 episodes), all characters are only present for 1 episode.  But as someone states in the forums, you come to care MORE about some of these 1 episode characters than you do for some recurring characters in other 26+ epi series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell, if it isn't obvious by now, I enjoyed/am enjoying this series immensely.  I was not sure if I could enjoy an episodic anime with new characters introduced each episode, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This series has become quite endearing to me, and has taken it's spot as my #1 favorite series of all time.  All of the different aspects of this series, good as they are, individually, combine to make one hell of an awesome and original series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe verdict... (as if it wasn't obvious)...  10/10.  This is definitely a series worth watching, and definitely one of THE MOST UNDERRATED anime series out there.  Please enjoy it, soon... and let's all spread the Mushishi <3.  :3",

            "content": "&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let yourself be blinded by fear or anger. \r\nEverything is only as it is.&rdquo;\r\nStory\r\nMushishi is essentially a series of stories styled after East Asian legends and folktales. In lieu of gods, spirits, and demons, the paranormal phenomena are attributed to more primitive yet no less enigmatic creatures called &ldquo;mushi&rdquo;. Dealing with their kind is the expertise of &ldquo;mushishi&rdquo;; professionals whose role may be thought of as an amalgam of healer, exorcist, biologist, X-Files investigator, and Jedi master (well, sort of). Ginko happens to be one of these mushishi and he wanders from town to town, looking for interesting cases and lending a helping handto those adversely affected by these mushi.\\n\\n\r\nAs formulaic as its premise may sound, no two incidents are alike and every episode features not only different mushi but a different setting and cast as well (with Ginko as constant exception). Because of these, the series is able to experiment with various concepts and human relationships and none of the stories ever end in a predictable manner. As such, there is little room for stagnation as each tale manages to be unique and refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nThe title is often mentioned in the same breath as Kino no Tabi though Mushishi&rsquo;s oriental setting and animistic influences give it a more distinct flavor and theme. Whereas Kino limits herself to exploring &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenarios by visiting different countries, Ginko takes it a step further by providing possible solutions and emphasizing the importance of living in harmony with nature, with fellow men, and most importantly, with the self.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWhile not exactly an anti-hero, Ginko&rsquo;s personality is an unusual mix of benevolence tempered with common sense; a combination of &ldquo;grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed, courage to change the things that should be changed, and the wisdom to distinguish one from the other.&rdquo; Saving lives is part of his job but he also knows when there&rsquo;s reason still to hope and when it&rsquo;s time to move on. He may break his own code at times for the well-being of the majority and he&rsquo;s not above fooling the gullible either just to get by. His expertise stems not only from his knowledge about mushi but also from his understanding of human nature. \\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, none of these supporting characters are shoved into stereotypes which plague most anime and manga. No catgirls, lecherous geezers, or single-minded youngsters (Believe it!); just regular folks in unusual circumstances due to encounters with mushi. Consequently, it doesn&rsquo;t require much effort to empathize with these characters even if most only appear in their respective episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNot only is the theme &ldquo;everything is only as it is&rdquo; evident in the content but it also permeates the manner in which the stories are presented. Mushishi doesn&rsquo;t try to impress; it simply delivers. While other shows of this era tend go overboard with the fancy CG animation, Mushishi&rsquo;s visuals remain spare yet aesthetically pleasing. Rather than filling up the screen with explosions and fanservice shots at every possible moment, vivid scenes of natural beauty such as raindrops falling from the heavens, cherry blossoms drifting in the wind, and sunlight penetrating the dense foliage are shown instead. Of course, the viewers are occasionally treated to fantastic scenes showing the surreal characteristics of the mushi but these are shown only when called for in the stories and nothing is done in excess. Even the character designs are relatively plain but perhaps these also contribute to the story in their own way since the audience is less likely to judge the characters based on their appearances.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nLikewise, the audio takes the minimalist approach. The soundtrack is comprised of simply melodies which are surprisingly effective in evoking various thoughts and emotions. Ranging from haunting and heart-rending to hopeful and bittersweet, the music often eliminates the need for more words in the most crucial scenes. Also worth noting is the lack of exaggerated voice acting which makes the cast sound more like real people rather than cookie-cutter characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn addition to its enchanting audio and visuals, Mushishi also serves drama and thought-provoking content in balanced amounts. Its subtle content and execution never insult the intelligence and present several interesting ideas without drowning the viewers in philosophical jargon or sophistry. All in all, Mushishi truly is one of the finest anime specimen out there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis review is the final result of a review team composed of members from the &quot;Critics and Connoisseurs&quot; club.

            "content": "In spirit, at least, each episode of Mushishi strongly reminds me of one thing: A cave painting. A depiction of man and the outside world, brief and primal but perfectly expressive, radiating mysticism, perhaps possessed of more meaning than it initially appears to have.\r\nFrom minute one, Mushishi's representation of a vast world grabs the eye and doesn't let go. Lush forests with dew dripping from every leaf; barren winter mountains peppered with stubborn snow-covered trees; an innocuous pond with lilies on the surface of the still water. The series roams from setting to setting, and all are presented with a lifelike attention to detail. Thecolor palette is richly varied, reaching from the brilliant emerald of vegetation to the deep turquoise of the sea to the dusky red of a far-off sunset. Lighting is used to strong effect, whether it's beams of sun streaming through layers of foliage and mist or a candle's flame struggling to brighten a dark old house. \\n\\n\r\nAnd within those habitats, the mushi themselves, creatively rendered as a strange mix of the familiar and the utterly alien\u2014like shapeless blobs propelled by twitching motions, like phosphorescent insects scuttling along the earth, like great legless serpents twisting skyward. Some take the shape of a natural phenomenon, and the sight of a living rainbow exploding from the earth, or a long-restrained cloud breaking free, expanding and floating away, is bound to impress. The animation on the whole is excellent, but the mushi in particular seem to move with a vivid otherworldly fluidity. At least part of Mushishi is about making sense of the mysterious, bringing reason to something that seems unreasonable, and the designs of the mushi add some believability to this; it's quite easy to see how they could be thought of as ghosts, beasts, or legends, able to inspire both wonder and fear. The tranquility of the environments is consistently impressive in a low-key way, but the spectacle of the mushi can be eerie, majestic, and everything in between.\\n\\n\r\nSound is part of atmosphere, and in the same way that cold urban horrors might use reverberations in dark alleys or the foreboding thrumming of electronics, Mushishi might use a chorus of insects or the roar of drifting snow to surround us, allowing the setting to speak its piece. The music is minimal but startlingly effective, in many cases fitting easily alongside and even seeming to mimic the voices of the earth. Slow piano notes overlap with rhythmic footsteps, a woodwind's sad screams resemble those of a forlorn bird. So, too, can the score sound almost unearthly, with an ominous progression of bells and chimes sometimes underscoring a haunting ending or signaling the arrival of the mushi. The result is an immersive ambiance where visuals and sound alone can convey dark, brooding tension or innocent curiosity with equal ease. It isn't just pretty, it's totally engrossing, exuding pure atmospheric mastery in almost every scene.\\n\\n\r\nThrough this vast world walks Ginko, revenant of revenants, our looking glass. Perceptive of the nature of human and mushi alike, he uses words as careful and deliberate as his journeying stride to become the voice of reason and, with an air of serene confidence, impart his knowledge to others. To become a witness to needless death, a bearer of bad news, or a participant in deception is sometimes part of his job description. As an admirer of life and truth, he cares for none of these tasks, but he'll defy his own nature and undertake them with solemn dedication if he feels that it's necessary. He is wise, but not infallibly so. Nor is he a complete stoic; outbursts of childlike wonder at incredible sights, sarcastic retorts to smart-mouthed travelers, and emotion-laden shouts of panic and warning to his fellow humans all show him as a little more than just the nonchalant white-haired sage. His development, in the traditional sense, is sparse, but he is afforded a poignant backstory that makes him and his thought process a little less of an enigma.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Mushishi gently pushes a picture of a sprawling and intricate world where all beings affect each other in ways both seen and unseen, their actions rippling outward in ever-widening circles, and in that sense, Ginko as a character is no different than any other living thing in the show, simultaneously of little and great consequence. He may be our guide, cursed and blessed to ceaselessly wander, but the world doesn't turn for him. Rather, it's in what he represents that we might find significance: The quest for knowledge, the insatiable desire to understand even while knowing that the sheer body of things in existence prevents total understanding. The need to capture the meaning of what surrounds us, spread our wisdom responsibly, and use it to form calculated reactions to the world instead of rash judgments. He truly is that silver fish swimming endlessly through dark water, opalescent barbels probing fathomless black crevices, illuminating them, if only for a brief moment. Much of Mushishi's strength lies in the ability to provoke thought without direct questions, to let an image serve as subtext, and Ginko himself represents an impressively seamless merging of humanity and idea.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is episodic, not bound by an overarching plot. It is a series of self-contained stories which vary in theme, but are always skillfully crafted. Most episodes consist of human drama, based on relatable and familiar emotions, infused with an element of the natural world. The episodic format delivers powerful and gripping tales in an extremely brief timetable, a feat which I have no problem appreciating. The scenarios are original, and the writing is rich with little subtleties and metaphors, but each episode can be understood and appreciated as successful story even if you've no desire to peer into them deeply. View Mushishi as a progression of intelligent parables full of interesting ideas, or as a bunch of moving and affecting tales; much to its credit, it is both.\\n\\n\r\nPart of what makes Mushishi work is its steadfast refusal to portray anything in terms as simple as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cevil.\u201d Stories where barbaric man stupidly abuses mother nature, or where nature is a hate-filled monster that comes from the hills to eat scared little man, are a dime a dozen, and while they might pass as entertainment, they often fail to say anything worth saying because they handle man and earth as if they're combatants in a holy war. Mushishi is not so black and white, and it has an idea that scales much better. The mushi are not red-toothed animals seeking to kill in droves. The humans are not greedy savages bent on scorching the earth. Both are just beings, trying to survive in the same place and at the same time. That they will cross paths, have conflicting interests, use each other, and hurt each other is inevitable; such is survival. Each episode is one meeting of mushi and human, one miniscule butting of heads in a massive world, with the implication being that this is simply what happens, everywhere. Instead of vilifying humans or portraying nature as a vengeful power, Mushishi whispers: This is just the way things are. It does give us a small shove by implying that, as the ones with the ability to reason and understand, the responsibility for mitigating the damage that humans inflict (and the damage that humans receive) falls on the humans, but it never degenerates into the preachy heavy-handedness or gross oversimplifications that plague many works with similar themes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's that theme which allows Mushishi to navigate the spectrum of human emotion. Conflict in its world does not arise from moral failings or piggish greed, only from a lack of understanding, and understanding is a sword with many edges. Ask the child who learns of death, or the old man who learns of life. Sometimes the knowledge you gain is liberating, sometimes it's disheartening, sometimes it's terrifying. Mushishi can be all of those words and more, but even when it strays to one extreme, it never loses its humanity, its worldliness, or its feeling of being completely natural. Just as it can depict the warm orange rays of the sun and the cold white howl of the snow, it can depict innocent wonder and violent loss, and with equal sincerity. It has balance, and then some.\\n\\n\r\nAs a caveat, I will say that this is the kind of series that practically begs me to use the phrase \u201cnot for everyone.\u201d It's dialogue-heavy, more about the thought leading up to action than the action itself; it keeps the big guns of its visual spectacle on a tight leash, letting them explode only after a suitable buildup to assure the maximum payoff; it doesn't have the conventional storytelling satisfaction of explicitly coming full circle, instead simply tapering off and fading quietly, as episodic series sometimes do. A few episodes will likely be enough to inform you of whether or not it's to your tastes, and I've no doubt that many have labeled (and will continue to label) it as simply \u201cboring.\u201d I understand the origin of this opinion, but I just can't share it, because Mushishi is strangely beautiful and intensely fascinating on several levels. Imbibe it a little at a time like a fine liquor, or dive deeply into it and become drunk on its atmosphere, intrigue, and insights. In my experience, neither disappoints.",

            "content": "Some people will tell you Mushishi is great because it doesn\u2019t contain action and fanservice. These must be the same people who praise a film for not including Adam Sandler. They also make Mushishi look more pretentious than it is. It\u2019s far from it. The problem is, even though Mushishi has a worthwhile aim and the right methods, it doesn\u2019t know how to use them.\r\nIn order for something to be pretentious, it needs to put up a cover while not including the methods. An anime that has a realistic art style with dramatic characters is pretentious. It looks realistic, but the methods that are usedare opposed to it.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi makes it clear what it wants to be in the first episode. It\u2019s a series that\u2019s concerned mainly with men\u2019s relationship to nature. The mushi are just the physical embodiment of what nature can be. Some have criticized Mushishi for creating a magic system that has no rules but leads to convenience, but that\u2019s untrue. Mushishi doesn\u2019t have an RPG-like magic system because it uses magic to explore themes, not to offer instructions on how to do battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe rules the magic in Mushishi follows is the theme of nature. It\u2019s successful in that department. We often see nature portrayed as a calm, peaceful place in contrast to heartless machinery. If the person is especially ignorant, we will even hear about the good old days when men was One With Nature and everything was peaceful and good. Most people see nature though the lens of the Garden of Eden.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who ever bothered to learn a little about nature \u2013 botany or geology or zoology \u2013 will understand Mushishi\u2018s stance on nature. Nautre is unstable, mysterious, powerful and cares nothing about us. Volcanic eruptions and meteors crashing are terrible things, but they\u2019re produced by an indifferent world that has no malice. They just happen. Then again, it\u2019s the same world that gives us great food and visual spectacles. There plenty of time when the terrible and beautiful merge \u2013 how many dangerous animals are also beauiful?\\n\\n\r\nThe series achieves that by the nature of the mushi. They often benefit and harm at the same time, like allowing people to give birth to a person that died. There is always a sense of wonder and mystery surrounding the mushi. Even Ginko, despite his cold demeanor is also startled by them. What people don\u2019t say enough about Mushishi is that this is how fantasy should be done. It\u2019s not like Martin\u2019s world, which is full of details to make it clear and familiar. It\u2019s truly alien and fantastical.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the series falls is in all other departments. The series doesn\u2019t put enough effort into the characters and the stories. They exist solely to present the varying mushi. There are films whose purpose is only to deliver a visual experience, so abandoning conventional storytelling can be a smart decision. It\u2019s not here. It\u2019s not just that 26 episodes make you demand more, but that abandoning conventional storytelling doesn\u2019t help the series\u2019 aim.\\n\\n\r\nThe series forgets about the \u2018men\u2019 in the relationship between men and nature. The characters feel like they have an outer life. The issues spring from life itself \u2013 art, marriage, vision \u2013 rather than having a guy preventing another guy from Being the Best. There isn\u2019t enough character psychology to make these issues feel important.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all interchangeable. I kept waiting for a reason why this person is concerned with vision, or this one with marriage. Nothing is pointless in fiction, after all. In order to bring depth to an issue, you need to connect to the character. Something in the character\u2019s personality needs to be related to the issue so it will affect it. A lot of shounen shows know this, so they tend to give a narcisstic nature to their characters. The character doesn\u2019t just struggle with The Problem but with his own nature. Ikki learns to curb his narcissism and stop swinging between it and depression. Tai learns (or is supposed to) how being a leader works.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these two not being the most developed examples, they make for different stories. You couldn\u2019t put Tai in Ikki\u2019s story, because Tai\u2019s personality is concerned with relationships with others. You couldn\u2019t put Ikki in Tai\u2019s story, because his story is about learning that sometimes you lose some and win some. I could not remember a character that had a situation concerned with his personality. They tend to have generic wants and needs, nothing that\u2019s unique to them. They may be \u2018ordinary people\u2019, but people are not clones even when they follow patterns. Or if the series wanted to comment on that, then the similarity should\u2019ve been made important. Nothing is there to emphasize how similar humans are. These are just empty characters.\\n\\n\r\nGinko is not much better. An episodic series isn\u2019t an excuse to have undeveloped characters. They may not change throughout the series, but they need a personality that will affect every story. A lot of Cartoon Network shows are purely episodic, yet they\u2019re full of quirky characters who create the stories because of who they are.\\n\\n\r\nWe get a backstory episode for Ginko, but it doesn\u2019t reveal much. What\u2019s his motivation? Why is he so into mushi? How does all this exploring affected his worldview? There are sometimes hints. In one episode, Ginko agrees with what I wrote above about the cruelty of nature. This is just one instant, though. All Ginko does is visit people, help them solve the problem and that\u2019s it.\\n\\n\r\nThat makes him a plot device, not a real character. He exists so we\u2019ll have someone to follow, but how different would the series be if it was a random mushishi in every episode? I do not ask to immidiately reveal who Ginko is. If every episode gave a small piece, it would be enough. The collector, who appears from time to time is the only person with something resembling a drive. He\u2019s really into collecting, and values it more than humans. It\u2019s a little touch that makes him more real than anyone here. There are sometimes other mushishi\u2019s who act a little different, but the difference is never wide enough.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a missed oppurtunity, sure, but not one without merits. It\u2019s as original as people say it is, and a good example of how far storytelling can go. It didn\u2019t live up to its concept, but it\u2019s still good that it\u2019s out there and that it found an audience. Hopefully, one of these someone will pick up these ideas and run away with them. It\u2019s a fun series, but one that should be easy to improve.\\n\\n\r\n3.5 mushi out 5",

            "content": "This anime was a very  unique experience. The show introduces a very interesting concept called the mushi. It'd be very difficult to describe what the mushi are precisely. In a nutshell , they're essentially spiritual beings, but at the same time they inhabit the physical world ( Yeah I know what your thinking, you just completely contradicted yourself. I know, I know just go with it) and they use humans as a host ( very similar to a parasite). One aspect in particular that struck me about the show was how it was devoid of any western influences whatsoever. Many anime fans don't realizehow anime is indeed heavily influenced by Western culture. But Mushi-shi primarily borrows stories from many east Asian folklore and myths. Although Mushi-shi does offer an original and innovative premise/concept, the execution is most certainly flawed. \\n\\n\r\nStory \\n\r\nThe story of Mushi-shi follows the exploits of Ginko, who is otherwise known as the Mushi-shi or Mushi master in the English dub. Ginko's job as a Mushi-shi is to go around and help people who have been infected by the mushi. This is one of the flaws to Musi-shi, which is it's formulaic plot. As you go through these episodes you'll notice that 90% of the them play out like this: Ginko is wandering around, he encounters a village, group of people or an individual who have had an encounter with the mushi. Which in turn, leads to them being harmed to the point were they're crippled or their lives are hanging on by a thread. Ginko attempts to save them. His efforts leads them to being cured or sometimes the episode will end off tragically where the one infected dies. Basically, this formula repeats for 26 episodes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nYeah.....the series is a tad bit repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nNotice how I said a tad bit repetitive and not overly repetitive. Because what saves it is the mushi themselves, there isn't a single episode where the mushi are exactly the same; it's always fascinating to observe them, because the way they interact and work with humans is so compelling. Oh and did I forget to mention that Mushi-shi has no main storyline ? Yes, this is an episodic anime where each episode is it's own standalone story. This wasn't a problem for me, but I know it will be for some. Because of course, most people generally prefer a main ongoing story. Again this wasn't a problem for me. Also, when I say episodic, I mean it. It's not like Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo, where it's episodic in nature but it has an overarching story. That\u2019s not the case with Mushi-shi. Plus there's no recurring characters in the show except Ginko. I mean, if someone was to walk up to me and say \"hey, I found Mushi-shi to be a phenomenal anime and I absolutely loved it,\" I'd completely understand. If somebody else walked up to me and said \"hey, I found Mushi-shi to be extremely boring and I didn't like it,\" I'd also completely understand. Because of how literally quiet and subtle it is (not recommended if you got A.D.H.D), which isn't a bad thing by the way. Mushi-shi is definitely not for everyone; it's not meant to appeal to the masses, its meant for a niche audience who can truly appreciate its fascinating concept and artistry. It's very reminiscent of an independent arthouse film. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters & Themes \\n\r\nNow on to the themes and characters. This anime excels in that department. Mushi-shi does a fantastic job of exploring themes of loss, despair, self sacrifice, suffering and tragedy. Whenever the mushi infects people, family bonds are tested and death is always around the corner. If someone does in fact die or suffer a heavy loss, it always resonates with you. So yeah, clearly the show has a lot of emotional depth. Lets get into the characters, now as I mentioned before there are no recurring characters except for Ginko, and for the most part the anime does a fairly good job of fleshing out these nonrecurring characters. Especially considering the fact that each has only about 21 minutes (excludes opening and closing songs) of screen time. On to Ginko, whose obviously the main protagonist. You'll definitely take a liking to him as he's a very kindhearted individual. He does get a good amount of characterization and we do get a back story as to how he became a Mushi-shi/Mushi master. But really compared to other main protagonists its wasn't enough in my opinion. That's another one of my problems with Mushi-shi, Ginko needs to be fleshed out more. Nevertheless, he's an all around good main protagonist \\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nArguably the best part of Mushi-shi, from the score, to the voice acting and even just the sounds going on in the back ground. The opening track is called \" The Sore Feet Song\" by Ally Kerr and its a solid one overall. You'll probably enjoy it if you like folk rock. Something that is also very unique about Mushi-shi is the ending theme, or should I say ending themes, because every episode has its own closing song and I got to say, I liked all of them. It's hard to describe them because the instrumentation is so unique and each one feels so surreal and atmospheric. They have an otherworldly vibe to them. Then we have the actual score within the show which is also great and complements the mood excellently. Like the closing themes, the score has an otherworldly vibe as well that I can't put my finger on. Finally on to the voice acting, which is outstanding on both the Japanese sub and English Dub. No seriously, it's that good, especially the English dub which in my opinion surpasses the original Japanese and it ranks up there with Funimation\u2019s best work like Baccano, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Fullmetal Alchemist. Both Yuto Nakano and Travis Willingham embody the character of Ginko perfectly, and all the other cast members do a great job as well especially considering that fact that they only appear once. Also, pay attention to the tone of the voice acting on both languages and notice how monotone and subtle it is. Don't let it discourage you. This is completely intentional because it's meant to match the quiet and subtle tone of the actual show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation \\n\r\nFinally, we get into the last part of the review, the art and animation. The animation is very good and smooth, but the art (especially the backgrounds) is absolutely stunning. You'll know what I mean when you watch the series for yourself, just pay close attention to the detail that is given here. From the lush green vegetation, to the mountains and rivers. It's absolutely gorgeous. I recall when I was watching it, I had to pause the show for a moment because the backgrounds were so beautiful to look at. Hands down, some of the best you'll find in all of anime. I guarantee it. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts \\n\r\nWhen it's all said and done, Mushi-shi has it's flaws and at the same time it has a lot of good things going for it. It's formulaic tendencies really held it back. Plus, Ginko could have been fleshed out more. Regardless of that, this anime was a joy to watch and it's a good solid one at that. If you have an open mind, I recommend you check it out, especially if you want something that is unique and original.",

            "content": "It's pretty rare to see a purely episodic anime that isn't a comedy, and that's just another reason Mushishi was such a treat.\r\nSTORY - The series follows the journeys of a traveling Mushishi named Ginko who investigates paranormal phenomenon usually caused by creatures called Mushi. Each episode describes one of his encounters with self-sustaining villagers in and around vast mountain ranges. Something is wrong, and Ginko does what he can. It's very straightforward, but even though each episode more or less follows the same format, it isn't a simple case of Ginko saving the day every single time. Sometimes things are beyond his control; sometimesnothing can be done regardless, and sometimes, nothing need be done at all. It can be frustrating sometimes when Ginko has revelations that he won't explain until later, and because of the supernatural nature of the Mushi, Mushishi has quite an expository air to it. The mysteries aren't of the sort you can really deduce yourself, and there's a lot of talking and explanation.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the way the Mushi and humans interact can be very fascinating at times, disturbing at other times. Sometimes Mushishi feels like a cross between a nature documentary and a paranormal investigation. Fans of either would definitely enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - Ginko is really the only reoccurring character in the series, though his collector/doctor friend, Adashino, does show up now and again. Each episode contributes a different situation involving different people in a different place, and they almost never have anything to do with one another. Naturally, this means the exclusive cast of each episode remains pretty generic. There is the generic little girl and little boy character, the young woman, the young man, the middle-aged woman and man, the old woman and the man. Sure, the individual characters may have unique characteristics depending on their situation, but for the most part, the cares, worries, and priorities of each of these archetypes are standard. I didn't really mind though. After all, their situations did set them apart from one another, and as almost all these characters lived in small, self-sustained villages, it's conceivable to say that their lifestyles made them similar.\\n\\n\r\nGinko, as the protagonist, gives us a little more depth and insight into his personality, but even he remains a mostly enigmatic character for the length of the series. His intentions are generally altruistic, but there is more to his actions than that. Actually, I wish Ginko's thoughts and personal feelings about Mushi are touched on more -- there are definitely morals and deeper philosophies involved, but they're only touched on in one or two episodes. Still, those are the episodes that give Ginko the most personality, and I think it's very easy to relate to him as a result. His quirky habits and mannerisms are kind of endearing too, and he's just a fun character to watch. He's easy-going: very fitting for this kind of episodic series.\\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - Mushishi definitely has some of the most gorgeous backgrounds for an animated series (as opposed to an animated movie) I've ever seen. The forests are lush with detail and vibrant colors. It floors me the way every plant and flower and tree branch and leaf is expressed. Views from mountaintops are breathtaking, and the oceans glitter with tiny waves and light. Cloud formations are grandiose and powerful, and the night sky is always vibrant with stars. These are some really, really amazing environments, man. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs, in contrast, are pretty plain. Ginko stands out with his white hair and teal eye (which have a legitimate explanation beyond &quot;he's an anime character!&quot;), and his face is pretty unique in itself, but all those archetypal villagers? In every episode, you'll have deja vu. &quot;Hey, isn't that the character from the last episode?&quot; No. It isn't. None of the villagers get repeat episodes, but you'll think so for a while because all of them look the same! Every little girl character looks like every other little girl character, and every middle-aged man villager looks like every other in the same category. It's actually pretty amusing, and I didn't particularly mind this repetition simply because... well, it doesn't matter all that much. Since none of the characters repeat, it isn't like it's that confusing. Anyway, I can accept that they blew all their character design budget on the backgrounds; it's really not that bad of a trade-off at all. :P\\n\\n\r\nI also really liked that Mushishi had a very tranquil air about it. The title screens of every episode appeared quietly into the existing scene, calmly and without interruption. There is no bridge animation/page to frame where the commercial break would be. It just fades in and out very smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - Mushishi has some really minimalistic music. The soundtrack throughout the series is mostly of the traditional Japanese sort -- bells, gongs, bamboo flutes, biwas, and other string instruments. They're all very, very fitting to the series and definitely enhance the scenes they're used in. They're moody, eerie, calming, and occasionally cheerful. Sometimes there's only silence, but that fits too. For being so minimal, the sounds in Mushishi are incredibly effective. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is already an indication of this. It's soft and slow and reminds me somewhat of something they'd play in a yoga class: soothing. The lyrics are in English (not Engrish!) and also fit very well with the themes of the series. I love the name of it too -- &quot;The Sore Feet Song.&quot; The ending theme is always an instrumental and changes with every episode, something you don't see often at all. The composer is none other than Toshiou Masuda of Naruto fame, and he once again does an awesome, awesome job (even if you don't like the Naruto anime, it's hard to deny that it has an amazing soundtrack). The end themes are generally very mellow, bittersweet, which echos the endings of many episodes. More yoga music!\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - I saw all of the series subbed, and interesting enough, Mushishi has a gigantic cast list because there's a different voice actor for pretty much every single random villager character in the series. I thought since many of the villagers are reasonably similar, they'd just use one voice per archetype. No! All of these people have their own voice! I guess that's a pretty good way of making up for the lack of variation in visual designs, and it works out pretty well. It's worth noting that a majority of the little kid characters aren't annoying! Some of them are actually... reasonably cute? I really did enjoy Ginko's voice also; it's pretty &quot;normal&quot; sounding, but it fits his character very well.\\n\\n\r\nEdit; I just discovered that the entirety of Mushishi is available streaming off FUNimation's website, dubbed. As such, I took the liberty of checking out a few episodes, and it's pretty good! I really wasn't sure about Ginko's voice at first, but Travis Willingham does a pretty decent imitation of Yuto Nakano's voice and it warms up to you fairly quickly. Willingham also somehow manages the same quirky kind of tone. While the American cast of villagers isn't quite as extensive as the Japanese, there are still a good number of varied talents there so it isn't too much repetition. All in all, I'd say FUNi did a pretty swell job.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - Mushishi might be one of those series you should watch a bit at a time just because it's entirely episodic and might feel a little repetitive in large doses. (I watched it all in two or three days, but hey, that's me.) There is no ending, and actually, I wouldn't mind seeing another season of this. There is an origin episode or two to flesh out Ginko's past and development as a character, but while they do help the general story along and I'm glad for them, I don't think they're entirely necessary either. If you like scientifically presented supernatural stuff and don't mind a very easy-come, easy-go story, then I'm sure you'll like Mushishi. :3\\n",

            "content": "This review contains no major spoilers. I was beyond thrilled when I had finally got my hands on Mushishi in its entirety. I have to shamelessly admit that I'm pretty dang easily entertained. So typically when there is a show that EVERYONE seems to love, I tend to enjoy it just as much. Unfortunately, once I got around to getting into the series I found a number of issues that others just didn't seem to have. I was entertained on a number of episodes, and definitely compelled to complete it. However, this certainly wasn't the masterpiece I thought I was about to watch.\r\nAesthetically this animeis among the best of the mid 2000s. Everything in this series just looks so damn good. The quality ranges all the way from the characters, to the many varying environments, and especially the mushi as they are drawn in a seemingly endless variety of colors, forms and sizes. There is really no \"rules\" when it comes to mushi so the creators can just draw whatever the heck they want. This leads to many off the wall forms, colors, shapes, matter, you get the idea. One of my favorite parts while watching was waiting to see what the next episode's mushi were going to look like. The dub is on par with the animation in that it's completely flawless. This is undoubtedly one of the best dubs out there. The music never really clicked with me, but it never detracted from the quality either, so no complaints from me there.\\n\\n\r\nNow the episodic story design and lack of main characters are where my feelings of this series seems to steer differently from the mass's . As much as I wanted to love this series, I just never got completely sucked in like my favorite shows always seem to have a way of doing. My first complaint is Ginko. He is our protagonist, mushi master, and the only real reoccurring character of the series (save for very brief multi-appearance of another) . Ginko is completely lacking in any trace of charisma. Actually, he lacks just about everything.  He really never expresses happiness, sadness, any emotions for that matter. There are a few instances where he verbally exclaims he is concerned with something or another, but it certainly doesn't feel sincere due to his stone face and never changing body language. Even in one instance where his life is in serious danger, he just stoically thinks to himself \"oh I'm gonna die, I don't want to....this isn't good\" with no feelings of urgency or emotion, as if he were thinking of a chore he had to do or something. He has absolutely zero development through out the series, and even the relationships he forms from episode to episode feel superficial. Every new acquaintance is simply a means of progressing the episodes with no hints of any realistic bonds being formed. Considering every other person in the series only gets 20 minutes of screen time at the absolute max, these flaws with his character are kind of a big deal. I understand they most likely meant his passive presence to allow for the individual stories to take center stage, but it rarely worked well in my opinion. I feel many of the stories would have benefited if Ginko were written in a way that we could relate or feel towards him. You can't have a great vagabond story if you can't feel for the guy ya know?  \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the other characters, most are fine given the little time they do have. They are mostly believable with ranging personalities so it doesn't get bland. But it's hard to really form a solid judgement towards them one way or another due to how little time we actually get to spend with them. As for the stories? To be totally honest here, a number of them can be just flat out boring. It would be inaccurate to say that they're \"bad\". But many just don't really drag you in as much as I anticipated that they would. The series opens strong, the first DVD is pretty entertaining. As we're introduced to the world of Mushishi, its design and uniqueness ropes you in at the beginning. But as the show progresses it never actually builds on anything. Every episode begins with an inexplicable conflict, and of course every conflict is revealed to be the result of some different kind of mushi. The situation is then analyzed and the mushi are taken care of in some overly convenient new obscure manner. Rinse and repeat. This formula begins to grow stale. Like I said earlier, there are no rules for mushi. This is great for the artist's freedom, but not so great as a plot device. I've never been a huge stickler for realism, but many of the solutions seem waaaayyy overly convenient, because previously unknown mushi traits always pop up at just the right time. For example all of a sudden a hopeless situation will be resolved because moonlight hits a mushi, or in another instance sculpting some pottery on the spot leads to the fix of an otherwise incurable ailment. There are just so many completely random and off the wall solutions to many of the problems that the viewer is expected to just roll with. I feel that it definitely detracts some from some of the show's enjoyment. With such short stories, it's also just really hard to get engrossed in the characters and their problems. The series does have it's highlights of memorable episodes, particularly in the first few episodes and then again towards the end, but these moments of greatness aren't exactly the norm. Many of the stories in the middle are just on the dull side unfortunately. Despite being only 20 minutes a pop, some seem to drag, moving inexcusably slow while not really offering enough excitement to make you actually care whether or not things turn out for the better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mushishi is a very chill and relaxing show to watch. The stories are always at least pleasantly humble despite all else. I also never grew tired of the fresh animation in each episode. However, given all the hype I had heard, I found myself disappointed and longing for something more. This is an okay anime, but not the amazing series I had originally thought I was about to watch. 6/10",

            "content": "10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10... 10! I've been seeing so many perfect 10's handed out to this Anime and it genuinely baffles me. When I saw all the scores this Anime was getting, I went into it thinking that I will be going into an Anime where everything will be amazing and wonderful, where I will become one of the people giving this a perfect score too. I was excited and thinking that maybe this Anime will have life lessons? Maybe it will take advantage of the world building to create exciting stories? Maybe it will create memorable characters? Nope. The amount of 10'shanded out to this show fooled me yet again, and I fell into the damn hype!\\n\\n\r\nCan someone actually explain to me why this Anime is considered a \"masterpiece\" by the Anime community, or why it is above an Anime like Death Note? I don't get it. It has \"good\" world building if you can call it that, some good episodes, some bad episodes and an uninteresting main character. I'd say most of the episodes were good so that's a plus, but the amount of problems it has in addition to how uninteresting and boring it became at the end just rubbed off the wrong way on me. \\n\\n\r\nMushishi is a show that talks about Mushi, mythical creatures created by the Anime to be some sort of driving force for the episodic plot this show has. These Mushi are forces of nature, sometimes acting as a foil to humans and ruining humans' lives. The only way to beat the Mushi and figure out a treatment for the sicknesses these creatures bring is by calling upon a Mushishi, which is supposed to be a person who can deal with the Mushi and figure out treatments for their victims. Mushishi can also see Mushi, unlike most normal people.\\n\\n\r\nHere we already have our first problem. Unless I am blind and infected by Mushi myself, then I see that this Anime does not show us anything of the Mushishi organization or it's origin, how they study Mushi, how they treat their patients and how Mushi came to be. These are all unanswered and the viewer is left with this void of knowledge all the way to the end. The Anime could have answered most of them or at least one of them, but it chose not to, it chose to create a work that is half finished. How do you go on to create a fantasy story full of whimsical creatures of all types, but not answer the most basic of questions at the very least? I've seen so many stories with plot holes, but they at least had some form of decency to explain the basic elements in their settings. Mushishi fails at living up to it's full potential by not explaining the magical elements it has created. What would you prefer, a story that has good world building, is explained and could be understood by the viewer? Or a story that has good world building, but does not answer anything to the viewer? If you pick the second option then this Anime is perfect for you!\\n\\n\r\nMy second problem here is that the Anime never explains why people can see Mushi while others cannot. We know, for example, that some people can see Mushi because they were infected by the Mushi. But why do the Mushi choose specific people instead of a whole tribe? Why do Mushi choose these specific people in the first place? Why do some people who are infected by the Mushi see them, while others cannot? In the very first episode we see a ritual happen, but it is never explained why this ritual happened, and the subject of Mushi humans is never seen again and just forgotten. Why? Mushi human appeared in the first episode and just never appeared again. All we saw from that point was just the Mushi in their original form infecting humans. \\n\\n\r\nIt just doesn't explain anything at all, other than maybe Ginko calling the Mushi by some absurd name based on it's type and figuring out a way to beat them somehow. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and the soundtrack are the only good things about this show. The art is incredible, it is very aesthetically pleasing. I remember watching an episode about the stone Mushi that turns into a beautiful pink cloud when someone carves into it, it was a very beautiful episode, so much so that I looked at a cloud on my way home from college and kept thinking about Mushishi. Another example is about a Mushi that takes the shape of a tree, when cut down the tree spawns legs and crawls inside the woods, so the visuals are definitely beautiful and surprise you as well. See how Mushishi delivers some amazing concepts? If only the Anime had explained and took advantage of it's setting to achieve it's maximum potential... Otherwise we wouldn't have had some very boring and stupid episodes too, wrapped up in an unexplained world.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are awful, end of discussion... do I really need to explain this one? The story has one reoccurring character that does not get development. Ginko is an awful character, no backstory, no development, no reasoning to his actions, no nothing. The episodic characters don't get any form of development whatsoever, but that does not matter so much to me because they have the excuse of being episodic characters, not main ones. The show instead should develop the main character at least, right? This is Mushishi, did you expect the main character to make any sort of logic or get any development? Come on man! Not in one scene do we see Ginko have an inner monologue with himself about how he feels towards his life or the Mushi around him, he's so one dimensional that the only attributes I can attribute to him are smoking, having one eye (which is never explained) and being unable to feel sadness, anger or happiness. Basically just an emo who somehow knows how to deal with Mushi. The Anime does give us some of his backstory during the final episode, but it only tells us one thing to know about him, that thing is that Mushi are attracted to him. Really? 26 episodes just for this? Jesus Christ what a disappointment!\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy this Anime for the most part, meaning that it had more interesting episodes than flat out bad ones. It still had some awful and boring episodes, so it gets a 5, maybe a 6 from me in terms of enjoyment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPeople are saying that this Anime is not like other repetitive and predictable Anime, as in it does not rely on cheap plot twists and big explosions to make itself look cooler. Rather it is a very meditative show that is slow and takes it's time to explain stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThese people who are saying that, they make me think that Mushishi is like The Wire of Anime (lol). I actually do think that this is like The Wire, they are both boring and don't rely on cheap tricks to advance their plots.... and that's where their similarities end. The Wire explains it's setting and plot fully, develops it's characters, and actually is a commentary about our world.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is an over hyped, overrated Anime that you should not waste your time getting into. This is a lesson that you should not always give into the hype.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So what reason could there be to praise a show that's been reviewed four times already, receiving highest marks? The answer is simple enough: it's been a long time since an anime has impressed me as much as Mushishi did. Going beyond the boundaries of the entertainment-based pop culture, this deserves the term 'art' in every aspect.\r\nThe provided synopsis could hardly be more accurate, yet does it tell little to nothing about the series. The reason for this is that Mushishi, unlike usual modern entertainment, convinces the viewer through style - aesthetics. There is no flashy, grotesque or absurd story, competing for attention among thecliche-ridden anime market. The plot flows like a calm streamlet, contemplative in its very essence.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode tells us a fascinating, coherent, artfully arranged tale revolving around Ginko and the people he meets on his journey, who are facing different consequences through the confrontation with the paranormal.\\n\r\nThe way the protagonist Ginko approaches the phenomenon 'Mushi' is open-minded, enquiring, yet discreet. \\n\r\nMaybe we can go as far as to assume that the paranormal allegorizes the beauty of nature which rarely receives attention in today's perception (in fact is invisible to most!).\\n\r\nBut the anime does not teach - it shows, implicitly. In a  meditative way. Hence, the impression it delivers is so very strong. The viewer does not reject the wisdom it provides.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode deeply touched me, not just through its profound story but as well by means of sound and animation. The music conveys the atmopshere modest, soothing, simply beautiful - and sometimes there is no sound at all. Minimalistic perfection.\\n\r\nThe animation is astonishing - detailed sceneries of nature in every thinkable facet, backgrounds imbued with life.\\n\\n\r\nIt was an unusual, enriching experience. Philosophical and artful - opposing commercialism and qualitative decline. Timeless.",

            "content": "A compelling, mysterious and thought-provoking anime on being's known as Mushi. This unique show proves that an anime doesn't need to have romance, action, comedy or something thrilling to be interesting to watch.\r\nMushishi is comprised of a bunch of episodic adventures where each episode follows its own mini story of, Ginko's encounters with the natural phenomenon known as Mushi. Each heartfelt episode manages to cleverly bring a great deal of drama involving different types of Mushi, with different problems, and there are episodes that stand out from the rest. It's pretty unique how this anime is set out like 26 different Japanese folktales, whichis a welcome change from the usual anime.\\n\\n\r\nHaving every episode telling a different story there's always something new to expect however this also means that there are new characters to every episode. With only Ginko being the only character to appear throughout the series it's pretty hard to get emotionally attached to any of them but at least they make the most out of the time they have.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi has some superb animation, which successfully makes the most out of the earth look and colors. So much detail is put into the environment; water and ambient lighting that even the slightly dull premise of the show can be easily overlooked. The music is a tranquil selection of guitar and age-old Japanese tunes that suit the calm nature of the show. Both the animation and music are the aspects that allow the viewer to be immersed into this deeply, compelling show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mushishi is a pretty amazing anime, with no beginning or end but just a collection of adventurous stories. It manages to bring something new to the saturated anime market, without any use of gimmicks. With all that said the only real reason why I didn't rate this any higher was due to the lack of everything; apart from adventure, mystery and storytelling. So this show really isn't suitable for people who require action, romance or anything thrilling in their shows, because Mushishi is really something that you can kick back and relax to.",

            "content": "Mushishi is, to tell the truth, nothing very special. It doesn't try to stand out, nor does it feed us with anime standards, like moe, or fanservice. it doesn't have flashy action - hardly any at all in fact - nor has it excessive amounts of blood. In fact this in itself is what makes it stand up. Its tranquility and taking things at a calm pace is what makes Mushishi so great, yet in a way it is also what makes it a bit offputting to some.\r\nSetting-wise, Mushishi is set in a world where being not human nor animal live. They are basic, pure;in touch with the very essence of life. They are called Mushi, as they are called, are often capable of performing supernatural phenomena, and naturally enough there are humans devoted to the study of Mushi. They are called Mushishi, and Mushishi follows one of these, uh, Mushishi. Eh.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi doesn't have a continuous story, rather, each episode features its own small story, where Ginko, our Mushishi, encounters a new Mushi and the problems it causes for some humans. The two-three episode characters are usually portrayed very meticulously to the viewer, giving us decent enough information and emotion to make them realistic, an impressive feat considering they have around twenty minutes to expose them to us. Usually Ginko tries to help with his knowledge (and to gain more), but at this point Ginko is really set apart from the standard hero, becoming more of an antihero-type of person. Whereas most heroes would never give up and go all superdetermined, Ginko knows when enough is enough, and if he can't do anything more, or if it's pointless, he tells everyone that it is, and leaves. In that, Ginko, too, fits in with the calm of Mushishi; he never lets his emotions rule over his sense of reason; he knows when to stop.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanying this lovely setting is what most will probably remember Mushishi for: Its art. The landscapes and sceneries protrayed often - Mushishi takes place in natural/village environemnts only - are breathtaking. Yet, they are not extremely vivid; they don't hit your senses with avid coloring and all that. No; they are more pale, plain. While still procuring those memorable sceneries, this also allows it to induce a more peaceful expeirence.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack must of course not be left out, because that, too, plays a major part in Mushishi's calmness. The soundtrack usually bases itself on a single melliflous intstrumental theme for each episode, which plays throughout the episode and at the end credits. the opening song is also lovely, and as serene as the rest of the soundtrack, and the show as a whole. The voice actors, too, do a great job of keeping with the peaceful feeling of Mushishi. They have very calm voices, and even when upset, screaming or crying, it's not in-your-face or loud; it's calm, yet very evocative.\\n\\n\r\nThough, all this tranquility, while important for the overall feel of Mushishi, can also be the most deterring aspect of it. Simply because it's a tad boring. You don't really watch Mushishi for its entertainment value, which in and of itself isn't very high. It can be rather boring. However, that doesn't change the fact that it is a show you should try out at least once. Or twice. What Mushishi is best at is calming you down, letting you relax with some interesting paranormal mysteries and enjoying gorgeous vistas.",

            "content": "Many struggle with wrapping their heads around specific folklore that is entirely different from the cultural roots of their own country. It can be an arduous task for the ill-prepared minds that nevertheless want to explore all facets of any country\u2019s folklore that captures the entirety of how it\u2019s culture evolved from its roots to the present. There haven\u2019t been many shows, or anime for that manner, that have handled folklore with the level of atmosphere and creativity that the show Mushishi has to offer and for this, we have to be thankful for its existence. A beautiful existence to be more specific.\r\nHow Mushishi developsitself from the ground up, in terms of its overall narrative, is by separating plot arcs into every single episode that have their own story that all feel unique and thought-provoking. The people, who Ginko comes across on these different episodes, are never seen again as he tries to make sense of how these \u201cMushi\u201d behave and how they adapt in the landscape of Mushishi\u2019s world by engrossing them into the people. What makes it extraordinarily admirable is the level of detail that encompasses the entirety of the show despite not having an over-arching \u201cstory\u201d from how almost every single character feels like actual people rather than one-dimensional caricatures that shows, like Mushishi, typically fall into when they try to do the same formula. I wouldn\u2019t go so far that it\u2019s every bit as perfect as one would hope, but it\u2019s more than enough for it to be garnered anything but warm praise for its in-depth characterization. Ginko himself proves to be a very competent lead in giving him the excellent detective mind that is akin to other great detective characters in other mystery works in the past by giving him a strong back-story to his past life and how he came into being a mushi-shi himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe absence of an overarching narrative in Mushishi, however, doesn\u2019t bold too well for it since it is bounded by a slight disconnect of a tightly structured world that it wants us to feel engrossed and connected but it ultimately doesn\u2019t come across as anything but average. While most of the episodes prove to be good in-of-themselves, watching them all together and trying to encapsulate the very nature of the particular world they want to portray feels empty and shallow. It intends to make an episodic show but at the same time it tries creates this living, breathing society on a macro-level that doesn\u2019t fit right on an episodic show. Its two properties of world-building that don\u2019t coincide perfectly and because of this, Mushishi comes across as far from perfect in this facet. The structure of Mushishi might\u2019ve taken it took into a slight nose-dive, but there\u2019s one exact detail to the show that makes up for it, the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nTo succeed in developing a relaxed tone, the atmosphere has to be just right for the viewer to be engrossed in it for which there\u2019s plenty to go around in Mushishi. One other crucial detail that every person always mentions about Mushishi that comes from the melancholic atmosphere is that there\u2019s not one person who finds the atmosphere nothing but beautiful. It\u2019s hard to make an atmosphere that is faulty but the one thing that would do it a disservice to any show of Mushishi\u2019s nature is how poor it creates a mood that is too blatantly lifeless or absolutely monotonous in how it integrates with the tone. To which I applaud Mushishi for bringing itself to its knees and flourishing. The lack of a lot of music helps in this aspect a lot to let us breathe in the atmosphere without any distraction for long periods while looking at the great artistry of the scene in question. I would\u2019ve appreciated even more if there was no music at all since the random musical instrumentation spread out at specific points of the episodes don\u2019t feel like they were needed at all.\\n\\n\r\nWith something as slow and methodical as shows like Mushishi typically come across, Mushishi manages to pace itself near-perfectly in taking its time to let us take in the scenes at face-value without hinging on quick interludes that would hamper on every scene. Despite its slow pacing, it never feels like a slog to go through. It\u2019s like listening to a great drone/ambient album that goes on for 2 hours, and once it\u2019s done, you\u2019ve felt as though only mere minutes have passed because of how entranced you were from experience. That is one thing to describe Mushishi: Entrancing. Once you\u2019ve set your sights and overall attention to the subtle details put into, not only the art but how hypnotic the writing of the dialogue is and the breathtaking Mushi sequences are, you can\u2019t take your eyes off of it for one minute.\\n\\n\r\nGreat care is given to the tone of Mushishi as it builds up the mood at certain points to feel very compelling and robust on a mental and emotional level into the stories. The Mushi sequences alone are all extremely breathtaking to experience because of their lucid creativity and imagination that was put into practice by the brilliant artistry of the show. They\u2019re the types of sequences that will forever be burrowed into your memory just by the sheer awe-inspiring imagination that was obviously inspired by Japanese folklore with the designs of the Mushis themselves and how the sequences themselves were directed brilliantly by how tense and uneasy they were portrayed whenever they appeared on-screen or any of the mushi incidents.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork itself borrows heavily from influences of old Japanese artistry you\u2019d see on an old Ukiyo-e print from early 17th Century Japan. It gives the atmosphere a bonus from the wonderfully detailed backgrounds and the creative animation of the sequences I mentioned beforehand. There\u2019s not much in the way of overall breathtaking animation because of its plodding nature, but it doesn\u2019t do a disservice since it fits very well to the tone. The character designs themselves look like actual human beings and have very minimal detail to the foreground of the palette on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is a show that cannot be done justice by just talking about it and that you have to experience it for yourself to see the qualities come full force. It certainly did for me. Despite my thoughts on it not being perfect in how I view on all of its positive aspects, that shouldn\u2019t be a clear sign to not go through a genuine calming experience that you\u2019ll hardly ever see in most anime. Watch it before you go to bed or anything that has to do with trying to make you reach into a state of tranquility. It should prove worthy of any acclaim to people who\u2019ve been interested in the pure Japanese mythology that this series has created for itself. If there were an anime show that could rank along with \u201cThe Great Wave off Kanagawa\u201d as one of the most significant contributions to Japanese art that showcases its aesthetic insight to its own culture, Mushishi would be that anime, bar none.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n",

            "content": "I heard about this anime a while ago, but the synopsis didn't seem that appealing to me.  So I basically forgot about it until recently and decided to watch a few episodes to see why it was so well regarded...\r\nIt's beautiful.  It's like meditating.\r\nStory:  It's an episodic show that feels like a collection of fables or myths to me... almost as though these stories were from a world before science when people made up spirits or gods to explain life's mysteries.  That's not really the premise of the show, but that's how it felt to me.\r\nIt's laid-back and meditative.  ButI was riveted ...maybe because it is such a quiet sort of show, I'm not sure.  Absolutely riveted.  I didn't want to blink.  I wanted to see everything and soak it all in.  I think it's astonishing that something that lacking in tension is still that incredibly compelling.  It's kind of like when you see the Grand Canyon or sequoias for the first time, I guess. ;)\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The world is beautiful.  The people are all the same, except Ginko. ;)  They only bothered to draw, like, 4 different faces (or it just felt that way)... so just keep in mind that even though that woman in one episode looks just like the woman from that other episode... it's most likely not the same person -- just let it go. ;)  \\n\\n\r\nI thought the gorgeousness of the scenery more than made up for the lack of distinction in the humans.  And I also thought that there was a subtle message about the universality of experience and the concept of the &quot;every man/woman&quot; in the uniformity of the way the people looked (which is also, I think, related to the lack of time in the show -- it doesn't matter if this is a century ago or today, and the story doesn't tell you).  And the landscapes are amazing.  I thought they did an incredible job of giving the environment the right feel and mood for the episodes.  There's so much personality in the environment that you could make an argument about how the landscape and the mushishi are the characters and the people are the background.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  I thought the voice actors did a great job of expressing a wide range of emotions without going to extremes.  There's a mellowness and evenness to the show that's recreated even in the tone and pitch of their voices, which I really liked.  (I really love it when everything comes together like that.)  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  Like I mentioned before, you end up feeling as though the main character the world/nature and the people are just what trees and buildings are normally in other stories, which brings art and character closer than I've ever seen before.  Ginko is practically the only character you see in more than one episode and serves as a main character/guide/wise man/shaman during your exploration of this new world.  The experience of the show is the experience of his relationship with the world around him.  He is poised, calm and interested without being over-eager or overbearing.  There is such a strong sense of serenity and acceptance in Ginko and his attitude towards the world around him.  He makes you think of a time long lost where man co-existed with nature instead of destroying it.  And because of that he&rsquo;s soothing and comforting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  There is this wonderful, reverent serenity that permeates everything about the series: the lingering look at the landscapes; the semi-monotonous speech of the characters; the slow, deliberate pacing of each show; and, most especially, Ginko's quiet, unflappable calm.  All those elements help create this atmosphere of profound stillness and ease. I feel like I walked away from each episode somehow refreshed and rejuvenated. And I loved how everything in the series was fell in line with the theme.  It's not uncommon for the story and the characters to carry a show, but here the sound and the art are just as essential to conveying ideas and emotions to the viewer.  Like I mentioned before, I love it when everything points in the same direction and there's nothing superfluous tacked on to interfere with or dilute the message.  Brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't for people with a short attention span, probably.  I'm sure there's a big chunk of the population will find it boring as watching grass grow and that's fine; it isn't for everyone.  But if you'd like to take a deep breath once in a while... this is definitely worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\n(Edited/Re-formatted:  April 9, 2008)",

            "content": "\u201cMushishi is a beautiful tragedy\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cTragic, in the sense that it was tedious to watch; beautiful, because it\u2019s finally over\u201d \u2014 Krunchyman\r\nConceiving an interesting, well though-out anime is not as problematic as one might assume, because, as Hayao Miyazaki has demonstrated, quality is not subservient to complexity; in fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite.  Simplicity, done correctly, is exceptionally sublime.  There is nothing more pleasing than watching a \u201cbasic\u201d show that executes its own themes splendidly, with a cast of characters that exude authenticity.  A simple anime has the potential of conveying a wealth of information that can impact the viewer in a myriadof ways, including: cognitively, psychologically, and viscerally.  It can hit all the pertinent emotional chords, permitting a cathartic outflow of emotion, stimulating deep inward reflection for future reminiscing, and altering one\u2019s perspective on their own existence.\\n\\n\r\nYes.  Greatness can be attained quite easily, through the power of embracing the \u201csimplistic\u201d approach; yet, most directors are unwilling to adopt a \u201csimple\u201d style, in fear that it may be misconstrued as being rudimentary, or absent of \u201centertainment\u201d value.  What is lost on those director\u2019s, however, is the idea of allowing the work to speak for itself, rather than bombarding the viewer with their own ideological message(s).  Mushishi, an anime experience unlike any other, prides itself on omitting a central philosophical thrust, instead opting for natural ambience and a peaceful, \u201csimple\u201d atmosphere.  It abstains from traversing the \u201ccommon\u201d ground that others have laid before it, electing to carve its own path through the deep, unexplored areas of the human consciousness.\\n\\n\r\nDoes this exploration impart any functional knowledge to the viewer, or simulate an experience that may resemble our everyday reality?  No, not really.  The immersive atmosphere is as cryptic as it is profligate waste.  Look no further then episode seven, \u201cRaindrops and Rainbows,\u201d to discover why the grand artwork is a constant reminder of unfulfilled potential.  Koro, a man obsessed with chasing the elusive Kouda rainbow that enthralled his father, embarked on a five year unpaid sabbatical to capture the mystical essence that represents his unrealized dream.  Upon achieving his goal \u2014 capturing the rainbow, that is \u2014 Koro comes to the realization that the \u201crainbow\u201d (i.e. his dream) had consumed him to the point of becoming disassociated with reality, obscuring his gaze from what he should be focused on (i.e. building the bridge).  Yet this epiphany occurred with diminutive resistance, forcing the viewer to wonder why Koro did not exhibit profound anguish, by having his dream extinguished.  But given the episodic framework, the viewer is dragged into the next \u201cstory\u201d without proper closure.\\n\\n\r\nBut as mentioned earlier, Mushishi was not designed to emulate the conventional framework of its predecessors, as it aspired to be a meditative experience through its employment of natural sounds, vivacious color schemes, and the use of the \u2014 seemingly \u2014 innocuous Mushi (creatures that are neither good nor bad, but simply exist for the sake of their own subsistence).  And while the Mushi alter the trajectory of the people it comes into contact with in vastly different ways, it becomes clear that a formulaic routine becomes the standard for the bulk of the entire series.  The routine being, as follows:\\n\\n\r\n1)  \u201cHmmm\u2026.This looks like a nice village, think I\u2019ll take a look.\u201d \u2014 Ginko\\n\r\n2)  Ginko discovers that a random citizen, or an entire village is plagued by a Mushi-related epidemic.\\n\r\n3)  \u201cI\u2019m a Mushi Master (Mushishi), and I have a method to resolve this issue, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s going to work.  That being said, let\u2019s give it a try anyway.\u201d \u2014 Ginko\\n\r\n4)  Beautiful artwork is used to awe and mesmerize the viewer, while, at the same time, divert the attention away from the glaring defects in the story.\\n\r\n5)  By the end of the episode, the Mushi-related issue has resolved itself in a life altering manner, sometimes for the worse, sometimes for the better.\\n\\n\r\nA handful of episodes, however, depart from this convention, one of which being Episode 12, \u201cOne-eyed Fish.\u201d  Regarded by numerous fans as the quintessential moment in the series, \u201cOne-eyed Fish\u201d delves into the cryptic past of Ginko\u2019s upbringing (as we discover from this episode, his real name is Yoki).  Acknowledging the diametrically opposed \u201cmother\u2019s\u201d in Ginko\u2019s life is crucial to comprehending the value of an adequate preceptor.  Ginko\u2019s biological mother \u2014 an example of a \u201cgood intentioned, bad outcome\u201d leader \u2014 commands her son to disregard the eerie Mushi, due to them being \u201cillusions.\u201d  Her subterfuge \u201cprotects\u201d Yoki\u2019s innocence, in exchange for his capacity to embrace the world for how it really exist, placing him at a disadvantage in his forward momentum as an enlightened person.  Nui, on the other hand, lives a rugged life because of her unfortunate circumstances; therefore, her callous nature emanates directly toward Ginko in the most unexpected manner.  It\u2019s tough \u201clove,\u201d but it hardens Ginko\u2019s resolve and instills a healthy dose of curiosity in his future endeavors.  Be that as it may, it\u2019s still flawed \u201clove,\u201d as Nui\u2019s advice is just as hollow as her missing eye.  A veritable buffet of trite psychobabble and misplaced grandeur if there ever was one.  The concluding scene where Nui\u2019s body vanished to the \u201cspirit\u201d world was visually brilliant, but failed to offer a tangible message to the viewer.  \\n\\n\r\nGinko, after the incident, surmises that \u201cthe hole of my left, even in the sunlight, was black as if it was seeped in darkness.  And it attracted weird things [Mushi].  If it continues to do that, misfortune is sure to follow.  That\u2019s the feeling I get.\u201d  The words \u201cmisfortune\u201d and \u201cfeeling\u201d are particularly important to understand why this final thought by Ginko is antithetical to the views expressed earlier on.  Remember, the Mushi is purported to be neither good nor bad, but \u201cmisfortune\u201d signifies \u201cbad luck;\u201d therefore, making his earlier quote, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.  Nor is it the Mushi.  You were both just trying to live,\u201d seem contradictory.  The word \u201cfeeling\u201d pertains to the fashion in which Ginko solves the majority of the Mushi-related problems, as it seems like he \u2014 conveniently \u2014 pulls solutions out of his \u201cback pocket\u201d just in the nick of time (with his gut instinct).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters \u2014 or should I say, the character (as Ginko is the only constant in this episodic adventure) \u2014 is never fleshed out thoroughly, and given the structure of the divorced narrative, the world-building is inextricably self-limited.  In addition, Ginko\u2019s aloof personality creates a distance between himself and the viewer, hampering the prospect of allowing the audience to empathize with the show\u2019s central protagonist.  The overall static nature of Ginko\u2019s character, dampened the prospect of having him evolve throughout the series.  Giving no further insights into his \u201ctrue self,\u201d besides the superficial qualities that he presented within the very first episode.  There\u2019s a reason why the viewer can watch Mushishi in any order they prefer (not the typical chronological order), because Ginko\u2019s development is non-existent.\\n\\n\r\nOne could argue that the aimless, repetitious plot harkens to the purposeless reality of our existence, and how we must coexist with nature and the \u201cspiritual\u201d beings around us to maintain a \u201cpeaceful\u201d balance.  If we accept this reasoning, we must acknowledge that much of the series is superfluous repetition, serving to admonish the viewer for their own inattentiveness to the world around them.  This concentrated effort pigeonholed the writers into a proverbial corner \u2014 perhaps by choice, to obviate their narrative and character development responsibilities. \\n\\n\r\nTo Mushishi\u2019s credit, there are tiny nuggets of truth cleverly sprinkled in for the viewer to unearth for their own edification; however, this stealthy nuance resembles the \u201cdivine\u201d words of a fortune cookie.  A comparison that feels apropos, considering the overall futility of the fortune cookie itself.  While considered a delightful treat at the end of a meal, its nutritional value is next to nothing (same goes for Mushishi\u2019s value), but its delectable sweetness and marvelous aesthetic bewilder the masses into thinking the treat is the highlight of the meal.  In spite of this mass delusion, it should be recognized that desserts (like Mushishi) are not only inessential, but detract from the \u201cmeat and potatoes\u201d (quality anime) that offer meaningful insights on the human condition.  Indulge in the \u201csweet treat\u201d that is Mushishi if you will, but understand that it will rot the brain with its dearth components; ultimately, leaving the viewer unsatisfied when they attain the requisite knowledge to strip away the intellectual facade that Mushishi employed to feign sophistication.",

            "content": "It\u2019s very nice that Mushishi had showed a great way of enjoying such scenery, environment, and culture of each passing scene as you might find yourself exploring its wonders and deeper meaning of it, which the series proves when you\u2019re into this world. Starting with its bunch of supernatural and mystery that engulfs the whole series, it never crossed to my mind that it is dull, boring, typical, and all used up theme just like the others, thus, it has shown such different mixture of drama, tension, and unusual phenomenon that will surely be a factor why this show is worthy to be watched\r\nNow thatyou\u2019re getting into the world of this show, expect some unusual sights that are being focused and centered all throughout the series. This is where there are such unexpected scenes to be seen and felt which will give a marvelous reaction to the viewers. In its beginning, it is quite enticing to find out what is hidden behind all of this creatures and how this creatures affects the movement of the show.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the protagonist, a wanderer who seems fond with these kinds of things will bring the show to the extent that his purpose is not only seeing the creature itself but also to find out what drags their existence in the human world. This is where the mystery and solving out problems pops out that became truly entertaining, as they come up a variety of ideas in every episode, which they\u2019re trying to show its different presence of drama, tension, and the unusual parts that keeps you wondering about. \\n\\n\r\nMushishi isn\u2019t only just a story based series that tackles about the unknown spectacles but it is also great in terms of describing a refreshing outlook for its viewers to enjoy. Honestly, all I can say to the series is that it\u2019s great, complete, and bizarre in showing such wonderful art & designs that makes me be amazed into it. Using such sketchy, brilliant, and light colors really affects the view into the show, as it sometimes gives a deeper meaning and interpretation for the viewers to look on, which I myself am also amazed on how these things turns out. Overall, these kinds of designs and themes that putted into the show truly match to the story, environment, and its surroundings as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the designs, the sounds will never been left behind as this element also gave a plus factor to the show. It\u2019s just like the classical sounds where old instruments are being played. OP and ED theme is played with such soothing sounds, while the BG effects have the same view just like the OP and ED as both of them gives a strange feeling into the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to impress into these 26 episode series is that why the protagonist isn\u2019t boring to watch. Mainly because the reason behind it is just merely simple, while appearing with all these 26 episodes the characteristic of this man is just unexpectedly many where he can be serious at some times while making such a fuss one after another. Even though this protagonist faces many trials, he is ready to face it without any doubts, which he became a guy with an attitude not to be easily forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nGinko, the name of the protagonist, is seems simple enough just like an ordinary wanderer but with his kind of different expertise he instantly became different from the others. What I like to this guy is that he thinks sharp, reasonable, and quick at some times but when pressure comes from his back, he sometimes became reckless. Sometimes there are twisted thoughts comes from my mind just because of his acts and thought about the flow of the show, so in every episode I\u2019ve thought that this character wouldn\u2019t be that great without his genius and well reasoning.\\n\\n\r\nWhy watch Mushishi? Because when you\u2019re really fond of sightseeing and exploring such unknown phenomenon or maybe such other things, this is truly one of a kind show that have shown all its aspects in their matched and beautiful outlook. Overall, trying to find a different genre which shows a pleasant and peaceful pacing? Why not try this and be amazed to it.",

The story is about the expedition of a Mushishi named Ginko, whose expertise is on paranormal phenomena. On his journey he encounters various phenomena that have something to do about his expertise, making it as a part of his living, or a threat with uncertified safety. \r\nThe main attraction would be supernatural and mystery of the story. It consists of long, serious and mind-boggling monologues that will never come up to boredom though it will surely hook to your senses.The way it attracts is through curiosity, curiosity that pushes you to find out what is the mystery behind it. It may be repetitive in such a way though the series make a difference to attract viewers as they fill tension to its drama and putting like a detective case through its mystery. \\n\\n\r\nThe other uniqueness in this series is that there is no main plot though it only consists of short tales that will keep you accompany on not being bored.

And even though he\u2019s quite a hardheaded, when it comes to his expertise he\u2019s willing to help as soon as there\u2019s a limitation on it.

            "content": "Overview:\r\nMushi-Shi is a a very unique series about microscopic mystical creatures called the \"Mushi\" and a man named Ginko that goes around studying them and helping people with Mushi related problems. Mushi-Shi tries very hard to be an artistic and sophisticated series and many hail it as a masterpiece. Whether or not it meets that criteria in your book of course depends on your answer to that eternal question of aesthetics, \"What is Art?\".\r\nPlot: 7/10\r\nThe Mushi are said to be much simpler than bacteria or even viruses, but have intelligence and are sometimes able to take human form. In the first episode, a woman isasked to become a mushi herself at the behest of several mushi. The mushi often grant people magical powers, but more often than not act as a serious detriment and are technically parasites. Ginko is quick to explain though that the mushi aren't actually evil or malevolent. They are simply trying to survive. The Mushi exist between the worlds of the living and the dead and have magical properties. On the surface, the Mushi share many traits with the mediclorians from the Star Wars prequels. Interestingly enough, the Mushi-Shi manga was first published in 1999 only a few months after the release of The Phantom Menace, where mediclorians are first discussed. The story structure is purely episodic with Ginko treating Mushi problems. At times, it almost takes on the atmosphere of a medical drama , like a very metaphysical  House episode directed by David Lynch. Sometimes Mushi-Shi lightly touches on societal issues like family structure, loyalty, and child abandonment. However, Mushi-Shi prefers to raise questions rather than answer them. My first impression of Mushi-Shi was that the mediclorians from Star Wars had somehow invaded an Anton Chekhov short story. This actually isn't that far off in terms of its writing style, by which I mean a completely neutral author voice combined with an almost non-existent plot that basically just flows freely to create a \"daily life\" feel with everyday characters...only with magic bacteria! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDue to the episodic nature of the show, the only character with development is Ginko. Ginko is by the way one of the oldest plant species in existence, and the character studies what are supposedly the oldest organisms. Now that the pun has been explained, lets talk about our man. Ginko is calm, calculating, and never seems frightened or shocked by anything that happens. He is an ideal doctor and someone that can work under any kind of pressure. Ginko is very laid back and displays no signs of anger, excitement, hatred, or joy. He is just very mellow all the time. He chain smokes in every episode and I don't think its tobacco. Of course, If I was the equivalent of an ER surgeon/ exorcist, I would probably go through life high as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is Mushi-Shi is absolutely gorgeous and is probably the highlight of the entire series. Every scene is this anime is beautiful. Sometimes it is haunting and even mildly disturbing, but most often it is serene beauty that we view in Mushi-Shi\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits the mood of the series quite well and has an opening that is quite catchy (although very hipster indy pop). This is a very hipster series though, so honestly did you expect anything else?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMushi-Shi can at times be gorgeous, thought provoking, and appear like an artistic masterpiece. At other times it can be insufferably slow and feel so pretentious I want to kick the computer screen. Mushi-Shi is not for everyone, but it is a well done series and I think most people will at least get something out of it. I will give Mushi-Shi praise for having no instances of \"moe\" bullshit, fanservice, hyper violence, giant robots, or other anime cliche's. However, does that alone make it a masterpiece? Not really. That isn't to say many people won't love Mushi-Shi. I thought it was good, but it wasn't really my cup of tea. I actually like it when a story has concrete conflict and an observable purpose. I like it when the author puts forward their own opinions, so I can compare and contrast them with my own. Mushi-Shi has a very neutral author voice and is very light on plot and action. This is one reason I compared the mangaka's writing style to that of Anton Chekhov. I am much more of a Dostoevsky and Tolstoy fan personally. I also tend to prefer the films of directors like Hitchcock and Fritz Lang to those like Lynch. This is simply my opinion. If you absolutely adored Eraserhead and Uncle Vanya is your homeboy, I would check out Mushi-Shi.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nI actually didn't love this series the first time I watched it, but it has grown on me a bit. I may not be quite as huge a Mushi fan as so many other critics on  MAL, but it is a series worthy of respect! The art is amazing, the soundtrack is well done, and it tries to go in a radically new direction for modern anime. The main character was interesting, and moments of the show were truly quite spectacular! If you like surreal imagery and can tolerate a slow pace, check this one out.",

            "content": "Mushishi is a unique show in many ways. It\u2019s rather weird and bizarre but is also very intriguing and definitely grabs your interest. This show was much different from what I expected it to be (in a good way) and for many episodes I had my eyes glued to the screen, watching intensely. Mushishi has a calm, mellow, and soothing, but also very deep and powerful feel to it.\r\n---STORY---\r\nI think the story is one of the strongest points in this anime. What makes Mushishi different from most anime is that it does not focus on a single overarching story and instead each episode has itsown short story with a new plot and characters (aside from Ginko who is in every episode) And this actually works quite well as each story is beautifully well told with many powerful moments that sometimes leave you speechless. You may find a couple of episodes to be a little boring but the vast majority of them are very well written stories that pace themselves very nicely. If I were to describe the plot of the show as a whole, I would say it\u2019s about Ginko traveling from place to place in feudal Japan dealing with different cases that deal with mushi. Which brings us to the next great point of this show. The Mushi.\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I begin with the mushi? They are one of the most unique concepts I\u2019ve come across. I\u2019ve seen many things similar to demons and spirits in shows before but nothing quite like the mushi. Just trying to explain what they are can be a bit of a challenge. If you want the most accurate description of what they are then read the synopsis of this show. The mushi and the effects they have on people and the world are the main focus of each episode and there are many different types of mushi that take on different forms and act in different ways. There are some that reside in your pillow and make your dreams reality and there are those that slip into your brain through your ear and feast off of your memories until you can no longer remember anything. Some mushi are harmless and others are dangerous. And though many of the mushi featured in the show do harm, I absolutely love the way they are portrayed. Regardless of what they may do, there are no good or evil mushi. They\u2019re just creatures trying to survive.\\n\\n\r\nNormally when watching shows or movies we see the characters go through many struggles throughout the story. But no matter how bad or hopeless it gets, we know that things will almost always end well. And that's a good thing of course. I mean everybody likes to see the protagonist come out on top. However in Mushishi this is not always the case. And because the show is episodic, they can get away with this. Some episodes end well and some don\u2019t. Many of the mushi act similar to diseases. And like diseases, sometimes there\u2019s simply nothing you can do. You can treat it but you can\u2019t cure it. This is great because it keeps the show unpredictable and helps give it a good sense of realism as well as provide us with some deep and rather sad endings. And every episode I found myself always wondering \u201cI wonder how this is going to end up. Will it end well for the characters or not?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe only real negative thing I think I can say about the story is that it does get a little repetitive. While the individual stories themselves are very different, each episode follows the same general formula.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a problem.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s mushi related.\\n\r\nGinko shows up.\\n\r\nThe problem is explained.\\n\r\nGinko attempts to solve the problem.\\n\\n\r\nRepetitiveness aside, the story is still spectacular and each episode is great and worth watching.\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTERS---\\n\r\nGinko is the main protagonist of this series and is a mushi-shi (A person who studies mushi) He\u2019s a calm, relaxed individual who is constantly travelling not just to solve cases involving mushi but also because he himself attracts mushi, thus he cannot stay in one place for too long or he will attract dangerous mushi to the area. His character is rather simple but I still found him very easy to like and he gets an interesting backstory about halfway thorough the show.\\n\\n\r\nGinko is the only character that remains throughout the show. And aside from him, each episode deals with different characters. Despite this, the characters of each episode are quite good and easy to connect with and feel for, despite the short amount of time they each get in the show.\\n\\n\r\n---SOUND & ART---\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, it\u2019s fantastic! The intro is amazing and does a great job of setting the mood. It\u2019s also nice to hear an English intro every now and then. Especially one sang by a native English speaker. The outro changes every episode and all 26 of them are beautiful instrumentals and I sat through the credits every time just to listen to them. The art style is also great and really shows in the way they animate the mushi and the background. The only downside is that the characters themselves don't look very detailed and most of the side characters look very much alike and you might find yourself thinking \"Wait a minute. Isn't that the guy from the last episode?\"\\n\\n\r\nDub or Sub?\\n\r\nThe dub for Mushishi is fairly descent. Ginko is played by Travis Willingham, who some of you may recognize as the voice of Roy Mustang. I had my doubts at first but now I can say that he was an excellent choice for Ginko. As for all the side characters, they\u2019re mostly hit or miss. Some of them sound bad while others sound quite good. The good news is that for the bad voices you\u2019ll only have to put up with them for one episode. The Mushishi dub is good but I would never recommend it over the sub. The voice acting in the original was truly spectacular and maybe its just me but when I watch an anime that takes place in feudal Japan, back when Japanese was pretty much the only language spoken, I feel that watching the Japanese version really helps give it that feeling of authenticity. So I will highly recommend the sub for this show. But this is just my opinion so watch whichever version you like :)\\n\\n\r\n---VERDICT---\\n\r\nMushishi is not for everyone. If you\u2019re looking for an anime dripping with action then you\u2019ll probably find this show very boring. Nonetheless, this show is still fantastic and I was very impressed with this anime. And if this show sounds even remotely interesting to you then I definitely suggest you put this show in your watching or at least in your plan to watch under high priority.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n",

            "content": "Mushishi is the most simplistic yet beautiful series that I had the pleasure to experience until now and is one of the examples that shows the incredible variety that anime has.  \r\nWell then, ladies and gentlemen I welcome you to my Mushishi review. I hope you enjoy it.\r\nNow, the story of Mushishi follows our protagonist, Ginko, as he travels around the world working as a Mushi-shi. So, instead of having an over-arching story, this show chooses to have a more episodic nature. This way of telling the story has its own pluses and minuses. For one hand, as every episode has a different storythe show never drags on, you can watch the show in any given order and you don\u00b4t need to pay attention to every little detail fearing that it might be really important to the overall plot, but in the other hand, it has some consequences in the characters, but I will cover that matter later on the review.\\n\r\nSo, as I said, every episode has its own story, usually involving Ginko trying to deal with a Mushi, the beings that the mushi-shis study, which in each episode create some kind of conflict. As such every episode has an interesting story, every one of them being fascinating from the beginning\\n\r\nto the end, and is very interesting to watch what the mushi from each episode can do. The only problem with the story is that if you are looking for something \"exciting\" or \"cheerful\" then you\u00b4ll have to watch something else, as the nature of this show is, most of the time, rather depressing and it doesn\u00b4t really have \"cheerful moments\". But if you can look past that, sit back, relax and go with the flow of the series, you will most likely be pleased with the story of every episode, because none of them is by any means predictable, so you never know if by the end of the episode you will have a happy ending or a sad one, which keeps you interested in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this show can be described in one word: beautiful. \\n\r\nThe animation for this show is, not only fluid and consistent, it is a pleasure for the eyes, the colours used in this series, especially when a Mushi is on the scene, makes it one of the most astonishing animation out there, and when you think that this anime is from 2005, I can only applaud Yuuki Nobuteru for his superb work in this series. The backgrounds in this series are also very well done having precious landscapes to look. The weak part of this animation, however, is in the character design, because, there are a lot of characters in this series that look alike, specially kids, and while it is understandable that given the episodic nature of the show, they have to introduce new characters every episode and some character designs will end up repeating themselves, it is still a little annoying to watch a character that looks almost exactly like that character from the past episode, however this is only a minor problem. The other problem is that when a character is at a certain distance his face disappears, which can be strange to look at. But, overall, solid and beautiful animation and great backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nThis show\u00b4s music composer is Toshio Masuda, and he did an excellent job composing the soundtrack for the series, the soundtrack matches the nature of the series completely, is soothing, calm, relaxing and I love it. And speaking about relaxing the opening for this series, \"The Sore Feet Song\" by Ally Kerr fits the show as much as the soundtrack, is nothing really special, and is not something \"unskippable\" but it\u00b4s nice to listen to it in some episodes. The endings for this series are actually part of the soundtrack so they are really nothing very special. The voice acting is pretty solid and, while I have no complains about it, it\u00b4s nothing from another world and the only voice that really stands out is Ginko\u00b4s.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series, as I said before, suffer from its episodic nature, because the characters in this series usually appear in one episode and they are gone the next one, the only exception being Adashino-sensei, a doctor and collector of paranormal items, who appears in three different episodes. But because the characters appear for one episode you really never get to like them much because of the lack of screen time. In the end, the only character that you end up getting attached to is Ginko, as he is the only character that appears in every chapter of this series, being him the protagonist and everything, not that I\u00b4m complaining Ginko is a great character and while he is usually laid back he is a complete professional in his work. But besides him while some of the characters in this series are pretty good you just don\u00b4t have enough time to start liking them.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this is a show that I enjoyed because it was very relaxing and the stories in every episode were unpredictable and interesting, but it\u00b4s something that you need to watch expecting that it won\u00b4t be \"cheerful\" or \"exciting\", but rather depressing even if an episode has a happy ending. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Mushishi is the perfect show to watch with a cup of the hot beverage that you prefer and relax and you will probably not get disappointed with the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now I bid you farewell and I hope that this review has been helpful and that you have enjoyed reading this review as much as I enjoyed writing it.\\n\r\nWait, is that what what I think it is? A second season? Mushishi Zoku Shou? Well, better late than never I guess, time to watch it. Adi\u00f3s, to you all.",

            "content": "Story - The anime has a rather simple story that is Ginko a mushi-shi travels to various parts helping people who have problems with creatures called mushi which are somewhat of a combination of plant/nature/animal. Each episode is a different story about Ginko helping people and there is no real ongoing plot. The main problem I had with the story is that they get very repetitive and about half way through the anime I had to take a break because I felt I was just rewatching the same episodes over again. A large portion of the episodes are about a woman and a man andone of them has disease or problem and tries to tie in a love into the problem which gets tiring after a while. This being said I did think the last five to six episodes were good. If you can stand repetitive plot lines then this should not bother you much.\\n\\n\r\nArt &ndash; There are two parts to the art here. First is the nature and drawings of the mushi. This was well done and fit into the series and was one of the better parts as well. The major flaw in the art style is that the minor characters look all very similar I honestly could not tell much difference between them. I though that they just got lazy, and only changed the hair style of the characters to make distinctions between the minor characters. All in all the art style was alright.\\n\\n\r\nSound &ndash; There was nothing really outstanding about the sound that comes to mind. There were no real problems with the sound either. Over all the sound was pretty good and there is not much to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter &ndash; As I have said before I found it hard to distinguish the characters from each other. As for the character of the anime I did enjoy the fact that it was willing to take a different view for anime. The problem was that they could not make it different enough for me to get too into the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment &ndash; If you could not figure it out yet I did not enjoy this anime. One of the main reasons for this was the fact that all the comments had said it was great or amazing and I was sadly disappointed. Another main reason was that I felt the lack of the anime making you want to see the next episode. Mushi-shi did not present much as to one wandering what will be next as most of the episodes ended similarly. I will say that if you are looking for something different and have not seen any anime about the relationship between people and nature that you would enjoy this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall &ndash; Overall I have seen better anime but I have also seen worse anime. I gave Mushi-shi a six only because of the lack of enjoyment and I felt I was suffering through watching it. I did how ever enjoy several of the last episodes as it attempted to recapture my interest. My last words if you are looking for something different in anime this might be worth checking out. \\n",

            "content": "Mushishi is an episodic anime that has only one main character, Ginko.  Ginko's purpose is to travel from town to town, researching a phenomenon called \"mushi\" and their effects on humanity.  He also helps the different villages deal with any mushi \"problems\" they may encounter.\r\nStory:\r\nThis is the SINGLE MOST beautiful and original story I have ever seen, both inside and outside the anime community.  The concept of \"mushi\"~ an entity that is neither human, plant, or animal, that affects the daily lives of humans is intelligent and thought-provoking.  How Ginko deals with these phenomenon, whether he is just researching or \"treating\"them is even more compelling.  Mushishi's stories have great life lessons hidden within them, and they are brought to life beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nBeautiful.  Gorgeous.  Breath-taking.  What else is there to say?  The scenery art for this series is some of the best I have ever seen.  My only complaints about the artwork in this series, is the character art (other than Ginko's).  The different characters who appear episode after episode seem to be drawn identically, but just with new clothes and a name tacked on to differentiate them from the last episode.  However, this is easily over-looked because of the characters themselves (which will be discussed later.)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWell, I'm afraid my review will fall short here.  I'm afraid sound is not usually something I really pay attention to, typically.  I will say, however, that the OP song is one of my favorites (if not my favorite) among all anime I have seen.  Yes, it may be my age saying this, but it is reminiscent of the old 70's folk music that I love so much.  It really is a beautiful song.  I'm giving the sound a 10, though, based on this song, and the music I did notice through the series, which was quite appropriate for the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAaaaaahhhh...  the BEST part of the series.  Ginko... Ginko... well, he's just awesome.  Sometimes he may come across as one of your old \"monotone\" teachers/professors, but you get the feeling that he truly LOVES what he does, and the interest he has in researching the mushi is undeniable.  The way he sees mushi as neither \"evil or good\" ... they \"just exist, like we do\" is a testament to his character.  Another great thing about this series is the episodic characters.  Other than Ginko (and a doctor that shows up in 3 episodes), all characters are only present for 1 episode.  But as someone states in the forums, you come to care MORE about some of these 1 episode characters than you do for some recurring characters in other 26+ epi series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell, if it isn't obvious by now, I enjoyed/am enjoying this series immensely.  I was not sure if I could enjoy an episodic anime with new characters introduced each episode, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This series has become quite endearing to me, and has taken it's spot as my #1 favorite series of all time.  All of the different aspects of this series, good as they are, individually, combine to make one hell of an awesome and original series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe verdict... (as if it wasn't obvious)...  10/10.  This is definitely a series worth watching, and definitely one of THE MOST UNDERRATED anime series out there.  Please enjoy it, soon... and let's all spread the Mushishi <3.  :3",

            "content": "&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let yourself be blinded by fear or anger. \r\nEverything is only as it is.&rdquo;\r\nStory\r\nMushishi is essentially a series of stories styled after East Asian legends and folktales. In lieu of gods, spirits, and demons, the paranormal phenomena are attributed to more primitive yet no less enigmatic creatures called &ldquo;mushi&rdquo;. Dealing with their kind is the expertise of &ldquo;mushishi&rdquo;; professionals whose role may be thought of as an amalgam of healer, exorcist, biologist, X-Files investigator, and Jedi master (well, sort of). Ginko happens to be one of these mushishi and he wanders from town to town, looking for interesting cases and lending a helping handto those adversely affected by these mushi.\\n\\n\r\nAs formulaic as its premise may sound, no two incidents are alike and every episode features not only different mushi but a different setting and cast as well (with Ginko as constant exception). Because of these, the series is able to experiment with various concepts and human relationships and none of the stories ever end in a predictable manner. As such, there is little room for stagnation as each tale manages to be unique and refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nThe title is often mentioned in the same breath as Kino no Tabi though Mushishi&rsquo;s oriental setting and animistic influences give it a more distinct flavor and theme. Whereas Kino limits herself to exploring &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenarios by visiting different countries, Ginko takes it a step further by providing possible solutions and emphasizing the importance of living in harmony with nature, with fellow men, and most importantly, with the self.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWhile not exactly an anti-hero, Ginko&rsquo;s personality is an unusual mix of benevolence tempered with common sense; a combination of &ldquo;grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed, courage to change the things that should be changed, and the wisdom to distinguish one from the other.&rdquo; Saving lives is part of his job but he also knows when there&rsquo;s reason still to hope and when it&rsquo;s time to move on. He may break his own code at times for the well-being of the majority and he&rsquo;s not above fooling the gullible either just to get by. His expertise stems not only from his knowledge about mushi but also from his understanding of human nature. \\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, none of these supporting characters are shoved into stereotypes which plague most anime and manga. No catgirls, lecherous geezers, or single-minded youngsters (Believe it!); just regular folks in unusual circumstances due to encounters with mushi. Consequently, it doesn&rsquo;t require much effort to empathize with these characters even if most only appear in their respective episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNot only is the theme &ldquo;everything is only as it is&rdquo; evident in the content but it also permeates the manner in which the stories are presented. Mushishi doesn&rsquo;t try to impress; it simply delivers. While other shows of this era tend go overboard with the fancy CG animation, Mushishi&rsquo;s visuals remain spare yet aesthetically pleasing. Rather than filling up the screen with explosions and fanservice shots at every possible moment, vivid scenes of natural beauty such as raindrops falling from the heavens, cherry blossoms drifting in the wind, and sunlight penetrating the dense foliage are shown instead. Of course, the viewers are occasionally treated to fantastic scenes showing the surreal characteristics of the mushi but these are shown only when called for in the stories and nothing is done in excess. Even the character designs are relatively plain but perhaps these also contribute to the story in their own way since the audience is less likely to judge the characters based on their appearances.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nLikewise, the audio takes the minimalist approach. The soundtrack is comprised of simply melodies which are surprisingly effective in evoking various thoughts and emotions. Ranging from haunting and heart-rending to hopeful and bittersweet, the music often eliminates the need for more words in the most crucial scenes. Also worth noting is the lack of exaggerated voice acting which makes the cast sound more like real people rather than cookie-cutter characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn addition to its enchanting audio and visuals, Mushishi also serves drama and thought-provoking content in balanced amounts. Its subtle content and execution never insult the intelligence and present several interesting ideas without drowning the viewers in philosophical jargon or sophistry. All in all, Mushishi truly is one of the finest anime specimen out there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis review is the final result of a review team composed of members from the &quot;Critics and Connoisseurs&quot; club.

            "content": "In spirit, at least, each episode of Mushishi strongly reminds me of one thing: A cave painting. A depiction of man and the outside world, brief and primal but perfectly expressive, radiating mysticism, perhaps possessed of more meaning than it initially appears to have.\r\nFrom minute one, Mushishi's representation of a vast world grabs the eye and doesn't let go. Lush forests with dew dripping from every leaf; barren winter mountains peppered with stubborn snow-covered trees; an innocuous pond with lilies on the surface of the still water. The series roams from setting to setting, and all are presented with a lifelike attention to detail. Thecolor palette is richly varied, reaching from the brilliant emerald of vegetation to the deep turquoise of the sea to the dusky red of a far-off sunset. Lighting is used to strong effect, whether it's beams of sun streaming through layers of foliage and mist or a candle's flame struggling to brighten a dark old house. \\n\\n\r\nAnd within those habitats, the mushi themselves, creatively rendered as a strange mix of the familiar and the utterly alien\u2014like shapeless blobs propelled by twitching motions, like phosphorescent insects scuttling along the earth, like great legless serpents twisting skyward. Some take the shape of a natural phenomenon, and the sight of a living rainbow exploding from the earth, or a long-restrained cloud breaking free, expanding and floating away, is bound to impress. The animation on the whole is excellent, but the mushi in particular seem to move with a vivid otherworldly fluidity. At least part of Mushishi is about making sense of the mysterious, bringing reason to something that seems unreasonable, and the designs of the mushi add some believability to this; it's quite easy to see how they could be thought of as ghosts, beasts, or legends, able to inspire both wonder and fear. The tranquility of the environments is consistently impressive in a low-key way, but the spectacle of the mushi can be eerie, majestic, and everything in between.\\n\\n\r\nSound is part of atmosphere, and in the same way that cold urban horrors might use reverberations in dark alleys or the foreboding thrumming of electronics, Mushishi might use a chorus of insects or the roar of drifting snow to surround us, allowing the setting to speak its piece. The music is minimal but startlingly effective, in many cases fitting easily alongside and even seeming to mimic the voices of the earth. Slow piano notes overlap with rhythmic footsteps, a woodwind's sad screams resemble those of a forlorn bird. So, too, can the score sound almost unearthly, with an ominous progression of bells and chimes sometimes underscoring a haunting ending or signaling the arrival of the mushi. The result is an immersive ambiance where visuals and sound alone can convey dark, brooding tension or innocent curiosity with equal ease. It isn't just pretty, it's totally engrossing, exuding pure atmospheric mastery in almost every scene.\\n\\n\r\nThrough this vast world walks Ginko, revenant of revenants, our looking glass. Perceptive of the nature of human and mushi alike, he uses words as careful and deliberate as his journeying stride to become the voice of reason and, with an air of serene confidence, impart his knowledge to others. To become a witness to needless death, a bearer of bad news, or a participant in deception is sometimes part of his job description. As an admirer of life and truth, he cares for none of these tasks, but he'll defy his own nature and undertake them with solemn dedication if he feels that it's necessary. He is wise, but not infallibly so. Nor is he a complete stoic; outbursts of childlike wonder at incredible sights, sarcastic retorts to smart-mouthed travelers, and emotion-laden shouts of panic and warning to his fellow humans all show him as a little more than just the nonchalant white-haired sage. His development, in the traditional sense, is sparse, but he is afforded a poignant backstory that makes him and his thought process a little less of an enigma.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Mushishi gently pushes a picture of a sprawling and intricate world where all beings affect each other in ways both seen and unseen, their actions rippling outward in ever-widening circles, and in that sense, Ginko as a character is no different than any other living thing in the show, simultaneously of little and great consequence. He may be our guide, cursed and blessed to ceaselessly wander, but the world doesn't turn for him. Rather, it's in what he represents that we might find significance: The quest for knowledge, the insatiable desire to understand even while knowing that the sheer body of things in existence prevents total understanding. The need to capture the meaning of what surrounds us, spread our wisdom responsibly, and use it to form calculated reactions to the world instead of rash judgments. He truly is that silver fish swimming endlessly through dark water, opalescent barbels probing fathomless black crevices, illuminating them, if only for a brief moment. Much of Mushishi's strength lies in the ability to provoke thought without direct questions, to let an image serve as subtext, and Ginko himself represents an impressively seamless merging of humanity and idea.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is episodic, not bound by an overarching plot. It is a series of self-contained stories which vary in theme, but are always skillfully crafted. Most episodes consist of human drama, based on relatable and familiar emotions, infused with an element of the natural world. The episodic format delivers powerful and gripping tales in an extremely brief timetable, a feat which I have no problem appreciating. The scenarios are original, and the writing is rich with little subtleties and metaphors, but each episode can be understood and appreciated as successful story even if you've no desire to peer into them deeply. View Mushishi as a progression of intelligent parables full of interesting ideas, or as a bunch of moving and affecting tales; much to its credit, it is both.\\n\\n\r\nPart of what makes Mushishi work is its steadfast refusal to portray anything in terms as simple as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cevil.\u201d Stories where barbaric man stupidly abuses mother nature, or where nature is a hate-filled monster that comes from the hills to eat scared little man, are a dime a dozen, and while they might pass as entertainment, they often fail to say anything worth saying because they handle man and earth as if they're combatants in a holy war. Mushishi is not so black and white, and it has an idea that scales much better. The mushi are not red-toothed animals seeking to kill in droves. The humans are not greedy savages bent on scorching the earth. Both are just beings, trying to survive in the same place and at the same time. That they will cross paths, have conflicting interests, use each other, and hurt each other is inevitable; such is survival. Each episode is one meeting of mushi and human, one miniscule butting of heads in a massive world, with the implication being that this is simply what happens, everywhere. Instead of vilifying humans or portraying nature as a vengeful power, Mushishi whispers: This is just the way things are. It does give us a small shove by implying that, as the ones with the ability to reason and understand, the responsibility for mitigating the damage that humans inflict (and the damage that humans receive) falls on the humans, but it never degenerates into the preachy heavy-handedness or gross oversimplifications that plague many works with similar themes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's that theme which allows Mushishi to navigate the spectrum of human emotion. Conflict in its world does not arise from moral failings or piggish greed, only from a lack of understanding, and understanding is a sword with many edges. Ask the child who learns of death, or the old man who learns of life. Sometimes the knowledge you gain is liberating, sometimes it's disheartening, sometimes it's terrifying. Mushishi can be all of those words and more, but even when it strays to one extreme, it never loses its humanity, its worldliness, or its feeling of being completely natural. Just as it can depict the warm orange rays of the sun and the cold white howl of the snow, it can depict innocent wonder and violent loss, and with equal sincerity. It has balance, and then some.\\n\\n\r\nAs a caveat, I will say that this is the kind of series that practically begs me to use the phrase \u201cnot for everyone.\u201d It's dialogue-heavy, more about the thought leading up to action than the action itself; it keeps the big guns of its visual spectacle on a tight leash, letting them explode only after a suitable buildup to assure the maximum payoff; it doesn't have the conventional storytelling satisfaction of explicitly coming full circle, instead simply tapering off and fading quietly, as episodic series sometimes do. A few episodes will likely be enough to inform you of whether or not it's to your tastes, and I've no doubt that many have labeled (and will continue to label) it as simply \u201cboring.\u201d I understand the origin of this opinion, but I just can't share it, because Mushishi is strangely beautiful and intensely fascinating on several levels. Imbibe it a little at a time like a fine liquor, or dive deeply into it and become drunk on its atmosphere, intrigue, and insights. In my experience, neither disappoints.",

            "content": "Some people will tell you Mushishi is great because it doesn\u2019t contain action and fanservice. These must be the same people who praise a film for not including Adam Sandler. They also make Mushishi look more pretentious than it is. It\u2019s far from it. The problem is, even though Mushishi has a worthwhile aim and the right methods, it doesn\u2019t know how to use them.\r\nIn order for something to be pretentious, it needs to put up a cover while not including the methods. An anime that has a realistic art style with dramatic characters is pretentious. It looks realistic, but the methods that are usedare opposed to it.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi makes it clear what it wants to be in the first episode. It\u2019s a series that\u2019s concerned mainly with men\u2019s relationship to nature. The mushi are just the physical embodiment of what nature can be. Some have criticized Mushishi for creating a magic system that has no rules but leads to convenience, but that\u2019s untrue. Mushishi doesn\u2019t have an RPG-like magic system because it uses magic to explore themes, not to offer instructions on how to do battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe rules the magic in Mushishi follows is the theme of nature. It\u2019s successful in that department. We often see nature portrayed as a calm, peaceful place in contrast to heartless machinery. If the person is especially ignorant, we will even hear about the good old days when men was One With Nature and everything was peaceful and good. Most people see nature though the lens of the Garden of Eden.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who ever bothered to learn a little about nature \u2013 botany or geology or zoology \u2013 will understand Mushishi\u2018s stance on nature. Nautre is unstable, mysterious, powerful and cares nothing about us. Volcanic eruptions and meteors crashing are terrible things, but they\u2019re produced by an indifferent world that has no malice. They just happen. Then again, it\u2019s the same world that gives us great food and visual spectacles. There plenty of time when the terrible and beautiful merge \u2013 how many dangerous animals are also beauiful?\\n\\n\r\nThe series achieves that by the nature of the mushi. They often benefit and harm at the same time, like allowing people to give birth to a person that died. There is always a sense of wonder and mystery surrounding the mushi. Even Ginko, despite his cold demeanor is also startled by them. What people don\u2019t say enough about Mushishi is that this is how fantasy should be done. It\u2019s not like Martin\u2019s world, which is full of details to make it clear and familiar. It\u2019s truly alien and fantastical.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the series falls is in all other departments. The series doesn\u2019t put enough effort into the characters and the stories. They exist solely to present the varying mushi. There are films whose purpose is only to deliver a visual experience, so abandoning conventional storytelling can be a smart decision. It\u2019s not here. It\u2019s not just that 26 episodes make you demand more, but that abandoning conventional storytelling doesn\u2019t help the series\u2019 aim.\\n\\n\r\nThe series forgets about the \u2018men\u2019 in the relationship between men and nature. The characters feel like they have an outer life. The issues spring from life itself \u2013 art, marriage, vision \u2013 rather than having a guy preventing another guy from Being the Best. There isn\u2019t enough character psychology to make these issues feel important.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all interchangeable. I kept waiting for a reason why this person is concerned with vision, or this one with marriage. Nothing is pointless in fiction, after all. In order to bring depth to an issue, you need to connect to the character. Something in the character\u2019s personality needs to be related to the issue so it will affect it. A lot of shounen shows know this, so they tend to give a narcisstic nature to their characters. The character doesn\u2019t just struggle with The Problem but with his own nature. Ikki learns to curb his narcissism and stop swinging between it and depression. Tai learns (or is supposed to) how being a leader works.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these two not being the most developed examples, they make for different stories. You couldn\u2019t put Tai in Ikki\u2019s story, because Tai\u2019s personality is concerned with relationships with others. You couldn\u2019t put Ikki in Tai\u2019s story, because his story is about learning that sometimes you lose some and win some. I could not remember a character that had a situation concerned with his personality. They tend to have generic wants and needs, nothing that\u2019s unique to them. They may be \u2018ordinary people\u2019, but people are not clones even when they follow patterns. Or if the series wanted to comment on that, then the similarity should\u2019ve been made important. Nothing is there to emphasize how similar humans are. These are just empty characters.\\n\\n\r\nGinko is not much better. An episodic series isn\u2019t an excuse to have undeveloped characters. They may not change throughout the series, but they need a personality that will affect every story. A lot of Cartoon Network shows are purely episodic, yet they\u2019re full of quirky characters who create the stories because of who they are.\\n\\n\r\nWe get a backstory episode for Ginko, but it doesn\u2019t reveal much. What\u2019s his motivation? Why is he so into mushi? How does all this exploring affected his worldview? There are sometimes hints. In one episode, Ginko agrees with what I wrote above about the cruelty of nature. This is just one instant, though. All Ginko does is visit people, help them solve the problem and that\u2019s it.\\n\\n\r\nThat makes him a plot device, not a real character. He exists so we\u2019ll have someone to follow, but how different would the series be if it was a random mushishi in every episode? I do not ask to immidiately reveal who Ginko is. If every episode gave a small piece, it would be enough. The collector, who appears from time to time is the only person with something resembling a drive. He\u2019s really into collecting, and values it more than humans. It\u2019s a little touch that makes him more real than anyone here. There are sometimes other mushishi\u2019s who act a little different, but the difference is never wide enough.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a missed oppurtunity, sure, but not one without merits. It\u2019s as original as people say it is, and a good example of how far storytelling can go. It didn\u2019t live up to its concept, but it\u2019s still good that it\u2019s out there and that it found an audience. Hopefully, one of these someone will pick up these ideas and run away with them. It\u2019s a fun series, but one that should be easy to improve.\\n\\n\r\n3.5 mushi out 5",

            "content": "This anime was a very  unique experience. The show introduces a very interesting concept called the mushi. It'd be very difficult to describe what the mushi are precisely. In a nutshell , they're essentially spiritual beings, but at the same time they inhabit the physical world ( Yeah I know what your thinking, you just completely contradicted yourself. I know, I know just go with it) and they use humans as a host ( very similar to a parasite). One aspect in particular that struck me about the show was how it was devoid of any western influences whatsoever. Many anime fans don't realizehow anime is indeed heavily influenced by Western culture. But Mushi-shi primarily borrows stories from many east Asian folklore and myths. Although Mushi-shi does offer an original and innovative premise/concept, the execution is most certainly flawed. \\n\\n\r\nStory \\n\r\nThe story of Mushi-shi follows the exploits of Ginko, who is otherwise known as the Mushi-shi or Mushi master in the English dub. Ginko's job as a Mushi-shi is to go around and help people who have been infected by the mushi. This is one of the flaws to Musi-shi, which is it's formulaic plot. As you go through these episodes you'll notice that 90% of the them play out like this: Ginko is wandering around, he encounters a village, group of people or an individual who have had an encounter with the mushi. Which in turn, leads to them being harmed to the point were they're crippled or their lives are hanging on by a thread. Ginko attempts to save them. His efforts leads them to being cured or sometimes the episode will end off tragically where the one infected dies. Basically, this formula repeats for 26 episodes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nYeah.....the series is a tad bit repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nNotice how I said a tad bit repetitive and not overly repetitive. Because what saves it is the mushi themselves, there isn't a single episode where the mushi are exactly the same; it's always fascinating to observe them, because the way they interact and work with humans is so compelling. Oh and did I forget to mention that Mushi-shi has no main storyline ? Yes, this is an episodic anime where each episode is it's own standalone story. This wasn't a problem for me, but I know it will be for some. Because of course, most people generally prefer a main ongoing story. Again this wasn't a problem for me. Also, when I say episodic, I mean it. It's not like Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo, where it's episodic in nature but it has an overarching story. That\u2019s not the case with Mushi-shi. Plus there's no recurring characters in the show except Ginko. I mean, if someone was to walk up to me and say \"hey, I found Mushi-shi to be a phenomenal anime and I absolutely loved it,\" I'd completely understand. If somebody else walked up to me and said \"hey, I found Mushi-shi to be extremely boring and I didn't like it,\" I'd also completely understand. Because of how literally quiet and subtle it is (not recommended if you got A.D.H.D), which isn't a bad thing by the way. Mushi-shi is definitely not for everyone; it's not meant to appeal to the masses, its meant for a niche audience who can truly appreciate its fascinating concept and artistry. It's very reminiscent of an independent arthouse film. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters & Themes \\n\r\nNow on to the themes and characters. This anime excels in that department. Mushi-shi does a fantastic job of exploring themes of loss, despair, self sacrifice, suffering and tragedy. Whenever the mushi infects people, family bonds are tested and death is always around the corner. If someone does in fact die or suffer a heavy loss, it always resonates with you. So yeah, clearly the show has a lot of emotional depth. Lets get into the characters, now as I mentioned before there are no recurring characters except for Ginko, and for the most part the anime does a fairly good job of fleshing out these nonrecurring characters. Especially considering the fact that each has only about 21 minutes (excludes opening and closing songs) of screen time. On to Ginko, whose obviously the main protagonist. You'll definitely take a liking to him as he's a very kindhearted individual. He does get a good amount of characterization and we do get a back story as to how he became a Mushi-shi/Mushi master. But really compared to other main protagonists its wasn't enough in my opinion. That's another one of my problems with Mushi-shi, Ginko needs to be fleshed out more. Nevertheless, he's an all around good main protagonist \\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nArguably the best part of Mushi-shi, from the score, to the voice acting and even just the sounds going on in the back ground. The opening track is called \" The Sore Feet Song\" by Ally Kerr and its a solid one overall. You'll probably enjoy it if you like folk rock. Something that is also very unique about Mushi-shi is the ending theme, or should I say ending themes, because every episode has its own closing song and I got to say, I liked all of them. It's hard to describe them because the instrumentation is so unique and each one feels so surreal and atmospheric. They have an otherworldly vibe to them. Then we have the actual score within the show which is also great and complements the mood excellently. Like the closing themes, the score has an otherworldly vibe as well that I can't put my finger on. Finally on to the voice acting, which is outstanding on both the Japanese sub and English Dub. No seriously, it's that good, especially the English dub which in my opinion surpasses the original Japanese and it ranks up there with Funimation\u2019s best work like Baccano, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Fullmetal Alchemist. Both Yuto Nakano and Travis Willingham embody the character of Ginko perfectly, and all the other cast members do a great job as well especially considering that fact that they only appear once. Also, pay attention to the tone of the voice acting on both languages and notice how monotone and subtle it is. Don't let it discourage you. This is completely intentional because it's meant to match the quiet and subtle tone of the actual show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation \\n\r\nFinally, we get into the last part of the review, the art and animation. The animation is very good and smooth, but the art (especially the backgrounds) is absolutely stunning. You'll know what I mean when you watch the series for yourself, just pay close attention to the detail that is given here. From the lush green vegetation, to the mountains and rivers. It's absolutely gorgeous. I recall when I was watching it, I had to pause the show for a moment because the backgrounds were so beautiful to look at. Hands down, some of the best you'll find in all of anime. I guarantee it. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts \\n\r\nWhen it's all said and done, Mushi-shi has it's flaws and at the same time it has a lot of good things going for it. It's formulaic tendencies really held it back. Plus, Ginko could have been fleshed out more. Regardless of that, this anime was a joy to watch and it's a good solid one at that. If you have an open mind, I recommend you check it out, especially if you want something that is unique and original.",

            "content": "It's pretty rare to see a purely episodic anime that isn't a comedy, and that's just another reason Mushishi was such a treat.\r\nSTORY - The series follows the journeys of a traveling Mushishi named Ginko who investigates paranormal phenomenon usually caused by creatures called Mushi. Each episode describes one of his encounters with self-sustaining villagers in and around vast mountain ranges. Something is wrong, and Ginko does what he can. It's very straightforward, but even though each episode more or less follows the same format, it isn't a simple case of Ginko saving the day every single time. Sometimes things are beyond his control; sometimesnothing can be done regardless, and sometimes, nothing need be done at all. It can be frustrating sometimes when Ginko has revelations that he won't explain until later, and because of the supernatural nature of the Mushi, Mushishi has quite an expository air to it. The mysteries aren't of the sort you can really deduce yourself, and there's a lot of talking and explanation.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the way the Mushi and humans interact can be very fascinating at times, disturbing at other times. Sometimes Mushishi feels like a cross between a nature documentary and a paranormal investigation. Fans of either would definitely enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - Ginko is really the only reoccurring character in the series, though his collector/doctor friend, Adashino, does show up now and again. Each episode contributes a different situation involving different people in a different place, and they almost never have anything to do with one another. Naturally, this means the exclusive cast of each episode remains pretty generic. There is the generic little girl and little boy character, the young woman, the young man, the middle-aged woman and man, the old woman and the man. Sure, the individual characters may have unique characteristics depending on their situation, but for the most part, the cares, worries, and priorities of each of these archetypes are standard. I didn't really mind though. After all, their situations did set them apart from one another, and as almost all these characters lived in small, self-sustained villages, it's conceivable to say that their lifestyles made them similar.\\n\\n\r\nGinko, as the protagonist, gives us a little more depth and insight into his personality, but even he remains a mostly enigmatic character for the length of the series. His intentions are generally altruistic, but there is more to his actions than that. Actually, I wish Ginko's thoughts and personal feelings about Mushi are touched on more -- there are definitely morals and deeper philosophies involved, but they're only touched on in one or two episodes. Still, those are the episodes that give Ginko the most personality, and I think it's very easy to relate to him as a result. His quirky habits and mannerisms are kind of endearing too, and he's just a fun character to watch. He's easy-going: very fitting for this kind of episodic series.\\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - Mushishi definitely has some of the most gorgeous backgrounds for an animated series (as opposed to an animated movie) I've ever seen. The forests are lush with detail and vibrant colors. It floors me the way every plant and flower and tree branch and leaf is expressed. Views from mountaintops are breathtaking, and the oceans glitter with tiny waves and light. Cloud formations are grandiose and powerful, and the night sky is always vibrant with stars. These are some really, really amazing environments, man. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs, in contrast, are pretty plain. Ginko stands out with his white hair and teal eye (which have a legitimate explanation beyond &quot;he's an anime character!&quot;), and his face is pretty unique in itself, but all those archetypal villagers? In every episode, you'll have deja vu. &quot;Hey, isn't that the character from the last episode?&quot; No. It isn't. None of the villagers get repeat episodes, but you'll think so for a while because all of them look the same! Every little girl character looks like every other little girl character, and every middle-aged man villager looks like every other in the same category. It's actually pretty amusing, and I didn't particularly mind this repetition simply because... well, it doesn't matter all that much. Since none of the characters repeat, it isn't like it's that confusing. Anyway, I can accept that they blew all their character design budget on the backgrounds; it's really not that bad of a trade-off at all. :P\\n\\n\r\nI also really liked that Mushishi had a very tranquil air about it. The title screens of every episode appeared quietly into the existing scene, calmly and without interruption. There is no bridge animation/page to frame where the commercial break would be. It just fades in and out very smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - Mushishi has some really minimalistic music. The soundtrack throughout the series is mostly of the traditional Japanese sort -- bells, gongs, bamboo flutes, biwas, and other string instruments. They're all very, very fitting to the series and definitely enhance the scenes they're used in. They're moody, eerie, calming, and occasionally cheerful. Sometimes there's only silence, but that fits too. For being so minimal, the sounds in Mushishi are incredibly effective. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is already an indication of this. It's soft and slow and reminds me somewhat of something they'd play in a yoga class: soothing. The lyrics are in English (not Engrish!) and also fit very well with the themes of the series. I love the name of it too -- &quot;The Sore Feet Song.&quot; The ending theme is always an instrumental and changes with every episode, something you don't see often at all. The composer is none other than Toshiou Masuda of Naruto fame, and he once again does an awesome, awesome job (even if you don't like the Naruto anime, it's hard to deny that it has an amazing soundtrack). The end themes are generally very mellow, bittersweet, which echos the endings of many episodes. More yoga music!\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - I saw all of the series subbed, and interesting enough, Mushishi has a gigantic cast list because there's a different voice actor for pretty much every single random villager character in the series. I thought since many of the villagers are reasonably similar, they'd just use one voice per archetype. No! All of these people have their own voice! I guess that's a pretty good way of making up for the lack of variation in visual designs, and it works out pretty well. It's worth noting that a majority of the little kid characters aren't annoying! Some of them are actually... reasonably cute? I really did enjoy Ginko's voice also; it's pretty &quot;normal&quot; sounding, but it fits his character very well.\\n\\n\r\nEdit; I just discovered that the entirety of Mushishi is available streaming off FUNimation's website, dubbed. As such, I took the liberty of checking out a few episodes, and it's pretty good! I really wasn't sure about Ginko's voice at first, but Travis Willingham does a pretty decent imitation of Yuto Nakano's voice and it warms up to you fairly quickly. Willingham also somehow manages the same quirky kind of tone. While the American cast of villagers isn't quite as extensive as the Japanese, there are still a good number of varied talents there so it isn't too much repetition. All in all, I'd say FUNi did a pretty swell job.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - Mushishi might be one of those series you should watch a bit at a time just because it's entirely episodic and might feel a little repetitive in large doses. (I watched it all in two or three days, but hey, that's me.) There is no ending, and actually, I wouldn't mind seeing another season of this. There is an origin episode or two to flesh out Ginko's past and development as a character, but while they do help the general story along and I'm glad for them, I don't think they're entirely necessary either. If you like scientifically presented supernatural stuff and don't mind a very easy-come, easy-go story, then I'm sure you'll like Mushishi. :3\\n",

            "content": "This review contains no major spoilers. I was beyond thrilled when I had finally got my hands on Mushishi in its entirety. I have to shamelessly admit that I'm pretty dang easily entertained. So typically when there is a show that EVERYONE seems to love, I tend to enjoy it just as much. Unfortunately, once I got around to getting into the series I found a number of issues that others just didn't seem to have. I was entertained on a number of episodes, and definitely compelled to complete it. However, this certainly wasn't the masterpiece I thought I was about to watch.\r\nAesthetically this animeis among the best of the mid 2000s. Everything in this series just looks so damn good. The quality ranges all the way from the characters, to the many varying environments, and especially the mushi as they are drawn in a seemingly endless variety of colors, forms and sizes. There is really no \"rules\" when it comes to mushi so the creators can just draw whatever the heck they want. This leads to many off the wall forms, colors, shapes, matter, you get the idea. One of my favorite parts while watching was waiting to see what the next episode's mushi were going to look like. The dub is on par with the animation in that it's completely flawless. This is undoubtedly one of the best dubs out there. The music never really clicked with me, but it never detracted from the quality either, so no complaints from me there.\\n\\n\r\nNow the episodic story design and lack of main characters are where my feelings of this series seems to steer differently from the mass's . As much as I wanted to love this series, I just never got completely sucked in like my favorite shows always seem to have a way of doing. My first complaint is Ginko. He is our protagonist, mushi master, and the only real reoccurring character of the series (save for very brief multi-appearance of another) . Ginko is completely lacking in any trace of charisma. Actually, he lacks just about everything.  He really never expresses happiness, sadness, any emotions for that matter. There are a few instances where he verbally exclaims he is concerned with something or another, but it certainly doesn't feel sincere due to his stone face and never changing body language. Even in one instance where his life is in serious danger, he just stoically thinks to himself \"oh I'm gonna die, I don't want to....this isn't good\" with no feelings of urgency or emotion, as if he were thinking of a chore he had to do or something. He has absolutely zero development through out the series, and even the relationships he forms from episode to episode feel superficial. Every new acquaintance is simply a means of progressing the episodes with no hints of any realistic bonds being formed. Considering every other person in the series only gets 20 minutes of screen time at the absolute max, these flaws with his character are kind of a big deal. I understand they most likely meant his passive presence to allow for the individual stories to take center stage, but it rarely worked well in my opinion. I feel many of the stories would have benefited if Ginko were written in a way that we could relate or feel towards him. You can't have a great vagabond story if you can't feel for the guy ya know?  \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the other characters, most are fine given the little time they do have. They are mostly believable with ranging personalities so it doesn't get bland. But it's hard to really form a solid judgement towards them one way or another due to how little time we actually get to spend with them. As for the stories? To be totally honest here, a number of them can be just flat out boring. It would be inaccurate to say that they're \"bad\". But many just don't really drag you in as much as I anticipated that they would. The series opens strong, the first DVD is pretty entertaining. As we're introduced to the world of Mushishi, its design and uniqueness ropes you in at the beginning. But as the show progresses it never actually builds on anything. Every episode begins with an inexplicable conflict, and of course every conflict is revealed to be the result of some different kind of mushi. The situation is then analyzed and the mushi are taken care of in some overly convenient new obscure manner. Rinse and repeat. This formula begins to grow stale. Like I said earlier, there are no rules for mushi. This is great for the artist's freedom, but not so great as a plot device. I've never been a huge stickler for realism, but many of the solutions seem waaaayyy overly convenient, because previously unknown mushi traits always pop up at just the right time. For example all of a sudden a hopeless situation will be resolved because moonlight hits a mushi, or in another instance sculpting some pottery on the spot leads to the fix of an otherwise incurable ailment. There are just so many completely random and off the wall solutions to many of the problems that the viewer is expected to just roll with. I feel that it definitely detracts some from some of the show's enjoyment. With such short stories, it's also just really hard to get engrossed in the characters and their problems. The series does have it's highlights of memorable episodes, particularly in the first few episodes and then again towards the end, but these moments of greatness aren't exactly the norm. Many of the stories in the middle are just on the dull side unfortunately. Despite being only 20 minutes a pop, some seem to drag, moving inexcusably slow while not really offering enough excitement to make you actually care whether or not things turn out for the better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mushishi is a very chill and relaxing show to watch. The stories are always at least pleasantly humble despite all else. I also never grew tired of the fresh animation in each episode. However, given all the hype I had heard, I found myself disappointed and longing for something more. This is an okay anime, but not the amazing series I had originally thought I was about to watch. 6/10",

            "content": "10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10... 10! I've been seeing so many perfect 10's handed out to this Anime and it genuinely baffles me. When I saw all the scores this Anime was getting, I went into it thinking that I will be going into an Anime where everything will be amazing and wonderful, where I will become one of the people giving this a perfect score too. I was excited and thinking that maybe this Anime will have life lessons? Maybe it will take advantage of the world building to create exciting stories? Maybe it will create memorable characters? Nope. The amount of 10'shanded out to this show fooled me yet again, and I fell into the damn hype!\\n\\n\r\nCan someone actually explain to me why this Anime is considered a \"masterpiece\" by the Anime community, or why it is above an Anime like Death Note? I don't get it. It has \"good\" world building if you can call it that, some good episodes, some bad episodes and an uninteresting main character. I'd say most of the episodes were good so that's a plus, but the amount of problems it has in addition to how uninteresting and boring it became at the end just rubbed off the wrong way on me. \\n\\n\r\nMushishi is a show that talks about Mushi, mythical creatures created by the Anime to be some sort of driving force for the episodic plot this show has. These Mushi are forces of nature, sometimes acting as a foil to humans and ruining humans' lives. The only way to beat the Mushi and figure out a treatment for the sicknesses these creatures bring is by calling upon a Mushishi, which is supposed to be a person who can deal with the Mushi and figure out treatments for their victims. Mushishi can also see Mushi, unlike most normal people.\\n\\n\r\nHere we already have our first problem. Unless I am blind and infected by Mushi myself, then I see that this Anime does not show us anything of the Mushishi organization or it's origin, how they study Mushi, how they treat their patients and how Mushi came to be. These are all unanswered and the viewer is left with this void of knowledge all the way to the end. The Anime could have answered most of them or at least one of them, but it chose not to, it chose to create a work that is half finished. How do you go on to create a fantasy story full of whimsical creatures of all types, but not answer the most basic of questions at the very least? I've seen so many stories with plot holes, but they at least had some form of decency to explain the basic elements in their settings. Mushishi fails at living up to it's full potential by not explaining the magical elements it has created. What would you prefer, a story that has good world building, is explained and could be understood by the viewer? Or a story that has good world building, but does not answer anything to the viewer? If you pick the second option then this Anime is perfect for you!\\n\\n\r\nMy second problem here is that the Anime never explains why people can see Mushi while others cannot. We know, for example, that some people can see Mushi because they were infected by the Mushi. But why do the Mushi choose specific people instead of a whole tribe? Why do Mushi choose these specific people in the first place? Why do some people who are infected by the Mushi see them, while others cannot? In the very first episode we see a ritual happen, but it is never explained why this ritual happened, and the subject of Mushi humans is never seen again and just forgotten. Why? Mushi human appeared in the first episode and just never appeared again. All we saw from that point was just the Mushi in their original form infecting humans. \\n\\n\r\nIt just doesn't explain anything at all, other than maybe Ginko calling the Mushi by some absurd name based on it's type and figuring out a way to beat them somehow. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and the soundtrack are the only good things about this show. The art is incredible, it is very aesthetically pleasing. I remember watching an episode about the stone Mushi that turns into a beautiful pink cloud when someone carves into it, it was a very beautiful episode, so much so that I looked at a cloud on my way home from college and kept thinking about Mushishi. Another example is about a Mushi that takes the shape of a tree, when cut down the tree spawns legs and crawls inside the woods, so the visuals are definitely beautiful and surprise you as well. See how Mushishi delivers some amazing concepts? If only the Anime had explained and took advantage of it's setting to achieve it's maximum potential... Otherwise we wouldn't have had some very boring and stupid episodes too, wrapped up in an unexplained world.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are awful, end of discussion... do I really need to explain this one? The story has one reoccurring character that does not get development. Ginko is an awful character, no backstory, no development, no reasoning to his actions, no nothing. The episodic characters don't get any form of development whatsoever, but that does not matter so much to me because they have the excuse of being episodic characters, not main ones. The show instead should develop the main character at least, right? This is Mushishi, did you expect the main character to make any sort of logic or get any development? Come on man! Not in one scene do we see Ginko have an inner monologue with himself about how he feels towards his life or the Mushi around him, he's so one dimensional that the only attributes I can attribute to him are smoking, having one eye (which is never explained) and being unable to feel sadness, anger or happiness. Basically just an emo who somehow knows how to deal with Mushi. The Anime does give us some of his backstory during the final episode, but it only tells us one thing to know about him, that thing is that Mushi are attracted to him. Really? 26 episodes just for this? Jesus Christ what a disappointment!\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy this Anime for the most part, meaning that it had more interesting episodes than flat out bad ones. It still had some awful and boring episodes, so it gets a 5, maybe a 6 from me in terms of enjoyment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPeople are saying that this Anime is not like other repetitive and predictable Anime, as in it does not rely on cheap plot twists and big explosions to make itself look cooler. Rather it is a very meditative show that is slow and takes it's time to explain stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThese people who are saying that, they make me think that Mushishi is like The Wire of Anime (lol). I actually do think that this is like The Wire, they are both boring and don't rely on cheap tricks to advance their plots.... and that's where their similarities end. The Wire explains it's setting and plot fully, develops it's characters, and actually is a commentary about our world.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is an over hyped, overrated Anime that you should not waste your time getting into. This is a lesson that you should not always give into the hype.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So what reason could there be to praise a show that's been reviewed four times already, receiving highest marks? The answer is simple enough: it's been a long time since an anime has impressed me as much as Mushishi did. Going beyond the boundaries of the entertainment-based pop culture, this deserves the term 'art' in every aspect.\r\nThe provided synopsis could hardly be more accurate, yet does it tell little to nothing about the series. The reason for this is that Mushishi, unlike usual modern entertainment, convinces the viewer through style - aesthetics. There is no flashy, grotesque or absurd story, competing for attention among thecliche-ridden anime market. The plot flows like a calm streamlet, contemplative in its very essence.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode tells us a fascinating, coherent, artfully arranged tale revolving around Ginko and the people he meets on his journey, who are facing different consequences through the confrontation with the paranormal.\\n\r\nThe way the protagonist Ginko approaches the phenomenon 'Mushi' is open-minded, enquiring, yet discreet. \\n\r\nMaybe we can go as far as to assume that the paranormal allegorizes the beauty of nature which rarely receives attention in today's perception (in fact is invisible to most!).\\n\r\nBut the anime does not teach - it shows, implicitly. In a  meditative way. Hence, the impression it delivers is so very strong. The viewer does not reject the wisdom it provides.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode deeply touched me, not just through its profound story but as well by means of sound and animation. The music conveys the atmopshere modest, soothing, simply beautiful - and sometimes there is no sound at all. Minimalistic perfection.\\n\r\nThe animation is astonishing - detailed sceneries of nature in every thinkable facet, backgrounds imbued with life.\\n\\n\r\nIt was an unusual, enriching experience. Philosophical and artful - opposing commercialism and qualitative decline. Timeless.",

            "content": "A compelling, mysterious and thought-provoking anime on being's known as Mushi. This unique show proves that an anime doesn't need to have romance, action, comedy or something thrilling to be interesting to watch.\r\nMushishi is comprised of a bunch of episodic adventures where each episode follows its own mini story of, Ginko's encounters with the natural phenomenon known as Mushi. Each heartfelt episode manages to cleverly bring a great deal of drama involving different types of Mushi, with different problems, and there are episodes that stand out from the rest. It's pretty unique how this anime is set out like 26 different Japanese folktales, whichis a welcome change from the usual anime.\\n\\n\r\nHaving every episode telling a different story there's always something new to expect however this also means that there are new characters to every episode. With only Ginko being the only character to appear throughout the series it's pretty hard to get emotionally attached to any of them but at least they make the most out of the time they have.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi has some superb animation, which successfully makes the most out of the earth look and colors. So much detail is put into the environment; water and ambient lighting that even the slightly dull premise of the show can be easily overlooked. The music is a tranquil selection of guitar and age-old Japanese tunes that suit the calm nature of the show. Both the animation and music are the aspects that allow the viewer to be immersed into this deeply, compelling show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mushishi is a pretty amazing anime, with no beginning or end but just a collection of adventurous stories. It manages to bring something new to the saturated anime market, without any use of gimmicks. With all that said the only real reason why I didn't rate this any higher was due to the lack of everything; apart from adventure, mystery and storytelling. So this show really isn't suitable for people who require action, romance or anything thrilling in their shows, because Mushishi is really something that you can kick back and relax to.",

In fact this in itself is what makes it stand up. Its tranquility and taking things at a calm pace is what makes Mushishi so great, yet in a way it is also what makes it a bit offputting to some.\r\nSetting-wise, Mushishi is set in a world where being not human nor animal live. They are basic, pure;in touch with the very essence of life. They are called Mushi, as they are called, are often capable of performing supernatural phenomena, and naturally enough there are humans devoted to the study of Mushi. They are called Mushishi, and Mushishi follows one of these, uh, Mushishi. Eh.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi doesn't have a continuous story, rather, each episode features its own small story, where Ginko, our Mushishi, encounters a new Mushi and the problems it causes for some humans. The two-three episode characters are usually portrayed very meticulously to the viewer, giving us decent enough information and emotion to make them realistic, an impressive feat considering they have around twenty minutes to expose them to us. Usually Ginko tries to help with his knowledge (and to gain more), but at this point Ginko is really set apart from the standard hero, becoming more of an antihero-type of person. Whereas most heroes would never give up and go all superdetermined, Ginko knows when enough is enough, and if he can't do anything more, or if it's pointless, he tells everyone that it is, and leaves. In that, Ginko, too, fits in with the calm of Mushishi; he never lets his emotions rule over his sense of reason; he knows when to stop.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanying this lovely setting is what most will probably remember Mushishi for: Its art. The landscapes and sceneries protrayed often - Mushishi takes place in natural/village environemnts only - are breathtaking. Yet, they are not extremely vivid; they don't hit your senses with avid coloring and all that. No; they are more pale, plain. While still procuring those memorable sceneries, this also allows it to induce a more peaceful expeirence.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack must of course not be left out, because that, too, plays a major part in Mushishi's calmness. The soundtrack usually bases itself on a single melliflous intstrumental theme for each episode, which plays throughout the episode and at the end credits. the opening song is also lovely, and as serene as the rest of the soundtrack, and the show as a whole. The voice actors, too, do a great job of keeping with the peaceful feeling of Mushishi. They have very calm voices, and even when upset, screaming or crying, it's not in-your-face or loud; it's calm, yet very evocative.\\n\\n\r\nThough, all this tranquility, while important for the overall feel of Mushishi, can also be the most deterring aspect of it. Simply because it's a tad boring. You don't really watch Mushishi for its entertainment value, which in and of itself isn't very high. It can be rather boring. However, that doesn't change the fact that it is a show you should try out at least once. Or twice. What Mushishi is best at is calming you down, letting you relax with some interesting paranormal mysteries and enjoying gorgeous vistas.",

            "content": "Many struggle with wrapping their heads around specific folklore that is entirely different from the cultural roots of their own country. It can be an arduous task for the ill-prepared minds that nevertheless want to explore all facets of any country\u2019s folklore that captures the entirety of how it\u2019s culture evolved from its roots to the present. There haven\u2019t been many shows, or anime for that manner, that have handled folklore with the level of atmosphere and creativity that the show Mushishi has to offer and for this, we have to be thankful for its existence. A beautiful existence to be more specific.\r\nHow Mushishi developsitself from the ground up, in terms of its overall narrative, is by separating plot arcs into every single episode that have their own story that all feel unique and thought-provoking. The people, who Ginko comes across on these different episodes, are never seen again as he tries to make sense of how these \u201cMushi\u201d behave and how they adapt in the landscape of Mushishi\u2019s world by engrossing them into the people. What makes it extraordinarily admirable is the level of detail that encompasses the entirety of the show despite not having an over-arching \u201cstory\u201d from how almost every single character feels like actual people rather than one-dimensional caricatures that shows, like Mushishi, typically fall into when they try to do the same formula. I wouldn\u2019t go so far that it\u2019s every bit as perfect as one would hope, but it\u2019s more than enough for it to be garnered anything but warm praise for its in-depth characterization. Ginko himself proves to be a very competent lead in giving him the excellent detective mind that is akin to other great detective characters in other mystery works in the past by giving him a strong back-story to his past life and how he came into being a mushi-shi himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe absence of an overarching narrative in Mushishi, however, doesn\u2019t bold too well for it since it is bounded by a slight disconnect of a tightly structured world that it wants us to feel engrossed and connected but it ultimately doesn\u2019t come across as anything but average. While most of the episodes prove to be good in-of-themselves, watching them all together and trying to encapsulate the very nature of the particular world they want to portray feels empty and shallow. It intends to make an episodic show but at the same time it tries creates this living, breathing society on a macro-level that doesn\u2019t fit right on an episodic show. Its two properties of world-building that don\u2019t coincide perfectly and because of this, Mushishi comes across as far from perfect in this facet. The structure of Mushishi might\u2019ve taken it took into a slight nose-dive, but there\u2019s one exact detail to the show that makes up for it, the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nTo succeed in developing a relaxed tone, the atmosphere has to be just right for the viewer to be engrossed in it for which there\u2019s plenty to go around in Mushishi. One other crucial detail that every person always mentions about Mushishi that comes from the melancholic atmosphere is that there\u2019s not one person who finds the atmosphere nothing but beautiful. It\u2019s hard to make an atmosphere that is faulty but the one thing that would do it a disservice to any show of Mushishi\u2019s nature is how poor it creates a mood that is too blatantly lifeless or absolutely monotonous in how it integrates with the tone. To which I applaud Mushishi for bringing itself to its knees and flourishing. The lack of a lot of music helps in this aspect a lot to let us breathe in the atmosphere without any distraction for long periods while looking at the great artistry of the scene in question. I would\u2019ve appreciated even more if there was no music at all since the random musical instrumentation spread out at specific points of the episodes don\u2019t feel like they were needed at all.\\n\\n\r\nWith something as slow and methodical as shows like Mushishi typically come across, Mushishi manages to pace itself near-perfectly in taking its time to let us take in the scenes at face-value without hinging on quick interludes that would hamper on every scene. Despite its slow pacing, it never feels like a slog to go through. It\u2019s like listening to a great drone/ambient album that goes on for 2 hours, and once it\u2019s done, you\u2019ve felt as though only mere minutes have passed because of how entranced you were from experience. That is one thing to describe Mushishi: Entrancing. Once you\u2019ve set your sights and overall attention to the subtle details put into, not only the art but how hypnotic the writing of the dialogue is and the breathtaking Mushi sequences are, you can\u2019t take your eyes off of it for one minute.\\n\\n\r\nGreat care is given to the tone of Mushishi as it builds up the mood at certain points to feel very compelling and robust on a mental and emotional level into the stories. The Mushi sequences alone are all extremely breathtaking to experience because of their lucid creativity and imagination that was put into practice by the brilliant artistry of the show. They\u2019re the types of sequences that will forever be burrowed into your memory just by the sheer awe-inspiring imagination that was obviously inspired by Japanese folklore with the designs of the Mushis themselves and how the sequences themselves were directed brilliantly by how tense and uneasy they were portrayed whenever they appeared on-screen or any of the mushi incidents.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork itself borrows heavily from influences of old Japanese artistry you\u2019d see on an old Ukiyo-e print from early 17th Century Japan. It gives the atmosphere a bonus from the wonderfully detailed backgrounds and the creative animation of the sequences I mentioned beforehand. There\u2019s not much in the way of overall breathtaking animation because of its plodding nature, but it doesn\u2019t do a disservice since it fits very well to the tone. The character designs themselves look like actual human beings and have very minimal detail to the foreground of the palette on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is a show that cannot be done justice by just talking about it and that you have to experience it for yourself to see the qualities come full force. It certainly did for me. Despite my thoughts on it not being perfect in how I view on all of its positive aspects, that shouldn\u2019t be a clear sign to not go through a genuine calming experience that you\u2019ll hardly ever see in most anime. Watch it before you go to bed or anything that has to do with trying to make you reach into a state of tranquility. It should prove worthy of any acclaim to people who\u2019ve been interested in the pure Japanese mythology that this series has created for itself. If there were an anime show that could rank along with \u201cThe Great Wave off Kanagawa\u201d as one of the most significant contributions to Japanese art that showcases its aesthetic insight to its own culture, Mushishi would be that anime, bar none.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n",

            "content": "I heard about this anime a while ago, but the synopsis didn't seem that appealing to me.  So I basically forgot about it until recently and decided to watch a few episodes to see why it was so well regarded...\r\nIt's beautiful.  It's like meditating.\r\nStory:  It's an episodic show that feels like a collection of fables or myths to me... almost as though these stories were from a world before science when people made up spirits or gods to explain life's mysteries.  That's not really the premise of the show, but that's how it felt to me.\r\nIt's laid-back and meditative.  ButI was riveted ...maybe because it is such a quiet sort of show, I'm not sure.  Absolutely riveted.  I didn't want to blink.  I wanted to see everything and soak it all in.  I think it's astonishing that something that lacking in tension is still that incredibly compelling.  It's kind of like when you see the Grand Canyon or sequoias for the first time, I guess. ;)\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The world is beautiful.  The people are all the same, except Ginko. ;)  They only bothered to draw, like, 4 different faces (or it just felt that way)... so just keep in mind that even though that woman in one episode looks just like the woman from that other episode... it's most likely not the same person -- just let it go. ;)  \\n\\n\r\nI thought the gorgeousness of the scenery more than made up for the lack of distinction in the humans.  And I also thought that there was a subtle message about the universality of experience and the concept of the &quot;every man/woman&quot; in the uniformity of the way the people looked (which is also, I think, related to the lack of time in the show -- it doesn't matter if this is a century ago or today, and the story doesn't tell you).  And the landscapes are amazing.  I thought they did an incredible job of giving the environment the right feel and mood for the episodes.  There's so much personality in the environment that you could make an argument about how the landscape and the mushishi are the characters and the people are the background.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  I thought the voice actors did a great job of expressing a wide range of emotions without going to extremes.  There's a mellowness and evenness to the show that's recreated even in the tone and pitch of their voices, which I really liked.  (I really love it when everything comes together like that.)  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  Like I mentioned before, you end up feeling as though the main character the world/nature and the people are just what trees and buildings are normally in other stories, which brings art and character closer than I've ever seen before.  Ginko is practically the only character you see in more than one episode and serves as a main character/guide/wise man/shaman during your exploration of this new world.  The experience of the show is the experience of his relationship with the world around him.  He is poised, calm and interested without being over-eager or overbearing.  There is such a strong sense of serenity and acceptance in Ginko and his attitude towards the world around him.  He makes you think of a time long lost where man co-existed with nature instead of destroying it.  And because of that he&rsquo;s soothing and comforting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  There is this wonderful, reverent serenity that permeates everything about the series: the lingering look at the landscapes; the semi-monotonous speech of the characters; the slow, deliberate pacing of each show; and, most especially, Ginko's quiet, unflappable calm.  All those elements help create this atmosphere of profound stillness and ease. I feel like I walked away from each episode somehow refreshed and rejuvenated. And I loved how everything in the series was fell in line with the theme.  It's not uncommon for the story and the characters to carry a show, but here the sound and the art are just as essential to conveying ideas and emotions to the viewer.  Like I mentioned before, I love it when everything points in the same direction and there's nothing superfluous tacked on to interfere with or dilute the message.  Brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't for people with a short attention span, probably.  I'm sure there's a big chunk of the population will find it boring as watching grass grow and that's fine; it isn't for everyone.  But if you'd like to take a deep breath once in a while... this is definitely worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\n(Edited/Re-formatted:  April 9, 2008)",

            "content": "\u201cMushishi is a beautiful tragedy\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cTragic, in the sense that it was tedious to watch; beautiful, because it\u2019s finally over\u201d \u2014 Krunchyman\r\nConceiving an interesting, well though-out anime is not as problematic as one might assume, because, as Hayao Miyazaki has demonstrated, quality is not subservient to complexity; in fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite.  Simplicity, done correctly, is exceptionally sublime.  There is nothing more pleasing than watching a \u201cbasic\u201d show that executes its own themes splendidly, with a cast of characters that exude authenticity.  A simple anime has the potential of conveying a wealth of information that can impact the viewer in a myriadof ways, including: cognitively, psychologically, and viscerally.  It can hit all the pertinent emotional chords, permitting a cathartic outflow of emotion, stimulating deep inward reflection for future reminiscing, and altering one\u2019s perspective on their own existence.\\n\\n\r\nYes.  Greatness can be attained quite easily, through the power of embracing the \u201csimplistic\u201d approach; yet, most directors are unwilling to adopt a \u201csimple\u201d style, in fear that it may be misconstrued as being rudimentary, or absent of \u201centertainment\u201d value.  What is lost on those director\u2019s, however, is the idea of allowing the work to speak for itself, rather than bombarding the viewer with their own ideological message(s).  Mushishi, an anime experience unlike any other, prides itself on omitting a central philosophical thrust, instead opting for natural ambience and a peaceful, \u201csimple\u201d atmosphere.  It abstains from traversing the \u201ccommon\u201d ground that others have laid before it, electing to carve its own path through the deep, unexplored areas of the human consciousness.\\n\\n\r\nDoes this exploration impart any functional knowledge to the viewer, or simulate an experience that may resemble our everyday reality?  No, not really.  The immersive atmosphere is as cryptic as it is profligate waste.  Look no further then episode seven, \u201cRaindrops and Rainbows,\u201d to discover why the grand artwork is a constant reminder of unfulfilled potential.  Koro, a man obsessed with chasing the elusive Kouda rainbow that enthralled his father, embarked on a five year unpaid sabbatical to capture the mystical essence that represents his unrealized dream.  Upon achieving his goal \u2014 capturing the rainbow, that is \u2014 Koro comes to the realization that the \u201crainbow\u201d (i.e. his dream) had consumed him to the point of becoming disassociated with reality, obscuring his gaze from what he should be focused on (i.e. building the bridge).  Yet this epiphany occurred with diminutive resistance, forcing the viewer to wonder why Koro did not exhibit profound anguish, by having his dream extinguished.  But given the episodic framework, the viewer is dragged into the next \u201cstory\u201d without proper closure.\\n\\n\r\nBut as mentioned earlier, Mushishi was not designed to emulate the conventional framework of its predecessors, as it aspired to be a meditative experience through its employment of natural sounds, vivacious color schemes, and the use of the \u2014 seemingly \u2014 innocuous Mushi (creatures that are neither good nor bad, but simply exist for the sake of their own subsistence).  And while the Mushi alter the trajectory of the people it comes into contact with in vastly different ways, it becomes clear that a formulaic routine becomes the standard for the bulk of the entire series.  The routine being, as follows:\\n\\n\r\n1)  \u201cHmmm\u2026.This looks like a nice village, think I\u2019ll take a look.\u201d \u2014 Ginko\\n\r\n2)  Ginko discovers that a random citizen, or an entire village is plagued by a Mushi-related epidemic.\\n\r\n3)  \u201cI\u2019m a Mushi Master (Mushishi), and I have a method to resolve this issue, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s going to work.  That being said, let\u2019s give it a try anyway.\u201d \u2014 Ginko\\n\r\n4)  Beautiful artwork is used to awe and mesmerize the viewer, while, at the same time, divert the attention away from the glaring defects in the story.\\n\r\n5)  By the end of the episode, the Mushi-related issue has resolved itself in a life altering manner, sometimes for the worse, sometimes for the better.\\n\\n\r\nA handful of episodes, however, depart from this convention, one of which being Episode 12, \u201cOne-eyed Fish.\u201d  Regarded by numerous fans as the quintessential moment in the series, \u201cOne-eyed Fish\u201d delves into the cryptic past of Ginko\u2019s upbringing (as we discover from this episode, his real name is Yoki).  Acknowledging the diametrically opposed \u201cmother\u2019s\u201d in Ginko\u2019s life is crucial to comprehending the value of an adequate preceptor.  Ginko\u2019s biological mother \u2014 an example of a \u201cgood intentioned, bad outcome\u201d leader \u2014 commands her son to disregard the eerie Mushi, due to them being \u201cillusions.\u201d  Her subterfuge \u201cprotects\u201d Yoki\u2019s innocence, in exchange for his capacity to embrace the world for how it really exist, placing him at a disadvantage in his forward momentum as an enlightened person.  Nui, on the other hand, lives a rugged life because of her unfortunate circumstances; therefore, her callous nature emanates directly toward Ginko in the most unexpected manner.  It\u2019s tough \u201clove,\u201d but it hardens Ginko\u2019s resolve and instills a healthy dose of curiosity in his future endeavors.  Be that as it may, it\u2019s still flawed \u201clove,\u201d as Nui\u2019s advice is just as hollow as her missing eye.  A veritable buffet of trite psychobabble and misplaced grandeur if there ever was one.  The concluding scene where Nui\u2019s body vanished to the \u201cspirit\u201d world was visually brilliant, but failed to offer a tangible message to the viewer.  \\n\\n\r\nGinko, after the incident, surmises that \u201cthe hole of my left, even in the sunlight, was black as if it was seeped in darkness.  And it attracted weird things [Mushi].  If it continues to do that, misfortune is sure to follow.  That\u2019s the feeling I get.\u201d  The words \u201cmisfortune\u201d and \u201cfeeling\u201d are particularly important to understand why this final thought by Ginko is antithetical to the views expressed earlier on.  Remember, the Mushi is purported to be neither good nor bad, but \u201cmisfortune\u201d signifies \u201cbad luck;\u201d therefore, making his earlier quote, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.  Nor is it the Mushi.  You were both just trying to live,\u201d seem contradictory.  The word \u201cfeeling\u201d pertains to the fashion in which Ginko solves the majority of the Mushi-related problems, as it seems like he \u2014 conveniently \u2014 pulls solutions out of his \u201cback pocket\u201d just in the nick of time (with his gut instinct).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters \u2014 or should I say, the character (as Ginko is the only constant in this episodic adventure) \u2014 is never fleshed out thoroughly, and given the structure of the divorced narrative, the world-building is inextricably self-limited.  In addition, Ginko\u2019s aloof personality creates a distance between himself and the viewer, hampering the prospect of allowing the audience to empathize with the show\u2019s central protagonist.  The overall static nature of Ginko\u2019s character, dampened the prospect of having him evolve throughout the series.  Giving no further insights into his \u201ctrue self,\u201d besides the superficial qualities that he presented within the very first episode.  There\u2019s a reason why the viewer can watch Mushishi in any order they prefer (not the typical chronological order), because Ginko\u2019s development is non-existent.\\n\\n\r\nOne could argue that the aimless, repetitious plot harkens to the purposeless reality of our existence, and how we must coexist with nature and the \u201cspiritual\u201d beings around us to maintain a \u201cpeaceful\u201d balance.  If we accept this reasoning, we must acknowledge that much of the series is superfluous repetition, serving to admonish the viewer for their own inattentiveness to the world around them.  This concentrated effort pigeonholed the writers into a proverbial corner \u2014 perhaps by choice, to obviate their narrative and character development responsibilities. \\n\\n\r\nTo Mushishi\u2019s credit, there are tiny nuggets of truth cleverly sprinkled in for the viewer to unearth for their own edification; however, this stealthy nuance resembles the \u201cdivine\u201d words of a fortune cookie.  A comparison that feels apropos, considering the overall futility of the fortune cookie itself.  While considered a delightful treat at the end of a meal, its nutritional value is next to nothing (same goes for Mushishi\u2019s value), but its delectable sweetness and marvelous aesthetic bewilder the masses into thinking the treat is the highlight of the meal.  In spite of this mass delusion, it should be recognized that desserts (like Mushishi) are not only inessential, but detract from the \u201cmeat and potatoes\u201d (quality anime) that offer meaningful insights on the human condition.  Indulge in the \u201csweet treat\u201d that is Mushishi if you will, but understand that it will rot the brain with its dearth components; ultimately, leaving the viewer unsatisfied when they attain the requisite knowledge to strip away the intellectual facade that Mushishi employed to feign sophistication.",

            "content": "It\u2019s very nice that Mushishi had showed a great way of enjoying such scenery, environment, and culture of each passing scene as you might find yourself exploring its wonders and deeper meaning of it, which the series proves when you\u2019re into this world. Starting with its bunch of supernatural and mystery that engulfs the whole series, it never crossed to my mind that it is dull, boring, typical, and all used up theme just like the others, thus, it has shown such different mixture of drama, tension, and unusual phenomenon that will surely be a factor why this show is worthy to be watched\r\nNow thatyou\u2019re getting into the world of this show, expect some unusual sights that are being focused and centered all throughout the series. This is where there are such unexpected scenes to be seen and felt which will give a marvelous reaction to the viewers. In its beginning, it is quite enticing to find out what is hidden behind all of this creatures and how this creatures affects the movement of the show.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the protagonist, a wanderer who seems fond with these kinds of things will bring the show to the extent that his purpose is not only seeing the creature itself but also to find out what drags their existence in the human world. This is where the mystery and solving out problems pops out that became truly entertaining, as they come up a variety of ideas in every episode, which they\u2019re trying to show its different presence of drama, tension, and the unusual parts that keeps you wondering about. \\n\\n\r\nMushishi isn\u2019t only just a story based series that tackles about the unknown spectacles but it is also great in terms of describing a refreshing outlook for its viewers to enjoy. Honestly, all I can say to the series is that it\u2019s great, complete, and bizarre in showing such wonderful art & designs that makes me be amazed into it. Using such sketchy, brilliant, and light colors really affects the view into the show, as it sometimes gives a deeper meaning and interpretation for the viewers to look on, which I myself am also amazed on how these things turns out. Overall, these kinds of designs and themes that putted into the show truly match to the story, environment, and its surroundings as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the designs, the sounds will never been left behind as this element also gave a plus factor to the show. It\u2019s just like the classical sounds where old instruments are being played. OP and ED theme is played with such soothing sounds, while the BG effects have the same view just like the OP and ED as both of them gives a strange feeling into the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to impress into these 26 episode series is that why the protagonist isn\u2019t boring to watch. Mainly because the reason behind it is just merely simple, while appearing with all these 26 episodes the characteristic of this man is just unexpectedly many where he can be serious at some times while making such a fuss one after another. Even though this protagonist faces many trials, he is ready to face it without any doubts, which he became a guy with an attitude not to be easily forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nGinko, the name of the protagonist, is seems simple enough just like an ordinary wanderer but with his kind of different expertise he instantly became different from the others. What I like to this guy is that he thinks sharp, reasonable, and quick at some times but when pressure comes from his back, he sometimes became reckless. Sometimes there are twisted thoughts comes from my mind just because of his acts and thought about the flow of the show, so in every episode I\u2019ve thought that this character wouldn\u2019t be that great without his genius and well reasoning.\\n\\n\r\nWhy watch Mushishi? Because when you\u2019re really fond of sightseeing and exploring such unknown phenomenon or maybe such other things, this is truly one of a kind show that have shown all its aspects in their matched and beautiful outlook. Overall, trying to find a different genre which shows a pleasant and peaceful pacing? Why not try this and be amazed to it.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nMushi-Shi is a a very unique series about microscopic mystical creatures called the \"Mushi\" and a man named Ginko that goes around studying them and helping people with Mushi related problems. Mushi-Shi tries very hard to be an artistic and sophisticated series and many hail it as a masterpiece. Whether or not it meets that criteria in your book of course depends on your answer to that eternal question of aesthetics, \"What is Art?\".\r\nPlot: 7/10\r\nThe Mushi are said to be much simpler than bacteria or even viruses, but have intelligence and are sometimes able to take human form. In the first episode, a woman isasked to become a mushi herself at the behest of several mushi. The mushi often grant people magical powers, but more often than not act as a serious detriment and are technically parasites. Ginko is quick to explain though that the mushi aren't actually evil or malevolent. They are simply trying to survive. The Mushi exist between the worlds of the living and the dead and have magical properties. On the surface, the Mushi share many traits with the mediclorians from the Star Wars prequels. Interestingly enough, the Mushi-Shi manga was first published in 1999 only a few months after the release of The Phantom Menace, where mediclorians are first discussed. The story structure is purely episodic with Ginko treating Mushi problems. At times, it almost takes on the atmosphere of a medical drama , like a very metaphysical  House episode directed by David Lynch. Sometimes Mushi-Shi lightly touches on societal issues like family structure, loyalty, and child abandonment. However, Mushi-Shi prefers to raise questions rather than answer them. My first impression of Mushi-Shi was that the mediclorians from Star Wars had somehow invaded an Anton Chekhov short story. This actually isn't that far off in terms of its writing style, by which I mean a completely neutral author voice combined with an almost non-existent plot that basically just flows freely to create a \"daily life\" feel with everyday characters...only with magic bacteria! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDue to the episodic nature of the show, the only character with development is Ginko. Ginko is by the way one of the oldest plant species in existence, and the character studies what are supposedly the oldest organisms. Now that the pun has been explained, lets talk about our man. Ginko is calm, calculating, and never seems frightened or shocked by anything that happens. He is an ideal doctor and someone that can work under any kind of pressure. Ginko is very laid back and displays no signs of anger, excitement, hatred, or joy. He is just very mellow all the time. He chain smokes in every episode and I don't think its tobacco. Of course, If I was the equivalent of an ER surgeon/ exorcist, I would probably go through life high as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is Mushi-Shi is absolutely gorgeous and is probably the highlight of the entire series. Every scene is this anime is beautiful. Sometimes it is haunting and even mildly disturbing, but most often it is serene beauty that we view in Mushi-Shi\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits the mood of the series quite well and has an opening that is quite catchy (although very hipster indy pop). This is a very hipster series though, so honestly did you expect anything else?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMushi-Shi can at times be gorgeous, thought provoking, and appear like an artistic masterpiece. At other times it can be insufferably slow and feel so pretentious I want to kick the computer screen. Mushi-Shi is not for everyone, but it is a well done series and I think most people will at least get something out of it. I will give Mushi-Shi praise for having no instances of \"moe\" bullshit, fanservice, hyper violence, giant robots, or other anime cliche's. However, does that alone make it a masterpiece? Not really. That isn't to say many people won't love Mushi-Shi. I thought it was good, but it wasn't really my cup of tea. I actually like it when a story has concrete conflict and an observable purpose. I like it when the author puts forward their own opinions, so I can compare and contrast them with my own. Mushi-Shi has a very neutral author voice and is very light on plot and action. This is one reason I compared the mangaka's writing style to that of Anton Chekhov. I am much more of a Dostoevsky and Tolstoy fan personally. I also tend to prefer the films of directors like Hitchcock and Fritz Lang to those like Lynch. This is simply my opinion. If you absolutely adored Eraserhead and Uncle Vanya is your homeboy, I would check out Mushi-Shi.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nI actually didn't love this series the first time I watched it, but it has grown on me a bit. I may not be quite as huge a Mushi fan as so many other critics on  MAL, but it is a series worthy of respect! The art is amazing, the soundtrack is well done, and it tries to go in a radically new direction for modern anime. The main character was interesting, and moments of the show were truly quite spectacular! If you like surreal imagery and can tolerate a slow pace, check this one out.",

            "content": "Mushishi is a unique show in many ways. It\u2019s rather weird and bizarre but is also very intriguing and definitely grabs your interest. This show was much different from what I expected it to be (in a good way) and for many episodes I had my eyes glued to the screen, watching intensely. Mushishi has a calm, mellow, and soothing, but also very deep and powerful feel to it.\r\n---STORY---\r\nI think the story is one of the strongest points in this anime. What makes Mushishi different from most anime is that it does not focus on a single overarching story and instead each episode has itsown short story with a new plot and characters (aside from Ginko who is in every episode) And this actually works quite well as each story is beautifully well told with many powerful moments that sometimes leave you speechless. You may find a couple of episodes to be a little boring but the vast majority of them are very well written stories that pace themselves very nicely. If I were to describe the plot of the show as a whole, I would say it\u2019s about Ginko traveling from place to place in feudal Japan dealing with different cases that deal with mushi. Which brings us to the next great point of this show. The Mushi.\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I begin with the mushi? They are one of the most unique concepts I\u2019ve come across. I\u2019ve seen many things similar to demons and spirits in shows before but nothing quite like the mushi. Just trying to explain what they are can be a bit of a challenge. If you want the most accurate description of what they are then read the synopsis of this show. The mushi and the effects they have on people and the world are the main focus of each episode and there are many different types of mushi that take on different forms and act in different ways. There are some that reside in your pillow and make your dreams reality and there are those that slip into your brain through your ear and feast off of your memories until you can no longer remember anything. Some mushi are harmless and others are dangerous. And though many of the mushi featured in the show do harm, I absolutely love the way they are portrayed. Regardless of what they may do, there are no good or evil mushi. They\u2019re just creatures trying to survive.\\n\\n\r\nNormally when watching shows or movies we see the characters go through many struggles throughout the story. But no matter how bad or hopeless it gets, we know that things will almost always end well. And that's a good thing of course. I mean everybody likes to see the protagonist come out on top. However in Mushishi this is not always the case. And because the show is episodic, they can get away with this. Some episodes end well and some don\u2019t. Many of the mushi act similar to diseases. And like diseases, sometimes there\u2019s simply nothing you can do. You can treat it but you can\u2019t cure it. This is great because it keeps the show unpredictable and helps give it a good sense of realism as well as provide us with some deep and rather sad endings. And every episode I found myself always wondering \u201cI wonder how this is going to end up. Will it end well for the characters or not?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe only real negative thing I think I can say about the story is that it does get a little repetitive. While the individual stories themselves are very different, each episode follows the same general formula.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a problem.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s mushi related.\\n\r\nGinko shows up.\\n\r\nThe problem is explained.\\n\r\nGinko attempts to solve the problem.\\n\\n\r\nRepetitiveness aside, the story is still spectacular and each episode is great and worth watching.\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTERS---\\n\r\nGinko is the main protagonist of this series and is a mushi-shi (A person who studies mushi) He\u2019s a calm, relaxed individual who is constantly travelling not just to solve cases involving mushi but also because he himself attracts mushi, thus he cannot stay in one place for too long or he will attract dangerous mushi to the area. His character is rather simple but I still found him very easy to like and he gets an interesting backstory about halfway thorough the show.\\n\\n\r\nGinko is the only character that remains throughout the show. And aside from him, each episode deals with different characters. Despite this, the characters of each episode are quite good and easy to connect with and feel for, despite the short amount of time they each get in the show.\\n\\n\r\n---SOUND & ART---\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, it\u2019s fantastic! The intro is amazing and does a great job of setting the mood. It\u2019s also nice to hear an English intro every now and then. Especially one sang by a native English speaker. The outro changes every episode and all 26 of them are beautiful instrumentals and I sat through the credits every time just to listen to them. The art style is also great and really shows in the way they animate the mushi and the background. The only downside is that the characters themselves don't look very detailed and most of the side characters look very much alike and you might find yourself thinking \"Wait a minute. Isn't that the guy from the last episode?\"\\n\\n\r\nDub or Sub?\\n\r\nThe dub for Mushishi is fairly descent. Ginko is played by Travis Willingham, who some of you may recognize as the voice of Roy Mustang. I had my doubts at first but now I can say that he was an excellent choice for Ginko. As for all the side characters, they\u2019re mostly hit or miss. Some of them sound bad while others sound quite good. The good news is that for the bad voices you\u2019ll only have to put up with them for one episode. The Mushishi dub is good but I would never recommend it over the sub. The voice acting in the original was truly spectacular and maybe its just me but when I watch an anime that takes place in feudal Japan, back when Japanese was pretty much the only language spoken, I feel that watching the Japanese version really helps give it that feeling of authenticity. So I will highly recommend the sub for this show. But this is just my opinion so watch whichever version you like :)\\n\\n\r\n---VERDICT---\\n\r\nMushishi is not for everyone. If you\u2019re looking for an anime dripping with action then you\u2019ll probably find this show very boring. Nonetheless, this show is still fantastic and I was very impressed with this anime. And if this show sounds even remotely interesting to you then I definitely suggest you put this show in your watching or at least in your plan to watch under high priority.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n",

            "content": "Mushishi is the most simplistic yet beautiful series that I had the pleasure to experience until now and is one of the examples that shows the incredible variety that anime has.  \r\nWell then, ladies and gentlemen I welcome you to my Mushishi review. I hope you enjoy it.\r\nNow, the story of Mushishi follows our protagonist, Ginko, as he travels around the world working as a Mushi-shi. So, instead of having an over-arching story, this show chooses to have a more episodic nature. This way of telling the story has its own pluses and minuses. For one hand, as every episode has a different storythe show never drags on, you can watch the show in any given order and you don\u00b4t need to pay attention to every little detail fearing that it might be really important to the overall plot, but in the other hand, it has some consequences in the characters, but I will cover that matter later on the review.\\n\r\nSo, as I said, every episode has its own story, usually involving Ginko trying to deal with a Mushi, the beings that the mushi-shis study, which in each episode create some kind of conflict. As such every episode has an interesting story, every one of them being fascinating from the beginning\\n\r\nto the end, and is very interesting to watch what the mushi from each episode can do. The only problem with the story is that if you are looking for something \"exciting\" or \"cheerful\" then you\u00b4ll have to watch something else, as the nature of this show is, most of the time, rather depressing and it doesn\u00b4t really have \"cheerful moments\". But if you can look past that, sit back, relax and go with the flow of the series, you will most likely be pleased with the story of every episode, because none of them is by any means predictable, so you never know if by the end of the episode you will have a happy ending or a sad one, which keeps you interested in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this show can be described in one word: beautiful. \\n\r\nThe animation for this show is, not only fluid and consistent, it is a pleasure for the eyes, the colours used in this series, especially when a Mushi is on the scene, makes it one of the most astonishing animation out there, and when you think that this anime is from 2005, I can only applaud Yuuki Nobuteru for his superb work in this series. The backgrounds in this series are also very well done having precious landscapes to look. The weak part of this animation, however, is in the character design, because, there are a lot of characters in this series that look alike, specially kids, and while it is understandable that given the episodic nature of the show, they have to introduce new characters every episode and some character designs will end up repeating themselves, it is still a little annoying to watch a character that looks almost exactly like that character from the past episode, however this is only a minor problem. The other problem is that when a character is at a certain distance his face disappears, which can be strange to look at. But, overall, solid and beautiful animation and great backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nThis show\u00b4s music composer is Toshio Masuda, and he did an excellent job composing the soundtrack for the series, the soundtrack matches the nature of the series completely, is soothing, calm, relaxing and I love it. And speaking about relaxing the opening for this series, \"The Sore Feet Song\" by Ally Kerr fits the show as much as the soundtrack, is nothing really special, and is not something \"unskippable\" but it\u00b4s nice to listen to it in some episodes. The endings for this series are actually part of the soundtrack so they are really nothing very special. The voice acting is pretty solid and, while I have no complains about it, it\u00b4s nothing from another world and the only voice that really stands out is Ginko\u00b4s.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series, as I said before, suffer from its episodic nature, because the characters in this series usually appear in one episode and they are gone the next one, the only exception being Adashino-sensei, a doctor and collector of paranormal items, who appears in three different episodes. But because the characters appear for one episode you really never get to like them much because of the lack of screen time. In the end, the only character that you end up getting attached to is Ginko, as he is the only character that appears in every chapter of this series, being him the protagonist and everything, not that I\u00b4m complaining Ginko is a great character and while he is usually laid back he is a complete professional in his work. But besides him while some of the characters in this series are pretty good you just don\u00b4t have enough time to start liking them.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this is a show that I enjoyed because it was very relaxing and the stories in every episode were unpredictable and interesting, but it\u00b4s something that you need to watch expecting that it won\u00b4t be \"cheerful\" or \"exciting\", but rather depressing even if an episode has a happy ending. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Mushishi is the perfect show to watch with a cup of the hot beverage that you prefer and relax and you will probably not get disappointed with the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now I bid you farewell and I hope that this review has been helpful and that you have enjoyed reading this review as much as I enjoyed writing it.\\n\r\nWait, is that what what I think it is? A second season? Mushishi Zoku Shou? Well, better late than never I guess, time to watch it. Adi\u00f3s, to you all.",

            "content": "Story - The anime has a rather simple story that is Ginko a mushi-shi travels to various parts helping people who have problems with creatures called mushi which are somewhat of a combination of plant/nature/animal. Each episode is a different story about Ginko helping people and there is no real ongoing plot. The main problem I had with the story is that they get very repetitive and about half way through the anime I had to take a break because I felt I was just rewatching the same episodes over again. A large portion of the episodes are about a woman and a man andone of them has disease or problem and tries to tie in a love into the problem which gets tiring after a while. This being said I did think the last five to six episodes were good. If you can stand repetitive plot lines then this should not bother you much.\\n\\n\r\nArt &ndash; There are two parts to the art here. First is the nature and drawings of the mushi. This was well done and fit into the series and was one of the better parts as well. The major flaw in the art style is that the minor characters look all very similar I honestly could not tell much difference between them. I though that they just got lazy, and only changed the hair style of the characters to make distinctions between the minor characters. All in all the art style was alright.\\n\\n\r\nSound &ndash; There was nothing really outstanding about the sound that comes to mind. There were no real problems with the sound either. Over all the sound was pretty good and there is not much to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter &ndash; As I have said before I found it hard to distinguish the characters from each other. As for the character of the anime I did enjoy the fact that it was willing to take a different view for anime. The problem was that they could not make it different enough for me to get too into the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment &ndash; If you could not figure it out yet I did not enjoy this anime. One of the main reasons for this was the fact that all the comments had said it was great or amazing and I was sadly disappointed. Another main reason was that I felt the lack of the anime making you want to see the next episode. Mushi-shi did not present much as to one wandering what will be next as most of the episodes ended similarly. I will say that if you are looking for something different and have not seen any anime about the relationship between people and nature that you would enjoy this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall &ndash; Overall I have seen better anime but I have also seen worse anime. I gave Mushi-shi a six only because of the lack of enjoyment and I felt I was suffering through watching it. I did how ever enjoy several of the last episodes as it attempted to recapture my interest. My last words if you are looking for something different in anime this might be worth checking out. \\n",

            "content": "If there's one thing you can say about this show, it's certainly unique. But this show is one of those ones that are kind of hard to rate, because it's really not for everybody. I personally enjoyed it but I could very easily see someone else getting bored out of their mind by it. Might as well get started then.\r\nWhen you watch this show, the most obvious thing that will pop out is the atmosphere itself. Taking place in *gasp* Japan in... I don't know shit about Japan's time periods but either way it's not modern. It takes place in a time where the resident'sinteractions with nature are more you know, relevant. A time where people didn't have big modern cities or advanced medicine or anything like that. This is a time where people are forced to directly live off of and be at the mercy of nature to survive. In many ways, this makes the setting and time period practically perfect. As our protagonist, Ginko, wanders around the countryside we see a good variety of settings, all of which can be almost equally beautiful. Quite frankly, the art and the atmosphere are pretty much the best I've seen in any anime I have ever watched. It's great, it really is, especially when it comes to the designs of the mushi.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, even though this show focuses heavily on nature and the spiritual sides of things (well, I guess I wouldn't exactly call Mushi spirits but that's not important right now) some of the events, concepts, and ideas presented in the show are still very much relevant to us today. This show is completely episodic, but some of the individual episodes actually end up covering some pretty heavy topics. The show can really make you think some times, which is another thing that I like about it.\\n\\n\r\nStill, that's not to say the show isn't without its faults. Whether these issues are actually a big deal to you is going to make all the difference between whether you enjoy the show or not. If those issues don't bother you, this show is probably going to be one of the absolute greatest shows you'll ever watch. If they are problematic, than this show might end up being a bit boring to you. In which case, I suggest you might want to just watch a few episodes and then drop it (you can basically watch the episodes in any order by the way. I personally think episode 21 is a really nice one by the way.) \\n\\n\r\nSo what are those issues? Well, one of them is simply the lay out of the show. Ginko is a wanderer, going from place to place... and he can't stay in one place for long. This is central to his character, and fortunately it's explained pretty decently why he's actually like this... as opposed to \"wanderers will be wanderers. Loners will be loners.\" Like you might see some shows say xP What does this translate to? Well, it's a completely episodic anime, with no overbearing plot to any of it. It's literally just the guy going from place to place trying to help people that have problems pertaining to mushi. In a similar fashion to crime shows like CSI or whatever, it might end up feeling a bit repetitive after a while. There are plenty of recurring themes, and it doesn't help that some of the side characters look ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME. The show can be monotonous at times, so if you don't like shows that follow this sort of format in general, you might not like it too much. I personally wouldn't call this a flaw as much as it's simply a format that some would find appealing and some wouldn't. Though I will admit it would've been nice if the show at least attempted to have some sort of plot that brought the episodes together.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other thing I think is worth mentioning is the characters. The thing is, there's really only one character worth mentioning, and that's Ginko. Everybody else is pretty much gone after they're episode is over. So I guess I'll talk about Ginko first. As a protagonist, Ginko seems like a good fit for the show. He's designed in a way that makes him more modern looking than anyone else in the show. Apparently they originally intended the show to be more modern... and changed that... but kept Ginko's design. However I'm not entirely sure about the source on that so if I'm wrong don't lynch me. Either way, he's actually a surprisingly bad ass character. I am a person who likes character development, so it's a bit of a disappointment that Ginko didn't get more of it. His backstory is actually pretty interesting in a way but it basically only answers the most basic questions you have about the character. Still I can say that I enjoy his character.\\n\\n\r\nEvery other character on the other hand only gets an episode of development so it's challenging at times to get invested in them. But for what they got in the time frame, some of their stories can actually hit surprisingly hard. Not as hard as they would if we got to know them better instead of just one 20 minute episode but still heavy nonetheless. The characters are a lot more realistic and toned down then you would expect from an anime. This is a positive thing to me especially if you want to take a break from... well, almost every anime ever. Still, this could be a good or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. One of the main reasons this show can feel so repetitious is because the side characters aren't really all that distinguished from one another. They're all unique in some way, but because they're *mostly* just pretty normal people reacting to abnormal situations they don't really distinguish themselves that much. \\n\\n\r\nThis is made even worse because of the way they're drawn. This is the only reason I give the art a 9 instead of a 10, the side characters all look way too similar. In most anime you'll see different hair colors (many of which won't be realistic at all), different hairstyles (many of which won't be realistic AT ALL), different clothing (except for you know, most high school animes) etc. This show really highlights why somewhat unrealistic but varied characters designs are actually a good thing a good portion of the time. Yes, they all look like actual Japanese people in that time period. But seriously, some of those character designs look almost exactly the same. You'll see a decent amount of young couples throughout this series, and it's almost impossible to tell them apart design wise some times other than say, the hair length of the girl. The characters are just that similar looking. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, that's the show. I personally enjoyed it, but this is one of those shows that are kind of hard to judge. It's just the kind of show that will be completely amazing to some viewers and a complete snooze-fest for others. It's a nice slow paced atmospheric anime, and it also has one of the most relaxing theme songs I've ever heard. So if you don't have a tolerance for a slow pace or a little repetitiveness then this might not be for you. You might want to just watch the first few episodes, a couple of other random episodes and then drop it. Or you could watch the whole thing. The show's not for everyone, but for anybody who thinks they have the patience to watch a sort of laid back show like this then give it a try. It's an interesting show, it really is.",

            "content": "Mushishi was painful. I have never fancied that a day will come when I will drop a show, but alas, this day came. Mushishi is my first dropped show, and for a solid reason.\r\nFirst off, the story is non-existent. The characters have no motivation, and I have no idea where the show is supposed to go, even after watching 14 episodes of it. Hell, even the most generic shounen characters have some goal to pursue, be it to save the world, or to find something. The characters in Mushishi lack this precious substance.\r\nSecond, the art and animation weren't anything special. Before trying to watch Mushishi,I've heard people say that it has magnificent art and animation - my foot! I watched HunterxHunter a week ago, and it had a way better animation for its 148 episodes than this wreck, Mushishi. In addition, half of the characters in Mushishi looked the same, and there were moments when I didn't realize I was seeing a totally different character from the one I had seen in the previous episode (or even scene).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was boring at best. Most of the OST lacked lyrics, which is a disadvantage to me. The Opening, which was the only piece with lyrics, which was dull and almost made me fall asleep. I can say nothing about the VAs, neither good or bad - they didn't need to do a spectacular job whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the worst aspect of Mushishi. As I already mentioned in the beginning, they all lacked motivations and goals, and wandered aimlessly throughout the story. Needless to say, no character managed to interest me, because of their monotonous behaviour - yes, almost all characters had the same personalities.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy Mushishi and I'm not planning to ever finish it. And, please, don't tell me that it gets better in the later episodes - a good show is good from the beginning to the end.\\n\\n\r\nDisappointed. Might watch To Love Ru instead - it may provide me with something substantial, unlike Mushishi.",

The Mushi Master visits those infected with 'Mushi' (or spirits if you will) and he has to figure out how to cure them. It's an exciting concept and I wish the series had a cast of reoccuring characters rather than justone main character.

            "content": "One of the most beautiful anime ever made, Mushishi stands mountains above every other show made in the past 7 years, this show is probably in the top five of the best anime ever made. In fact it might even be the best anime ever made. So why did I give this show a perfect 10 on everything? Because it really is that good.\r\nStory: There is no over-reaching story, rather this show is episodic, some may be upset about the fact the show is in this format, but that is what makes this show so special. The story generally is about a mysterious man (Ginko)who travels all over Japan and seeks to help people who have been affected by a strange parasite-like substance known as Mushi. The mushi are what really make this show interesting, because every episode they find different ways to continuing making life hell for the person in question. Anyway it is really really complex to explain a typical episode, generally Ginko meets somebody and then they will usually explain the problem and then most often then not Ginko will fix the problem. For those wondering if there is an episode dealing with Ginko himself, there is and it's about half-way through the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Wow, I honestly say this show is on a whole other platitude in terms of how beautiful the Art is. It is almost like you are watching a moving painting. I could go on and on but really better you see it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music is beautiful, although the show is very quiet, it heightens your senses and you can generally detect a lot of sounds if you listen closely. The foley sounds are really well done and I should mention the music, which was composed by the guy who did the music to Naruto, which also has a phenomenal score. But Toshio Masuda's music really comes to life here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There really is only one main character but Ginko himself, is what makes the show. Though he appears in every episode he tends to take himself out and let the protagonist of said episode tell his/her problem. As far as Ginko goes he is a very original character and he is not one that is made up on cliches. For instance if you look closely at the show you will notice he wears modern clothing while everyone else is in Traditional japanese dress; this question was posed Hiroshi Nagahama at Anime Expo 2007 and even he could not come up with an answer of why Ginko wears more modern clothing. Ginko's physical characteristics such as his white hair, green eyes and air of mystery make him one of the most intriguing original characters to grace the anime screen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is an opinion of how much I liked the show. I really, really enjoy the show and I'm still about 8 episodes away from finishing it, but yes this is probably in the top 10 anime of all time. However, word of caution, if you are someone who doesn't enjoy the slow pace of the show this could be an aggravating show to watch. Nonetheless give it 3 or 4 episodes and I think you'll fall in love with it.",

            "content": "In the past science was still unknown, thus whenever an incomprehensible phenomenon happened, humanity attributed these incidents to supernatural occurrences. In the west gods were the main explanation, whereas in the east, particularly in Japan, such events were mainly tied to spirits and demons. There are quite a few anime that present such themes as Mononoke or Natsume Yuujinchou, yet in the case of Mushishi, it presents these topics through \"creatures\" called \"mushi\". Mushishi is a fantastic anime that displays these themes wonderfully trough a compelling narrative and presentation of the story, as well as wonderful character presentation.\r\n~Story~\r\nMushishi follows the main protagonist Ginko, a mushi-shior mushi researcher, who travels from one place to other in order to investigate the mushi. These are considered to be the most basic life forms of the world, including to be tied to the explanation or meaning of life itself; yet almost no information exists of these, as most people are unable to see them. Nevertheless, some people are aware of their existence, making the mushi-shi's job to investigate easier, as these may harm humanity as well; however, Mushishi's intention is to transmit the fact that mushi are neutral beings. It incorporates them as natural things that coexist with other life forms, different from other mediums where usually it is the root of \"evil\" as it disadvantages humanity, and thus needs to be exterminated.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is of episodic nature, yet does an outstanding job when it comes to narrating and presenting the story. The mystery buildup of each event is well done, by carefully introducing the viewer the circumstance of the village/people affected without revealing more than necessary to later unravel how everything happened and is solved. These incidents are varied, yet very human and realistic, at times being even a bit disturbing. \\n\\n\r\nAnother positive aspect of Mushishi's episodic nature is the fact that each episode gives an insight on what mushi are, their variety, behaviour and habitat, as well as shaping the world and people in that era; besides, mushi seem to have a foundation in both science and fables, in which viewers may recognize some phenomenons in real world where the author decided to explain these through. As the show progresses, viewers may begin to appreciate it even more, as each situation is always different and leaves the audience wondering what is to be expected next.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nGinko is certainly is one of the most interesting characters in the anime scene. He is of benevolent nature, yet mixed with common sense and his own knowledge of the mushi, which consequently in some cases he may come over as a harsh individual. This is due to his conceptions and beliefs of life itself, which naturally includes mushi as well; in his eyes every type of life form is equal and should be respected. Some background story to Ginko is provided, yet is scarce, which leaves the viewer longing for more, but it doesn't influence the story in any negative way.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no big cast of characters in Mushishi; in fact, Ginko is the only character that is present in every single episode.This doesn't mean that the supporting cast is dull and underdeveloped; these are very human and outstandingly well presented; in fact, you really begin to care and relate to the characters throughout the episodes, because of their struggle, the human decisions and hardships they have to endure. Other thing to note is that cast are not stereotypical in any way, they're simply persons with problems. There are the interactions of Ginko with the villagers, which could be described as a scientist who comes to explain to people who posses no knowledge on the subject, which is quite intriguing to see.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of Mushishi is well done, character's movement are realistic and well executed, as well as the scenery such as trees, clouds, rain and snow. The backgrounds are nothing outstanding, yet varied, well displayed and detailed, matching correctly with the atmosphere it is trying to convey. Character designs are nevertheless a minor drawback, as most are nearly indistinguishable from each other, yet fulfill their purpose. Nevertheless, it also avoids the issue of judging the characters by their appearance, enhancing the general atmosphere of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors performed their role well, though nothing remarkable.The soundtrack used is simple, yet matched perfectly with the narrative and presentation of it, negating usage of any type of soundtrack when needed; rustling of leaves, conversations, which added to the general atmosphere it was trying to convey, some of them being very memorable. There is however a certain lack in variety of these, consequently hindering the viewer from fully enjoying the show.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mushishi was a wonderful anime; it is an experience everyone should have had, it is a journey into the world of the mushi, based on science and fables at the same time. In addition to the fantastic narrative and execution of it, characters, soundtracks and animation used matched perfectly with the anime. I'd love to have seen more background story on the main protagonist, yet was easily overlookable. This anime is a must watch for anyone interested in the supernatural exploration, sharing similarities with Natsume Yuujinchou, yet more intricate. It is a series best watched when not marathoned.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Coexistence is a difficult concept for humanity to grasp. All too often humans choose the path of domination rather than understanding and harmony, often to their own detriment. We fear the unknown. We reject the unusual. We hide our eyes from life's harder truths. Mushishi delves into these concepts as we follow the protagonist, Ginko, on his unending journey through a strange and beautiful world. In this world, their exist living creature that are neither flora nor fauna. These creature are made of pure life energy and are called mushi. In this world, mushi exist everywhere, but only a select few can see them. Ginkopossesses that ability, and works as a mushi master. Mushi masters travel the world studying these creatures and helping any humans that are negatively impacted by them. Mushi are for the most part benign and harmless, but sometimes in their quest to live and reproduce, humans come to harm. And that is where the story of Mushishi begins.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is almost entirely episodic in nature. As I said, Ginko travels from village to village, searching for interesting mushi to study and answering the pleas for help that get mailed to him. Ginko tries to maintain the equilibrium between mushi and people, unlike most mushi masters that prefer extermination. It appears to be set in Feudal Era Japan. There are few reoccurring characters throughout, and you could almost watch the episodes in any order and still understand the bulk of the what's happening. Mushishi is an ideal anime to view if you're short on time because each episode is a satisfying experience in itself even if the time in between viewings is long. \\n\\n\r\nBy far the most impressive thing about this show for me was how invested I became in each new story. Very few episodic anime have made me care so deeply for the new characters that are introduced each time. The stories are all very emotional. You'll find yourself experiencing many highs and lows throughout. The writers succeeded in making the conclusions all very unpredictable. Sometimes you'll cry or yell in anger or maybe just stare in disbelief. I was never got bored or complacent watching this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe stories are all slowly paced, and there isn't much traditional action to be found. Shounen lovers may be put off by the lack of fighting. Romance lovers will be pleased to know that Mushishi has plenty of great love stories.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is absolutely beautiful. The scenery is amazing. No detail was spared as the artists rendered gorgeous setting after gorgeous setting. The character art is all fairly simple and traditional, but it works for the show. I would have liked to see a little more effort put into differentiating the characters from each episode though. Besides for a few select characters, most of the others look fairly similar to each other.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThat intro song! It's amazing how perfectly that captures the feel of the entire series. The rest of the music consists primarily of pleasant instrumentals that compliment each scene very well. I watched the English dub for this show, and I really have to compliment each voice actor. They really captured the emotion of each scene. Native English speakers should definitely give this dub a chance. I think even the most diehard sub fans will be surprised.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, considering you only see the majority of the characters for 20 minutes each, it's amazing how much depth each of them had. You'll often find yourself rooting for a character introduced only minutes before. As for the main character, Ginko, the show does an excellent job of fleshing out his character. Not a lot of time is spent on his backstory, but by the end of the show, you really feel like you know the whole character, through and through. There are no true villains in Mushishi (not even the mushi), just average people trying to make their way in the world. That contributes to the sense of realism this show projects even though it deals with many fantastical elements. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nI'm not one to watch the same anime over twice, but I can definitely see myself going back and watching this. The most important thing for my enjoyment of an anime is the ability to empathize with the characters and the ability to imagine myself in the storyline. I found that this anime really allows me to do that. I'm also a traveler myself. I trek long distance hiking trails, sometimes for weeks. Mushishi captured the spirit of adventure I often feel as I travel, and that probably upped my enjoyment quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really did love every part of this anime. I would recommend it with enthusiasm to anyone that loves strong stories and interesting characters. This is a must-watch.",

            "content": "If there's one thing that I've learned after all my time here on MAL, it's that filthy casuals and critics are one and the same. Both groups are prone to overrating and underrating various programmes and ignoring flaws in their favourite shows whilst discussing them. The sole difference lies in the programmes that these two groups watch... oh, and the fact that it would seem people put more sway into a critic's opinion than a filthy casual's and why wouldn't that be the case? Critics are the ones that know what's good and what's rubbish, right? Not exactly. When you get right down to it,all shows have their strengths and shortcomings and what is good and what's rubbish is ultimately left to the viewer to decide. With all of that said, let's get on with this review. Today, we're looking at Mushishi: one of MAL's most precious critical gems that I don't particularly care much for.\\n\\n\r\nWe all know about Mushishi: it's an episodic supernatural drama about a wandering shaman who does exorcisms. Each episode follows a rather formulaic approach: we have a person who's being plagued by spirits, our shaman comes to the rescue by performing an exorcism, then leaves to wander the earth some more. Argue all you want about semantics but that's the basic plot and formula that the show follows over the course of 26 episodes. Now this approach has a lot that's going for it. I mean, Western programmes pretty much rely on an episodic format so it must do *something* right. Since each episode is a self-contained story, you can (quite literally) watch this show in any order you wish. Even though each episode follows a formulaic approach, what goes down in every episode is something to behold. There's something inexplicably mystifying about the way that the mushi affect the lives of others along with how Ginko resolves the problems that people have because of the mushi.\\n\\n\r\nInexplicable mystification aside, the episodic format lends itself to one problem that all shows of its ilk tend to have: consistency with episode quality. Given that every episode in a particular show is NOT written by the same person, it's only natural that some episodes would be much more entertaining to watch than others. Whilst this problem affects all programmes, this dilemma is especially noticeable in episodic shows. Even if a particular episode in a show with an overarching story is lacklustre, at least it contributes *something* of relevance to the plot. Mediocre episodes in episodic programmes are no better than sour grapes on the vine: finish one and you're left with a bad taste in your mouth. As blasphemous as it may be to say, not every episode of Mushishi is the epitome of perfection.\\n\\n\r\nOn another note, the episodic format also has one other problem: it doesn't give the viewer an impetus to keep watching more episodes beyond whether or not they want to see more of Ginko and his exploits against the mushi. As much as I liked watching Ginko work his magic against the mushi that were plaguing some poor unfortunate soul, it's not the kind of show I would gladly watch again. If you've watched one episode of Mushishi, you've basically watched them all (this statement is especially true in both seasons of Zoku Shou). Obviously, that's not the case but that's what it feels like to me! I don't have any impetus to keep watching more episodes because there's no overarching story gradually progressing nor is there anything remotely entertaining I found whilst watching this show. Sure, I was mystified by what was going on but I wouldn't necessarily conflate that sort of enchantment with any feelings of being entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of characters, Ginko (the wandering shaman) is the only character (of relevance) we're ever exposed to. Yeah, every character we're exposed that ISN'T Ginko is exclusive to that episode alone and that's quite a shame too. There were some characters that I would've loved seeing again but just didn't because of that damned episodic format. As great as Ginko is, it would've been nice to see some familiar faces along the way. Speaking of Ginko, we never really learn much about him aside from a few details surrounding his past and he doesn't really go through much in the way of significant changes over the course of the programme. It's no stretch of the imagination to think that I actually struggled to find a reason to care about Ginko at all that goes beyond the fact that he's cool and he's also voiced by Travis Willingham. Yeah... Mushishi isn't exactly the epitome of characterisation to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of production values, Mushishi has it down-pat to say the least. This was a show produced by Artland and it would seem that they know how to keep the critics pleased, especially given that Artland was one of the studios responsible for bringing us the much-lauded Legend of the Galactic Heroes, the biggest critical darling MAL has to offer. It's safe to say that these guys know what the hell they're doing when it comes down to animating something. Audio-wise is also a similar story, since the OST and dubbing (across both the Japanese and English tracks) are also pretty damn good. Say what you will about Mushishi's story and characters, but I think we can all agree that this was one of the best-produced programmes to ever come out of 2005 as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSo, final thoughts? Mushishi is one of those shows that I can see why people like it in the first place but I just can't see myself getting into it but what do I know? I'm a filthy casual who likes garbage such as Elfen Lied and InuYasha in earnest. Maybe I lack the capacity to understand the true beauty of what's going on in front of me. Then again, you know what they say: different strokes for different folks. If you like Mushishi, that's fine and dandy but it's one of those shows I'm simply not a fan of. Anyway, feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)",

            "content": "I had no idea what to expect going into the show. The description reminded me of the average American episodic TV show where each individual episode is some kind of case or problem and there is an overarching plot to keep the general story moving. I also expected some preaching about environmentalism and the effects of human habitation on the environment and other such morality-bashing. Thinking thus, I jumped in head-first and discovered what I can only express as one of the most beautiful experiences I have had. This show deserves every single grain of praise and more.\r\nThe story is simplistic to the extreme. Ginkois actually never the true protagonist of the story. Despite being a very mysterious and somewhat intriguing character, replacing him each episode with anybody else wouldn't change the anime in any way because the true center of the story are the mysterious, vibrant, various, and occasionally vicious Mushi. The tiny creatures and their various effects on humanity are the central arc of the story. As humans continue to spread their influence, they encounter more and more of these weird creatures and their experiences with these beings is the totality of each episode. Rather than watching a show, the feeling comes across that we are witnessing the birth of folklore which is something I have not seen done often.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative simply flows from the start of the episode to the end, very much like the flow of a metaphorical river, indicative of the stream that is life. It is very real, the temptation to dump on our heads the lessons of environmentalism and the dangers of industrialization and the destruction of life etc etc. Yet this anime never takes that path and simply presents the events as they are. As the Mushi themselves, each episode just... is. Beautiful yet haunting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is outstanding (as is my rating). With an anime as slow and gentle as this, the art also reflects this tone. Characters are rounded, drawn with soft strokes, their hair straight, their clothing coloured softly with no loud colours and Ginko himself an oddity among them as the one who stands out. The environments are beautiful with dense forests painted lush greens, the waters a sparkling grey even rocks painted as unassuming objects with dull, short strokes. The Mushi, being the star of the show, are multicoloured, varied and lively. Each have their own characteristics and are hence drawn to reflect such characteristics. If you're looking for a lovely anime, this should surely be under consideration.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, as is the show, is also gentle with very little percussion or woodwind instruments. Strings and bells are the crux of most of the music driving further the impression that you are watching the birth of folk tales which begin in houses and small gatherings where such gentle instruments would accompany the tales they would narrate. Though they suffice, none of them are memorable and you wouldn't want to listen to them out of context of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nIf it weren't for the characters themselves, this show would have fallen completely apart at the seams which is why it is remarkable how wonderfully relatable and memorable almost every single one of them are. All the people are real and simple characters with their own lives and problems. If they are suffering, we feel for them and want them to get better. We feel their sadness in their times of trouble, their joy in being helped out of their situations and their peace when they continue to live their lives or otherwise. I would have expected Ginko to be the aloof, mysterious, dark but helpful character we see so much, eg Black Jack. But the truth is he is merely another person, helpful, simple, blunt and without many layers to peel. He has only the simplest but sweetest of reasons to continue travelling and he does so with few complaints and has very little interest in his own mysterious past for, as a traveller, he has learned to look ahead and revel in the present and hope for the future.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mushi too are characters in their own right. We are always told that they are merely simple creatures only wishing to survive, who only inflict harm because of their nature, not their intentions. However harmful, ambiguous, or terrifying they may be, they too, like the humans, wish to live on and we are able to empathise with that.\\n\\n\r\nIF my review didn't give you the impressios that I IMMENSELY enjoyed this anime, then again I tell you that I absolutely did and will surely return to any episode of this anime in times when I am in sorrow or doubt to calm myself down or to simply enjoy the beauty of this show again.\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely an anime you need to experience at least once in your life and you will be all the better for it.",

            "content": "Declared one of the best of 2007 by AnimeNewsNetwork, Mushishi is a supernatural drama set in old rural Japan that boasts visuals and storytelling over action and fanservice. Mushi are a group of primiative lifeforms that are neither animal nor plant, and invisible to most people but have lived amongst humans forever -- kinda like poltergeist plankton. Their shapes and sizes can vary from small as an insect to as large as a small pet. The show follows a man named Ginko who is a \"Mushishi\" -- a witch doctor of sorts. One of a small group of people who can see Mushi, he studiesthem and helps people whose lives are being effected by them. Ginko has the added problem of being a person who attracts mushi as well, forcing him to be nomadic to help maintain the balance of life in the areas he's in.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this series is the artwork. Beautiful landscapes of lush vegetation, constant light and atmospheric effects, and special effects used for the mushi don't look like CG pasted on top like in a low-budget series. Character design wasn't bad, except that there wasn't enough variation between the appearance of the villagers, making it appear some are in multiple episodes when in fact it is a different person every time.\\n\\n\r\nThe stories themselves are fantastic in their humanity and charm. The quality of the writing varied some (especially near the end) but overall kept me happy throughout the show. Mushishi is first and foremost not an action series, and would generally bore anyone who's really looking for stimulation. I've heard people say you shouldn't watch it late at night (because it will put you to sleep) and while I can't say that's accurate, it is a series you generally have to be in the right mood to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is simple and calming. It may be a little cheesy or repetitious at some points (like Casio-keyboard Muzak for the local Chinese buffet) but generally sets the mood right for whatever is happening. Only the opening theme has any singing, and the ending score that leads out each episode changes each time. Those are so nice and blend so well with the final minute or so of the story that I generally sit through the end credits to enjoy the rest of the song.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is entirely episodic in nature, and there are only one or two references to previous episodes made in the entire run of the show, neither of them were important plot-wise, so the viewer is free to watch the show completely out of order for the most part. It's also a slice-of-life show, meaning that the stories don't always have a conclusive start or finish. Some of the stories end on a happy note, some sad or bittersweet, some don't really resolve at all. A couple of times we start with Ginko having already met the supporting cast and the story already begun. This also means the series itself has no conclusive end and the final episode was a little weak.\\n\\n\r\nIt took more than three months for me to watch the series, and it should have been done in a month at the most. But the one-episode stories and overall feel of Mushishi makes one not want to watch it quickly. But that's okay in this case, and I still highly recommended it for someone looking for a more contemplative adult anime or for fans of high production values.",

            "content": "They lay, unseen in the shadows, the mysterious beings known only as the mushi. They are the closest to the earth of any living being that dwells on its surface. They live around us all, and are, for the most part, very docile creatures, but they become deadly as well. When this happens, it is wise to seek the help of a mushi master. The story of Mushi-shi follows one such mushi master, named Ginko. A mysterious man who only stays in one place long enough to aid those who need him, and then leaves to the next place. \r\nThe plot of Mush-shi is episodicand nothing short of extraordinary. If all the beauty in the world were to be moulded into a show, it would be Mushi-shi. Its roots dwell deep in ancient Japanese culture, it's heavily symbolic, but never obvious about it, and it's simply an amazing experience. The show seems to take place around the 1800s in Japan, but it is never confirmed, as much as all the Japanese culture in it would lead us to believe, as well as the fact that most characters in the show wear traditional Japanese clothing. It never loses an air of mystery, though, which does leave room for argument. The show always leaves you satisfied, and although it isn't one to watch in one sitting, it's a perfect show for before going to sleep. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another interesting aspect of Mush-shi. Aside from Ginko, characters only appear in one episode (with the exception of a close friend of his.) However, each episodic character is given enough back-story that you care for them. You want them to overcome their troubles and live a happy life. You feel the genuinely upset for these one episode characters when they have trouble overcoming these obstacles. It's truly amazing how this was pulled off, and I salute them for doing so. Ginko himself is a very interesting character and always a joy to have on screen. He's laid-back, sarcastic, but always willing to help others. He really loves his work, even if sometimes it doesn't seem like it. Details on his character are given out little by little as the series goes on, and by the time you get to the episode with his story, you'll find it rather hard not to get teary eyed. He's one of those characters who you have to love. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this series is, you guessed it, beautiful. The character designs are simplistic but if they had been any more detailed, the show's tone may have been altered slightly. They're really better off simplistic. The characters dress in clothing typical for the setting, making it feel very natural. The colours and backgrounds are soft and inviting, adding to the lullaby effect of the show. The animation is rather minimal, but it doesn't need to do any more than it does. It's simple, but effective. \\n\\n\r\nEverything is a high point in this show, and the music is no exception. It's extremely soothing and again, beautiful. There is a lot of piano in this score which is used to great effect. The animation in the opening is very minimal, but the opening song, which is in English, is a very relaxing song and captures the tone of the show well. The ending of the episode merges seamlessly into the ending theme, sending you to sleep with images of the world you just left. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the series where I refuse to watch it in a certain language. I absolutely will not watch Mushi-shi in Japanese. Odd, I know, considering everything about this show is Japanese, where as many other anime are heavily Americanised. Allow me to explain. Mushi-shi, as mentioned before, is much like a lullaby. I don't want to have to read when watching it. Honestly, I just want to relax and watch without having to worry about that. Your best off just watching in whichever language you know best. The acting in the Japanese is solid; I'm sure, as it always is. In English, Travis Willingham plays Ginko perfectly, as well. Not only that, but every single minor character is acted perfectly, without many miscasting. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mushi-shi is a stunningly unique and beautiful series. It isn't one to be watched for hours on end, but rather to watch before going to sleep. Everything about this series is beautiful. If you ever had trouble believing that anime was art, watch this series, it will make you think twice. It isn't action packed, and who knows, some people may find it boring, but can I take away marks for that? I don't think so, since excitement isn't really what it set out to do in the first place. It set out to teach people about how Japanese culture was and still is partially, and to act as a lullaby, and it surely does that. I could recommend this series to anyone, including people who don't normally watch anime.",

            "content": "Mushishi is really one of those series that's very unique and mysterious. \r\nThe story starts off with a Mushi-shi named Ginko, which throughout his journey, encounters different kinds of people that are in strange situations that are caused by these creatures called \"mushi.\" They exist to somehow help out people that are afflicted by the mushis, so they act like medical doctors that's wandering about from place to place. The people he encounters are really unique, and their problems symbolize diseases in the real world, at least as I see it. Ginko appears in the villages where these peoples are and try to relieve themof these mushis, or just to try to help them out somehow. The mushis could be infesting inside the person, or exist outside their surrounding environment that could even affect an entire village. Either way, they cause something that makes their victims act strange. The story line is very episodic, but it really does fit the plot since each episode depicts Ginko being faced by a different problem each time.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Mushishi is really something that's worth appreciating. The vivid forests that Ginko travels through, the ocean that's constantly shown in the story, and the villages themselves are all very detailed and are just great just staring at them. Right when the first episode started off, I was thrilled by the details the people behind this anime put their backs into. The fog and mist surrounding the forests and the village makes me think of going outside on an early morning and breath in the crisp morning air while the birds chirp on the trees. That laid back feeling is really something. This could be a recent series that was first aired only two or three years ago, but I totally appreciate the animation and art on this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds involved in Mushishi are also great. The opening song just resembles one or two of my all-time favorite bands. The slow and mellow flow of the music is just laid back, and it just fits what the story is all about. Even the ending is very unique for an anime. Every episode ends with a different ending music, along with a different piece of art to show with it. With other anime, I usually just watch the opening and ending once, then the rest of the series I just skip them and go directly to what I'm supposed to be watching. But Mushishi is different. Every episode, I watch (or maybe just listen) the entire opening just for the music, then watch the whole ending for each one too. It's that great. The voice actors, specially the one doing Ginko's voice (in Japanese of course) really did a great job, so I give kudos to him for that. The sounds just come in at the right time, especially that bell or chime that rings out of nowhere, but fits the scene.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi's characters are also great. There's the doctor that buys all of Ginko's weird collection, then the people that are afflicted by Mushis themselves. I kind of felt like there was a shortage of main characters though, but I think that making Ginko the character that everyone revolves around fits this anime anyways. That's because he travels around, and that's the only way of fitting all the pieces to the puzzle. Ginko's history also depicts someone that makes him what he is today. The people on this series also somewhat felt like they have the same faces, well at least mostly everyone, with a few that's just different. It felt like they have the same ancestors from way, way back then that just shows just now. But, that's just something weird that I had to add. But back to the discussion, I say the characters that Ginko meets on his travels are very mysterious as if they're ominous or something. But in the end, they're just regular people. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is really something that I have enjoyed. It's something that persuades me to travel myself. No, it MAKES me want to travel. I really like shows where the main character travels to different places, and Mushishi just took the word &quot;Adventure&quot; to the next floor upstairs. I really had fun watching the series, and it's a show where everyone will find something to enjoy. The creators really need to start thinking of making a sequel that covers the last half of the manga. PLS!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is my top favorite all time anime that even surpassed Cowboy Bebop. I'm really into action animes like Bebop and hilarious ones like GTO, but Mushishi got that humble feel to it that just makes one feel good about something. This work is truly a masterpiece, and I recommend it to anyone who's reading this review.",

            "content": "Less of a show and more of a journey; a spiritual one. The way each episode is laid out is fairly simple, there is a problem where a Mushi is involved and as such a Mushishi is called upon (Ginko our main protagonist is one of the many Mushishi). Yet through those problems be it successfully solved or not, we experience nature, humanity and all the range of emotions it has to offer. \r\n- Depth and complexity through simplicity -\r\nSometimes a simple meaningful conversation beats 1000 flashy sword strikes. Mushishi does not try to use cliffhangers, exaggerated mysterious protagonist, complicated vocabularies and other means capableof creating the illusion of depth. Mushishi's naturally brilliant writing and execution of storytelling speaks for itself. \\n\\n\r\nThis also applies to the music present in Mushishi. It\u2019s hard to describe the feeling unless you\u2019ve watched the show. Instead of having the music just to support certain scenes, Mushishi\u2019s music walks together with the show. It chimes melodies at all the right timing further enhancing the viewer\u2019s experience. The music composition mirrors the show itself, all the different instruments complements each other, knowing when to play and to harmonize.\\n\\n\r\n- As real as life gets -\\n\r\nDespite its fantasy setting due to the Mushi, the show Mushishi feels real. It doesn't try to paint life in a certain colour or gives you sudden plot twists just to somehow save the day. Mushishi instead presents you life with all its dilemma and unpredictability. There might be a time where even after Ginko and the characters involved had given all they've got, things simply doesn't go the way they wanted to. That is just how life rolls. Life itself can get quite contradictory and unpredictable: We can say \"Look before you leap\" but then again \"He who hesitates is lost\". Mushishi illustrates a lot of thought provoking realisations throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nLife flows the same way as each character we met through the journey, slowly forgetting some as new ones are introduced with different problems. It personally made me realize how things comes and go. From the friends that I met and forget, the parents that will depart before their child, the problems that we face in each stage of our lives. We are all a side character to each other with our own stories to tell. Through the realization that live is inherently meaningless yet through our actions and the choices we made, we gave it meaning. \\n\\n\\n\r\n- Travelling with the protagonist not watching over them \u2013\\n\r\nWhile a lot of shows had successfully made me empathize with the characters none made me feel as if I am there myself as much as Mushishi. Through each problem and each choices I feel like I was there questioning what I would do in such a situation. \\n\r\nGinko is not a master samurai, a magician or a boy overcoming his fear to chase his dream. He is just a normal guy, who happens to be well versed in all things related to Mushi be it through studies or personal experience. But most importantly he is your travel companion and as Ginko involves himself in a fraction of another individual/families\u2019 life, so do we. \\n\\n\r\n- Like flowing on a gentle river -\\n\r\nThis might be my personal preference, but I feel so many anime tends to be overly hyperactive (it\u2019s like a house packed with so much furniture that you don't have enough room to walk and breathe). Mushishi strikes the perfect balance in terms of speed. Things just flows so well between scenes and conversations. I don't need to keep up with the show nor slow down to be able to appreciate it, instead the show made me sync in and be immersed in it.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Mushishi is a one of a kind experience that might appeal to a narrow group of people. But if you are willing to watch it with an open mind and appreciate it, it might just be one of if not the best show you will ever watch.",

            "content": "The brisk night breeze cuts your face as you trudge through the fresh, powdery snow. You glance upwards to the tranquil, star laden canvas in the sky, wondering just how long you've been traveling. There's a rustling of thicket, seemingly blanketing the woods around you, and a distant echo of howling, vibrating your frigid bones. At last you see the cabin, your eventual destination. Squinting through the bramble of branches in your field of view, the shack has a small stream of smoke billowing into the crisp, clear air. There's a dim glow of a fire inside the window, causing them to produce condensation andsteam up. Suddenly, an ominous aura comes over your body, causing you to halt and you confirm that this is your target. A mushi, more menacing and intriguing than any you've combatted before. Consumed with curiosity and caution, you resumed your trek to the cabin.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi, adapted by Studio Artland (LotGH) in 2005, is one of the most unique and fascinating anime I have ever seen. Viewers follow Ginko, a \u201cmushi-shi\u201d, through an almost documentarian style series, with an amicable yet languid atmosphere. He travels across vibrant landscapes in search of \u201cmushi\u201d, who are transient beings exhibiting a plethora of unique abilities. Through his journeys, Ginko wishes to uncover the true nature of these creatures, and perhaps develop a more coherent understand of human existence itself.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is a hard anime to recommend. If you don't watch it properly (i.e., no bingeing here) or with the right mindset, it can fall off and become boring. The anime is less of a standard beginning, middle and end and more of an experience. That being said, it's best enjoyed in small doses with the lights off in order to really feel the ambient nature the series exudes. The way each vignette is handled makes the anime episodic in structure, which can be less than translatable for some viewers. The ending of Mushishi is also much more like your standard episode instead of a conclusion, leaving much room for a sequel\u2026 which we all know happened some years later.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of recurring characters can also cause the series to seem emotionally disconnected. It's hard to empathize with one-offs with little to no development but in a way this adds to the impassiveness the series embodies. The effort is directed to the mushi and the environment more than the individual affected, which is what I believe the show\u2019s creator was trying to get across. Ginko himself is an enigmatic character. He represents the ponderer in all of us, and as if stricken by his own curiosity he actively seeks out the mushi to learn more about them. His calm, collected demeanor resonates with the audience, causing you to really root for him and support his campaign. \\n\\n\r\nThe mushi themselves are enchanting in their own right. Whether possessing a human or a plant, they have a sentient nature about them that's enthralling. Each time I would sit down to watch Mushishi I found myself excited to see what new mushi would be revealed in the episode. Some of the imagery the mushi produced when being exercised were quite disturbing and in some cases even graphic, adding to the haunting setting.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of themes explored in Mushishi can seem overwhelming, since the mushi themselves are so unexplainable. Some say the series is illustrating the roots of mankind while others tend to draw more to a biblical demonry reference. Either way you slice it, Mushishi is one of those few shows that falls under the intellectually challenging category without being pretentious. Truly a remarkably interesting series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Mushishi has a very dark tone to it. Although there are instances of vivid color schemes being explored, most of the scenes are washed out or almost opaque. Again, this aspect causes the languid nature of the series to be emphasized greatly. Most of the episode characters have indistinguishable faces, which doesn't help the empathizing point I made earlier, but helps bring out the other parts of the show more clearly. Animation is solid but not flashy in any way. I don't believe the series had an extreme budget, and it shows in some ways. The mid 2000\u2019s was an experimentation period for animators after all, and Mushishi is thankful enough not to incorporate any sluggish CGI.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u201cSore Feet Song\u201d is one of the oddest anime OPs I can think of. Its slow acoustic rhythm is anything but exciting, but really sets the tone of the show. As much as I couldn't get into it originally, by the end of the series I began to sit through it instead of skipping over it. The full version of the song is also quite soothing. The ED is delicate and light, wrapping a nice bow on top of each episode, which is another reason why Mushishi is great to watch in small doses. Although the composer of the OST did work on shows like Excel Saga, Mushishi\u2019s Soundtrack is impeccably relaxing. The soft strings and pianissimo beats draw out the best in each scene. Both the English and Japanese dubs are well done and don't detract from the atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMy large amount of enjoyment from Mushishi was mostly due to my ability to take it slow. I recognize that this show is not for everyone, but if watched in the right setting and with an open mind, it can truly be a delightful experience. It doesn't fall under a specific genre so it's hard to compare to other shows. Mushishi is just Mushishi. I would recommend this series to fans of shows like Haibane Renmei or Kino\u2019s Journey due to their world building alone, and for the latter it's episodic approach. As always, thanks for reading!",

            "content": "Here is a seriously unique anime experience that everyone at least ought to give a shot. It does have some serious flaws that should not be overlooked, but its strong story-telling, gorgeous background art, sublime take on horror, and intriguing central character all insure that this is something truly special--to be cherished by only a few perhaps, but so be it.\r\nMushishi concerns itself with the traveling healer Ginko, who specializes in illness and other associated phenomena caused by 'mushi,' which seem to be troublesome spirits, but which Ginko insists are a form of life akin to something between plant-life (or perhaps fungus) and insects. Mushiare not purposely malevolent (indeed, they don't really seem to be 'purposely' anything), but in their own struggles to survive and breed they affect the world around them in troublesome ways--and when people come into contact with them, the results are often frightening or tragic. Having an unfortunate history with mushi himself, Ginko has become a mushishi--a person who specializes in the 'biology' of mushi, and who uses his knowledge to help others who come into contact with them. \\n\\n\r\nI see this show frequently described as a 'horror' (more specifically speaking a 'body horror') and while I suppose that strictly speaking this is true, it doesn't tell the whole story. It is true that the people who find themselves in symbiotic relationships with mushi often suffer in some physical way (though not always), and occasionally this suffering enters into some truly squicky territory. However, even at its most horrific, Mushishi pulls together some truly beautiful, unforgettable imagery. One can quake at what is actually unfolding on the screen, but nonetheless be in awe of the sublime artistry that is on display. If Mushishi is a horror, than it's a beautiful horror, with some sequences attaining an almost transcendentally lovely quality. (Comparable to Miyazaki's work, in some instances. I would particularly, and favorably, compare Mushishi with Princess Mononoke.) It's hard to describe without sounding like a dope or using lots of superlatives, but the writers and animators take advantage of the uniqueness of the mushi to put on display truly generous displays of wonder.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of wonder: dat background art. And dat music. And dat writing. And dem voice actors. Nearly everything about this anime screams quality, but I would particularly like to single out the main character. Ginko is the glue that holds everything together here. Mushishi is a purely episodic series, where he is the only regularly recurring character. There is no overarching plot to speak of. The episodes could be watched in completely random order and it likely would not affect one's experience with the show at all. There is no real beginning and certainly no end. I would argue that there is a subtle emotional arc to the series and would encourage people to watch it in order, however, and this arc relates entirely to the development of Ginko himself. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two episodes that flashback to Ginko in his youth, but otherwise Ginko himself is something of a mystery. In spite of this, the writers wring a great deal of character of this secretive, mysterious man, and they do so with great subtlety and feeling, aided immensely by the animators and the Japanese voice actor. (I must report that the English voice actor does an alright job, but Yuto Nakano *owns* Ginko.) Watching him carefully and listening to him intently is a surprisingly rewarding experience--pay special attention to the way he acts around children and women, or the way he deals with villagers. There is a lot to Ginko, coiling just beneath the surface. And Nakano masterfully expresses this without ever giving too much away, gently emphasizing Ginko's quirks, and even imbuing him with some quiet but powerful sex appeal. It's one of the best male voice performances I've ever heard, right up there with Jurota Kosugi as Akio in Revolutionary Girl Utena and Steven Blum as Spike in Cowboy Bebop.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on, not only about Ginko (have I mentioned his character design yet? God, I love it!), but about everything else that this series does right, as well. But I feel like I need to explicitly state that it's not all peaches and cream--there are some things here that may really bug you, assuming that you don't mind the episodic storytelling at all.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, there are the character designs--almost all of them who aren't Ginko. They're not bad character designs--I actually really like them. The problem is that there's less than a dozen of them to be spread out across the whole twenty-six episodes and however many dozens of characters there are. As powerfully written and acted as all of these dozens of one-time characters are, it's a huge blow to the show that they're not given their own unique faces. One could argue that this was done purposely--thematically, doing this does make some sense within the context of the show, but I find it to be a blow to the show's quality, nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nOn a similar note is the music. Again--fantastic music. And I mean that--it's truly a wonderful score, perhaps one of the best I've heard in an anime series. But there's far too little of it to stretch across all twenty-six episodes without it becoming stale, and it is certainly not helped by the fact that it's used in almost exactly the same way in every episode, and even in the same order. Similarly, with very few exceptions, all of the episodes follow nearly exactly the same structure. Which I suppose you must expect to some degree from an episode series, but here it gets to the point of being almost painful. There was one stretch of episodes in particular where accurately predicting the fates of some of the characters was so easy to do that it was almost funny--and it's all because of patterns that the show establishes.\\n\\n\r\nFor me personally, these are not insignificant flaws. There are ways around them--for example, this is honestly a show that I would never marathon. It is best experienced piece by small piece, and I would not recommend watching more than four episodes of it in a day. Indeed, ideally, I would recommend that you only watch one episode of it every night, preferably right before bed. Go on watching whatever other anime you are marathoning at the moment, then finish your night off with one episode of this. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, this is almost a show that I could watch one episode of every night before bed for the rest of my life--it just gets you in the right state of mind for sleep. Not because it's boring (though some people will find its slow pace and lack of action to be just that) but because it's just seems like such a perfect prequel to a night of dreams. \\n\\n\r\nOne last thing--if you're looking for an anime experience similar to this one, I'd highly, *highly* recommend Kino's Journey. Seriously, if you haven't watched that one yet but you love this show, you are wasting time simply by allowing yourself to finish reading this sentence. \\n",

            "content": "**Minor Spoilers**\r\n This was one of the most challenging anime I've ever had to watch in a very long time.\r\nThis series was recommended to me by one of my very close youtube friends because he felt there was a lot of similiarities between my personality and the personality of the main character in the series known as Ginko. This series has received a lot of critical acclaim but unfortunately reflecting on what I have watched and I say with regret that I did not enjoy this series as much as everyone else.\r\nLet's focus on what I liked about the series compared to what I didn'tlike.\\n\\n\r\nThe Good. The anime in itself has some of the most beautiful tranquil music and beautiful natural scenery I seen in an anime period. The folk style storytelling is pretty solid but there is no sense of progression minus a scatter scene here and there from select episodes that builds upon the main character. Every episode is kind of a detective story with regards to the plot and the resolution for the plot for each episode. It's kind of fun to kind of guess throughout the episode how to fix the problems the mushi cause since the episodes are very self contained. You could start on episode 1 or episode 17 and you wouldn't feel lost because the storytelling aspect in each individual episode is incredibly strong.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad. Pacing is the number one problem with this anime. For the most part, a lot of the episodes are incredibly boring with no significant build up throughout the majority of the episodes. It was incredibly challenging to me to even get through one episode straight through because the majority of the episodes I had to pause around 10 to 15 minute mark because it felt so mentally exhausting to get through. The anime has a hard time deciding on what it wants to be because half the episodes have good endings while the other half of the episodes have dark depressing endings to them. I don't mind when animes want to have a depressing feel to them. I have watched vampire princess miyu after all. I just wish Mushishi could of been a bit more consistent with regards to its storytelling. This anime can be a very depressing anime to get through but in a way it deals with how harsh life can be and no matter what you do your fate can be to an extent uncontrollable. There is no humour in this anime (none) but it can teach some very valuable lessons about life in general.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, its really hard for me to recommend this anime because it is going to be different from a lot of other anime that people have seen before. I personally struggle with depression myself but I can admit that because I'm not perfect but this was an anime I would of been better off watching if depression did not have such a significant hold in my life since I work away from home quite a lot. If you want an anime with some solid storytelling, beautiful tranquil music and imagery than by all means watch it because in my eyes those are the strongest points in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI will admit though my favorite episode in the series is the episode where we see how Ginko loses his eye and obtains his white hair. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 (Not Recommended - but if your interested its worth checking out a few episodes to see if it pertains to your interests.)",

            "content": "Mushishi is the story of a Mushishi, or Mushi-Master, Ginko, as he travels around the world helping those who are having Mushi troubles. Mushi are unique beings that aren't plants, animals, nor human. All Mushi are different which can cause for quite an interesting story.\r\nStory - Well, Mushishi is a bit different. It doesn't follow an actual plot, but instead has episodes that are unique to the overall basis of the story: a Mushi is causing trouble to someone or some village and the Mushishi, Ginko, tries to help whoever is in need of help. However, the stories are very interesting most of the timeand will hold the viewers attention. I will admit, some of the stories were a bit boring, but 90% of them were really good.\\n\\n\r\nArt -Well, the animation of the actual Mushi was good, however, the characters in each episode were pretty much drawn the same. In fact, you might get confused sometimes in the beginning since you have to realize that other than the main character, there aren't many recurring characters despite the similar appearance. On the other hand, the overall animation of the detailed backgrounds were very nice. You'd be amazed if you just paused on some of the mountain or forest scenes. Quite nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Being a supernatural anime, I enjoyed the &quot;spooky&quot; sound that came from it. The OP and ED also followed this supernatural-theme, which was very enjoyable. The sound went together nicely with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Well, not much development is shown since we only have 1 main recurring character, but we do get background on Ginko in a few episodes. It would have been nice to see some more, though. Ginko is pretty like able too since he is very levelheaded and knows what he is doing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Most of the time I really enjoyed Mushishi. However, since some of the episodes weren't that good (more or less around 5 of the 26 episodes), I did get bored throughout those, but otherwise I found the episodes to be really unique and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mushishi is a very unique supernatural anime that will gain praise by any Supernatural fan. If you prefer things like Romance, Comedy, and Action then this is not the anime for you. But anyhow, I enjoyed it. ^_^",

            "content": "\"If the four fingers on my hand represent animals and the thumb represents plants, humans would be here, at the tip of the middle-finger, farthest away from the heart. The closer to the palm of the hand, the simpler the creature. Around the wrist, all the blood vessels come together, right? About there are fungi and microorganisms. It's hard to distinguish between plants and animals at this point. But high up the arm, past the shoulder, close to the heart, there are still things beyond those.\"\r\nThese things are called \"midori mono\" - Green things -, or \"mushi\", a slightly misleading term, given it translates to\"insects\" or \"bugs\". Because they are much closer to being the very essence of life rather than mere manifestations of it, few people are able to actually see them. One such person is Ginko. Being a \"mushi-shi\", a mushi master, he travels rural pre-westernized Japan conducting research and helping people who get to indirectly experience the existence of mushi, as these outlandish creatures tend to be the cause of sorts of strange phenomena and problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe original manga could be called an anthology, seeing it is basically a collection of unrelated short stories. The anime, consequently, is episodic in nature, meaning it contains no overarching story, not even two-parters. Each episode is a self-contained adaption of a chapter from volumes one to six of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of twenty-six episodes, there are only three recurring characters. One of them appears in no more than three episodes and another one remains but a faceless narrating voice - except for that one time. The third one is Ginko. His rather unusual appearance reflects the fact his ability sets him apart from other people. Although the time the story is set in would normally require all characters to wear wafuku - traditional Japanese clothing -, Ginko is always dressed in yofuku - typically Western clothes. In-story, however, no one seems to even notice, and unlike regarding his hair and eye color, the viewer is never given any explanation either. \\n\\n\r\nGinko's personality is even more unusual. If the average male lead is a boisterous hothead who acts purely on impulse, Ginko is the exact opposite. Whereas other mushi-shi think of the mushi as vermin to be exterminated, Ginko knows they inflict problems on people because they are, like every other living thing, doing what they have to in order to survive. If, however, the only way to save a human life is to eliminate a mushi, he will do so without regret. He simply understands the way nature works and accepts it.\\n\\n\r\n\"Why do you kill us?\"\\n\r\n\"Because you consume human children.\"\\n\r\n\"It isn\u2019t my fault.\"\\n\r\n\"It isn\u2019t my fault either, except we're stronger, so you're going to die.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhile this may imply that Ginko is somewhat wooden or stoic, he is, in fact, rather laid-back. His facial expressions can be quite funny and his manner of speech is blunt, almost rude at times. He does not like to lecture people but prefers to give them just enough advice for them to be able to make an informed choice. Needless to say, people don\u2019t always listen.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is often mentioned in the same breath with Kino no Tabi which is understandable in a way, seeing both are episodic anime centered around one person travelling. And while I rather like Kino no Tabi, I'd like to emphasize that Mushishi is much more subtle, much more unobtrusive in its approach, but much more thought-provoking notwithstanding. Sometimes calming, sometimes disturbing, there is something about its general vibe that feels incredibly special, magical almost.",

            "content": "Mushi. Strange lifeforms said to be more primitive than germs and bacteria. Very few people can see them and they can cause strange phenomenom ranging from weird illnesses to paranormal events. And we also have the Mushi-shi. Mushi experts specializing in eradicating or capturing harmful mushi, helping people with their mushi problems. One of them is Ginko, the mushi-shi with a strange white hair, traveling to various places to help people and also to seek more knowledge about mushi.\r\nDespite having a relatively high rating, my expections for anime was rather low. It doesn't have action, it doesn't have romance so pretty much I just watchedthis anime on a whim. But after finishing Mushishi, I found myself thoroughly impressed because this was indeed a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is an episodic anime set in fictional old Japan. Watching Mushishi reminds me of folktales and legends. The way the story is told, mixed with gloomy and sometimes relaxing atmosphere of the show, really gives you this feeling of eeriness. The story itself is unique and creative. There is no overarching plotline so there are new characters every episode with new mushi problems and of course our mushi hero Ginko appears to save the day. The story sounds simple but I have respect for the creators of Mushishi and writers who create episodic stories in general, because not only will they have to create new stories every episode but also every episode needs to be just as good as the last one. And unlike non-episodic anime, episodic shows doesn't have cliffhangers to keep viewers from watching.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise, Mushishi's backgrounds and sceneries are well-done, capturing historical Japan very nicely. However, I can't really say the same for the character designs. The characters looked to much alike. There were a number of times where I thought I was looking at a character from a previous episode. Well that is pretty much the only gripe I have with regards to the art but all in all Artland did a great job.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who watched Mushishi will definitely remember the opening theme \"The sorefeet song\". The song doesn't really have anything to do with the story or theme of Mushishi but I personally think it's the perfect op for Mushishi because it surprisingly fits well with the atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters in Mushishi because it is episodic and most of them will never appear again in later episodes. So I'm not going to talk about the supporting characters anymore because they are not given much characterization and are only\u00a0created solely for one episode. Let's just talk about Ginko the main character. Ginko is by far not a complex character but that doesn't mean he is shallow. He is level-headed, insightful and very knowledgeable. He kind of reminds me of Kakashi from Naruto. Put simply, he is the type of characters cool boys wants to be when they grow up but fails miserably.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mushishi is a great anime that you shouldn't miss. If you want a breather from all the battleshounen or romance shoujo you're watching and would like something that is unique and well-thought-out, then you should watch Mushishi. Highly recommended.",

Mushi are neither plants nor animals, they are life in its purest form.\r\nStory:\r\nMushishi is an episodic show, every episode has an unique story of it's own.\r\nThe storytelling is perfectly handled and the blending of reality and fiction is very well done. Many episodes makes you think of how you would handle the problem and what your reaction to the mushi would be. Originality also plays a big role in Mushishi, every episode feels like a new and fresh story and the mushi are always different thanthe ones before so it doesn't get repetitive at all.\\n\r\nThe formule for every episode is pretty much the same but since there are no rules set in the mushi world you never know what could happen and that makes for some mindblowing endings. Another great aspect of Mushishi is that in many episodes you can actually place the Mushi in the real world and it would perfectly fit the problem that's occuring without being unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOur main protagonist Ginko has a great sense of justice and doesn't place the mushi in a category of good and evil. The mushi just try to survive, just like we do. I see people claim that Ginko is underdeveloped, but that's a false statement since he is already developed. He also has a great backstory and a good sense of humor. He even builds his own harem while following his journey(JOKE). But he's not the main focus, the main focus here are the mushi situations the side characters get in. The side characters always have solid development especially for an episodic series and a good amount of depth to them, their reactions are realistic and their bonds are showed really well. The only little complaint I have is that some of the characters look too much like eachother but that doesn't ruin my enjoyment for the series at all. Sometimes the characters could use a bit more development by the end of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Animation:\\n\r\nThe music fits this anime perfectly, it's relaxing and mysterious and adds to the amazing atmosphere which is one of the best in all of anime. The voice acting is also very good and fits the characters very well. The art is amazing, the backgrounds are some of the best I've seen in anime and the characters are well drawn. It also has two great opening songs, with the second opening being one of my favourite openings of all time. Every episode has a different ending and leaves you sitting on your chair as if you've just seen a movie.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI have never loved an anime as much as this, I feel like this will be my favourite anime of all time, it could change but I doubt it. It's so relaxing, unique and well done. I will say this anime is not for everyone, and you probably shouldn't marathon it because of its episodic nature. Also, Mushishi can be very dark so be aware of that. One of my few 10/10's.\\n\\n\r\nA MUST WATCH.\\n",

            "content": "Mushishi started as a manga by Urushibara Yuki. It won her a couple awards and got adapted into an anime at the end of 2005 going into 2006. The adaptation was handled by Artland, the studio behind Gunslinger Girl Il Teatrino, Ichiban Ushiro no Dai Mao & Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu. Which isn't exactly a strong track record but it's also a small sample size. So, how does Mushishi compare to the studio's other offerings? It'll be very difficult for it to not be at least the second best thing I've seen from them. \r\nStory:\r\nThis series doesn't have a single over-arcing story. Rather, it's an episodicseries where we follow Ginko on his various adventures. Ginko is a mushishi, a person who studies and deals with complications caused by organisms called mushi that many people can't even see. I'm not sure how that's supposed to work given the way eyes function but it's a fantasy world so they can have elements like that. Each episode presents a mushi related problem. Each episode focuses on a different issue and how it gets resolved. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I really appreciate about the series is that it does vary a lot. Ginko may show up right away or come later. He may investigate or he may know exactly what's going on. He may or may not have a good solution. Things may end happily, tragically or bitter-sweetly. It creates enough variety to keep things interesting and to keep the audience invested in new situations as they come. The pacing in the individual episodes is handled very effectively as well. The atmosphere is really good and the world itself is quite intriguing.  There are some episodes that are better than others but there aren't any that are bad. All of them are good, at least. The series continually introduces new mushi which is good in that it keeps things interesting but it also leads to some of the solutions coming across as forced. Almost like Urushibara came up with the idea for the problem and wanted a specific ending for the characters who were having trouble but didn't know how to get to it. Fortunately, there aren't many episodes that have solutions like that but there are a few. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nWe only have two major reoccurring characters, Ginko and his friend Adashino. They're both really strong characters with a good level of depth. Then we have the side characters who frequently take the focus for the individual episodes. These characters do get well fleshed out and have serviceable motivations for what they're doing. They all have verisimilitude and that helps create investment in those scenarios. Even the less important side characters still manage to come across like actual people. I also appreciate that those characters who are put into antagonistic roles have sensible reasons behind what they're doing and are usually acting more out of ignorance or greed than any malice. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are superb. The backgrounds are really detailed and there are some gorgeous nature scenes. The mushi are frequently visually interesting and there are some legitimately creepy moments with them. The characters also look quite good, although the way mouths are drawn can be odd. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is really good for both the major and side characters. Nakano Yuto in particular does a superb job in the role of Ginko. The music is nicely done and suitable for the series. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay: \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't any in this series. Some of the side characters get romance but it's always het. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nMushishi is an excellent series. It takes a good premise and uses it to great effect. If you're looking for an episodic series, I do recommend it. My final rating is going to be a 9/10. Next week I'll be looking at another series I was asked to review. It's going to be Love Hina.",

            "content": "A masterpiece.\r\nThere are some shows that are addicting, some shows are to be gulped down like a severely dehydrated man drinks water and then there are some shows that need to be savored, shows that are are like a balm on irritated skin - cool and soothing, to be used at regular intervals and at each time giving so much satisfaction. Mushishi is the latter kind.\r\nWatching it while letting the amazing art, beautiful sound and touching stories wash over me was such a great experience. It is an anime that could have gone on forever and I would have watched every minute of it. Youcan just see the amount of love, work and thought that has gone into crafting every frame of the show. Every scene is a work of art. The scenery captures more than just the image, it captures the soul of the place.\\n\\n\r\nThe world is particularly impressive.\\n\r\nWhat struck me as extraordinary was the fact that there were no evil people or creatures. There was no monster that the hero is fighting. The people aren't evil for the sake of being evil. There are occasional grey characters and even they are just out to survive. Even if something is harming us, the idea that we should consider that it is just trying to live and we should tolerate it is so foreign in this world. In our world the knee jerk reaction to something bothersome is to destroy it. Ginko's empathy is not seen as something extraordinary in the anime, just a part of the world. That universe is completely fleshed out.\\n\r\nThe mushi live an existence separate from what we know as normal and that is okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe stories are complete and they work very well even taken without the whole. What moves the stories are the characters. We are only introduced to them for a short while and we see them as human in the sense that we don't understand them completely, we don't have to understand them completely but we know their story and that matters.\\n\\n\r\nI love detective stories and Mushishi is paced like one. Introduce the problem and have the detective figure it out. The eureka moment doesn't give the same jolt that I get when a detective figures out a problem we are baffled by even when we have all the information, but it is still nice. Another important part of the anime is love, in its most powerful and intangible form. It is in every story and in every form.\\n\\n\r\nThe music flows through the show. The opening track is with its visuals sets the tone perfectly and drops gently into the story, the background slowly pulling its viewers into the story and keeping us there till a few seconds after the credits start to roll. The feeling that the story continues through the credits, that the story continues beyond what we have been told, that the characters we were with live on is solely because of the beautiful music.\\n\\n\r\nGinko is the main character but it isn't really about him. This is such a strange show that way. It isn't character driven in the sense that we need Ginko to make the story interesting. In many episodes he seems almost like a foot note in the main story. Even in the final episode, where I was expecting some kind of bang, just has him as a secondary or even tertiary character. It is a testament to how compellingly they have written that world that we don't need an anchor to sink into it. His western clothes remain a mystery (albeit a well dressed one).\\n\\n\r\nI really wish there were more episodes of Mushishi.\\n",

            "content": "Disclamer: Let me be fully serious now: Mushi-shi is a crazy 420 weed show about an old man who has a big addiction and nobody tells him about it and is not safe for kids to watch. Nobody has seemingly to put this together but me, but I feel that for the children and their safety I have to say that first! Now, onto reviewing this crazy show!\r\nThe story is like a said, some dude keeps hittin the bong and sees freaky things called Mushy, and helps people come down from their high! I am never kidding, was this show made in Colorado or Hamsterdam!?It is a touching and imaginative journey that is highly episodic so there isn't much to spoil, much like the Journeys of Kino, except Mush-iy's Ginko is a man. There is also some exploring of nature vs humanity and the togetherness of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this show has a lot of soothing sounds because it mostly takes place in nature, where all the good drugs come up. Stoners like me, and people boring like stones, will feel right at home on their trip. Meanwise, the art of the show is stunning beautiful and goes perfectly with Pink Flyod or some celtic band that chubby chicks might like similar to Nitewish; there are so many colors and makes you want to get away from society!\\n\\n\r\nYour enjoyment of the show is depending on how long you like episodes that do not have much connection or big development. There is very little to tell you that Ginko will ever quit smoking so much, or that others will give up their addiction in the long run. If you like art and relaxing while you munch down some chips, you will love Mushy!\\n\\n",

I decided to review this anime, because it made such a huge impression on me, but perhaps not for the reasons one would assume. \r\nHonestly, to the untrained eye, this anime was BORING. Excuse my blatancy, but to someone who's accustomed to the high-paced, exponentially increasing plot lines which are evident in many action and shounen anime, this show is like your fourth hit on a blunt. The effect just isn't as stringent, or lasting, if you will. \r\nBut where Mushishi really caught my eye,was the originality, and the subtly embedded within it, which leaves the audience with a sentimental understanding of something more than just basic plot or entertainment. It's not such a slap in the face with emotion, or appearance of profundity; in fact, it's quite the opposite. The seemingly minute deviation from different story lines contain the interest factor in other aspects. It may not be an on-the-edge-of-your-seat type of show, but in essence, the simplicity complimented the sensibility. I must say it was a refreshing change which causes you to think beyond moe and tig 'o biddies. \\n\\n\r\nMushishi is... Well, in the words of Rich Homie Quan, it can \"make you feel some type of way.\"",

            "content": "Extensively exotic forest, covered with the lucidly enormous visage of the sun in the sky placing most of it\u2019s gorgeous grace upon the ample grass everywhere you look. It\u2019s hard to believe how intensely green is the local nature. The overwhelming echo of the wind makes you harder to stand still the higher you\u2019re getting. The only sounds you recognize are familiar rings of crickets, sough of the crystal water nearby and the beautiful symphony of birds warbling everywhere above you. By the time you climbed up to the nearest hill, you were welcomed with the engrossing look of the vastness around you. Bright sky,enormous trees, treacherous mountains, peaceful ponds and the undoubtable feeling of a meaningful ensure that \u2013  this life, given birth unasked is a mystical miracle and you\u2019re a part of the vicious, yet beautiful world\u2019s life, which you live with all your might. Let us cast it\u2019s brilliance past the rainbow and it\u2019s colors.\\n\\n\r\nIn the anime once in few years, there is a certain work that transcendents the medium, \u2013 while not necessairly revolutionizing it \u2013 pushing the envelope and reaching a pinnacle rarely seen, creating something completely unorthodox and creative. It lies down to personal prefferences which shows are especially deserving that title, however I do believe that \u201cMushishi\u201d - without a doubt- places itself as one of those titles. Anime is an expressive form of art in its own way, telling a story by the exploitment of the audiovisuals and it\u2019s script, which is what differenciates it from live-action works. Sometimes this \"art\" is utilized to produce poor, commercialized shows not worthy of mentioning, however sometimes it\u2019s used to satisfy more demanding viewers. Studio ArtLand famous for creating the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of anime \u2013 a legendary War Drama OVA from 90\u2019s: Legend of the Galactic Heroes - once more in 2005 decides to produce something of sufficient quality \u2013 Mushishi, consisting of 26 episodes - yet 9 years later decides to release 2 more seasons consisting of 10 episodes each, which is very admirable, taking the fact, not many studios these days are willing to take the risk, instead of supporting commercial and unimaginative works created for the sole reason of merchandising, supporting the otaku culture, which is one of the reasons why anime is rarely taken serious by people not familiarized with it. Obviously, a big mistake. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAll anime despite of their quality, or the effort put from their creators can be called as \u201cart\u201d. As long as an individual finds something to be aesthetically appealing, whether that be a decent visual experience with plot or an universally hated work, that's all that really matters. But sometimes you'll stumble across works that take it a step further in order to invent something outstanding enough to put to awe most of it\u2019s viewers in order to place itself as one of the biggest successes in the medium. And to many in the community, one such work that has reached the pleasure of being that outstanding title is, the anime Mushishi. Mushishi portrays an undominated by civilization world of feudal Japan during the Edo period, filled with it\u2019s melancholic and tranquil tone, yet transcendental and mystic nature of what lives beyond it \u2013 Mushi \u2013 the most basic form of life in the world. Existing without any purposes and goals, Mushi are unorthodox spieces, seen in countless forms, such as diseases, animals, weather or unearthly forms of unsearchable phenomenas, while living next to a race not fully aware of their nature, nor their significance in their lives \u2013 the human race. The people gifted with the vast knowledge of them are called title Mushishi\u2019s. As Mushi are neutral spieces, while can be seen as helpful, they can also be very dangerous. That\u2019s when ordinary people not understanding the reason of their sorrow are placed before hope and the cathartic understanding, when the main protagonist \u2013 Ginko, while being one of the Mushishi, wanders through the villages to teach people not only how to deal with Mushi, but also how to deal with problems caused by them.\\n\\n\r\nMost of Mushishi\u2019s emphasis is placed on the portrayal of it\u2019s separated stories. The show is episodic, each one portraying separated story only connected by the Mushishi \u2013 Ginko and Mushi causing incomprehensible problems to people he meets along the way. Ginko is laidback, yet responsible and caring; intelligent and cunning, ready to help, yet never takes any side in conflict and also can get selfish. The character doesn\u2019t get any real development throughout the story, yet feels very \u201calive\u201d, which is the testimony of powerful characterization by it\u2019s author. The show lacks any action, it\u2019s slow and immensely captivating, yet this title\u2019s prowess for crafting almost \"healing\" atmosphere is peerless. Each episode - even if not every of them is ending happily - leave the viewer with a bittersweet feeling of satisfaction, since the emotional crescendo doesn\u2019t come until the end credits, hence the delightment carried out is the most powerful at this point. There is no way of predicting the outcome - as in nature itself \u2013 not every outcome is determined by whatever is the most favourable conclusion. So while you are watching things that are often tragic, in Mushishi what you\u2019re really watching is a person watching a sad story, and then moving on. Tears are shed, but Ginko remains impartial in spite of all this, gaining little more than the experience itself, as do you. Considering that, Mushishi is a work not only about some mystical \u201cthings that does weird things\u201d, but mostly about people and their problems. Is your sorrow only yours? The solitude you carry on your back, does it end with your life? Some of the Mushi portrayed are extremely bizarre, yet can get a symbolic meaning. Unconditional love, loss, empathy, loneliness, relieve... The themes portrayed can be seen as simplistic and universal, yet they are extremely relatable, being the things we all long for or experienced along our way, which only increases their meaning. \\n\\n\r\nIf anime could ever been called an \u201cart\u201d in it\u2019s own way, then Mushishi is master canvas brought to life; it\u2019s art personified. The rich visuals, astonishing landscapes and the emphasis put into it\u2019s sound effects, creating a friendly atmosphere is what makes that animated work \u201calive\u201d. It doesn\u2019t try to ostentatiously convince you into it\u2019s cleverness, yet those willing to look beyond what is visible at the first glance will surely find something worthwile, as what you can receive through can be far more meaningful. There are very few works I will ever proclaim as a masterpiece, while giving them a 10/10 score and Mushishi is one of them. It\u2019s a title, which pushed the envelope far beyond my expectations and has become something far more significant in result, as it can change at least a small part of us for better. And im conviced that anyone, trying to check it out will be at least entertained by it.  Maybe they also won\u2019t see any Mushi, Monsters, Ghosts or Ninjas hiding below their bed, but maybe they will try to look honestly into the eyes of a beloved one, sit down in silence to listen through the symphony of their own body, think about their happy memories, not  as nostalgic transcience, but rather feel a gentle joy of creating the new ones, to look at the world from distance as a chess board of their infinite capabilities. Maybe they will value nature more and value people with indulgence, by the size of their heart, rather than their appearance, or perhaps they will finnaly try to trust someone and try to look up to the solutions of their problems through the ways they haven\u2019t tried before. To discover some of the world once more.",

It's as if the series is trying to implant upon the viewer Ginko's personality itself \u2013 thus leaving the audience to feel old, tired and lifeless. A single episode of Mushishi might destroy all the lustfor living you have piled upon yourself in a whole week \u2013making watching any more of it a real burden.

            "content": "To be completely honest, I never really got warm with Mushishi.\r\nNonetheless its still a pretty good anime.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nMushishis plot is completely episodic. Yet, every episode still is unique in its own way, with varying endings, plots and characters. Like a 20 minute movie.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThe backgrounds of Mushishi are really outstanding and probably one of the best backgrounds I've seen so far. The character designs on the other hand are mediocre at best. Besides main char Ginko everyone looks the same. The Mushi on the other hand have great and varying designs, making all of them really unique. Animations are fluent and nicely done.\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nThe bestthing first: Again the background. The OST has an awesome spiritual ring to it, which outlines Mushishis idea. Same goes for the ending songs, which are unique, yet similar to each other and blend in with the anime. As far as the opening goes, I think \"Sore Feet Song\" is a pretty average song, which still manages to fit to the anime just as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nWhich characters to begin with? There is only Ginko. And well, to be honest, he's basically just this good-willed anime main char, as seen times and times before. His background is only mentioned as sidenotes every now and then, which is more interesting though. Definitely better than just telling us 'Well, that's his background, deal with it.\". A real character development is missing as well, at least for Ginko. The minor characters of each episode develop by coming in contact with Mushi.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI already told you, I never warmed up with Mushishi, thus rather disappointing enjoyment.\\n\r\nStill, its quite the sentimental and deep anime, so if you like that kind of stuff, go for it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nNot my kind of anime, yet still a really good show.\\n\r\nRecommended if you like anime with deeper meaning.",

            "content": "I am reviewing Mushishi after a second viewing. I was really surprised about a lot of the elements of this anime, It's not a mainstream anime and definitely not something for everyone, especially if you only like fast paced animes or watching a lot of episodes one after the other. Mushishi is more of a relaxing anime and makes you think about your life and the meaning behind it. It's an episodic type anime. Each episode is separate and has no specific plot. It's mostly about Ginko, the main character, going around solving Mushi related problems and interacting with the people involved with these problems.A Mushi is a type of being that lives side by side with the humans but I will let the anime can explain it way better than me since it's not so easy to explain, the anime does it better (episode 1). I will now analyze the anime section by section before giving my final impressions.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIf it's episodic, it doesn't mean that the story has to suffer because of it. On the contrary, I find that Mushishi delivers quite well with short stories that are different one episode after the other. This type of story telling gives us the satisfaction of seeing the end of an episode as we know it really ended there. Another element of Mushishi is in it's various ending on it's 26 eps run. The ending can be, sad, happy or neither and leaves the rest up to you to decide on how you might have imagined it ending or what might have happened after. Mushishi has a great relaxing flowing story that focuses more on the characters telling you the story and really engaging you like if you were part of the conversation at times and listening as a 3rd person. Overall, the small stories makes it unique from other animes and leaves you with a great sensation at the end of the episode where you have time to think and relax your mind. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation in Mushishi is simply beautiful. The art really puts emphasis on the whole theme of nature and the background is so beautifully animated. The Mushi's are drawn quite nicely and gives us these vague and mysterious looking things. Their entire existence is kind of vague and mysterious as you will learn as you watch this serie. Nothing else to say for the animation except the fact that it really is gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack by Masuda Toshio is one of the best soundtracks I have heard in animes. He composed it so well that the soundtracks matches perfectly with the story and the situation that they are in. Also the ending song or rather soundtrack is different at the end of every episode which makes it easier to appreciate. It's easy to just listen to the ending song while rethinking about the episode. I sometimes found myself just looking at the credits while listening to the ending song. The soundtrack for this anime is just great, I have no complains.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIn this anime, the main character is Ginko and he's pretty much the only actual character that's a \"regular\" in every episode. Since this anime is very episodic, you will not see any character development but rather you will see bits and pieces of Ginko in every episode. Beside Ginko only the doctor and Mushi collector shows up in 2 or 3 episodes. Putting all that aside, the characters from every episodes feels real, they have a certain realism to them the way they act in from of certain problems or situations. You can in some sense relate to their problems and they pact they decide to take on resolving the problem. Overall, the character was good but sadly we don't any character development which would have it made it better. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this anime for various reasons which involves great music by Masuda Toshio, the amazing animation, the great short stories and down to earth characters that we can relate to. I really liked the ending songs changing from episode to episode which really matched with the ending of the episode. It leaves a calm feeling and makes you really think about the episode that you just watched. It also lets you think about life in a certain way.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime and I highly recommend it for people who like slow paced, relaxing and calming anime with life lessons at the end of every episode.",

            "content": "Mushishi to me, is like that one friend that we all have. You love seeing them... for about twenty minutes and then you realize why you haven't seen them for so long. \r\nAt the beginning i came into the show thinking that i could finish it in a day or two. Two years later, between falling asleep through episodes because of the blissful and calming music and dark art styles. To forgetting which episode i am up too, resulting in starting from the beginning, i can happily say Mushishi has been a pleasure to complete.\r\nThe premise of this story all revolves around Ginko the Mushishiand his travels throughout the land in search of helping people with mushi related issues. Every episode focus' on a new group of characters (with the exclusion of Ginko) and the problems they are going through caused by a type of mushi. Blah blah blah, i'm assuming everyone has already heard of Mushishi, if not you know where to find the descriptions. All in all, the stories are somewhat darker than what i expected which was a nice surprise.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was something truly unique. Throughout every episode is has been consistently dull, which worked in it's favor tying it perfectly with the story. The detail of surroundings and landscape were brilliant taking into consideration that it was created nearly 10 years ago. \\n\\n\r\nSound was a strong component to this show. It fitted the mood exceptionally well. Simple is better, much better. This anime doesn't go over the top with this component, which i feel is the reason it worked so well. Sometimes all a scene needed was a softly played instrument to set the mood.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was brilliantly done for the character that each episode was based around, which is hard because it is all episodic and got a fresh batch of characters every episode, but thankfully it worked out. I was however a little bit disappointed with the amount of personal background information our main man Ginko didn't get in season one. In saying that, it wasn't necessary to the plot and we still got some pieces of information here and there.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show was truly one of a kind. \\n\r\nNow time for me to watch season two, \\n\r\nsee you in two years.\\n\\n\r\nByeee.",

            "content": "\u201cMushishi\u201d is an anime that I would use as one of the best examples for \u201eartistic\u201c anime. An anime is artistic when the purpose isn\u2019t to tell the audience a normal story (which means it has distinguish start and ending, characters and everything else a \u201cnormal\u201d story needs) but to present them a creative work, so something other than normal.  \r\nLets look at the word \u201cArt\u201d before:\r\nThe very definition of art by Wikipedia already says: \u201cArt refers to works of creative expression\u201d\r\nWell art is a very subjective word, so everyone can make something and call it art, or claim that something he likes isjust simply art and if you don\u2019t like it you don\u2019t understand it.  If the person who says that or who creates art is famous probably all his fans will do so as well, which would explain all the weird shit in the nowadays modern art museum. Anyway, art in its core has the purpose to satisfy its creator. Often creators included little details which are there to inspire the imagination or the personal attraction to an artwork for the viewer. A deeper meaning is often the \u201ccreative expression\u201d art is supposed to have. But this deeper meaning is not always so clear. The hard work behind a picture, the years of training and learning or the endless failures to get it right one time is maybe the real reason for the emotions one has for his works of art. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t like it than it just simply doesn\u2019t appeal to you, it is not because you don\u2019t understand it. Like I said, art is a very subjective thing, some might say modern art is so special because it has some kind of deeper meaning involved, others might say something else. For me a stories itself have a lot of connection to art, since there can be hard work behind them, a deeper meaning and creativity. Those stories are for me even more interesting, but sadly the anime community has shown how little viewers are interested in hard work behind their shows. Shows that are creative in not only their story but also their artstyle or characters are either unnoticed or hated while producers milk the cashcows with the same shit that sells for years. Shows that make up over 90% of the anime that come out every season. That\u2019s why shows that want to break this manner with creativity are always welcome to me, if they prove me to be worthy to watch. And Mushishi is one of those shows.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn its surface is Mushishi an anime which is easy to go into. It has a very beautiful artstyle, which isn\u2019t that much unique and creative, especially not in their character designs. It shows a lot of nature, which makes it so appealing, since nature is not only a thing humans will always feel attracted to but is also a high selling point in the industry.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has a very fitting soundtrack for that artstyle, with calm natural tunes. And I think that\u2019s already why this anime is so populare and liked. If Mushishi had the same artistic artstyle and soundtrack as it has artistic storytelling it would have the same amount of fans as \u201cAku no Hana\u201d. I think as well that with only the artstyle and soundtrack and a normal story the anime would have been boring as hell, since the artstyle and the soundtrack are very unchanging. But Mushishi doesn\u2019t shine in its music neither its artstyle. It shines in something else. What would that might be? Well Mushishi doesn\u2019t have a continuing story with a baseline. Its characters are flat and uninteresting, especially the main character lacks of emotions, motivations and everything which would make a character realistic and interesting. He is simply an ordinary guy who tries to safe everyone. It would be euphemistic to call him a \u201cclich\u00e9\u201d character.  It\u2019s so called \u201cstory\u201d is completely unfocused and unimportant. \\n\r\nBut that is only because of one reason or purpose. Mushishi revolves around creatures called \u201cMushi\u201d, which aren\u2019t humans, neither animals, but something else and they are only visible to certain humans. This already is just a creative idea to appeal to a certain audience. In this show they deal with lots of different forms of this mushi and every time it\u2019s a little bit different. \\n\\n\r\nTo present a topic which should interests the audience. Nothing profound and deep, only something very simple but abstract and original. Something you probably have never seen before. That is its key, its only purpose. The rest is just the build around, the way the anime brings you this idea. If there wasn\u2019t some kind of story the ideas wouldn\u2019t be brought to the audience in this gripping way. The static and unchanging soundtrack and artstyle are only the ignition of the topics but made so perfectly together. \\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t tell you if you will like Mushishi, since that matters if you will like the topic it presents. I also didn\u2019t like every idea it presented. Some episodes where great, others uninteresting. I would suggest to try it out and see for yourself. But I would say since its very calm and nature like many people will be appealed by it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion: Mushishi doesn\u2019t shine with well written storyline, after all its an episodic anime, neither does it shine with interesting characters. But Mushishi shines with fire inside the viewer\u2019s minds, ignited by a simple picture, a simple idea. Everyone who doesn\u2019t understand that fact is probably one of those who likes the male lead (Ginko) and who thinks the anime is about the story failing to understand its purpose.",

            "content": "Mushishi, in every sense of the word, is an experience. Not only is it an experience for the characters that are told in the episodes; it's also an experience for its watchers. You feel sympathetic towards the people you watch. You only see them for a set time limit of about twenty minutes, but you may go through years of their lives. After the episode is done, you feel like you've known them personally. That's how real and powerful Mushishi feels.\r\nMushishi is one of those anime gems that really cares about the important things that made anime so great in the first place. One, isthe superb animation. Each episode seems to get a certain color range depending on the Mushi it sponsors. In one episode, the mushi was a type of purple flower and so every frame had some kind of purple hue to it. In another episode, the colors are bleak and gray until the very end when the mushi appear and burst into vibrant colors.\\n\r\nThese patterns usually happen in the beautiful backgrounds of Mushishi.\\n\r\nBy contrast, however, the humans are of simple design. Realistically, most characters have dark hair colors and plain clothes. This contrast forces you to look at the nature scenes and grasp their splendor.\\n\\n\r\nSounds also play an important role in Mushishi. Toshiro Masuda does a very good job at making the mood through this sounds. There is no melodramatic music of an orcestra or annoying j-pop/j-rock songs; just simple instruments and simple melodies that are very calming. Masuda also made all the ending songs, for Mushishi doesn't truly have one ending theme. This way it is better; it catches the mood for each episode quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nFunimaition provided the English dub, so if you watch any of their stuff you'll instantly recognize the voices and they do their jobs exceptionally well.\\n\r\nHowever, voice acting is not one thing Mushishi stresses on, even for the Japanese version. Everyone talks in a slow manner, and they sound natural (unlike most anime with screaming pink-haired characters). Sub or dub, you'll get a good deal here. Watching the dub will probably be the better deal, since then the focus is on the screen, not on subtitles.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the talking is finished, the most striking detail of all was the emotion you can feel in response to watching such a soothing and tranquil anime.\\n\\n\r\n Besides the obvious short stories that come out of episodic series, there is a back story that occurs throughout the whole series. But what it exactly it is is up to the viewer. The first episode had a quote that can resemble the series: \"Life in its purest form.\" In Mushishi, everyone is living their lives, along with the mushi. It's only when they interact with each other when things get complicated.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is one of those series that are best seen through animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is also an art form. An art that both entertains and makes you think long after the credits roll. It makes you want to pack up your things and walk through a forest. It touches the part of you that feels like there can be so much more to life just waiting to be discovered by finding yourself in a new town...\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Splendid animation that is prone to detail\\n\r\n+ Characters you can sympathize with\\n\r\n+ Not cliche at all\\n\r\n+ Is highly rewatchable\\n\r\n+ Unique soundtrack\\n\r\n+ One of the best dubs\\n\r\n+ Follows the manga almost frame by frame\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n+ Shorter than the manga\\n\r\n+ Not too many recurring characters\\n\r\n+ It leaves you wanting more",

            "content": "You need help with mysterious ghost-like creatures getting in the way of your life? Ask Ginko for top-notch assistance.\r\nMushishi: One of the most unique animes out there to say the least. An episodic series focusing on one character, Ginko, who is basically the only recurring character from start to finish. Knowing that to be the case, the series may be hard to get hooked on to. But in this review I will reveal why such a unique concept can be executed so greatly throughout the 26 episodes. In other words, I will show how Mushishi works as a whole.\r\nGinko is, broadly speaking, a true geniusand the hero of the series. Known as the Mushi Master, he is a credible source for any Mushi-related problem. Solving different cases episode after episode, you could label him a very dedicated man. With all the mysterious mushi dwelling in the dream-like setting of the series, Ginko can solve practically any problem that is related to mushi. And often times, the mushi are an invasive species. When that is the case, Ginko can exterminate the invasives and solve everyday people\u2019s problems. I think of Ginko as the guy who just loves what he does, and solves cases very intelligently. That is what makes Ginko genuinely human.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is always very relaxing and dream-like. And this type of anime qualifies for that kind of setting, being a episodic series with one main character. I could tell that a lot of precious time was spent creating these great background settings. They were truly beautiful and unforgettable. The background, along with Ginko\u2019s character, makes the anime so heartfelt. To have such a genuine main character, and also make the visuals just as strong, separates a good anime from a great anime. Mushishi accomplishes both of these aspects.\\n\\n\r\nI could easily tell that a lot of effort was put in for the episodes to make sense together as a whole, even while the anime did not have a continuous plot. The way Ginko solves the mushi-related mysteries is always very unpredictable and intellectual, and I thought it was great that it was consistent throughout all 26 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was the only weak point I could possibly point out. The music is absolutely beautiful, when present. But a lot of the time, the show remained silent in terms of music. It seemed slightly minimal in my opinion. I could have enjoyed the series even more with just a little bit more music in the background, especially at climactic parts. But that didn\u2019t even come close to ruining the anime for me. I was amazed by other things such as what I mentioned in earlier paragraphs.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is a beautiful work of art. There had never been a show like Mushishi, and there never will be another show that expresses similar concepts. 26 perfectly paced stories, legitimate character Ginko, and crazy good visuals make this anime a must watch for all kinds of anime fans. Why do I say to all kinds of anime fans? Because its so vividly shows such a unique sensory experience to all viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: a fantastic anime, 9.5 out of 10",

            "content": "Mushishi is definitely a masterpiece. Mainly because it is the most original anime I have ever seen. Well, of course, there are other very original animes. But to my mind, the difference is, that all those animes were later copied. The word \"copy\" might be to harsh. We could say that other animes, were created, following the same idea with more or less similarities, but I have not heard of an anime so similar to Mushishi, that you could say it is not original anymore. The scale of its uniqueness is still enormous, even if we compare it to other media. Well, you might say,that there are other episodic animes with weird stories and new character introduced each time. But that is not where Mushishi's originality lies. The point is in its atmosphere, the whole idea of the world, and the stories themselves. \\n\\n\r\nAnd those stories are my favorite part of Mushishi. To a person who hasn't watched this anime yet, I'll try to describe it. In each episode, the main character Ginko travels around the world and helps people with Mushi problems. And every story will be fascinating to everyone. Because at first look, those stories are just fun to watch. Some are goofy or hilarious, some are extremely emotional and sorrow and some just make you feel happy. But! If you try to dive into the depths of every story and understand it inside out you will find mushishi very thought provoking. Some episodes provoke thoughts quite easily, while others have the meaning hidden under heavy allegories. And that is why everyone will like Mushishi, deep philosophical problems hidden under simplicity and fun. And the range of those philosophies is pretty wide. From something as basic as connection between humans and nature to the complexity of emotions and the meaning of life and death.\\n\\n\r\nAnother amazing part of Mushishi is its atmosphere. It is truly outstanding because it's so soothing and relaxing that you could just fall asleep watching it. The environment is perfectly synchronized with with ambient sounds and music creating a unique atmosphere similar to Tarcovsky's movies. The budget does not seem to be top notch, and technically speaking its mediocre. But the director's work makes it up with usury. The idea of mushis and how they look helps a lot. They blend into the entirety enhancing the soothing atmosphere with those shining, tingling, wavy creatures flying around everywhere. All this sums up and becomes a phenomenon in the world of anime art.\\n\\n\r\nLike in every episodic anime, you will meet a lot of different characters that you will forget quite easily. Besides Ginko himself there are few important characters introduced in the backstories of Ginko, but the main story, or should I say stories, are concentrated around one-time characters. They are usually created in a way to help the idea of each story. Sometimes symbolic. But we also see realistic characters in episodes where they are psychologically analyzed. But no matter what kind of character it is, when you watch Mushishi, you get really attached to them feeling their pain and sorrow, or joy and happiness. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you are wondering if this anime is your type. I'd say wonder no more, because Mushishi fits almost every type. Except maybe action, but to my mind, action lovers will enjoy the relaxing atmosphere as much as everyone else.",

            "content": "\u201cThe glow from the light in a house during the winter is a welcome sight to creatures, beasts, mushi and humans alike.\u201d\r\nMushi are spiritual life forms that are neither plants nor animals nor microorganisms and are invisible to most humans. They have no specific reason for their existence and very little data is available on them. Although they are mostly passive, certain mushi are dangerous to humans. Mushishi (or mushi master, however you\u2019d like to call it) are experts on mushi who travel across the country researching these mysterious creatures. \r\nBefore I go into the story, let me start off by saying that theconcept of mushi and their existence is brilliant. The mushi world the characters live in is spellbinding and you feel yourself being drawn into their mysterious and beautiful world. To make the viewer believe in the existence of supernatural creatures to this extent is a feat that only Pokemon has managed to achieve.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Mushishi is very simple \u2013 Every episode, Ginko goes to a new village, where he sees a person who is suffering from an illness caused by a mushi and decides to help the victim. Although all 26 episodes of this show follow the same format, it never gets boring or tiresome at any point as each episode deals with a new kind of mushi, which are intriguing to say the least. While some mushi just cause mild deafness, some mushi rip the soul out of the victim\u2019s body. And it is up to Ginko to restore them back to normal. Although the storyline is deceptively simple, the treatment of the theme makes it gripping. Watching a doctor trying to find a cure for an unknown disease has never been this entertaining. While some cases are slow paced and have a detective-like feel to them, some are action-packed and exciting. As the series progresses, the problems get more complex and the atmosphere becomes darker. But I\u2019ll get to that later. The way normal human sickness symptoms are linked with mushi is really well thought out.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is an episodic anime that consists of a set of short stories and can be watched in any random order and it would all still make sense. Each of the stories is derived from Japanese folk tales and therefore has a significant amount of detail attached to them. The plot twists and turns unpredictably and there is never a dull or predictable moment in any of the 26 episodes. Just when you think you figured out what was going on, a revelation is made out of the blue and this shatters the crux of your speculations.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is stunning to say the least. Mushishi features some of the most beautiful artwork I have ever seen. The forests and mountains are done artfully and create picturesque sceneries of rural and sub-urban Japan. The animation quality improves greatly as the show progresses. The characters look very realistic, a bit bland though. The village folk fit perfectly and they all look just how they should be. The mushi look very cool and have a spiritual aura and an unearthly feel to them. I cannot emphasize enough how wonderful the art is. \\n\\n\r\nThe music takes you on an absorbing journey throughout, the oriental instrumentals adding to the charm \u2013 another success story by Toshio Masuda. Every single track is soulful, absorbing and soothing. Every episode has a different ED. And each of them is done well. The OP is an English song called \u201cThe Sore Feet Song\u201d and is a charming piece, with a breezy acoustic guitar strumming in the background to the pleasant vocals of Ally Kerr. The background score does a wonderful job in setting the mood.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing the audio department can be really proud of is the sound effects. The wings fluttering, snow crunching, crickets chirping, leaves rustling, waves crashing and every minute sound is done to perfection. Hell, it is so detailed that you can hear the change the voice in the characters when they are talking outside and when they are talking inside an empty room, where it echoes. The voice acting is subtle and not overdone anywhere. I would recommend both the dub and the sub as they are both excellent.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in each episode are completely different, with the sole exception of Ginko. Since the characters are all villagers, they are depicted as simple illiterate farmers. In each village, there are a new set of characters, each with their own voice actors. The cast list is nearly endless because of this. Ginko\u2019s doctor friend appears in a couple of episodes and the voice of Nui can be heard during the opening and closing narrations. \\n\\n\r\nGinko is a very simple character. He is a very friendly and likeable person. Although not hesitant to put his life on the line for saving a patient, he is a very calm and composed (sometimes laidback) guy who has a certain teacher/professor air about him, probably because all mushi masters are basically scientists. The show does go into his past, but rarely.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost episodes/arcs have a bittersweet ending, which is never loose-ended in any way. Each episode also has a satirical message, which is pretty deep and goes unnoticed unless you completely grasp the situation the characters are in. Once you manage to understand the underlying meaning of the episodes, you will find yourself marveling at the creativity and subtlety with which it was handled. The quality of the episodes remains consistent till the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe feel of the show is outstanding. Since the events that take place affect only rural and middle-class Japanese, the viewer gets a wonderful insight into real Japanese culture and tradition. It even focuses on certain delicate topics such as forced arrange marriage and social exclusion. You feel yourself drifting along these tiny villages and getting a taste of their lives. While the series starts out as Ginko dealing with minor illnesses, you see him handling extremely dangerous ones in the later episodes. The already atmospheric show becomes darker and at times you feel yourself being engulfed by the power of the mushi.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the series is not climatic in the least, but then again, you don\u2019t watch Tom & Jerry hoping to find out whether Tom really catches Jerry do you? That being said, the episodic and slow paced nature of the show might not appeal to everyone. This is not for those who expect a trite thriller that gets your adrenaline pumping while moving towards a catastrophic culmination or a fairy tale slowly travelling towards the much awaited poetic justice. It is a journey in which you are a fellow traveler along with the mushi, mushishi and the villagers. Your experiences may not be spectacular but may linger and leave a\\n\r\nlong lasting image in your mind. If you liked Kino\u2019s Journey, Natsume Yuujinchou or Haibane Renmei, then you can\u2019t go wrong with this show.\\n\\n\r\n[ THE WRAP-UP ]\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is one of the most unique anime out there. With an exceptionally original concept and a definitive atmosphere to it, this one is a real show-stopper. Having only one character appearing consistently in every episode, things never get repetitive. The show follows the definition of the word \u2018episodic\u2019 to the T and maintains the quality of the episodes throughout. The animation is superb and features some of the best artwork I have ever seen. The soundtrack is filled with oriental tracks that is soul stirring and the sound effects deserve special credit. It does a wonderful job in setting the mood. The OP and the EDs are fantastic as well. Once again, the formula of \u2018realistic approach to a supernatural concept\u2019 is applied and fits like a glove. Each episode is the kind of short story that you want to curl up with during a rainy afternoon or a lazy Sunday. Overall, Mushishi is the kind of anime that I would pick up after a couple of years and fall in love with it all over again. There really is no reason that this anime deserves anything less than a 10.\\n\\n\r\n~As always, feedback of any form is appreciated. Thanks you for your time ^^ ! ~",

            "content": "I know what you\u2019re thinking, you have looked at Mushishi and heard it praised, but the premise of it just doesn\u2019t sound too interesting. The premise is very basic and perhaps boring at first glance, but this could not be more untrue. The fact of the matter is that Mushishi is masterfully executed, in pretty much every aspect. In the world of Mushishi, small life forms exist called Mushi. The Mushi has no other purpose than to live and reproduce, which makes their interaction with the world interesting and without judgment. Since these Mushi know no empathy or emotion of any kind, the results ofMushi range from miraculous to catastrophic. You would think that Mushi could be exploited by humans, but the catch is that only very few people can see them. Our main Character Ginko can see these Mushi and makes his living by being a so called Mushimaster, who travels around the country (which in Mushishi is rural Japan) helping people with seemingly mysterious problems. Ginko is different from other people, in that he has white hair and only one eye. Why this is, is explained in an episode, so I won\u2019t go further into it, but it results in him having to stay on the move as he attracts Mushi.\\n\r\nBeing the main character and only recurring character Ginko, as a character, has a lot on his shoulders. Luckily he performs his role masterfully. He is completely unique and he never gets old. I think I could watch a thousand episodes of Mushishi and never get tired of Ginko. Ginko focuses on his discoveries within the Mushi field, and you can genuinely tell he is fascinated by them. Despite of this Ginko always manages to help out the people to the best of his ability, while still trying to preserve the Mushi. While doing this he always remains calm, collected and respectful to those around him. Ginko is meant to be the star of the show and carry it to victory, which you might think is a lot to put on his shoulders, but he does so flawlessly. There are other new characters in each episode, but these are not nearly as interesting as Ginko and you pretty much forget about them in the next episode. This is the result of an episodic anime and it is hard to avoid, but I will not criticize it too much as Ginko himself more than makes up for it. \\n\r\nAnother great strength of Mushishi is how philosophical and mind-pondering it is. It raises questions such as \u201cIs all life equal - and should it be treated as such?\u201d and \u201cIs there limits to how much humans should interfere with nature?\u201d, while never giving anything but a hint of the answer forcing the viewer to think for himself. This is something I value highly in animes and movies in general, and Mushishi does it to the highest level.\\n\r\nEach episode of Mushishi has its own story and premise and there are several times years between episodes, which definitely helps strengthen the mystery that solves Ginko and the Mushi. It works to Mushishi\u2019s strength that it is an episodic anime. By not seeing every one of Ginko\u2019s moves it feels like you are being told a story, where you get the highlights. This story is Ginko\u2019s life as a Mushimaster. The pacing in each episode is also picture perfect. You never feel rushed into a situation. You usually get a small backstory to what is happening and then you see Ginko showing up. You are pretty much always on par with what\u2019s happening, which is extremely important in an anime as philosophical as this one. \\n\r\nAll in all Mushishi is a very well executed series. The pacing is never off, Ginko is the show\u2019s superstar and performs to the highest grade and the premise of Mushi is much more interesting than it appears on first glance. While I didn\u2019t touch upon it great detail the art and sound are pretty average. This is not an anime to watch for its art or sound quality, but they do their job and don\u2019t let you down.\\n\\n\r\nThe good:\\n\r\n-\tVery interesting premise and setting\\n\r\n-\tAmazing main character in Ginko\\n\r\n-\tFlawless pacing\\n\r\n-\tVery entertaining\\n\r\n-\tHighly philosophical\\n\r\n-\tForces the viewer to think for himself\\n\r\nThe bad:\\n\r\n-\tForgettable characters besides Ginko\\n\r\n-\tAverage art/sound quality\\n\r\nFinal score:\\n\r\n-\t 10/10\\n",

            "content": "Nowadays the anime industry is littered with violence, sex and for some reason moe shows. It is not like this is a bad thing, in fact, there are many shows that belong to these categories that are very entertaining to watch. However, just once in a while, animes like Mushishi emerge from a world full of chaos, bringing with them a different but very much needed change of pace.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nMushishi records the journey of Ginko, a Mushi Master who travels across the country to help people in trouble with the Mushi. Mushi are supernatural creatures that seems to exist on a different plain entirely, andsometimes their lives would interfere with that of humans, causing us problems. What is different about Mushishi though, is it's episodic nature. Each episode of Mushishi contains a different plot line entirely separate from one another, and except for Ginko and a few others, all of the characters showed in a story will never be seen again. However don't be alarmed as this is exactly where the beauty of Mushishi lies. While other animes with overarching story lines just tell its single tale and then leaves you to find something else, Mushishi has many profound messages to deliver, and the audience will always have a variety of things to relate to. Furthermore, each episode is an exploration of an aspect of a certain theme in life, and as the audience join Ginko on his journeys, they also learn this and that, making the show very life like and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem Mushishi has due to its nature is that sometimes characters would look similar to one another. But the true focus of Mushishi is as I mentioned above, telling the story of life, and because of that, the characters only serve as mediums to deliver you the message. The best part of Mushishi's art is instead its scenery and the Mushi themselves. If you loved the look of Mizayaki's Princess Mononoke, then you are going to enjoy Mushishi's art very much as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Mushishi is absolutely amazing and sets the mood very well. Just like the rest of the show, it is very calming and relaxing, and there are many tracks that could stand by themselves. Animes and other medias do not get me emotional very easily, but accompanied by its soundtrack Mushishi did manage to bring me to the verge of tears.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, many characters in Mushishi do not return after their story is over. The person that does stay with the audience however is Ginko, the Mushi Master. Despite Ginko not being the focus of the story in most of the episodes, through his journeys we learn about his nature and the type of person that he is. To me, that is very interesting because instead of being told who he is, we slowly interpret Ginko for ourselves. And in the end, each person who watched Mushishi might have a different opinion of Ginko. Just like how in life, different people will see you differently.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't put in to words how much I enjoyed Mushishi. It's unique, it's beautiful, it's meaningful, it's memorable, it's everything I want in a good anime, no, a piece of art. Mushishi had proven to me that anime can serve as a medium to convey the profoundness of life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEven if you're not a fan of soft, relaxing shows like Mushishi, you should at least give the show a watch some time before you kick the bucket. It is an experience that I believe that everyone should go through, and I guarantee that if you give it a chance, you will not regret watching it.",

            "content": "Mushishi is one of my all time favorite anime's the score given because at a realistic view it does have its problems\r\nThe story isn't exactly put together in one entire season, more of a series of mini stories involving mushi (which can take a little getting used to depending on your tastes) but overall the story is drawn together and shares interesting plot points as an episode.\r\nThe art and sound are BEAUTIFUL. depicting water colored backdrops whether its a forest or looking at the cliff of a mountain. The sound also makes you feel like you're drawn into Japanese culture as you are watching thestory unfold as well as the aesthetics of both calming you and giving you the relaxing feeling you are looking for.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the main character development is lacking. You don't find anything out about the main character's history or backstory in depth, basically it is just rolling with the punches. And considering the episodes are completely different each episode, you don't find anything out about the characters in the story  after the episode is over so its easy to forget them. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment value is good as long as you're willing to give it a chance and use your noggin when watching the episodes. Its more of a thinkers anime rather than a balls to the wall action story but it holds it's own in a different way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall with the mixed score I have to give it a 7 out of 10.The story is ok but never has a huge plot point. Basically each episode being  a mini story about mushi, and the ending could use some work (then again thats usually an anime's weakness lol). The art and sound are a beautiful mix which is relaxing and breathtaking, which goes along the same beauty as the major movies mihuzaki has created. Character development is lacking and needs a little bit more padding on Ginko's backstory, And it will only fit certain audiences if you are willing to give it a chance and are a fan of episodes that make you think and make you have to focus to understand what is going on.",

The characters are so well done, even when they only appear for one episode, you truly feel for them in the end.\r\nMushishi evokes many different emotions while viewing it. Some episodes may have a really nice ending, while others can be really sad. The drama is top notch, and very believable, thanks to the characters and great voice acting. The beautiful backgroundmusic amplifies these effects.\\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the anime (the beautiful art, serene music, compelling story) is what pulls me in with every episode. The entire experience of watching Mushishi is unbelievably calm. The more pulled in I am, the more relaxed I get. Thus, the soundtrack itself becomes a huge stress reliever~ It's almost as if I were watching it in my head as I listen; the serene nature of the anime is relayed through the music, and all those feelings I have while watching it come back to me. Listening to the OST, something I do everyday, is the best way to relieve stress. It really works wonders for the anime, especially when considering the quality of animation maintained throughout all 26 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI have yet to see an anime series animated as beautifully as Mushishi is. Everything was so well done, you can tell they spent a lot of time translating this from the manga. The Mushi are reminiscent of the creatures you would find in a Hayao Miyazaki film, the Kodoma of Princess Mononoke perhaps. They have a certain magical aura, a mystifying presence, that makes you want to see more and more of them.\\n\\n\r\nBeautiful art/animation, brilliant use of music, with very touching/moving stories~ even with its episodic nature, where most characters only appear for a single episode. The pace of the anime is really slow and relaxed, but not to the point of being boring~ It is just right =)\\n\\n\r\nI know I can't get enough of this Mushishi~ It is an anime which should be seen by anyone who enjoys anime~ If you watch it, maybe you will feel the same as I do ^__^",

            "content": "Story - An episodic masterpiece, a real delight. This was one of the most intriguing stories i have seen so far in my anime watching life. It made me want to watch it twice (once in english, once in Japanese. I can say that japanese is still always better, it just feels that much more authentic).\r\nAnyway, its about a travelling spiritual healer of sorts. The spiritual beings he deals with are called mushi and are essentially the essence of life itself. The healer travels from place to place for various reasons following various rumours. And ends up dealing with heaps of different kinds of Mushiand hearing the stories attached to them. It was a clear 10/10 for me though, the ending was a little bit of a buzz kill, i can't help but feel that way.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The Art was great and the landscapes were magnificent. the mushi and the 'light vein' were fantastic features in the Art which really brought the story to life. My main complaint is that to many of the extra characters in the different villages looked pretty much the same. Was that some kind of asian joke?\\n\\n\r\nSound - Music was very well suited and had that traditional oriental feel about it. Nice effects etc. as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The main character was an enigmatic one i enjoyed very much. His charisma and general manerisms were interesting to watch. It was a particularly interesting factor that they leaked the main characters history bit-by-bit throughout the series. Extra characters all had interesting stories to tell about how they had been afflicted by mushi.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - this anime is a very captivating one and i was always desperate to see the next episode which rates as well-enjoyed in my books. it definatly has some great re-watch value as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Great anime, nothing more need be said.",

            "content": "i will be 100% honest with you guys. i know you are reading this review because you have doubts whether to watch it or not because IT LOOKS BORING. admit it!  i honestly admit it! because im a fan of ACTION PACKED animes so at first glance it looks boring from the cover art itself up until the description. Last year i tried  watching this series because of curiosity like \"What the hell, a boring anime on top like duh\" and episode 1, to be honest i only watched the first four minutes and my reaction was  \"its so boring !the dialogueis boring the story telling is soo boring\" and i immediately closed the tab and never watched it again (the opening song is so beautiful tho) until last week i decided to give it another chance and tried to bear the boringness of the introduction but i realize the importance of it. for those who plans to watched this ill give you a simpler explanation.\\n\\n\r\nMushi is \"BUGS\" in Japanese, Mushi is also a term used to describe an organisms that CAN'T be seen by the naked eye. /e.g. like our souls, ultra violet rays etc./ But the protagonist GINKO and some selected people has the ability to see and interact with them\\n\\n\r\nGinko is a mushi-shi(mushi master) some characters in this series gave him weird looks because they cant see a mushi and misunderstood him as a Bug/insect master whenever he introduce himself, LoL\\n\r\nMushishi is an episodic Anime which means you can watch any episode anytime and every episode has different and interesting stories (my favorite is episode 3). This series is very relaxing and an eye opener i usually watch 1 to 2 episode every night a good bedtime story. the art is beautiful as well as the animation and the expressions of the characters is also good. Some episode will make question everything about your own existence like when you put your hands in your ear you can hear a volcano erupting or like how do people really sleeps because when you close your eye you can still see your eyelids but when were already asleep we only see pith black do we have 2nd eyelids? and something like that. Some stories goes very slow but you wont attempt to skip even a second because IT WONT BORE YOU im telling you IT WONT. and yes i regret not watching it the first time but im happy that i already did! so watch in now and thank me later :)\\n",

            "content": "Note: This is my first review on the site.\r\nSTORY: \r\nThis is not as easy to review an episodic show since there is not really much of a story. It's basically about a man name Ginko who goes around and helps people with strange beings known as Mushi. \r\nWhat are Mushi? Well, allow me to tell you. Mushi are the most basic forms of life in the world. They exist without any goals or any purposes aside from just simply \"being\". They are beyond shackles of the \"goods\" and \"evil\". Mushi can exist in countless forms and are capable of mimicking things from the natural worldsuch as plants, diseases, and even phenomena like rainbows, for example.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its episodic nature, I feel like it works well with it. The stories are well different and show us what has happened to the people who are contacted to the Mushi.\\n\\n\r\nThough my only problem with the episodic nature is that sometimes the stories feel a little rushed. I have nothing wrong with any of the endings of the episodes since they do seem fit well with the situation with that certain episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe story gets a 9/10\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is one of the best points in the show. The atmosphere is breathtaking and did get you invested into its world. The character designs never bothered me to be honest. It takes awhile for you to get adjusted to them. \\n\\n\r\nThe art gets a 9/10.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI was not sure what to think of the sound at first but it is not that bad if you think about it. It might just be me but the opening reminds me of this song called \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\" by The Proclaimers (maybe because of the beat or that they are both catchy).\\n\\n\r\nThe ending themes are all instrumental and really nice to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really outstanding and I liked all the pieces of music in the show and didn't hate a single one.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub is really good. The voices seem to fit well with the characters and yeah they use the same actors sometimes, but there's nothing wrong with that. The most outstanding one is Ginko, played by Travis Willingham. I have nothing wrong the japanese version at all, it's just that I like the dub (though who knows when Aniplex will dub Mushishi Zoku Shou).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound gets 10/10.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWell to make it easier on myself, I will talk about Ginko, the Mushi Master. Come to think of it, the Mushi Master reminds me of Ghostbusters for some reason. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, he is one of the best characters I have seen in an anime. He has a certain charm to him. Since I watched this dubbed, I really liked his dub voice. I don't mind the japanese voice for him but I am just used to Travis Willingham as Ginko (though that would take a while for me if I wish to start Mushishi Zoku Shou since who knows when Aniplex will dub that).\\n\\n\r\nGinko is an interesting character. He seems to know more about the Mushi than we do and sometimes he might not be who we expect him to be. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters had a purpose to be there and seem to be a purpose to be there. There are recurring characters but I shall not spoil them for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters gets a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show. Not at one point did I feel like I was bored. The stories kept me interested. \\n\\n\r\nThere's not much I can say on my enjoyment. It gets an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the best anime I have ever seen. The atmosphere, Ginko, the soundtrack and the episodic nature is really good. Though I can understand if you don't like episodic-type shows.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this show a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this to anyone who enjoys episodic-type shows. \\n\\n",

            "content": "-SPOILERS WILL BE AVOIDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, SO ANY MINOR SPOILERS ARE UNINTENTIONAL-\r\n(This is my first review on MAL, any criticism is appreciated)\r\nMushishi is one the most unique anime ever created. The Drama and Adventure is second to none, and it is a overall beautiful series. There is a thin line between a good episodic anime, and a bad one. Mushishi is by far one of the best, and will be for eternity.\r\nStory-10:\r\nAs previously mentioned, Mushishi is an episodic show, and each episode has a condensed story with a beginning, middle, and an end. Each story usually revolves around some sort of Mushi-a spiritualcreature that simply lives, with no other purpose in life to fulfill; the most basic form of life-, and how it's affecting a certain character. The thing that sets Mushishi apart from other episode anime is that each episode is better than the last. For example, if you (hypothetically) thought that episode 12 was the best, as soon as you watch the next one, your mind will change, and using our example, your favorite episode would now be episode 13. And that's the beauty of Mushishi, although the formula never really changes, you will never, ever be bored.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation-9:\\n\r\nSo imagine that you were watching this in 2006 and seeing the animation of Mushishi. Your mind could potentially be blown. The animation is not necessarily fast, and the art isn't colorful. However visually, Mushishi is extremely realistic. The slow but particular animation, the beautiful landscapes, Mushishi is fantastic in the visual department. Each background is drawn to the utmost of detail, and the wind blowing the leaves all over the screen, the characters moving in a very human-like fashion,  it`s just gives it the sense of realism that so little shows can achieve today. There is one problem however, and that is that all of the character models are drawn in almost exactly the same way. Ginko is one of the only recognizable characters, and even he looks very similar to everyone else. Now I`m not sure if it was a problem in the manga or if it was the anime producers but it can be somewhat distracting and difficult to distinguish between characters visually, which is sad because many of the characters have wonderful personality and development (which I will get into later). In short, it doesn't measure up to the art and animation of some newer shows, but it still is far above average.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10:\\n\r\nMy feelings towards the soundtrack for Mushishi can be summed up in one word; beautiful. (I'll be using that word a lot, so be prepared) Each track of the OST is composed so wonderfully, adding atmosphere yet also directing your attention to the music. The Opening is slow paced yet pleasant, a very calming song to a very calming anime. The ending changes with each episode, yet they are all so outstanding, I sit through the credits every single  time just to hear the outstanding tracks. The voice actors are outstanding, but more on that later. What more can I say? I listen to the Mushishi soundtrack every single day, it's just so incredibly calming.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10:\\n\r\nIn terms of character design, there is a issue, being that almost all of the characters aside from the main character, Ginko, look alike. However this is made up tenfold once the character's personality is revealed. The characters in many of the stories of Mushishi get more development in a single episode of screen time than many characters get in an entire series. As for the voice actors. Never has there been a show that I can say has better voice acting than Mushishi. There are many child characters in the series, and unlike many other franchises, the children are voiced by children, and it just sound so natural. Ginko's voice actor is also outstanding. Now on the topic of Ginko; he is one of the best male leads in anime history, or at least one of my favorites. His back story is wonderful, yet tragic. (without spoiling anything). And he has a very likable personality. The characters of Mushishi are among some of the best I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Recommendation-10:\\n\r\nBased on this review, I think it's not hard to tell that I like Mushishi immensely. However, Mushishi is definitely NOT for everyone. If you like action-packed shows, or overarching (complex or not) plots, and slice of life, episode adventure do not, then I don't think that you'll like it. But, I still think that everyone should at least watch around 3 episodes before making a final decision. Who knows? you might just like it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10:\\n\r\nMushishi is one of my all-time favorites, and what i consider to be one of the greatest shows of all time.",

            "content": "Hello... this is my first review, so I apologize if many mistakes in there.\r\nDon't judge the story by its cover. It's my impression for this anime.\r\nI always looking for anime like this. Although I ever seen this anime on Top 50, but because the anime was not popular like Steins Gate, FMA Brotherhood or Clannad and Shigatsu, I mean it never became a topic of discussion in some Indonesian Anime Group, and I never heard the anime,  so I not too interested with this anime.\r\nBut, my friend told to me and recommended me to watch Mushishi, he says that the score of anime washigh (of course it's on top 50) then suggestion me for watch it, he says it surely, so I watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watch first episode, I think this anime will make me bored. Bored anime bored anime, lol. But after I watch it, I feel relaxed and enjoy. I want to watch again! give me more!\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, lets see the anime\\n\\n\r\nThis anime giving us the stories between Human and Nature around it. Like in the synopsis, Human was life with \"Mushi\". A \"being\" that can't be seen with all Human. some \"Mushi\" are capable of mimicking things from the natural world. They have an odd shape. This is the most Interesting point.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character just one, he's Ginko. He was a \"Mushi-shi\". Mushi-shi are those who can see a \"Mushi\" and researching them, and because of that he had a journey. He wears a white plain clothes and jeans (he looks cool when the setting was in past period).\\n\\n\r\nI really like the story, very interesting. In every episode, we will given a different story. The conflict between Human and \"Mushi\" will remember us, that human are nothing without nature, and humans need nature. In each episode, Ginko will solve the problem of the conflict with his knowledge of Mushi. Seriously, I love this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThen, for the art and graphics, its very simply. The art seems \"dark\" and the graphics aren't stiff. I think it's suitable for Fantasy-Supernatural anime like Mushishi.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the sound, really relaxing.\\n\r\nFor opening song, it's really fooled me in the first time. I think, becasue the opening is so \"Romantic\" then the anime will have a romantic story, but until end I did'nt find any romance story.\\n\\n\r\n\"Every single night and day.... I searched for you.... \\n\r\nThrough sandstrorm and hazy dawns... I reached .... for you...\"\\n\r\nVery romantic lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nFor ending theme is an instrumental song, and every ending have a different song. You will enjoyment the anime until the end of the song.\\n\r\nNeither Opening Song, Ending Song nor Background song are so great. Very suitable for the anime. I'll give it 10\\n\\n\r\nFor the character, they're amazing. The depictions not rigid, and they follow the plot. Really natural.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, I really enjoying the anime. Amazing story, beautiful \"dark\" art and soft graphics, relaxed song,  and natural character are amazed me.\\n\r\nThis anime very recommended for who like soft and SOL anime with adventure, the slow plot will make you washed away when you watch.",

The whole series is very slow, but it does not drag; it takes its time, really allowing you to enjoy each scenario and contemplate the message.\r\nArt: Beautiful background shots that look like they came out of a museum. The characters (besides the main) tend to look like each other, but that could be deliberate (people are more connected or alike than they think). The mushiall had clever designs, and were fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: A really lovely opening song. I didn't mind sitting through it (and I normally skip the openers). The background music was simple, but conveyed the feeling each episode was meant to. I watched the dub, and I think Travis Willingham was a great choice for Ginko; he has a soft, soothing voice that isn't flat or monotone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The main character, Ginko, was a great example of how a character can be subdued but not boring. His gentle actions really set the tone for the whole show. Every supporting character had distinct personalities, and made each episode lively.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A great show for relaxing.

I can see that this show isn't for everyone, but it can be watched casually by anyone since each episode is individual.

I have no clue how people can rate it so highly. The art is very low, to the level when you won't be able to distinguish characters. Story is very repetitive and it's not progressing anywhere. The main character is absolutely boring there is nothing special about him and it doesn't look like he would progress anywhere within 6episodes. \r\nThe only good point that it has is probably the idea, soit has a good potential I would say but it's definitely no good in how it actually is. Though the same type of idea has many other animes that are composed better and having better quality of art. I can't imagine how it can outmatch Hotarubi no Morie in rating, as I wouldn't even dare to match those two together. From my view point, Moshishi is not even half as good as HnM. \\n\r\nFor me personally it was a huge disapointment.",

            "content": "Mushishi does not march toward some sort of conclusion or final purpose. Much like it's main character, Ginko, the anime merely drifts around, dispensing bits of wisdom and wonder. It is an almost zen-like meditation on the mystical unseen natural world and holds many parallels to our own lives, as it deals mainly in the unanswered and mysterious questions that we all find ourselves asking in life. It excels at acute observations on the state of humanity and revels in our lack of understanding. Most importantly, it romanticizes the things that we do not understand and creates a new language to describe it's nature. Thislanguage is the Mushi, an unseen force which holds great mystical power. This series plays out like a sort of collection of folk tales concerning the Mushi, centered around a sort of sage who helps people with their problems as he wanders the Japanese countryside. It is quite slow and is probably not for everyone, but if you have patience and a sense of wonder about the natural world, you will almost certainly gain something from this.\\n\r\n\tThis anime is beautifully drawn. Taking place mainly in the forest and small villages, the show contains an unfathomable amount of painstakingly painted backgrounds. You don't really notice how beautiful it is after a few episodes, but the fact that there is never a significant dip in quality to call your attention to it is impressive in itself. Characters are a bit more generic looking. Because this anime is meant to have an aesthetic quality similar to that of a restrained traditional Japanese painting, there is no overt craziness in the character's designs. They all have dark hair, wear traditional Japanese garb, and life in modest homes. What distant visual flare there is comes from the atmospheric and believable settings that the show dwells in. The caves of a tunneling Mushi, a foggy sea, a field set ablaze, and an inescapable bamboo forest are all brilliantly infused with personality and a sense of realness that is uncommon in animation. The Mushi themselves are also highly creative at times.\\n\r\n\tThe series score is done by Toshio Masuda, also the composer for Naruto. The music here is restrained and has an almost improvisational feel to it. Each episode has it's own piece of accompanying music, which is nice, however many of them sound the same. Repetition also sinks in when the few other pieces, like the one used when Ginko is describing a Mushi, are used EVERY episode. I will say though, the opening theme, \"Sore Feet Song\" is absolutely amazing. It conveys the feel of the show perfectly and for all 26 episodes, I never skipped through it. It prepares you perfectly for the quiet and contemplative experience you are about to have.\\n\r\n\tMushishi, as I said earlier, dispenses bits of wisdom about the age-old relationship between mankind and nature. The story, if you wish to call it that, is all about different people and their experiences with the unknown and the unexplainable. The show never really makes any assertions on good vs evil, right vs wrong, etc. Instead, it makes simple observations about the things that exist in nature and twists them into bizarre phenomena. For example, it details the experience of closing your eyelids vs truly not seeing or actually finding the end of a rainbow. Although there is peril in many of these stories, they are usually resolved through natural and logical means. If there is one overarching message, it is that things simply are. Trying to control what simply is is a futile exercise. In this way, the series draws similarities to the Zen Buddhist outlook on life and existence. This show is, in-fact, as close to a meditation as any piece of popular entertainment I have seen. \\n\r\n\tSo what is wrong with the show then? As I just said, this show succeeds brilliantly as a meditation. However, It fares less well in terms of entertainment. Despite the show being beautifully done, If you know what the conflict and resolution is going to be going into each episode, you kind of lose interest. In each episode, you know after a certain point that there will be a problem which at first seems unexplainable, it will be explained as being the work of Mushi, there will be some way to fix it, and everyone will go home. Although there are deviations from this outline, they are somewhat rare. The real reason to keep watching is not to see what happens so much as it is to see what there will be. The scenarios and settings are sufficiently interesting and beautiful to keep you wanting to return to this world. However, you may become fatigued, as I did, and take a break for some more straight-forward entertainment.",

            "content": "Mushi-shi.\r\nThis isn't an anime series like many others, the closest to describe it would be a Studio Ghibli movie in serial form, perhaps. It is comparable there, in the ethereal and inventive and spiritual nature of the plot, which centers on the beings called mushi, and those who study them, more specifically, Ginko, a man that always seems out of place compared with everyone else.\r\nWhile every character in this series, other Mushi-Shi included, usually dresses in classic traditional japanese attire, he seems to wear western shirts and clothing. While the character designs of every other character is apparently made to look as down to earthand, well, realist, as possible - while definitely not lacking a certain charme and beauty, indeed , I found them an extremely nice change of pace from all those ridiculously colored punk hairdos you see so often in other anime that they totally lost any kind of rareness appeal to me - Ginko has green eyes and white hair.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, most of the time, Mushi-shi puts the humans into the center spot of the plot, even though everything is connected to the Mushi, it's all about human plights and people's reactions to them. Sometimes with rage and fear, sometimes more gently, but either way, the only one seemingly unaffected seems to be Ginko, altough even he is portrayed as a genuine human being with his faults and sometimes his emotions overpower him as well, although he seems like a serene wise most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Mushi-shi is barely comparable. And not just the visuals, it ties together with the sound, the chiming, eerie music that usually plays when mushi-shi appear, the long camera pans and scenes that simply showcase the silent landscape and nature, and the visual effects, especially, again, when the mushi appear.\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned the character designs seem simple, but each person is different enough not to be confused with any other, and although black hair and a certain look prevails, that's intended to showcase that yes, this is indeed ancient japan, not out of a lack of creativity. \\n\\n\r\nThe individual episodic plots are quite nice, the only downside to it all is, of course, that you do  not have an overarching story, except perhaps how you get a closer and more succinct picture of Ginko's character and heritage. The greatest part of it is definitely the multitude of different mushi, and especially the way they are presented: From the point of view of a society that studies them, it is never said: This is how it is, and those you saw are exactly all mushi that exist, on the contrary, it summons a vivid idea of billions and billions of mushi that exist in Mushi-Shi's world but simply have not appeared, and although the focus is on Ginko, it also showcases a few other Mushi-Shi, all seemingly weird, special and unique. It even has some interesting ideas about how an organisation like theirs could work, being without apparent hierarchy and all.\\n\\n\r\nBut the most important thing - and the one that made me compare it to Studio Ghibli, besides the fun and amorphous spirits that oh so frequently feature there - is the fact that you really feel: Someone put all his love into this work. Every single scene seems to tell me this, the charming characters, who are all too human with their problems and their reactions, the ethereal mushi, the landscape: It all seems to be crafted with utmost care.\\n\\n\r\nThe slow english intro theme is just as unique, and seems to express the mood of Mushi-Shi perfectly:\\n\r\nSlightly melancholic, filled with love, speaking of long journeys and the small but very important moments of peace and happiness that make life worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nI could probably write pages more of praise of this, in one way or ther other, but in brief:\\n\\n\r\nThis is the stuff that makes me realise why I like to watch anime so much.",

To see things differently than they are. That some of the least important things have the most effect on life. With the story, there was never really something that was the same. Each episode was it's own story. Some were about life in mountains, some were about life in towns, there was one with a traveling person, and a few episodes that have Ginko's past. The art was wonderful. All the colors were vibrant. Everything lookedawesome. Mushi-Shi is set in a different time era than the current time, and the art shows that. How everything was brighter and more alive before factories and other large buildings came. The art has all the colors in the rainbow and the shades to match. The sounds, too. It matched every scene perfectly. The ending themes also ended each episode in it's own way. The opening seemed to show that Ginko is traveling to get some place important to him. The characters were great, but most of the younger boys looked the same. They all had the same nose, eyebrows, mouth, and eyes. That got a little annoying. But Ginko comes into the scene so I didn't really care too much about it because Ginko looked totally different in a new way. I enjoyed this show a lot. It was very interesting. This show never failed to disappoint me in any way. Everything was just about flawless. Overall. This show deserves a ten. Just because it was calm, no action. Just life and how humans and other creatures interact with each other to thrive.",

            "content": "Mushishi is a collage of very simple stories set in a very complex world, very much alive. It will not score many marks on character, drama, action, or tension, or any of the things that tend to captivate viewers. It remains, in spite of all that, compelling; and because of all that, refreshing. \r\n\tIt's not possible to talk about Mushishi and not talk about the setting. The setting makes the story, and the character. In Mushishi, we have Mushi as the fundamental life-force of the world. For most, these remain invisible, for some, they are objects of curiosity acquiring tangible form, for a few, theyare a fact of life. Mushi are integrated into every aspect of the world: a place without Mushi is barren and lifeless, but too much of it spells disaster and invites tragedy. \\n\\n\r\n\tIn many ways, the setting of Mushishi mimics life: Mushi themselves are incapable of good or evil, that is why they are simultaneously beneath human morality and above it. They are part of nature, part of a grand balance. The balance is constantly shifting, changing, but is a balance nonetheless. As humans, the question is whether to accept this balance, and coexist with it, or to fear it, and attempt to master it.\\n\\n\r\n\tThere is a second facet to the world of Mushishi. As always, the human element exists secondarily to nature. Expecting something more akin to Kino's Journey, I'd been surprised when I realised that the story was set in an alternate Edo-era. Part of this decision on the part of the mangaka, I suppose, was due to nostalgia, and part of it, I think, must be due to the idea of coexistence. Perhaps it came down to a very simple question like: how did people live before machines? And before industrialisation? And perhaps most importantly of all, before they lost their vital link to nature. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe world is alive, and fluid, it is not just a blank tablet made for humans to carve meaning into. To exist, then, one must also coexist. \\n\\n\r\nThen we come to the characters. Ginko is the name of the man. White-haired, roguish, stoic, dressed in distinctly western garb, (and not to mention somehow popular with both the gents and the ladies) he is in many ways the outsider, and as a result of that, he is who we identify with. Ginko is human, flawed, apathetic, eccentric, which makes him all the more endearing (I speak for myself) and  relatable. Simply put, Ginko is the Red Schuhart of Mushishi.\\n\\n\r\n\tGinko does not belong anywhere. He does not hate people, nor nature. He gets along. Likewise, he does not hate mushi. It is through his eye(s) that we see the world in all its ethereal and Lovecraftian splendour (I will explain the Lovecraft parallel later). Yet he is always the visitor, the drifter. There is something that enthralls every Romantic, the idea of walking the world, without goal, without ambition, just taking in everything, and being alive. Something Chris McCandless would have agreed with, surely, but perhaps not the 'alive' part. I digress.\\n\\n\r\n\tGinko is more than an outsider. He coexists. He belongs in the natural world of Mushi, just as much as he is ill at ease in the human world of, well, humans. Ginko is part of the setting, part of the living world. It is not man against nature but man with nature, man as part of nature, and vice-versa, and so on. \\n\\n\r\n\tI suppose, one might see mushi as characters in their own right. Like people, they are capricious, having their own needs, stubborn. But they are not people: theye have no motives, except insofar it serves their bodily needs. They have no agenda but for survival. They are not capable of deceit. Like Ginko, they are misunderstood. Like Ginko, they come and go. And not unlike Ginko, they are nature.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe structure of the series is episodic. Every part can be watched separately in no particular order, which complements the content perfectly. There is no real beginning to the story, nor any ending. The conflict and coexistence between human and mushi will endure.\\n\\n\r\n\tOther than the worldbuilding, another keystone to Mushishi is the tone. The sound and the visuals synergise with each other to weave a sense of serenity. I have few words to say about the visuals. I'll admit that I have little by way of taste, but I can tell you that they are quaint, and calming. Various mushi seemed to be modelled on real creatures, so that they are familiar but enthralling.  The colours seem subdued, so that you always feel as if you're looking at a corner of a great rolling painting, rather than at a jumble of them. Still shots are common, and Ginko often alone, but it manages to be neither melancholic nor foreboding. There is always the sense of wonder.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe music compliments tone, the best I can do to describe it is that it's about 'being' and not 'doing'. There are no hectic marches, no heroic anthems. In the same way that the plot is more about existing and restoring nature, the music exists: it goes nowhere, it just is. One might even see Mushishi as a Taoist work. The concept of a balance mirrors that of the 'Tao', and the idea of living simply and mindfully tallies with 'Wuwei'. In a way, the music underlines Ginko's principles: it is not as though Ginko cannot act; it is that most of the time, he refrains from doing.\\n\\n\r\n\tFinally, let me end with the Lovecraft comparison. There's no need for me to go into detail. The topic has already been thoroughly discussed by JeffersonAirship in his post titled 'Mushishi: the Anti-Lovecraft' which you can peruse at your leisure. The gist of the matter is that whilst both works deal with superhuman natural forces: sometimes gargantuan, often dangerous, always unpredictable, Mushishi accepts what Lovecraft has rejected: the idea that humans are insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Yes, there are things too terrible to call creatures lurking all too near us, yes, we are so tiny that they do not even notice us, yes, if and when the do notice us, we perish, and yet, Ginko shows us that we can still live in knowledge of them. Lovecraft would treat mushi as a lore rightly forbidden; Ginko seeks mushi and seeks to know everything about them: the reassuring truth, the ambivalent truth, the unsettling truth. All. In a way, Mushishi is the enlightened view to Lovecraft's Luddite-ness.  \\n\\n\r\n\tI have noticed that I've given Mushishi unimpressive scores on most of the criteria, and for some reason it still holds a special place among the anime I've watched over the years. There are facets and nuances that simply cannot be captured by a ratings. The bottom line is that it's a fresh perspective for things we have too long taken for granted. Things like nature, coexistence, mastery, and our place in the Great Chain of Being. The setting is at the centre of it all. Character, plot, music and art all revolve around a world that is fluid, immutable and unknowable. Ginko and the mushi are interwoven into the very mystery of nature.  Perhaps we are, too.",

This show has mysterious wonderfulness and never bored great storytelling. At first, this show is truly masterpiece for me.\r\nProtagonist is Ginko. He is very wise guy, and know human's feeling well. One of my favorite male characters. Upon watch this show, no problem if you focus him. \r\nMain story also simple. Basically, Ginko solves various phenomenon about Mushi. In a word, rich in variety. Each episodes are deeply thought-provoking about life.\r\nWhy people subject to living? What is true life? Future of Ginko? These doubtexist in this show. And It's eliminated beautifully. Just like solve riddles.\\n\r\nTBH, It's better to relax and have fun. The reason is that whole atmospheres are quite calm and stable. Despite core is serious. Haha, that's what good about it.\\n\r\nGinko is admirable adult on the surface, but that truth is he has painful past. His essence is same with other people. Anyways, he is mass of existential reason.\\n\r\nIn order to understand his being strongly, you must watch this show. Really sad but remain holy hopes. So Ginko is a person worthy of respect.\\n\r\nPeople have each unusual trouble. Part of people may unsaved. However, to solve them is Ginko's job. At the same time, that is his reason for living.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, it's perfect. It animated in detail and splendid. Especially nature named forest. Firefly also colorful.\\n\r\nAnimation also great. Disorder don't exist at all. Because of standing pictures are many. Nevertheless, there are intellectual.\\n\r\nMusic of this show is art. Opening is English, and lyrics are profound. This show's symbol. Really eargasm and peaceful. Just awesome.\\n\r\nVoice acting is well done. Ginko's voice is sugary and cool. You definitely love his voice and performance. As far as I heard Japanese version.\\n\r\nCharacter development is amazingly nice. Ginko is attractive character. I also like Adashino and Karibusa. They're people involved of Ginko, and good personalities.\\n\\n\r\nFlaw is only this. Main characters are less.\\n\\n\r\nI love this series so much. Once again, Mushishi is one of the classics and very interesting content. I praise this show's author and anime staff.\\n\r\nIf you loved this show so much, you should watch Zoku Shou and Specials. These also great as same as first season. Mushishi is forever.\\n\r\nI have original manga and first season Complete Series. That's how much I love it. Rarely treasures.",

            "content": "Mushishi is like a consistent, actionless, more personal version of Kino\u2019s Journey. Like Kino, the main character Ginko goes from town to town learning about them. It would be nice to be able to talk about Mushishi solely in contrast to Kino\u2019s Journey, but according to MAL, Mushishi is many times more popular. \r\nGinko studies the mushi (a supernatural phenomena) in different areas Gotta-Catch-\u2019Em-All style and it appears that is his sole purpose in life. In his studies, he happens to help the townsfolk negatively affected by the mushi Ghostbusters style. That\u2019s about all there is to say about Mushishi plot-wise. Mushishi is solely episodic.\\n\\n\r\nYou don\u2019t watch Mushishi for the plot, however (not this season at least, haven\u2019t seen the rest at the time of this writing). Mushishi is all about atmosphere and getting the viewer to open their minds and think about each scenario in each episode. This approach to storytelling is done almost flawlessly in Mushishi with impeccable consistency. I\u2019ve never seen an episodic series where every episode has the exact same high quality atmosphere and pacing. You can read my review of Kino\u2019s Journey for a contrast. \\n\\n\r\nMushishi is perhaps the best anime in its genre; however, this is a genre that doesn\u2019t appeal to me personally much. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ll take a philosophical episodic masterpiece any day, but I won\u2019t rank it as high as a plot masterpiece like Monster, or a space opera masterpiece like Legend of the Galactic Heroes. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that I didn\u2019t like about Mushishi was the lack of character design. Every character looks the same and it bothers the ever living crap out of me. This will tank the \u201cart\u201d score. Otherwise, Mushishi is absolutely gorgeous, from the scenery to the mushi, it\u2019s all beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: The somber, actionless, episodic nature of Mushishi is bound to leave a large number of people bored out of their minds, even some without ADD. Given that, the fact that Mushishi is so highly ranked in MAL is a testament to what a masterpiece it is. You don\u2019t get to be the best in your genre without getting noticed. Not to sound arrogant, but if you found the way I described Mushishi earlier boring, you\u2019ll more than likely find Mushishi itself boring. If you did not find it boring, you will more than likely love the anime.\\n",

Also, each episodes provides an emotional conflict in each individual Ginko comes across. Ginko is our main character and he's a Mushi-shi,  a wise white-haired mushi exorcist who discovers and an omniscient of the mushi. Previously mentioned, each individual Ginko come across have emotional conflicts and at the end of the episode, we the viewers experience different dilemmas which coincidently, different mushi are taken part in. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is so calming and relaxing sometimes mystical, mixing traditional Japanese folklore and Buddhist music. There are two opening songs and let me say, like the show, you feel the emotion and passion the world of Mushi-shi presents to the viewers, drawing in to see the absolute beauty of Mushi-shi\\n\\n\r\nMushi-shi is a visually artistic show that you can absolutely love; the large amount of atmosphere, emotionally investing story, and intriguing dilemma the show conveys. A coming of age episodic series that is beloved and critcally acclaimed. Mushi-shi is a personal journey for us viewers to evolve and appreciate the wonders of life, even if they're downsides of life itself. It's definitely worth watching, a show you can calm your mind and feel the relaxation. Mushi-shi is truly beautiful in narrative and art form",

            "content": "Setting. \r\nWhen you open up, start up, whatever Mushishi, that's the first thing that will be apparent - the main 'characters' and art complement each other perfectly to tie together a beautiful world not too far removed from our own. \"Characters?\" (I like to think) I hear you cry? But there's only the one white-haired dude? Well, there is him, Ginko as he's known, but each episode (and this series is episodic, taking on a 'monster-of-the-week' style format) introduces a new 'Mushi', a kind of bacteria-like organism that, as stated in the bio, have no other purpose than to just 'be', 'live'. \r\nWhat I liked,and what did strike me straight away is, even if the mushi were in the form of something terrible such as a disease, they're not 'evil'. The team did not 'cop out' so to speak, I mean these mushi just exist to live, they don't know what they're doing is destroying someone's life. And sometimes, they're just harmless lights, other times, they're a goddamn beautiful rainbow! \\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry I keep gushing about it, but the art and world-building/setting is the highlight and selling point, in my opinion of course. For example, Ginko, in his travels (there's a reason he wanders which I won't spoil, is nothing of massive concern though), wanders to a fishing village. Of course there's fisherman and a story contained in just this episode, but to me, the misty water, the weather-beaten shacks, the overcast sky with rain just waiting to pour - it's all very atmospheric and when Ginko travels to villages that have forests (my second favourite natural place IRL, only second to the ocean), and just the sunlight hardly filtering in through the canopy, secret little pools with catfish (which is a reference to japanese mythology, thank you Mr. Gaijin Goomba), well, it's an experience, almost as good as going to a hidden forest in untouched countryside out there, in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap this, the intro song ia fantastic, one of those songs you wish you could play on guitar (I'm trying!), the ending is also brilliant, and there's some action-y type music in the episodes which complement the scenes they're in. I haven't touched on character because talking about the mushi would spoil the episodes, and Ginko's character and goals are pretty much explained in the bio. But yes, a wonderful series that really shines in it's world and the atmosphere the world creates. A beautiful masterpiece. Easy 10.",

            "content": "This is what I would call fairy tale ( or fairy tales ) for adults. For me the anime was a long-needed proof that you don't need to have insanely elaborate story-line with shallow relationships and bizarre characters to make an awesome anime.\r\nI would certainly recommend this for anyone who likes a little bit artistic and peaceful story. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who thinks that it takes huge explosions and people screaming their special ninja-karate-magic attacks at people.\r\nMost important thing to say, which occurs to me after looking at the specific review fields below:\r\nthis anime doesn't have anything that could be any differentfrom what it is. I felt that all the contributing factors make up into a very good package of entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nI found the animation rather beautiful, however, not as beautiful as I would've hoped. \\n\r\nIn some of the episodes I wish they would've stuck to normal animation instead of using painfully obvious 3D animations and effects. However, they didn't take away too much of the enjoyment.\\n\r\nOther then that it's visually very soft and pleasant to look at. Some people might yearn after big and watery eyes but I never felt so. The characters and the atmosphere blend nearly perfectly together and neither take away attention from the other.\\n\\n\r\nLike with the animation, I felt the music sat very well together with the whole thing. It wasn't something people would rush to download I think, but it served it's very important purpose on making the whole anime nice and peaceful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn the anime at least there actually doesn't seem to be any grand plot. It's merely a series of tales of a man dealing with mushis in various ways. One may think that this is a bad thing but personally, I thought it was nice. The makers of the anime knew what they were doing and didn't try to insert anything more complex then what was necessary.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the stories per episode, I thought they were quite fun. It was interesting how they explained some myths and such with mushis. I also liked the explanations on what mushis were and why they did what they did. \\n\r\nThe stories in each episode were simple and very likable. They may have been a little philosophical but not in a way that's painfully obvious nor were those philosophies ever delivered by showing the ( usually ) main character on close-up saying something would-be deep. It was left for the viewer to realize in the way they wanted, if they wanted.\\n\\n\r\nThere is only really two characters in the series that show up more then once. However, the people that showed up in the stories were pleasant enough with a lot of variation when it came to personality. On looks they may have all looked a bit too similar, however I didn't see this as that bad of a thing: rather have the believable looking characters that don't stand out much then have vividly designed characters that take away the attention from the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe character that stood out most but still fitted very nicely with the atmosphere was obviously the main, Ginko. He is cool but not brooding ( for a change ) and does have a little story of his own that explains his history. However, the anime does not make a huge fuss about it. \\n\\n\r\nThe other character that stands out only because he has a monocle is Ginko's... I want to say \"friend\"... who seems to collect things related to mushis ( something also addressed ), however save for two episodes he doesn't really do anything groundbreaking. Well, that goes for the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, the anime doesn't really focus on any character any more then is necessary for the story. It does not try to sell itself on characters that are really sexy, intriguing and such. Which somehow for me at least seemed to result in much more interesting characters then.\\n\\n\r\nI have already watched the series twice and no doubt I will watch it completely again. Goes very well together with a rainy summer day and a cup or two of tea.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not that the anime is so incredible, it's just that it's nice and relaxing like your favorite fairy tale.",

So it's neither deep in storyline nor deep in character development.  The artwork are music are also very simple.  There are better serious anime out there.

            "content": "I first came into contact with Mushishi through a snippet of footage seen in an AMV. I still remember that particular fraction of a second quite clearly, so striking was its' aesthetic. I won't give anything further away here.\r\nI watched Mushishi over the course of a fortnight. It became the thing I looked forward to in the evening and rapidly took second place out of all fictional works I have ever experienced. \r\nMushishi is, as closely as I can define it, an absolutely charming collection of ghost stories. Told from an unknown point of view, it follows a single lone traveller through an old land- a country that has not yet seen the march of human progress, a country that could be old Japan, old Britain or old Germany, but for the language the people speak. I say this because the stories feel as though they could happen anywhere, and the people feel as though they could exist anywhere, and the landscape looks as though it could be anywhere. This 'anationalism' lends Mushishi a feeling of timelessness, and it allows each story to be told to anyone, regardless of home or way of life.\\n\\n\r\nIt resembles, in some small ways, pre-Christian British and European folklore - stories about land-gods and spirits that are not human and can never be human and can never understand humans. Stories that happen to be united by a single calm, inquisitive character.\\n\\n\r\nSome of these stories, under the surface, convey a very important message, and one that cuts deep: desperation, in the form of possessiveness or hope or stubbornness, festers quickly. Others are rather more fatalistic: if you are in the wrong place at the wrong time you may suffer ill fortune that you did not deserve: what matters is how you respond to it.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Mushishi is restful. It does not tell Western stories in that it does not necessarily rely on action or drama or even interpersonal strife to drive it - in fact in several cases, it feels very much more like a documentary that just happens to catch details and events in peoples' lives in passing. It tells spiritual stories and sometimes those stories sit behind events which even now are inexplicable to most of us - a waking coma, or autism, or early blindness.\\n\\n\r\nIn even-shorter: Mushishi is incredibly hard to define in that overall, despite being a story about the inhuman, it is one of the most human anime that I have ever watched. It plays in subtlety and minimalism, and tells an even more powerful story precisely because its arrangement somehow resembles real life.",

            "content": "Story & Characters\r\nIn the world of Mushishi, there exists a form of life known as \"mushi\" - strange creatures that are more primitive than animal, plant or bacteria, yet are closer to the source of life than any of the former. Although only a few people can actually see the mushi, they interact with the world in bizarre ways. It is not (generally) in their natures to cause harm, but their entirely alien natures means that when human and mushi interact, neither comes off better. This has led to the rise of Mushishi - people who mediate human-mushi affairs. Ginko is one such mushishi, aman who is constantly traveling from village to village to study these mysterious beings and the effects they have on people, trying to help out where he can. Each episode of Mushishi follows Ginko's journeys through a world that resembles rural, medieval Japan. Although the series is episodic in nature, there are a few recurring characters besides Ginko because Ginko will occasionally return to a village to check up on the friends he has made there.\\n\r\nThe series is essentially a \"mushi of the day\" type of show as there seem to be an infinite variety of the creatures; no two remotely alike. However, unlike hero series where the \"monster of the day\" always ends up in a battle (with recycled footage), Ginko is not always trying to fight the mushi unless he is given a good reason to (i.e. it is deteriorating the life of the villagers.) Ginko is more of a researcher than a mushi exterminator (although the show implies most mushishi are of the latter mindset) so the mushi battle episodes are greatly interspersed with mushi investigation episodes and help keeps the series from being too repetitious or predictable. This also helps maintain the portrayal of mushi as being utterly foreign to our understandings, not as malevolant beings (with a few exceptions.) Because of this, the story remains relatively peaceful and subdued, and one that makes you think instead of one where you can tune out and watch people fighting crazy things.\\n\r\nSummary: The story is simple and episodic, with each following a general formula (Ginko arrives at village, finds mushi, deals with mushi) but the variety of mushi and people that Ginko interacts with helps maintain a freshness for each episode. As the series progresses, you can see how Ginko truely cares for the people and mushi that coinhabit the world and often gets emotionally involved in events, allowing the viewer to also develop an attachment to people and events. If you're looking for something other than high-school romantic drama or fighting mechas, this is a good series to try out. Besides, with its episodic nature, you can check out a few now, see if you like it, and come back a good time later to see more if you decide to continue with the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art of Mushishi is subdued and simple in nature, which is fitting to how the series is presented. The colors are often in a dull grey/brown/green palette which helps set a somewhat somber (but not dark) nature to the show. There's not a whole lot of variety in character design (except for Ginko, with his surprising white hair and green eyes) or scenery (there are only so many ways to portray a forest or a rural village.) If it weren't for the different mushi themselves, the artwork for the scenery and people in each episode would be interchangable. However, the true variety lies in the design of the mushi. They can be glowing, floating jellyfish, or feathery birds, or a rainbow with the colors inverted, or a white bamboo in a grove of green. Each mushi's form is generally relevant to their nature, and there is plenty of variance in that.\\n\r\nSummary: Simple artwork with a subdued palette, there's not a lot of variety in a rural medieval Japan setting, but the amount of different mushi help address the lack. Effective, but nothing to knock your socks off.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nVoice acting: Sort of like the interchangability of the character art (except for recurring characters), their voices are fairly interchangable as well. Although competently done, unless you tie character art + voice + story + mushi together, it can be difficult to tell people from different episodes apart. Thankfully the few recurring characters do have distinct voices (Adashino-sensei is voiced by the well-known Yuji Ueda, who also voiced Honey and Clover's Morita, Love Hina's Keitarou and Kenshin's Sanosuke, among others.) Ginko also maintains a distinct voice, but my favorite performance was Mika Doi's Nui, who portrayed Nui as a reclusive hermit who is old before her time, yet manages to develop a deep attachment to Ginko in the short time they are together. She also does well as the narrator, using the same elderly voice that conveys authority to the narration.\\n\r\nMusic: The music of Mushishi is fairly quiet and simple but still very beautiful and haunting. No heavy orchestral workings in these songs - they rely more on simple piano/synth and a lot of traditional Japanese bells and chimes, which helps it maintain the medieval Japanese setting. Most of the music is slow and somber, but then most of the episodes are slow and somber. There are a few fast-paced pieces that are used when Ginko is fighting a music, but for the most part the music is soft and idyllic like the episodes. The opening song is a little ditty that sort of reminds me of a Bob Dylan piece (except the words are more easily understood) with its simple harmony and stylings. The lyrics fit the series well (it talks of traveling) but took me a little while to get used to.\\n\r\nSummary: Relatively bland voice acting (with a few exceptions) but a soundtrack that really sets the stage for the story and scenery.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\r\nMushishi is a relatively simple series artistically, musically, and in the set-up of the plot, but the content of each episode, and the relationship between humans, mushi, and how Ginko deals with them can be very complex. Due to the episodic nature, it's hard to get attached to anyone except Ginko himself, but the degree to which Ginko gets attached to people and places makes you at least want to try. The episodic nature also means that you can go back and watch any episode you feel like if you found any particular village or person or mushi rather interesting. This series is suited for people who want a more thoughtful series at the expense of gorgeous art, action-packed battles, extensive character development and teenaged angst, and is aimed at a slightly more mature audience.\\n\r\nThere are a lot of comparisons between Mushishi and Kino no Tabi considering both are episodic series that follow a person traveling from land to land and learning about the people/nature of each place. There are some major differences between the two, which actually makes me enjoy both series better:\\n\r\nKino is the detached traveler who takes Star Trek's Prime Directive directly to heart; she almost never gets involved in a country's business, and sometimes goes out of her way to maintain her distance. Kino no Tabi is a showcase of different lands, each one with a dark and horrible twist at the end that makes you go WTF and think the author is smoking something serious. Kino's detachment allows you to view each country from an outsider's perspective and see what the locals cannot, what makes their land utterly absurd and ironic.\\n\r\nGinko is rather the opposite - he goes out of his way to help people in very place he visits, often coming back several months later to see if he had truely been able to help. He can and often does get deeply, emotionally involved in the situations he comes by, even if he knows things will not turn out the way he wants. This makes him an accessible character and one you can emphathize with, and his fascination with the mushi and their endless variety are transferred to you. With each episode, you wonder, as Ginko does, what sort of people and mushi he will encounter, and what he might be able to do to help both.\\n\r\nIt's refreshing to get different perspectives on world views, and I like both series because of it.\\n\r\nSummary: Simple, thoughtful series. No action or angsting here. Probably why I like it so much. Am definately interested in checking out the manga.\\n\\n",

I haven't watched this kind of anime  in a long time . \r\nStory : 10\r\nStory is magnificent . Talking about unnatural phenomes and people that are connected with that . Episodes arent connected with each other . Each episode has its own story and background that is one of the best animes in history . I can't beilieve that writer had such imagination .\r\nArt: 9\r\nArt is a bit ofold but I like it that way. I didnt give it 10 'coz I'm used to new animes,new ''art'',I started watching animes recently,maybe that's why . \\n\r\nWell its not old anime but it's not new generation .\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nI really don't pay much to sound but this anime but there is that song and I kinda like it so its 9 :D \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nWhat else to say than brilliant . Characters are unique . Best of them of course Ginko. A boy who lost mother in early days and becoming one of the greatest mushi shi-s . Always calm and full of understanding and above all COOL . Dealing with whole bunch of mushi-s and also caring about them not just people because they are also part of this world and things that make this world .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nI wolud gladly say i enjoyed watching these episodes . Every episode was new and exciting. Every mushi was different ,different people having  different problems  and all those research methods and paranormal stuff . It kinda gives me chills.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 \\n\r\nI said it beggining, a piece of art and one of the best animes i watched so far . When you see it on myanimelist you think look that man standing there ,nowhere girls to find etc . I thought like that too but I wanted to give it a shot and I was suprised . Don't ever judge a book by its cover! Ty about your reviews it helped me a lot to think about this anime to watch or not and sorry about my bad english.\\n",

            "content": "Mushishi is a unique anime series. Here was my reaction at the end of every episode: \"Hmmm... Huh... Ahhhh...\" (while nodding my head with a slight smile). What kind of reaction is that? Pensive, I suppose.  \r\nMushishi isn't a story that tries to blow your mind with unthinkable ideas - it's just the opposite, really. It takes simple concepts that you don't normally think about, and then portrays those ideas in clever ways that then entice you to go climb a mountain and ponder it for a while. Or take a peaceful nap. The music, imagery, and dialog is all very soothing. =]\r\nEvery episodeis about a really laid-back guy named Ginko, who aimlessly travels around helping people with problems involving colorful creatures that are invisible to most peoples' eyes (sometimes they're glowy insect things, or like gooey parasites, or they blend in with nature in some way, for examples). There is no over-arching plot. There is no mystery, suspense, action, romance, high-level drama, or even a lot of character development (Ginko's in every episode, but the episodes are rarely actually about him). \\n\r\nWhile I say there's little character development, there are practically no \"stock characters\" in the entire show. All the one-shot side characters Ginko helps are truly treated as if they were real people. (That wear kimonos.) Oddly enough, at the same time everyone in Mushishi is rather... well, a normal, everyday person. This is not typical for anime, or fiction in general, to be honest - but it works. The situations everyone ends up in for every episode makes the show plenty interesting. \\n\r\nHaving said this, I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Some episodes are better than others (as in all animes) but overall there really isn't much I can say bad about the show. Just make sure you're in the mood for something quiet and slow-paced. For allegory, Mushishi's not a series of explosions - it's a bonsai tree. \\n\r\nOne freaking awesome bonsai tree.",

            "content": "Mushis are primitive beings, described as the essence of life itself, basic and pure. When Mushis gather, supernatural events tend to occur. Most people can't see Mushis, but there are those that spend their entire life interacting and studying the critters. They are the Mushishi.\r\nAnimation wise, Mushishi delivers a very different impact with its simple character designs, colored almost entirely in pastel hues. The animation, though simple, is dreamlike and fluid as it flows from one vignette to another. Through out the series, it retains a somber mood, rarely broken with action, humor or visual comedic devices.\r\nMushishi unfolds as a series of individual stories revolvingaround Ginko, the white-haired, one-eyed travelling Mushishi. The series' slow pacing delivers the impression of an after-dinner storytelling session by the fire. There is no particular order to the series; each story is a one-shot deal, a bonus for those who hate episodic arcs. The mood of each episode varies with each Mushi, all beginning with the dreamy guitar strings of the opening theme (It is good to note that the series has no ending theme. It changes in every episode). Several episodes are amusing and lighthearted, some dark and sinister and others, simply thought-provoking. Behind the seemingly simple and child-like narratives that often precede each story, we are treated with glimpses of philosophy, culture and Japanese customs, all superbly done.\\n\\n\r\nAn obvious disadvantage of the series is its lack of action and climax. Unlike other anime series whose episodes lead to, well, something, Mushishi does not do this. It continues on a parallel, with occasional curves and dips but does not conclude. This can take a while to get use to, but 5 episodes in, the lack of action won't matter as the engrossing storytelling takes over.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one impressive anime, without the frills of excess, perfect for cold rainy days with a mug of Maggi curry at hand.",

            "content": "Mushishi is a masterpiece\r\nAn episodic supernatural tale about a mushishi named Ginko travelling the world to solve problems caused by mushi beings that transcends the understanding of reality and possess god like powers.\r\nBecause of this set-up each episode is unique, inviting and is executed to its fullest potential.\r\nDue to fact that mushi can see and interact with people but people can't interact  or see  them(except for a minority) its interesting to watch the effect they have on the human society and how some people use or abuse the power that the mushi hold. For example an island town uses a certain mushi toreincarnate citizens on the verge of death.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Mushishi is godly to put it simple. That being a bit of an exaggeration but they are really god. The scenery for the anime is stunning, vibrant and gives the impression that this anime is based in the early times. The character designs are rough yet mature and match the anime very well, you won\u2019t find any moe girls or walking breast in this anime which is definitely a plus. The only flaw to the character design is the fact that basically all supporting characters look the same but this doesn\u2019t hinder your experience as the mushi design in the stronger selling point. As stated in the synopsis mushi are depicted as beings from another world and this really shown in the art. The mushi come in all different colours and sizes with some accompanied by a mystical glow. SO to wrap it up I give the art 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound has been used really well. The voice actors all did a decent job in matching the characters and the protagonist was given a voice in which don\u2019t mind hearing for 26 episodes.  The background music is matched well with the setting of the anime , you\u2019ll be hearing the tune at the right times with causes this anime to transcend above others. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP is a wonderful song that in some way matches the whole travelling aspect of this anime, the OP is also visually appealing with its water coloured paintings filling the screen. The ED is quite peculiar in the fact that it is just text with a black background for about half of it, then pictures of fauna fade in from the darkness. But what\u2019s really peculiar about the ED is the music, there\u2019s no vocal just instrumental with a supernatural twist but it leaves me with goose bumps and the urge to watch more of mushishi.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the supporting characters in this series only stick around for one episode max with the exception of a mushi collector but despite this the guest characters of the episode get a background story with a tinge of character development and it\u2019s not done half assed so you\u2019ll definitely be hit in the feels to some degree every episode . The star of the show Ginko is a perfect match for the series. To put it simple he has a carefree attitude, intelligent, wise and get serious when the time calls for it. What\u2019s nice about ginko is that he also provides some comedy relief and the timing of it is good. \\n\\n\r\nThis is anime is no doubt one of my all time favourites and out of all the supernatural themed anime it stands on the top, overtaking natsume yuujinchou. Despite how much I love this anime and how good I say it is, I don\u2019t recommend it to everyone. The anime is quite slow and when I say this I mean it feels its length. You\u2019ll come across a lot of series that feel longer or shorter than they actually are for example how mars of destruction felt like 40 minutes then 20. Because of the slow pacing in each episode a few heads will turn.\\n\\n\r\nAn anime that feels like a fairy tale\\n\r\nThis anime is a once in a decade series and should be given a go.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you're thinking of giving this anime a chance, then please, go for it. Mushi-shi is very unique and very episodic. My personal opinion to you, this is an anime that I wouldn't recommend binge watching. It's that special kind of anime that you keep tucked away for a rainy day and just pull out to watch an episode or two. If you are the kind of person who likes to see animes with a bunch of tits, explosions, autistic male MC's (see my IS review), and boooooooty shakin, then this ain't for you. \r\nNow, I will try to explain the anime very quickly andkeep it short because if you want a huge review, look at the other people that put more effort into it than my lazy ass did. The anime centers around our main character named \"Ginko\" who is a mushi-shi. In this world, there are thinks called mushi that are supernatural in their own way. They can have both good and bad affects to the people, animals, and the environment around them. You go from episode to episode seeing Ginko travel to different places and try to assist those who are affected by the Mushi-shi in a bad way. There is no continuous story and each episode has their own little story with different characters and settings. \\n\\n\r\nFor the settings, stories and characters in these episodes, they were done well. Nothing over the top and nothing really annoying. Some are done so well taht you even get an emotional bond to one character even tho it's only for one episode. I found the soundtracks to fit very well with the anime itself. The mushi in each episode were also very interesting in how they interacted with humans and how Ginko tries to find the solution. The art style is old fashioned but is very nice and the environments are beautiful. All-in-all, I enjoyed every episode and had no problems with it. It is a breath of fresh air after seeing the stereotypical and lackluster animes that are out currently (looking at you Shinmai Maou no Keiyakusha). And to those who dislike the fan service thrown into animes, this one has none. So you can enjoy that too.",

Now don't Judge me cuz i already know this is a masterpiece but i simply found it too oppressive to watch.\r\nStory: I'll just say this the story talk about a wandering man who studies the so called mushi and help various people handling them. Every episode is auto-conclusive and i went not so far so i can't say there is a backstory. \r\nArts: As far as i could see the art its really outstanding. It give you a big impact and make you \"travel in space\" its really good believe me. \r\nSounds: Same story for the music and sounds theyput you in the anime and make you feel the same feelings of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Characters are well done, not so many cliches and they react just as they should.I have to also say that they are well builded.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it? Yes and not. I gave this anime 1 enjoyment cuz in my personal opinion its too oppressive and heavy to watch so i just dropped it. I have to enjoy myself  while watching something not feeling so anxious, especially if i can't see a f**kn' plot in the episodes. I don't know if there is a big story later developed but i simply don't like autoconclusive animes especially if everytime i have to feel so overwhelmed. In one hand what i just said its a bad thing but in the other hand its also a good thing cuz if you like this kind of animes then you should really watch mushishi and you will enjoy the product because he do what he have to... maybe a lil' too much.  \\n\r\nOverall: i gave 8. I think this is really a good anime. I don't like this type of but maybe you do. It have all you need arts, musics, characters, every episode has a good plot. You have to decide. Have a nice day guys.",

            "content": "Anyone who has watched Mushishi can agree that it is definitely a unique anime as it has no single storyline or whatsoever yet it still manages to take the #1 spot, at least for me, for its soothing and pleasant scenarios.\r\nStory:9/10\r\nTo put it simply, mushishi's storyline is divided into 26 parts(each per ep) each having its own unique story.Although in each episode, a new problem arises, the concept and methods behind getting them solved are somehow related to one another since in every episode we get a glimpse of a new mushi.Thats about it.Now i know some may find this to be boring and lame,which might be true if you cant handle slow pace anime since this would probably be the slowest of them all, but if you are someone who wants an anime with something unique and unusual to offer that you havent seen previously in any other anime(and arguably wont see in the future as with the direction anime is currently heading towards) then mushishi is a must watch for you.Tho let me warn you must be ready to endure scenes where nature describes the atmosphere and the situation.\\n\r\nArt and Animation:9/10 \\n\r\nFor an anime which came out in 2007, mushishi has quite a beautiful animation and as nature plays a big role in this anime, the scenes surrounding the beauty of nature are something to look forward to as they are really heartwarming and relaxing to just look at.But beware since every episode a new character is involved, some character designs might look too similar to what you have seen in a previous episode.\\n\r\nSound:10/10\\n\r\nThe soundtracks in mushishi fit right in with the atmosphere of the incident and they can vary from being really deep to emotional to soothing.Opening song was also alright whereas the ending song was different in every episode(gotta respect the studio for going out of their way to add in 26 different ed songs).Some were outstanding while others were alright but in all honesty, the soundtracks were really something since they weren't anything you would hear in a typical shounen anime rather they would fit in perfectly with historic Japanese fairy tales.\\n\r\nCharacter:10/10\\n\r\nTheir is only one major character in this part of the series who is seen in every episode.That being ginko.Although the doctor(adashino) might be somewhat relevant, he wasnt shown that much throughout the series so i won't be going into detail about him.So if i had to describe ginko in all simplicity, it would be that he is a cool and calm character.Ginko, who is a mushi expert(and something more which might be a spoiler if i disclosed it here) is an understanding and an intelligent character who tries his best to help others but he doesn't completely aid them.I'm sure you must have heard of the saying \"Instead of feeding a starving man a fish, teach him how to fish\".That's basically what is implied in mushishi.Ginko is someone who understands both the perspective of a human and a mushi and whenever a human has done some sort of harm to a mushi(which is usually the case), ginko teaches them how to deal with mushis without harming them.He always tries his best to keep humans and mushis away from each other since they cant co-exist with each other as one tries to overtake the other(usually being humans as they are born with that nature).I would regard ginko as one of my fav character for being an intellectual and a cool character tho i cant say the same for others as some might find him to be boring and dull.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nIf it wasn't for the enjoyability i got out of this anime, by now it would be in my dropped anime list like many other anime.Seeing a new problem arise every episode with a different mushi being involved in the scenario along with a different character and ginko having to use different measures in order to ensure safety for both the mushi and the human was what i enjoyed the most.But, as stated previously, others wont have the same amusement.\\n\r\nOverall:10/10\\n\r\nConsidering everything i said about mushishi, i can safely say that mushishi is one of my fav anime series as it offered something new and tackled some new concepts that i had not seen previously in any anime.If you are someone who enjoys slice of life, relaxing/chill, soothing anime where the story isn't the main focus, mushishi is definitely for you.But if you want some hardcore action infested scenes where there are specific main and side characters and story progression, mushishi is definitely a NO for you.",

            "content": "Mushishi is quite frankly, a brilliant and engrossing anime that catches your attention in the oddest way possible: by being very very simple. The very beauty of Mushishi is in its simplicity. It doesn't try to catch your attention with cheap, tried and true formulas. It doesn't try so hard to be deep that it trips and falls on the slippery slope of pretentiousness. It doesn't contain squicky and gory high octane action scenes. Mushishi manages to keep your attention for all 26 episodes just by being what it is: A simple, mysterious, and beautiful anime.\r\n[ Story 10/10 ]\r\nMushishi is an episodic anime. Each episodesees the main character Ginko dealing with a different person, a different mushi, and a different conflict. There are as many different types of mushi as there are people, so each supernatural  phenomena is as interesting as the last. The various characters introduced throughout the anime are just normal everyday people who's lives have been affected in some way by the mushi.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the fact the mushi can cause grief and illness to many people, Ginko stresses that the mushi aren't inherently evil. They're just trying to get by in life, much like humans are, and shouldn't be hated for it. Little comments like these could possibly be interpreted as having a deeper meaning.\\n\\n\r\nBut like I stated above, Mushishi doesn't try way too hard to be deep. The story is simple yet interesting. Its very easy to keep up with and follow. There's always a new and interesting case waiting to greet both Ginko and the viewers in each episode. \\n\\n\r\n[ Characters 10/10]\\n\\n\r\n Ginko, the main character, is the only character that appears in every episode. Over the course of the anime, aspects of his character as well as his past are slowly revealed. Ginko is very calm, slow to anger or panic, and displays a knowledge and outlook on life that betrays his young appearance. A bit of his past is revealed later in the anime, explaining how he became a mushi master and how he attained his odd, otherworldly appearance. As a main character, he's pretty likeable. The anime focuses more on the individual cases he takes on, rather than Ginko himself. \\n\\n\r\nA new batch of characters is introduced every episode. None of these character's growths or personalities are formulaic. Of course, with each episode being 30 minutes, its difficult to fit in significant character development for each character. But its interesting to see how each person changes once the episode is over. Its also interesting to see how each person reacts to the mushi they are confronted with. \\n\\n\r\n[ Art and Sound 10/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is a peaceful little number that perfectly suits the atmosphere of the anime. The insert songs were great as well. The animation is top notch considering its age. I found it hard to believe I was watching an anime that was a little over seven years old. Care was put into the lush and beautiful backgrounds. There isn't that much variety in the character designs, aside from Ginko. But they are far from bad, and it goes hand in hand with Mushishi's whole air of simplicity that I mentioned earlier. \\n\\n\r\nProbably the most interesting to look at are the mushi. The way the transparent, colorful little guys dance around the screen is a real treat to watch. From the cute little ones from the first episode to the creepy swamp mushi, they've all got some interesting and quirky design. The voice acting for Mushishi is another well done addition to the series many good points. Having watched the dub, I can safely assure you that its a quality one. Travis Willingham's performance as Ginko is definitely worth praise. Several voice actors appear for the different characters in each episode and they all do a great job as well. The script is devoid of any awkwardly worded translations that plague some anime. There's no over the top screaming, gratuitous cursing, or the inevitable \"EHHHH?\" (or in English \"WHAAAAAT?\") being thrown around at the drop of a hat.\\n\\n\r\nThanks to that (and probably a good voice director), the dialogue never comes off as forced or awkward. \\n\\n\r\n[ Enjoyment 10/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell, I enjoyed this anime a lot. It was a real treat to watch. I appreciate and praise its ability to keep my short attention span glued to the screen without any cheap gimmicks. Its a very peaceful and chill anime that I particularly enjoyed while drinking green tea after a long day at school. \\n\\n\r\n[ Overall 10/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one rare gem of an anime that no one should pass up. Its very hard to find a flaw in this anime. Although I think people who want a series with a lot of action, explosions, hot chicks, and an overarching plot may not find what they are looking for in Mushishi. Mushishi just isn't that kind of anime, but its still easy to get in to and enjoy. Perhaps try watching Mushishi after you're done watching that crazy, over the top, adrenaline pumping anime like I did. You might be able to appreciate it simple yet interesting plot a lot more.\\n\\n\r\n+ Superb art and animation (for its time)\\n\r\n+ Splendid English Dub\\n\r\n+ Interesting story, characters, and world\\n\r\n+ Original, creative, and easy to follow",

            "content": "Wow. That is my impression upon finishing the series (at 3 o'clock in the morning, I may add). I tried to start this series online a month or two ago and just couldn't get past the 2nd episode, but I recently bought it on DVD (because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about) and was hooked from the 3rd episode on.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThis is the kind of story that sneaks up on you. At first, everything seemed a bit unconnected and I wasn't sure if I liked it, but when I picked it back up, watching a few episodes a night, I realizedwhat a beauty the anime really is. The story is told in an anecdotal sort of format. Rather than showing the lives of a small group of people, the story seems to be more about life itself. There is a big focus on the world and staying in harmony with the creatures that live in it, even the \"mushi\" who can only be seen by some people but can affect many. One of the nicest parts about the anime is that it's really relaxing. Sure, there are suspenseful bits, but the aura of relaxation never entirely goes away. I was never scared of any of the mushi in the show (I tend to get paranoid in the dark) because even the detrimental mushi weren't the kind that would jump out and scare me, so I was able to retain a calm mindset.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nAll of the art is beautiful. The story is set mostly in rural Japan during older times, so there aren't electronics and technology featured--just nature, which I think is one of the most beautiful things to look at. The only problem I found with the drawings was that many of the characters looked extremely similar--the same coloring, similar hairstyles, etc. even between genders, so it was hard to tell them apart. However, characters never really crossed storylines, and the recurring ones were given significant characteristics, so it wasn't that much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the anime is soothing and musical. I love the opening, which reminds me of summertime and nature, and the endings are all different instrumental pieces created specifically for each episode, so the mood of each story is carried through the credits.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThere are only two recurring characters that I can remember (the main character, Ginko, and the doctor in one of the fishing villages). That being said, the characters in each episode all seemed extremely human, which was refreshing. Watching an episode is like meeting a new person and catching just a glimpse of their life while simultaneously being introduced to the creatures/mushi that occur where those people live. Ginko was also fun to watch, with a likeable and sometimes funny personality, and I really enjoyed learning his backstory.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe series did feel a little unfinished at the end, but then, the beginning wasn't that significant either, so I believe it serves its purpose as just a glimpse of lives over time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nWatch it. Yes. Please do. Especially if you're stressed or something of the like--it's not a comedy, but it makes everything feel a bit more beautiful and profound (with not a lot of thinking involved). Take the journey along with Ginko and see how even though all creatures live differently, they are all part of this wonderful thing called life.",

            "content": "So after watching a series like Attack on Titan or Gurren Lagann, Mushishi is an ever present reminder that anime basically has no boundaries and continues to be one of the reasons why I watch the medium. It's also extremely jarring because of how calm it is, seriously don't watch Mushishi if you're tired, you'll fall asleep. Mushishi though, unlike those other shows is severely out there and much calmer than the aforementioned bright colors and explosion based plots. Mushishi is a brilliant show because of how it can pull off a well written plot that raises tension and builds excitement, but in a strangelyquiet and mesmerizing way. It presents the viewer with an ancient Japan where mushi-masters (mushishi) hold the line in our real world by helping people who have been affected by Mushi, which are creatures that bridge the gap from the natural world to the metaphysical one. The show follows Ginko, an effectively stoic protagonist and his diagnoses of Mushi affecting people throughout the country. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode tells its own story that follows this premise, but the writers of the show always find a way to make Ginko shine in the spotlight in a different way. The plot of each episode not only brings the mushi to life through their bizzare powers (to which the art for each is beautiful by the way), but the people that Ginko interacts with are a wide variety of different people, and the fact that there are so many different characters gives the show an added sense of realism to the already dream-like story. Ginko himself is interesting despite the fact that he's a stoic character, you can really see his personality shine through when he experiences fear, success, or gets irritated. The whole point of the show is simple, and it expresses how the human's wants, needs, fears and dreams don't always coexist with nature's natural cycle, and it's a very deep, introspective experience nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nThe only issue I had with the show was that even though I really enjoyed the simple premise of a variety of different problems, I wished that the viewer got more of an overarching look at everything Ginko has learned from his journeys as a mushishi, and I wished that the last few episodes actually come to some sort of conclusion that touches on this. However I'll also accept the answer of \"just watch season 2\" to feed my hope of finding the answers to my questions the show left unanswered. So if you're looking for a show that you can enjoy by yourself and maybe have some tea late at night, Mushishi will set the mood of some calming brainfood and good writing.",

This is not to say that mushishi requires you to turn your brain off, instead i'd say it requires some thought, but enough to keep it at a mellow middle of brain power. It's beautiful to look at, interesting to listen to and follow and just genuine fun to watch. Though it is a more melancholy then happy, It's not enough to depress you too much, and the amazing fun and happy moments make up for a lot of the tear jerkers.\\n\\n\r\njust watch and love it.",

            "content": "This story is quite lovely. Each episode is pretty much closed off. You can start watching anywhere in the actual show and never really miss anything. The story doesn\u2019t really overlap and the only real character that you need to know is Ginko. It helps keep the story straight and you don\u2019t have to remember every little detail like when it\u2019s a show like Durarara!!! that has a number of different main characters and secondary characters in it. The stories themselves are so cute and yet most of them have a rather sad ending or beginning that really makes you feel depressed and doesn\u2019t helpyou feel better though. The only times I did feel better is the tiny bit of comedy that happens with Ginko and some of his friends. Ginko is sadly not explained much except for one episode in which they talk about his past but I really would like to know much more about that past.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole art style is a feast for the eyes and animation almost never falters. This is a show that you would watch if you want something slow and calming as there aren\u2019t ever fighting or hard core battle scenes. Most of the time it\u2019s more talking and careful thinking within the story. Each background is carefully detailed, even when the show is clouded in mist, you can still see a lot of details within it. Characters seem a bit lacking at times though, some of the side profiles look a little dull and skulls seem deformed. It is just the art style though and not laziness. You can tell that they put a lot of heart into the product.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very pretty, gentle and sweet. The Background music never ever breaks the show and each story has one main song although it is hard picking out that one song out of the many. I fell in love with the Opening as it really sets a mood. I believe it is in English in both the Japanese Dub and English Dub. The dubs are also good in both English and Japanese, though I lean to the English in this. That does mean that there are a lot of voices that are reused but as I never really notice that stuff, I didn\u2019t really care.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a must see for anyone that likes slow shows but don\u2019t touch it if you are really into fast pace Mechas.",

            "content": "\"Cure lies in the curse\"\r\nWith this simple, yet deep message as the core theme, the masterpiece named Mushi-shi is presented to us as the purest form of entertainment. A lot of pieces of art and literature try too hard to get their message across through a good concept, and at times fail to do so. However, Mushi-shi delivers its message perfectly, accompanied by an excellent and perfect concept, without ever seeming desperate.\r\nMushi, the entities closest to life itself, is one of the most brilliant fantasy, supernatural elements I've come across. The wonderful design and subtle motion really bring these existences to life. As neat asit is, this anime doesn't rely on its fantasy genre to cover for sloppy writing and polishes the elements well enough to be plausible all by itself. It is detailed, well fleshed out and its field is widely spread. As mushi are involved in different spheres of the people's lives, we get a peek into and observe these various parts of life. The phenomenon concerning the mushi and how to deal with these occurrences is explained extremely well. Nothing in it ever felt forced, but simply natural. While the element is perfect by itself and coherent to the theme of this anime, that's not all that Mushi-shi offers. Mushi-shi presents, explores and explains different Japanese folk tales, traditions, custom, legends, in short, Japanese folklores through its own unique concept. No other attempts on this has been better, as far as I've seen. Mushi-shi has many other original concepts that are unique to Mushi-shi only. These elements are nicely explained as well.\\n\r\nThe stories usually revolve around villages, mountains, towns and forests. With the touch of the brilliant art, these places are masterfully presented. The rivers, houses, household materials, fallen leaves, all the little details make the places seem real. And despite the stories occurring surrounding these areas, none of the setups are completely identical to each other.\\n\r\nThis show is episodic in nature. Although every story is mushi related, one can't really find a specific pattern or formula of the series of incidents. In other words, this anime is not repetitive and each episode provides us with new experience. While the stories are unique, they are also incredibly well written. As I always say, \"Mushi-shi is the compilation of 49 masterpieces (26 episodes+20 episodes+3 specials)\". Every episode of Mushi-shi is a life lesson and more or less a masterpiece. From the beginning to the end, every episode held on to its atmosphere, never losing a bit to fatigue. The stories are told wonderfully. The small details are highlighted carefully through conversations and actions, never falling to the level of information dump, or anything close to that. It knows when enough has been told and where to start showing. The balanced transition of dialogues and actions is excellent. The narration is done perfectly, not too much, nor too less and perfectly timed. The narrator's voice blends in nicely with the storyline, giving us an experience equivalent to hearing stories told by Grandma while sitting in a room of a small house in the rural area. This is a priceless experience. All the episodes have excellent and satisfying ends, some of which are in my top five anime ending list as \"some Mushi-shi endings\".\\n\r\nBeing a purely episodic show, other than the MC, Ginko and Dr. Adashino, the characters rarely appear in more than one episode. While that might seem quite a disadvantage, Mushi-shi used it to its advantage, which we get to see later on. Within this very short span, Mushi-shi fleshed out the characters wonderfully. As someone who has lived a long time in a village, I could understand and relate to the characters and was also able to discern the small yet adequate amount of differences among them. I grew care for the characters and that's what matters the most, since Mushi-shi is about their lives. Some of them even develop in this short period of screentime in a plausible way.\\n\r\nThe main character, Ginko is a brilliant character. What I'm about to write next didn't derive from myself but I totally agree with it. And his/her presentation is better than what I can come up with, so why not! It goes somewhat like this: \"Ginko is not the last piece of the puzzle. He's the one who will have you put together the pieces and finish the puzzle. Ginko is you\". Well, it's been a long time since I saw that statement and I only read it once so I probably didn't use the exact words he did, but this is more or less it. Ginko's past is explored enough and he had superfluous character development. Also, he isn't inhumanly perfect. He makes mistakes, he acts on instant impulses. His characteristics has its own distinctive ornaments. In fact, it is a wonder how the personalities of the mushi-shi(s) are so different from each others', their methods of dealing with the mushi phenomenons included. Their views and outlooks on matters are also varied. This shows how the group of mushi-shi(s) is not monolithic. Actually, every important character in this anime is interesting in their own ways. Some characters' behavior may seem a bit overdone or weird, but they're always in a realistic limit and most of the time justified through the concept of mushi. I may forget their names, looks and actions, but their essence will always remain strong in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design for most side characters in Mushi-shi is actually quite similar, but they're never identical. Although little, there are differences in the design of each characters. That much difference is adequate in my opinion because you can't expect all the village people to be totally different from each other. It's artistic and quite realistic as well.\\n\r\nThe anime is not a piece of art, rather a huge collection of tremendous amount of art pieces. \"It literally uses moving artworks as its background\", is what someone I know said and I don't see any reason to disagree. The sceneries are the most beautiful I've seen in anime or anywhere else in entertainment industry. With masterful use of effects and wise choice of colors, each frame is a valuable piece of natural portrait. The excellent animation job does everything necessary to bring these sceneries to life. The slow and subtle animation deepens the tone of the moments and gets us completely absorbed into the scenario.\\n\r\nThis is accompanied by excellent background music played by Masuda Toshio, which blend in perfectly with the atmosphere, intensify the moods and move us subconsciously with their captivating rhythms. They don't distract the viewers, but rather engage them more into the anime. Both of the opening songs are extremely refreshing and enjoyable. Just listening to them removes your weariness. The ending themes are different for each episode with different sceneries presented with them. They are relaxing and possessive. The voice acting is realistic and amusing. The sounds that the mushi make, along with the visuals are ecstatically wonderful. The environmental sounds are equally compelling. The natural sounds alone can form the sceneries. The screenplay and audio are carefully measured and synched. The production of this anime is perfect in every way.\\n\\n\r\nWell, nothing made by man is absolutely perfect. Even the definition of 'perfection' is imperfect. But, Mushi-shi has no flaw worth mentioning. There are very few shortcomings that cannot be pointed without nitpicking. Albeit rare, there are cases when the mushi related incidents are not as explained as the others. Due to this, those occurrences seem a bit implausible and absurd. But they're far from what one can call 'sloppy writing'. Some people do complain about Ginko's attire being the only Western one, but that's not at all the point. However, it is not really illogical, given Ginko is a traveling mushi-shi. It's not really impossible that he's one of the few people who was influenced by Western fashion considering the era. And it's certainly not surprising that amongst the very few of them, Ginko is the only one seen in this anime. However, the weird thing is that no one is curious or surprised to see Ginko in such odd dresses. Again, that's not an issue for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMushi-shi is one of the most relaxing and refreshing experience, if not the most. It was intriguing, at times enticing, sometimes funny. Then at times depressing or melancholic. But, even in the presence of all these emotions, one feeling is always there. It is a deep, absorbing, overwhelming feeling, which in one word, is 'awe'. A feeling of respect combined with wonder. Mushi-shi is one of those few series that succeeded to convey the atmosphere perfectly. You could feel the environment relayed in each season. It's aesthetics caused me euphoria. It provided me with many forms of enjoyment mixed up magnificently.\\n\\n\r\nMushi-shi couldn't have been made any better. It's an unique experience that cannot be compared. So far, this is the best anime I've seen and nothing came close to its level. It's a masterpiece worth 9.75 out of 10 in my current rating system, which is the highest score I've given so far. As 'perfection' goes, this is as close as it gets. Mushi-shi is highly recommended for anyone. It's my second most favorite series and my most respected work of fiction.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nMost of the episodes vary in quality, some are amazing while some aren't as powerful though not necessarily bad just not as good (example:the episode about the rainbow). The effects and the purpose of the Mushi were pretty diverse which made it feel almost like a different story each episode. The show can be sometimes quite tragic, not every episode end in a good note, though I wouldn't say it's dark, it's more like the show isn't afraid to shy away from the typical happy ending.\r\nAnimation:\r\nThe character design could have used a bit more diversity, since every literally looked the same, I understand that it'spretty much the same case with most anime but everyone had practically the same haircut and facial features that some people would think hey didn't I see you last episode?, at least Ginko actually looked different, though the plain looking characters are easily forgivable because the overall quality of the animation is top notch, like the fantastic looking environment, a lot of highly detailed scenery that helps giving the show an a feeling of epicness.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI watched the dubbed version which was actually quite decent, there was virtually no awkward dialogue and it the voice actors didn't sound robotic, there was some instances where the some voice actors were used repeatedly for different characters but it's not really such a big issue since most games and anime dubs abuse this even more and to be honest I'd rather have that than shit voice acting that most dubbed versions of anime have.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST usually consist of subtle (and effective) guitar and piano scores, the OP was good I suppose it's a little bit too happy for the show though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nGinko is a good main character he's not annoying but I felt that they could have handled his character a bit better since he doesn't really have that much of a personality, at least the show had one or two episodes dedicated to his back story which prevented Ginko from being a boring character. The show does it's best trying to make you care for the side characters during each episode, while they do a good job making you care even with the fact that the characters look practically the same.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWell I have to say episodic shows are possibly the home of great anime; Aria, Kino's Journey and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (too an extent) are all episodic shows and they are definitely anime of the highest quality, these kind of shows manage to make each episode different and interesting, even as most of the time they have a recurring theme each episode, it never feels repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nMushi-shi is definitely one of the best anime out there, it might have some faults but it has a lot more aspects that it does pretty well. it's a show that's absolutely impossible to hate, and is definitely something every anime fan needs to see.",

            "content": "Like most other reviewers, this anime is very hard to categorize, so i'll just simply say its a slice of life anime which is episodic in nature, and based on the travels of a mushishi called Ginko who is kind of like a traditional shaman/herbalist. The atmosphere is very surreal/melancholic and realistic at the same time, and the stories told capture that childlike imagination we all have/had at one stage of our lives. Highly recommended if you're looking for something unique and spellbinding, although the animes deeper levels would probably be wasted on the kiddies.\r\nThe only real beef i have with it is the characteranimations. A lot of the supporting cast looks exactly like other people in the previous episodes, but if you can look past that and accept that they did it intentionally and it's not that important for the story since the characters are all in different situations and have a different personality, you will like this.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, i suggest you do not marathon this one, and rather enjoy it slowly and in the right state of mind, otherwise you will waste it, because it does move quite slowly and it could turn some viewers off initially. It did for me and i dropped it the first time round, but then later on, it became one of the top 10 for me(same thing for OP, first 30 eps put me off, but for other reasons).",

Like Aku No Hana (which is something Mushishi fans should enjoy) it's quite subtle in its narration and displays an interesting point of view on morality. Although it uses supernatural forces the outcomes of its stories are somewhat realistic in thesense that one side doesn't win all the time and isn't displayed as some kind of morality God-can you really blame a species for wanting to survive (there was a really cool dialogue between Ginko and Mushi on that subject actually) ? As a result every episode feels dramatic yet Ginko's ending speeches always manage to give you a sense of fulfillment no matter what side \"wins\" because victory is nowhere near the focal point of this anime. Enchanting; one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.",

Additionally alot of the music is purely instrumentals that blend into the background.\r\nNow this anime does take up an episodic approach, meaning that each episode starts from scratch for the most part with a different situation coming up at the beginning and generally beingresolved by the end.  Rinse wash repeat.  This is not the type of show that is meant to be binge watched, there is no overarching story.  One should watch this show when they want to relax and watch something peaceful.\\n\\n\r\nBasic Idea: There exist spirits that live alongside us and interact with us throughout our daily lives and we have no perception of them.  For better or worse these spirits go about their business and some cause problems when they interact with humans.  Our protagonist is a Mushi master and can see these spirits.  He goes about helping people throughout the land with these problems that arise.",

            "content": "This anime surprised me a lot. My good friend tends to suggest a lot of anime to me, and his tastes are pretty similar to mine. But when he mentioned this anime I was rather skeptical, by the way he described it. \"X-files meets anime.\" is what he told me. Well that might freak you out too. But it's almost as simple as that. It's X-files meet a sort of feudal Japan, in an anime. That still may freak you out, well then let me explain:\r\nStory - 10\r\nThe storyline of this story is kind of hard to describe, that's why my friend say 'X-Files' asunexplainable things happen in that show. But unlike X-Files we as viewers know what the general cause of the problem. Basically the reason behind the problems people have, which seem 'supernatural' are due to this entity called \"Mushi.\" Mushi are creatures with only a few can see, and aren't plant nor animal. Ginko (the main character) is a mushi-shi. They are like mushi doctors. They asses problems associated with the mushi, and try to fix them. Each episode has a different story, similar to that of X-Files. But Ginko is still Ginko.\\n\\n\r\nNow the reason I enjoyed a the stories, is because this isn't something you could ever think up. The Mushi cause some strange problem, which may or may not seem ordinary to us, and Ginko finds interesting and exciting ways to fix things. To put how interesting the stories are, let me put it in perspective for you; my parents find anime very strange, and are almost opposed to be watching such. When I told them about this anime, they actually watched it with me, and actually enjoyed the show, and the different stories associated with each episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nDue to my friend's continuous complaining about certain aspects of shows, I too have become picky. But the art in this show is phenomenal. I was really happy to see that the animators seem to put in a lot of time an effort into the environments and character design. Each character, now matter how minuscule their part was, was given individual features, which could part them from the rest of the characters. But the most notable part of the art would have to be the environments.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nI'm not a big noticer of sound and music. Now I liked the music in the show, but that's just about all I can say, aside from the fact that it fit really well. The sound effects were very well done as well. Your probably asking what kind of effects could they use in an anime such as this one. Well one example is what you would hear if you were deaf. If you cover your ears you can still hear the vibrations in your head, they were able to do that in the anime, and it was very impressive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nGinko is a very cool guy. He's a very lax, sarcastic dude, who gets serious only when he needs to be, and is rather mysterious. His background is completely unknown til later episodes, where a lot of things are explained about him. Due to Ginko's sarcastic personality he's tends to be the comic relief at some points, and due to his completely relaxed attitude, you tend to  drop a load in your pants when he says something ridiculous then explains it like a genius. But he's a very nice dude, he's very considerate, and usually doesn't take money as payment for things, but rather objects to help further his understanding of mushi, that or he'll sell the object to his doctor friend for money. xD\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nThere is only one thing I didn't enjoy about this show: It ended. I was really happy with every episode, every story. I enjoyed it to the max, except when they stopped animating it. Everything kept me wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nOverall this anime was awesome. There need to be more like it, because it's way different than any other anime out there. If you want to try something different watch this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI was that was helpful, it was my first review. :D",

My reasoning for doing this is written above. \r\nIt's such a simple anime as far as the art goes. It keeps pretty much in nature through different seasons. But the stories are far from simple. They are very thought-provoking and some even eerie. \r\nHighly recommendif you want to chill and relax and work your brain at the same time.",

            "content": "Mushi-Shi is my all time favorite anime\r\nStory - 9\r\nthis anime is more of an episody one... where there really isn't one plot that goes through the whole series... it's more like... each episode is a small vignette of the main character, Ginko, solving a problem with mushi. I like this part of the anime because you can watch any episode at any time and still understand it because there is no plot. I don't like it because.... well the same reason if that makes any sense. It's also a very creative idea... It's all about nature and living htings and how they interact and howthat's bad or good. It deals with things like that... So there are no fight scenes at all.. But each episode is very calm and soothing and has a very important moral. Some episodes are a bit weird and far-fetched... but most are just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nthe art is absolutely beautiful. Especially landscapes.. it depicts ancient Japan and its wonderful scenery.. The mountains.. oh god.. they are so beautiful... It's just so hard to tell you all about it. you should watch it and marvel at the beautiful backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nMasuda Toshio (who actually composed the music for naruto as well) is a GENIUS!! the music for htis series is soooo calming... It's soft and very simple.. maybe one or 2 notes and that's it but it does wonders... Listen to it when dooing homework, you will be so focused on it... Listen to it when you're trying to get to sleep but can't .... You'll fall right into a deep sleep. Listen to it when your stressed. it'll calm you down. just LISTEN TO IT!! some songs are so beautiful that it actually brings tears to my eyes no matter how many times i listen to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nbecause each episode is a stand alone, they all have different characters, so you can't see any development over time in that. Not even the main character because it just shows you random snapshots of his life helping people with mushi. but the lack of character development in no way demeans the overall anime at all. \\n\\n\r\nenjoyment - 10\\n\r\neverything comes together in the most dazzling anime i have ever seen. I fell in love with it. I would immerse myself into each episode and be staring at the screen by the time the end credits come on saying \"wow.... that was beautiful\" but each episode has a similar aura if you know what i mean. You can't watch too much of the show at once.. After 3-4 eps i suggest to stop because you're watching a similar pattern of events happening and each episode has a lulling effect.\\n\\n\r\noverall - 10\\n\r\njust watch it. you won't regret it",

            "content": "Mushishi was (and is) definitely one of the most satisfying, well-thought anime series I've seen so far. The genre is both supernatural and romance, which pairs very well in a story like Mushishi's, so I would definitely recommend this to fans of supernatural beings and/or friendships between abnormal beings and humans.\r\nStory: 10\r\nJumping straight to the story, it was excellent and deep-hearted. It actually flowed with the manga quite well with an easy-to-understand setup. Each episode contained a complex message or moral that all tied together in the end, and with the atmosphere it consented with it was very enjoyable to piece these hidden messages together.Although some episodes skip through entire manga arcs, the plot was well enough to efficiently satisfy me, completing its series without leaving me hanging or wondering \"What next?\" However the location, era, and origin of each character is unknown, so to first-time readers or watchers, this may be a bit confusing. For fans who are more into the hype of anime, a plot as tricky as Mushishi's will be totally unfitting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art and animation was beautiful and full of both warm and cool colors. I found the character designs very interesting and well-blended with the natural forest-like scenery, which served as eye candy for the most part. Mushi (the so-called \"ghosts\" in the series) were colored in different tones and hues, which ranged from relaxed and calm to fiesty and angered. As for the animation, it was extremely enjoyable to see these creatures that not even the viewer knew just floating around like plasma water in air. The characters' movements were fluent, but the camera angles were shaky and sudden at times, which subtracted little from the overall enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI usually don't pay much attention to sound very much, but the soundtrack was a bit unfitting along with character movements. The opening and ending was very meaningful and followed a deeper aspect of Mushishi, which made up for sound errors just a smidge.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nGinko, the main character, was an enjoyable protagonist along with some side characters. I could tell that Ginko had probably spent most of his life wandering an unknown area, studying these strange beings after an incident as a child and had a very deep interest in Mushi, while teaching those who could see Mushi about these strange beings. Most of the side characters were cliched a bit, and shared a pattern of not knowing about the Mushi, but acknowledging they were harmless creatures after Ginko came along. They all had the same reactions to the Mushi (with the exceptions of a few helping characters).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9\\n\r\nAs a huge fan of paranormal/supernatural and hidden messages in the plot, I found Mushishi to be a refreshing series. The plot pacing was slow in the beginning, but adequately sped up between the last few episodes, which subtracted from the deeper side of Mushishi. Another minus for me was being a big shounen, sci-fi, and cyberpunk fan, so by gut I didn't enjoy the lack of action in this series. However, Mushishi was a beautiful series with meaningful plot, enjoyable characters, and plenty of eye candy, and always will be in my straight opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I'd recommend this anime/manga to fans of supernatural beings and friendships forming \"along the way\", as the blend of romance and supernatural would make up for sound errors and character tropes.",

The conflicts typically arise from a man vs. nature imbalance---caused intentionally or unintentionally---and the protagonist must interact with spirits of the land to get to the source of each problem. Many episodes have a sad or mixed ending, but there are heartwarming moments.\r\nOne strength of the anime is the way in which nature becomes a central character. The human protagonist is not overbearing, and leaves the viewer to formulate their ownopinions. Although the action is infrequent and slow-paced, the mysteries, artwork, and emotional draw are sure to keep the viewer hooked. Mushishi is an excellent anime for people in their 20's.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is about a decade old, and some of the artwork---while impressive---lacks the crispness of more recent works. Occasionally the mysteries are predictable.\\n\\n\r\nI strongly recommend this anime to viewers who prefer natural themes, episodic works, slow-paced storytelling, and calming but somber vibes. People looking for action-packed anime or upbeat anime should look elsewhere.",

That is why one is only almost discouraged.\r\nStill, Mushishi is a formidable accomplishment to live up to, the current high water mark of its type. That type, though, is difficult to specify. Fables? Folktales? I'm not sure what term to use, as none of them seem quite right. Perhaps Mushishi is best summed up as a series of halfremembered bed time stories. That too isn't quite right, but it gets at the heart of the matter. There is typically a moral, one that is complex enough to be interesting but simple enough to be grasped by a fairly small child. There is always some element of the fantastic, though there is more of nature mysticism here than anything else.  There is basically no action, and a dreamlike tone persists throughout. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot. There is not much of one, in all honesty. Mushishi is one of the quintessential episodic anime, with only the main character, Ginko, and one or two other more minor characters recurring throughout the series. Occasionally some bit of background about Ginko is filled in, but just as often Ginko himself recedes firmly into the background for an episode or two. Each episode finds a new cast of \"main\" characters who have run afoul of the series' titular life forms, and Ginko, a wise and enigmatic wanderer,  attempts to help them. Then in the next episode we meet a further cast of characters who are similarly troubled with only Ginko's presence to tie the stories together into a cohesive whole. \\n\\n\r\nThese are only broad outlines that admittedly don't reveal much about the show's feel. Some examples then. In one episode, Ginko runs across a man who has spent years attempting to catch a rainbow. In another, Ginko visits with a child whose writings come to life. Not that when the child writes 'lion' that an actual lion comes to be, you understand, but rather that the very symbols written upon the page are alive. And so on.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is generally excellent, rich with lush forest scenes shrouded, as often as not, with mist or darkness or a gentle rain. This is good, since the backgrounds must bear significant scrutiny in a show with little going on in the foreground beyond walking and polite conversation most of the time. The soundtrack completes things nicely with simple, quiet melodies. The green and brown tones, mistiness, and gentle soundtrack all contribute to reinforcing the contemplative, dreamlike atmosphere of the show. Again, the nearest analogy I have is to bedtime stories that one has almost, but not quite, forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that Mushishi is perfect. Like any episodic anime, it suffers from a lack of cohesive narrative and occasionally uneven quality. But while there is no overarching narrative with which to engage, there is an overarching tone and a series of themes that are developed with consummate skill. And while some episodes are of course better than others, even the relative low spots are easy to overlook given that when Mushishi really works \u2014 as it does, for instance, in the near perfect \"The Sound of Footsteps on the Grass\" \u2014 it is an unqualified masterpiece. \\n\\n",

If there isn't an interesting overarching plot line, I tend to find myself contemplating why I'm even watching the show. However, I never once felt that way with Mushishi.

My deepest apology**\r\nWell, Mushi-shi is one of the anime i think is underrated by everybody. When i show it to my Dad, he said it's boring. When i show it to my best friend, he said it's shitty. And so on and so on. Every people, i showed this anime will say it's boring. But i find myself quite fascinated by this anime, so read on, please.\r\nFrom what i think, this anime is really similar to \"Kousetsu Hyaku Monogatari\",\"Jigoku Shoujo\", and last but not least \"JigokuSensei Nube\" and if you want it American style, the \"Supernatural\" series, except the MC goes solo and kicks ass in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf people found this anime to be boring, i'd say some of the episodes are, even i fell asleep in one of the episodes. But i really like the MC, Ginko. He really amazes with his calm and careful approach to the source of the problem. Rarely shows any signs of fear, and rather he shows amusement in the face of danger. I guess what really pulls me to this anime is the way Ginko carries himself through the problem.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely the anime for you if you like calm MC\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime brings the vibe of old japanese era with extra creepy feeling. The OST, i'd say is doing their job nicely by adding a certain emotion to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle and graphic animation, is just fine. Don't really love it, but i guess i can't imagine this anime going with other artstyle (Like SAO for instance ^^). So it's fine i guess\\n\\n\r\nThe main cons of this anime though, is the lack of storyline. It's just all about Ginko travels around and solving problems along the way. Ginko meets several new character along the way, but they're just acting like some kind of bonus, and didn't really matter if you just forget them. Similar to \"Supernatural\", but \"Supernatural\", have more solid storyline, they have a main enemy, at least. But Mushishi just don't have it.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched the \"Mushishi Zoku Shou\" and the second season of it. And the my review is still the same. Cause the creator of this anime never heard of climax, rising action, and denoument.\\n\\n\r\nDas ist der Erste\\n\r\nFriede!\\n\\n\\n\r\n**I've made several mention of other anime and things in this review. If you liked this anime or you're just curious. It won't hurt to check it out**",

At the first glance it may not seem very captivate or interesting, but please believe me, it won't cost much to give Mushishi a try, cause it's not as boring as you may think it is...\r\nStory 10 \r\n The story is simple but still unique and pretty interesting. Every episode's story is told in a very poetic and enjoyable way, that makes you want to watch the next episode. Every episode is relaxing, breathtaking, and has a deep meaning. But still the story is not the only thing that makesthis series so charming.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is gorgeous, it has a wonderful pallet and an excellent design, it is exactly what the story needs, the art and the story are perfectly match with each other. The backgrounds were wonderful and of course the character design was nicely done in order to show how perfect the main character is.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\\n\r\nOnce again... The sound was fitting perfectly with the other elements of the show (story, art, characters). The voice actor of the main character Ginko (Nakano Yuto) was just excellent, I really enjoy his voice acting. Also the seyuu of the supporting cast done a really good job (especially with the younger characters). But what I really loved was the soundtracks, even thought they weren't very catchy they make you lose your self in the series and helps you relax.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\\n\r\nGinko..... Just how brilliant this character may be? He loves what does, and he always tries to do what he can in order to help people with their mushi-problems. His background story was also beautiful. He really is a very captivating and charming character that I will always treasure. But except Ginko there are still the supporting characters. Even though they only play for one episode, be sure that you will remember them because of their background.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime is seriously recommended for everyone, and I mean it. To be honest at first I thought I would get bored of this series and drop it, mostly because a teacher of mine (art teacher, non-anime fan) suggested it to me... but even though I gave it a try, and hontony I loved it, and I watched it 3 times and when I get bored or want to relax I still watch my favorite episodes, I'm pretty sure that I will remember this Anime for a long-long time.",

            "content": "I don't know why I started watching this anime. I was actually surprised to see it so highly rated. But after watching it I can say with certainty that this is one of the most underrated animes series ever.\r\nStory:\r\nMushishi is set in historic Japan with a fantasy element. Enter mushi which are supernatural creatures which are invisible to the naked/normal eye. The protagonist, Ginko is a mushi master or mushishi. The anime is episodic in nature with Ginko travelling along the country trying to study about them. This leads him to meet people who are affected by mushi. Another strong point about this series wasthat the episode endings didn't always have a good ending. The dialogues was also really well thought and still stay with me.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe character designs of mushishi is very interesting though very repetitive. Most of the characters look similar to each other except for a few characters. Artland simply did a marvelous job with the scenery. There were scenes in the anime where I got goosebumps. The story, excellent though it is, would not have left an impact on the viewer, if the scenery was unable to convey what was happening.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nLoved the opening as it caught the meaning of the anime. The background music was simply amazing and very soothing. I was transported into that world listening to it. The tracks suited the ongoing scenes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nEven though being episodic, the characters are one of the strongest if not the strongest point of the show. The new characters in the episode were so well developed to the point that I was actually surprised that the episode was only 20 minutes long. By the end of the series, even the enigmatic Ginko is given a good back story. It was this back story which truly allowed this anime to transition from an excellent anime to a masterpiece\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWhen I initially started watching this series, I could only watch one episode per day, as I would try to savor it for the entire day. I liked it but wasn't really drawn to it. Then, as I mentioned before, the epic back story was the turning point for me. I enjoyed watching the series after that. At this stage, Mushishi had left its mark on me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis deserves infinity out of 10 according to me. This is definitely one of my all time favorites in any form of media. I do not know how many times I've rewatched it.",

No edge of seat thrillers or cliff-hangers, just peaceful story.

Ginko's characterwas perfect for the lead, with his general outlook and wisdom guiding through each episode. \\n\\n\r\nI will warn though, this anime is not for the weak stomached. Some of the imagery can be sickening to the stomach, although not intensely graphic. My brother couldn't stand the sight of some, but then again he has a abnormally weak stomach.

Every petal, every blade of grass was beautifully done.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to really enjoy this story, you do need a mature outlook on life itself.

            "content": "\"Mushi are life in its purest form\"\r\nStory (8):\r\nMushishi doesn't have a single storyline, instead, each episode has its own original story. This does not however, affect the quality of the anime, as each story features something original and interesting. All of the episodes however, have something in common, and that is the appearance of \"mushi\", beings that are beyond life and death. In every episode, a new type of mushi appears. These mushi affect the world around them and can even determine the fate of mankind. The main character, Ginko, is a mushishi, or put simply, a person that specializes in mushi. He travels aroundthe world dealing with the problems that mushi are responsible for, and does the best that he can to fix them.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9):\\n\r\nThe art is presented in a way which is very visually appealing, and at the same time very calm. It doesn't overdo it by adding too much detail, and it doesn't try to show-off. Instead, it presents itself as if it's not trying to impress at all, by just being natural. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9):\\n\r\nLike the art, the sound doesn't try to impress. The soundtracks consist of minimal, but effective melodies that express a variety of emotions and which go well with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9):\\n\r\nThe main character, Ginko, has a personality that allows him to express different thoughts and emotions while at the same time being able to think calmly and logically. He lives for the sake of his work and for the well being of mankind.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters of Mushishi consist of people whose lives are affected by mushi. Only one of them appears in multiple episodes, but as for the rest, they only appear in one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8):\\n\r\nMushishi is the kind of anime that gradually gets better and better. It seems a bit boring at first but after each episode gets more and more interesting as the mysteries and powers of the mushi are unraveled.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9):\\n\r\nAside from having captivating art and sound, Mushishi also serves a good amount of drama and a little action. It's ability to present many interesting ideas in many creative ways makes, and the fact that it successfully delivers without trying to impress, makes it one of the best anime ever made.\\n\\n\r\n*Yay this is my first review!! ^^",

( For those who already know, just remember the moonlight bridge, the string from the sky, the bamboo- mushi and all the other crazy stuff that happened, I mean... seriously, they had quite some fun writing stories like that )\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the art is very special too, almost every side character looks the same, once again, I won\u00b4t say this is something that shouldn\u00b4t be criticized but I won\u00b4t because I liked it a lot. \\n\r\nThe repetitive style of the side characters sets the focus on their actions and their feelings, you have no chance but to take a look at their personlaities, rather than their looks, in order to judge them.\\n\r\nTo make it even more interesting, your final judgement can be even more complex after thinking about how they deal with their individual \"Mushi-problems\", or maybe are even the Mushi at fault for the people acting the way they do ? \\n\r\nCan they even be charged for just being alive ? \\n\\n\r\nThese are some questiones that came to my mind while watching Mushishi and I\u00b4m glad about that because this anime managed to make me think about somehow important questiones but without punching a certain image and problem right into my face and saying \" this is it and now make up your mind!\" \\n\\n\r\nWhat else can be said about Mushishi ? \\n\r\nSadly enough, it\u00b4s nothing that will become mainstream but maybe that\u00b4s for the best because that way it keeps this special status in my heart ( sry for writing stuff like that but I couldn\u00b4t come up with a better way to describe it ).\\n\r\nIt may be anything but mainstream and it may be very peculiar but that\u00b4s what makes Mushishi so great, that fact that there won\u00b4t be an anime that can come close to it.\\n\r\nI had a great time watching Mushishi and can only recommend it to everyone, it sure is worth trying out so you better do so or else you will miss a truly one special, one BIG anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mushishi is a show keeping tabs on a white haired bloke called Ginko, unlike most peep's, Ginko can see plankton like creatures called Mushishi that inhabit his world. They come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and due to their mostly obscure nature, they have the habit of causing negative things to happen to those around them. Ginko makes his living by taking advantage of his ability's and helping those who have problems as a result of the mushi, each episode focuses solely on a single story and there's no real order or over arching narrative at play here.\r\nThe best thing about Mushishiso by far is the character of Ginko, he's so different and unique I can't name another character even remotely like him, if I had to describe him to someone I'de call him the most soft-spoken bad ass to ever be written, he's never boastful, brash or barges into situations without a seconds thought, he's calm, knowledgeable and immensely caring of those around him. As a result of his likeability, it doesn't really matter that all of the characters that Ginko meets will only be around for the duration of the episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe show in turn manages to keep it's self interesting through its structure, as mentioned, each episode revolves around Ginko helping other people out with Mushi related problems, but since the only limitation of what the Mushi can do is the imagination of the writer, many different and unique stories are told throughout the duration of the show. In turn though, Mushishi doesn't remain a purely happy show as it might initially give the impression, there are some truly saddening episodes which provide some nice emotional variety to keep things fresh.\\n\\n\r\nAnother huge boost to the quality of the show is the setting, the choice of feudal Japan goes a great way of adding to the sense of wonder and mystery since it seems so foreign yet rooted in reality. The background art goes a long way is helping this, since to put it simply, its beautiful, it add's so much to the crispness of the setting and makes each individual frame something to behold.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is also spot on, the pacing is well done throughout each episode and the topics touched upon felt well thought out, at the end of each episode there's sense of awe that I had leaving me to ponder my thoughts for the rest of the day. This said, at times Mushishi can feel like it explains alot in a little space of time, I wouldn't call it an anime that requires your full attention or multiple viewings to understand, but there are moments when things can be missed and I found myself rewinding the video in the hope of understanding what just happened, I'm not sure if this is down to poor writing or the occasional mistranslation, but it's a minor issue that happens rarely.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few other issues that I have mind, for starters, the animation really isn't anything to write home about, for the most part it boils down to your clich\u00e9d \"moving of the mouth without the jaw\" type of animation, however, this can be excused since the show never really needs well animated scenes with lots of frames plus the voice acting makes pretty much all the dialogue bearable, while I can't say from a huge amount of experience with the medium, Mushishi does have the most consistently good voice acting I've ever heard, there isn't a single voice that I would consider \"bad\" and it only really dip's down to \"average\" quality now and then which helps with the immersion of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat has a tendency to break the immersion mind is certain frames of character art, for the most part it's just fine but now and then the animators got lazy and just don't draw the faces. I realise that this is done pretty commonly in hand drawn animation due to the limitations of the medium, but the instances I refer to are shot's where the characters face's aren't even that far away. It's not a deal breaker but it can be a pain here and there.\\n\\n\r\nGetting into the raw nitpicky stuff, there were two episodes that I felt where rather meh, one involving a rainbow and the other involving a woman who was loosing her memories, while neither was poorly handled, I just felt they lack a sense of mystery that made the rest of the anime so enjoyable to watch, but this is only two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to pick at is the character designs, while there's initially nothing wrong with them, and for the most part they look nice (especially those dressing gown things everyone seems to be wearing all the time, they look nice). I found that different age groups of different sex's all looked very similar, especially the youngsters. While not a deal breaker I couldn't help but have a sense of deja vu when the show introduced a new character who looked like an old one, for the most part, hair styles and cloths are the only things to use to tell them apart. \\n\\n\r\nGenerally you should probably watch it, yeah... go watch it.",

            "content": "Although this anime doesn't have many constants throughout the series, the flow of the story is beautiful and has a calming effect.  Each episode reveals something more about the nature of the Mushi, and if you use the knowledge you gained from previous episodes, you gain a deeper understanding about the situations that occur.  The happenings are always varied; sometimes there's a happy ending and sometimes there's a sad ending, but sometimes it isn't that simple.  Though the literal substance of the show is about the paranormal, it focuses a lot on the human experience.  There is always a lot ofemotion and internal conflict attached to each Mushi-related situation.  \\n\\n\r\nI love visually discovering each different type of Mushi throughout the show.  They all vary in shape, color and movement, though you can find similarities between them.  One Mushi might appear in the form of a rainbow, while another will take on the shape of a dragon.  All in all a beautifully executed concept. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not usually struck so deeply by anime soundtracks, but this one really took hold of me. Just as the show flows like a calm, steady river, so does the music.  It fits perfectly with the content of the show.  It sounds like something I would do yoga or meditate to.  It accurately depicts the flow of nature.\\n\\n\r\nGinko, the Mushi-Shi whose journey we follow, is calm and mysterious, much like the Mushi he studies.  Watching the show, I felt as if I got to know Ginko better with each episode.  Though nonchalant and unattached to any one person or place, he cares very much about the people he encounters and helps.  Through this, we come to care deeply as well.  \\n\\n\r\nMushi-Shi is not for you if you like things that are fast-paced, witty and/or highly comedic.  It is for people who love the supernatural, nature, and perhaps are looking for something they can relate to on an emotional level.",

It also doesn't help that said one main character is practically lifeless. \r\nWhat kind of life can you have without people around you? Ginko, the lead, can't be attached to anyone since he's wandering from village to village. Well, he has to. It's a plot point. That doesn't mean someone couldn't have been traveling with him...\r\nThe stories about the different mushi were somewhat interesting, I guess. In ten plus years of watching anime I haven't seen any show that mentions these odd creatures.It's too bad the mangaka couldn't weave them into a plot and give the plot at least a small group of connected characters...\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\ntheme song note, not a fan. I thought the theme songs were pretty terrible too. I like watching theme songs so a show without at least okay themes loses a 1-3 out of 10 just for that... \\n",

On his journey's, he encounters these creatures of nature named Mushi who affect the lives of others ranging from visions of the future, odd illnesses & other strange phenomenon.\r\nEvery episode is its own story showing how people's lives have changed from the mushi for better or worse. Most tales result in Ginko aiding people who been cursed by mushi or at least attempt to save their lives as not all episodes end in happiness. Mushishi is certainlymystical with its heavy atmosphere where music will often take dominance in the scene causing either relaxation or terror for its viewer. There's an abundance in creativity in this series such as man trying to catch a rainbow or a family who was born from plants. These types of stories bear resemblance to Osamu Tezuka's writing in his \"Black Jack\" series as Mushishi themes range from the preservation of nature & the importance of life.\\n\\n\r\nThe mushi are not good nor evil just a force of nature in which Ginko discovers in his many trips across the world. Most episodes are great stories but obviously could vary from person to person but with its 2nd season debut can hopefully lead to more enchanting story lines. Not for everyone but definitely offers an insight towards morality & man vs nature. Enter the world of mushi where Ginko does his best to understand the unknown.",

Narrative is gorgeous, kinda classic Japanese storytelling.\r\nEach episode is independent, so it doesn't matter if you watch the 3rd episode and then watch the 1st. \r\nThe anime itself is a supernatural type but nothing related with horror, and the way the story told educate us about Mushi (though it doesn't actually exist inreal life)\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork isn't so fancy or less engaging, but considering the type of the story, it is sufficient enough for us to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing to complain about this anime AT ALL, except that I want a lot more Season Series out of it.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing, I think EVERYBODY, not matter your taste of anime genre, would enjoy watching Mushishi.",

            "content": "This isn't really a review but more like an overview of teh anime, no spoilers but not much details either, focusing on only the 1st season.\r\n\"Mushi\": the most basic forms of life in the world. Detailed information on Mushi is scarce because the majority of humans are unaware of their existence.\r\nMushi-shi are those who research Mushi in hopes of understanding their place in the world's hierarchy of life.\r\nThroughout his journey, Ginko, the Mushi-shi travels around the world and helps people dealing with mushi, that the people tend to think of as curses and diseases since most can't see or feel them. Ginko's journey is dividedinto short stories, a story every episodes. The episodes might be considered as standalone but a background story is going on somewhere. (probably during season 2 and 3, which I'm not covering) The short stories are very well made, narration makes it even better, there's narration at the start of the episode and at the end. Every episode starts with people having troubles with an illness then Ginko appears and help them get rid of it by chasing out the mushi, in most cases. The whole anime is like a compilation of short stories, so, progress is slow and the pace is monotone but it's still very enjoyable if you're patient enough.\\n\r\nGinko is one of my facvorite characters, very cool and composed, not sharing anythign about his past since he doesn't know much about himself either. And the voice actor did a great job in reflecting Ginko's personality through his voice, it's just perfect. I really loved the music, it made feel the suspence while in a dark forest, joy when the people are happy and sadness when someone passes away, and music + narration was just a perfect mix, very well done.\\n\r\nThe show isn't very dynamic so I don't recommend it to the people that seek action and development.\\n\r\nBut if you're looking for a calming and relaxing experience, enjoy the strory telling and follow what happens because I find it beautiful, and I found myself thinking about creation, the universe, world and also... the invisible at times while watching. Such anime won't make you excited as much as it'll make you think, which I find it good for a change.",

            "content": "Why do we watch anime?\r\nIs it for over the top characters? Is it for convoluted, overly confusing storylines? Is it for shouted attacks and illogical power-ups? Is it for the sickly sweet Japanese concept of \u201ckawaii\u201d?\r\nI don\u2019t think so.\r\nSo many shows fall victim to the same old tropes and stereotypes. I watch these shows and I wonder \u201cWhy?\u201d.\r\nWhy do I watch anime? What is it about anime that makes it stand out as an artistic medium?\r\nThen I watch Mushi-Shi, and remember.\r\nIf you only watch anime for the clich\u00e9s mentioned above, then Mushi-Shi is not for you. It is not fast-paced or in your face. Itis a meditative show that slowly steps into existence, captivating you with its beautiful world, and then quietly meandering on its way.\\n\\n\r\nI have been captivated by the enchanting world of Mushi-Shi, and I hope that some of you can find the beauty that I have.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is both the weakest and the strongest part of Mushi-Shi. There is no over-arching plot; it is simply many self-contained stories of Ginko on his travels. For this reason, some people might see it as boring or repetitive. In my opinion, these people are terribly wrong. Each episode is a complete story, and each episode is meant to be reflected on and enjoyed on its own.\\n\\n\r\nSo don\u2019t go into Mushi-Shi expecting to binge-watch 15 episodes at a time. Instead, make yourself a cup of tea, curl up on the couch, and watch one episode a night, taking the time to savor each. Make some time for Mushi-Shi, and you\u2019ll find yourself in the company of a master storyteller.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOnly one character is featured throughout the whole series. That character is Ginko, who is a well-written character in himself. He is far from the typical, loud-mouthed hero. Ginko is quiet, reflective, and logical, traits which are far more relatable to me that those of most anime heroes. His personality fits in well with the world of Mushi-Shi and is entirely believable.\\n\\n\r\nApart from Ginko, there are usually one or two featured characters in each episode. Though these characters have small parts to play in the grand scheme of things, most are fairly distinct and all seem human rather than caricatures of humanity. People\u2019s emotions and reactions have a beautiful sense of realism.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHere is where Mushi-Shi really shines. From the gorgeous backgrounds to the simple (in a good sense) character designs to the meditative background music, Mushi-Shi\u2019s production is awesome. Each place on Ginko\u2019s travels looks entirely different with a wholly unique atmosphere. Any picture from the show could be regarded as true artwork on its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs might seem very simple when compared to the stunning background, but I believe that this isn\u2019t a real problem. For one thing, the simple designs have a beauty of their own, and, for another, the animation of the characters is done so well that it\u2019s easy to forget the simplicity. The animators seem to have taken extreme care when it comes to the expressions and movements of the characters. Since the show isn\u2019t fraught with action, the animators have to pay special attention to small movements. The characters are always able to convey the emotions they are feeling through little changes in facial expression and body language, a real feat of animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Mushi-Shi is rather understated and simple, but it does a good job of keeping the viewer in the proper state of mind. I can\u2019t say much about the music except for the fact that it is well-placed and well-suited.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI truly believe that Mushi-Shi is a masterpiece of art. Whenever I need to relax or remind myself of animation\u2019s beauty, I turn to Mushi-Shi. Though movies like Wolf Children and movies by Miyazaki certainly rekindle my interest in anime when that flame goes out, Mushi-Shi is one of the first anime TV shows to have the same effect. This show is a piece of art that showcases all that anime can be.\\n\\n\r\nIn short:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Beautiful animation\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Meditative atmosphere\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Amazing storytelling\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Human characters\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Not for binge-watching\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 No overall plot\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Could be boring to some\\n\\n\r\nRecommended to the following:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Tea-Drinkers\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Introverts\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Philosophers\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Day-Dreamers",

            "content": "Mushishi is an anime that has an episodic structure and a higher-level action is missing. be Much More Pulls like a thread through the episodes the phenomenon Mushi and the exploration of these - with each episode one penetrates deeper into this mysterious world of fantasy and mysticism.\r\nGinko is traveling, usually he gets from his client mail, asking him that he may come to them or he goes to a village at random and snaps there rumors. If he is somewhere asked he goes to the house of the client and this tell them about strange events that they can not be explained. If thisexceeds their judgment and thinking, you are looking for a Mushishi. Then briefly describes what it is and Ginko examined this case in more detail. He gives his thoughts award by which Mushi is and explains what it means to be on and covers solutions.\\n\r\nEach episode stands alone as an independent story, yet sometimes we see that a certain chronology and a link between the episodes is when Ginko told about certain cases.\\n\r\nSo each episode is very fascinating in itself. For each episode represents a particular Mushi and each episode illustrates how strongly with those of Mushi depends people's lives together. As both influence each other. How different the Mushi-species may be. Some are neutral, some also harm people. Especially often it happens that a Mushi itself per se does no harm, because it simply exists. But mere its existence and unintentionally negative impact on the people make him seem like a plague.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters:\\n\r\nEach character was incredibly well written. They arrived in front of a like real people and not as a fictional character drawn. Ginko is one of the best characters I know. He is intelligent, is understandable and sympathetic.\\n\\n\r\nVisually is \"Mushishi\" for me a masterpiece. Seldom does one see so stunning, detailed images of nature and everything seemed so eerily alive. The appearance of Mushi is something that a terror inspires and can hold their breath. Somehow the anime looks like a series of paintings that really makes you sink into this wonderful world. The drawing style of the figures is rather simple, but just to be realistic about it. There are no colorful, flashy colors or any things that look like cuteness, as it is known from other anime. Everything seemed so mysterious and uncanny.\\n\r\nMusically, I must say, I had often quite goosebumps, especially if there were exciting places where Ginko explained something or anything weird happened, managed to build this mysterious atmosphere and the music. More often even melancholy, quiet pieces of music were played that go under your skin, especially if a story has come to an end.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion:\\n\\n\r\nMoreover Mushishi is very philosophical. He treated many subjects about which one should think.\\n\\n\r\nCan it be justified to take the life of another human being, just so there the group is going well? What's in a single life?\\n\\n\r\nAnd you can live with the bad conscience that another person has died for. Is it selfish to live so on?\\n\\n\r\nWhat is more important, his own interests, or the nature?\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see is Mushishi experimenting with supernatural things, the viewer moves through the fantastic setting in its spell an anime. But just by addressing the ambivalent phenomenon \"Mushi\" and the interaction between them and the people shows that the anime mainly everyday things, crises, problems and issues dealt with, which are surrounded by supernatural elements. delve into this fantastic world to get to know more of Ginko and the Mushi, to learn more about the Japanese folk belief, but even thinking about the philosophical questions - that makes the anime from.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly wish to emphasize the story in which it comes to a Mushi, who lives at the top of the sky and a thread can be downloaded, with which he can lure his food. Accidentally woman has taken up the thread and is pulled upward. Without a statement that it is a Mushi, one would think that supernatural things were at work. Even more important to the story, however, was that the woman since then could not stay on the floor and there she moved again upward. I found the theme behind thought-provoking: The woman needs to the bottom of the facts, so to stay on earth, something she holds. It is the unconditional love of her friend, she needs so that she can stay on Earth. Are not they, they would disappear. In essence, the story was about the unconditional acceptance and love towards a person. No matter how much you will be despised by society, no matter what efforts you have to take upon themselves. The point is that you love a person, with all their faults and quirks. Then they will remain at a. It was one of the few love stories that ended well and I was very touched.\\n\\n\r\nAlso something that I found very appealing, was the idea that the dead are reborn. What I would do if my mother would be born as my daughter again? Would I be happy about it or I would not have rather mixed feelings? Because no matter how you look at it, even if the daughter as an image of the mother appears, she would never replace. You could be my mother never again. Such complicated feelings towards the people that represent an incarnation of the deceased, are discussed in the story. I found the subject so far also exciting because I had not seen so often such theories about reincarnation etc. in Anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs \"Mushishi\" can be philosophical and profound, I was able to prove to some stories, but there were other episodes where you have to think much. So the people had to decide whether to burn down the mountain or should starve in a story. It was not an easy decision, eventually you wanted a hand not quite sure destroy nature, but when it comes to the welfare of the community - once again - you have to make certain sacrifices. That this decision in the end but that caused even more misfortune for the people came, nobody could imagine. Here is the message that one should think through decisions and their consequences thoroughly and always, no matter how it turns out, should take responsibility. Ever have to wonder what you should consider important, his own interests or the welfare of nature? What man claims the right over the fate of nature to decide to destroy his life to his rescue again? This can be transmitted as well subject to our world, where environmental protection is more important than ever. If animals are not kept under appalling living conditions and the environment exploited, so that man has well? Okay anime is somewhat understandable, because it is about survival. But we think ahead and to the present excessive consumption society, you have to reconsider the attitude to nature critical.",

While the second season has somewhat of a plot. So, animation wise this show is great with its beautiful world that has me watching it just to see. There are some problems when it comes to characters, but the nature more than compensates. The story is following a person called Ginko and he is a Mushishi that helps keep everything in balance. Its around 26 episodes just it little over than most. The director is Hiroshi Nagahama and hes has done shows likeDetroit Metal City and the Flowers of Evil. In my opinion hes just ok, nothing real special. The studio Artland has done shows Legend of the Galactic Heroes and Hitman Reborn. I would say Artland has helped more than create their own shows. As of now there is no Dub of the show. Some of my likes would be the art work and the ability to watch any episode. Some of my problems is that there is no story line and at times doesn't give us much information about who he is as a person. Saying all of that I would rate this show 7.5 out of 10. I would recommend it if you watch a very chill and calming series.",

            "content": "Visual stunning, musically brilliant, fantastic characters, and awe-inspiring world building, these are the things that come to mind when I think of Mushishi.\r\nMushishi is an episodic show that follows Ginko, a Mushi master, as he travels around the world investing Mushi and helping the people that come into contact with them. As such, there is no overarching narrative leaving the interest in the series to derive completely from the sole recurring character (besides the narrator and one friend of Ginko who appears in 3 episodes). Ginko carries said burden wonderfully. Generally, he appears apathetic and removed. His voice (done wonderfully by Travis Willingham in theEnglish dub) is generally monotone, however as you watch the show you will begin to realize that Ginko is deeply passionate about learning about Mushi and helping people. The credits rolled on the final episode leaving me with an empty feeling because I felt like a good friend of mine was leaving.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically and musically, the show was unlike anything I had ever seen. In a world that is so filled and ran by mystic beings (the Mushi) the art style and music had to fit with that and it certainly succeed in this task. The lighting and use of bright colors make the world feel magically. This feeling is complimented by the music. Ambient and minimalist the music exists perfectly within the show. I listened to the music some outside of the show and it conjured up scenes in the show. The music is so well-intertwined with scenes that they exist hand-in-hand and to have them separated feels as though I am cheating myself out of the full Mushishi experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe story always drew me in too. No episode is directly related to any other episode (the closest thing being that events from other episodes are referenced in other episodes ex. the events of episode 1 are talked about in episode 5). Each one was wonderfully creative and served to add to the already vast and sprawling world of the Mushi. From this, you will get my only critique of the show: many episodes are vastly less interesting than others. Mushi are not good nor are they evil. They merely exist. Often times then, the mushi, in their own existence, will cause problems for humans in their existence. Sometimes, these issues are interesting and sometimes they are not. I can remember several times throughout the series where watching one of the episodes felt like a chore because I either did not care about what the Mushi were doing or I didn't like the people that were being effected by the Mushi. However, these episodes are few and far between and should not prevent anyone from watching this excellent show.",

Ginko is a mushishi and mushishis works with mushis (I dont want to spoil you anything). I cant find anything wrong with the story, in every single episode you will watch something different, and the way Ginko resolve the cases with the mushis is worth it.\r\n-Art, simple art, elegant, but i love it.\r\n-Sound, the openings are amazing and the general music is soft and relaxing, its fixperfect with the anime and helps a lot with the atmosphere.\\n\r\n-Character, you will meet a lot of character, but you will love them. They have motives  for their actions. You can empathize with everyone. Ginko is the star of the anime, you will always know something because everything about him is a mystery. He is a quiet guy but adorable, I cant describe him, you must watch this anime.\\n\r\n- Enjoyment, I saw the entire anime without knowing the time was running. And I've seen this anime twice.\\n\r\n-Overall, I think this is not an anime for everyone, I am a huge fan of this kind of animes, but maybe you like other kind of anime, with action and guns (you know, that kind of things).\\n\r\nAll in all, a must watch.",

            "content": "The anime community hasn\u2019t heard much from Studio Artland since the Macross era of the 80s and the epic show that is Legend of the Galactic Heroes. This new show called Mushi-Shi is based on the highly successful manga by the same name. It adapts very well by covering each chapter as an episode in the anime. This show is mellow, slow paced, relaxing, but in general a show worth taking a deep breath for.\r\nMushi-Shi follows a Mushi master called Ginko. He is a soft spoken and laid back guy which always has a cigarette in his mouth (there is a reason). What is aMushi master? They are people who study mysterious creatures called Mushi. These creatures are basic life forms that can exist is numerous forms be it rainbows or spores from a plant, but their only purpose seems to simply exist. Each episode follows Ginko on his journey to solve issues and rumours revolving around Mushi and to possibly learn more about not only his life, but those affected and perhaps life itself.\\n\\n\r\nAs a character, the audience learns certain aspects about Ginko. We learn why he acts the way he does, why he always has that cigarette, and even why he does not stay in one place too long. Everything in the show seems to have a solid reason and purpose. The writing in each episode does vary based on the content it covers, but overall the show is solid.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much in terms of animation but when the time comes for it, not only does the show succeed but also creates wondrous works of art blending in and engrossing the viewer. Backdrops and panning art used in Mushi-Shi is a fantastic example of this sudden surge (at the time in 2005) in higher animation and art quality. Almost any still image with environmental backgrounds in the show could be used as wallpaper or art on its own. Music used throughout the show is extremely subtle, but at the same time fits the mold and mood it is going for creating a powerful sense of wonder.\\n\\n\r\nIn turn, when all is combined creates this atmosphere to further enhance the show. Storytelling could not be told any better without said atmosphere being created. When winter episodes happen, the audience feels the chill and cold of the weather, or when there is sudden fear in the characters, the audience fully understands that fear as well. However, in terms of the character designs, most of them look entirely too similar to each other. Individualism is more or less taken away. However, this is probably a director\u2019s choice to focus more on the Mushi and their effect on the show rather than how human effect anything.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that aside, possible issues people could have with Mushi-Shi is the incredibly slow theme and pace of the show. That melancholy music or the subtle mono-tone voices of characters or the small amount of dialogue does create that peaceful \u201cwhite-noise-esc\u201d response that makes viewers fall asleep. It could just make this show the most boring this a person could watch or the most intriguing. Mushi-Shi is a coin flip in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nMushi-Shi is an incredibly unique experience that many anime fans would over look today (2017) and even passed over back in 2005. With fan service and little heavy dialogue shows out there, this show greatly depends on the viewer\u2019s taste in anime. However, this show should not be treated lightly and has that potential to become a top show for any fan.",

It is perhaps the simplest anime that I have ever observed, and yet arguably it is the most profound. The show beautifully weaves together simple story-telling with masterfully scripted dialogue, and pulls it all off with such graceful artistic imagery that it just simply begs to be watched and enjoyed. \r\nI came away thoroughly impressed by this series, and though perhaps one could argue that this unique show, which offers no overarching plot whatsoever, could be seen as boring, I beg to differ. It is by no means aperfect show, but it is one that can be slowly savored and relished. I easily found it to be the exceptional and pleasurable experience that it is acclaimed to be, and I am glad that I stumbled across this hidden art piece.  \\n\\n\r\nOne final note: Mushishi is not for everyone. It challenges the viewer to be patient, to be calm, to relax. In many ways, watching Mushishi is more akin to staring at a good piece of art and reflecting on it. If you do not seek that sort of gentle, soul-searching entertainment, then you will most likely not enjoy Mushishi. But give it a chance, because regardless of preferences, it's simply beautiful.",

            "content": "A mindblowing, and beautiful anime series. Not very typical in terms of what most would expect from an anime, yet it has proven itself to be a masterpiece nonetheless. The pacing is slow, and there isn't a lot of action, yet it turns out to be very gripping and suspenseful nonetheless. \r\nStory: \r\nEpisodic, without any type of overall link between the different encounters of the protagonist other than the protagonist himself and the occasional explanations about some of the phenomenon throughout the show (and some characters). Yet, each and ever episode contains its own individual story that all prove to be very gripping, and oftensomber. Each episode presents different characters from all around the regions Ginko travels to, and each has their own issue that is Mushi-related. Many of these stories are somewhat uplifting, yet often times very tragic and thought-provoking. The layout isn't one that I would usually be in to, yet it proves to work masterfully so. The many twists and turns the episodes take leave the viewer at the edge of their seat and constantly engaged even if the show isn't super fast-paced and action-packed.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe artwork is often very beautiful. The scenery is amazing and certain sequences just look incredible. Many of the human characters are hard to distinguish at times, so there is less emphasis on human faces and more so on the surroundings and Mushi. Which ultimately ends up looking good nevertheless. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nGood usage of sound. Lovely intro and outro music, very somber and alluring. The voice acting was very suiting for all the characters. The sound ultimately creates the type of atmosphere the show would intend for with each given situation. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nGinko is an amazing protagonist. A very mysterious and intelligent wanderer that truly shows how much he values life and learning. He isn't infallible, yet overcomes many obstacles with a realistic approach that doesn't leave the viewer with a huge sense of disbelief. The pragmatic ways he approaches each obstacle makes him a lot more enjoyable, and the way he perceives the world and challenges around him are at many times very compelling. Well-written character with quite a bit of depth. The other characters introduced can be very brash, other times tragic, or many other things across the spectrum which works well for each of the scenarios and situations in each episode. Most of them are also very compelling in their circumstance and have a lot to offer for the message that the episode in question is trying to convey. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFor me, it was hugely enjoyable. Very thought-provoking and beautiful. The pacing was wonderful. I didn't find myself counting down the minutes before each episode was finished because of how engaging the show can be. Many of the episodes had me dwell on them for a good time afterwards. There are many moments that are hugely emotional, and many that are quite philosophical. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nFantastic and outstanding show. A masterpiece. Wonderfully written and well-thought. A true gem in the anime world, as well as the world of entertainment in general. Whether a fan of anime or not, one could find so many reasons to adore this series and be captivated by it.",

            "content": "Before typing the review down, I just want everybody who is reading understand that rating an anime is purely subjective, but not without facts of course. We may be bias at time to defend our favorite series because ultimately, a review is a mixture of your own opinion and the facts that are lay out to you so that you can let others know what's the object/subject is about. In short, Mushi-shi is a Masterpiece (10/10) for me. Objectively, it deserves, at least, a 7 if anything, but deserves no more than a 9. It deserves, at least, a 7 because of its' innovative ideaand concept of mushi. It's also not an anime for everybody. It's really mature and questions the very nature. Like how there are many studies of different things such as psychology, biology, Entomology, etc., this is a \"Mushiology.\" Well, technically and literally, mushi in japanese is called bugs. But in this series, Mushi-shi is actually not just bugs, but more of a wider and vague groups. Think of it as a combination of spirits/ghost, paranormal, bugs, fungal, and nature. This is what the anime is really all about, hence why it deserves no more than a 9 out of 10. It would have objectively earn itself a 10 if the main character, Ginko, was more to him, but I want to believe that Ginko was made to be plain and simply helps other out during his travel because the series strongly involves solving and understanding about Mushi and letting people who doesn't know what mushi understand that they aren't \"evil\" things and are just bound by nature to live. Like how us, human, struggle to live, the mushi too, are just struggling ways to survive. \"The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.\" quoting H.P. Lovecraft. This is what precisely what Mushi-shi tries to convey as a message to both viewers and in the story. Now, if you want to know why it is a masterpiece in my opinion, simply keeping reading from here on out.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story isn't like an arc or the whole show, but rather each episode or two is a another different story as the main character travel areas to areas solving abnormal/paranormal problems because the main character is a Mushi-shi, which stands for \"Bug Master.\" It continues on without an end. Honestly, there is no end to this series. It could kept going on and on like a detective cases. This can be unfortunate to some people who actually wish an end to the story, and I completely understand that. But for me, a never ending story of something I like watch is a bit sad even though it should end at some point. But anyway, the reason why I like the story of how it is because from my standpoint, it's like listening to a companion's travel story and how it start and end up. Was the problem solve? Was Everyone Okay? Did you regret meeting those people? and stuff like that. Each episode felt surreal in some way, but also felt realistic. And that not all problems could go away and sometimes you just have to live with it like how our daily lives are.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art is never my forte so perhaps, I may be more bias here than other section. I simply like the art style! There I said it! It's immersive. It's dreamy. It's spiritual. It's beautiful. It's NATURE! It's very Japanese probably because of the setting of the anime. It looks like edo time to me. perhaps even further. Ginko design character is probably the reason why you wanted to watch in the first place. Any character with white hair is an eye catcher. Unfortunately, we reach modern world where white hair guys/girls isn't uncommon anymore though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Calming and spiritual. I don't know what else to say. It's certainly appropriate for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ginko may appears rather plain despite his white hair and green eye and one missing eye. Will you are half right and half wrong. You see, like many other ordinary people, Ginko in the past was an ordinary child as anyone else is. So, it make sense and does not contract his personality. But he can be humorous at time. Like everybody else in the series, Ginko is just trying to live his life. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Because it was my type of anime, I enjoy it thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I consider a masterpiece even if there are some flaws to it. The concept of it strikes me and I liked the pacing of the show and it story of episodic manner.",

            "content": "I watched maybe half of this show's episodes many years ago, and left it be. Now I finally got to watch the series again, this time finishing it. I haven't seen the other adaptations yet, nor the manga.\r\nThe anime's mood is well built, as the magical and mysterious air is in every episode. It's almost calming, in a way. For the mood alone I could watch this series again. I don't think this anime is for those who like to see a lot of action, since I'd say this is quite slow paced.\r\nWhat I didn't like about the series, is that so many of thecharacters looked too similar. Especially the small boy in episode three. He seemed to come up time and again elsewhere as the same-looking but different character. Most of the characters were not very memorable, apart from their problems. There isn't much depth to the characters' personalities, as we don't really get to know any of them. Maybe it's intentional, as the plot is so heavily centered on mushi and their behavior. Besides, introducing a new set of characters and problems in every episode isn't an easy thing to do. It would be interesting to see how this has been handled in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nAnother very memorable thing for me was the music. It really stood out, and added to the eerie mood. Overall, I enjoyed Mushishi very much.",

It very much reminds reminds me of a fairy tale in that it's about small groups of characters and their strange circumstances. There is no epic scale, no world that is at stake. At most, a single village is affected by the proceedings. Yet, this scale makes what goes on very powerful. Having a single peasant being harmed in an age without running water and where all a person is likely to see is their village makes the hardship all the more difficult to bear.Many episodes don't have a happy ending although some do. Life is hard in this beautiful and dangerous world and people do there best to survive, find happiness, and cope with the supernatural. It's not exciting but it is wondrous. It's certainly unlike any other anime I've seen. It's probably worth watching for that reason alone, but know that the individual stories and charters are also very good.",

            "content": "Mushishi Review\r\nHey, guys. If the youtube comment I got this information from is accurate, did you know mushi means \u201cvagina\u201d in German slang?\r\nWell, now that I\u2019ve finally gotten that off my chest I\u2019m gonna take a seat, get comfy and tell you all about a fantastic anime.\r\nOh, good ol\u2019 Mushishi. Mushishi has gotten a great reputation over the ten-year era since it first aired, and the raving Ginko-bodypillow-owning fanatics such as myself aren\u2019t blowing it out of proportion\u2026 like the way we blow on our Ginko bodypillows\u2026 \r\nSimilar to the one the protagonist takes in the show itself, watching Mushishi feels like a grand journey.You embark on your adventure at the starting minutes of episode one, playing ambient music and watching a 18 year old virgin creating his first let\u2019s play episode on repeat on your iPhone, so the aura you trudge in around you always feels mundane but also somewhat still amusing. Your good taste in music also attracts interesting characters, which all feel human, despite all being one trick ponies. And to top it all off, Studio Artland, the guys who made all the snobs jizzazzle their pants when they made Legend of the Galactic Heroes back in the day before your grandpa was watching Evangelion, is back animating all the beautiful scenery around you.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, after I gave you that terrible and confusing intro, let\u2019s sink our teeth into the juicy steak that is this show\u2019s synopsis. Mushishi is a collection of episodic stories that follows a white-haired one-eyed man named Ginko-stinko-chan as he roams around historical Japan. He ponders for the meaning of these mysterious beings named vagina- I mean mushi. Mushi, no s-es needed at the end, are the lowest levels of life and are like ghosts in the way that they\u2019re neither quite alive nor dead, but as an inkling from Splatoon would put it, \u201cThey totes do cause interruptions in the real world.\u201d During his travels, he meets people across the land whose lives have been affected by these beings and attempts to solve their problems the best he can. \\n\\n\r\nSomething that an episodic series needs to be great is an interesting world to explore. While most series explore this through evaluating the settings, laws or circumstances the places of these types of shows take place in, Mushishi builds its world by exploring what the mushi are capable of alone while not really dabbling in the previously mentioned areas. In Mushishi, people whose lives aren\u2019t being meddled by the mushi are barely being affected. While I\u2019d hate to, I\u2019m going to start talking about a negative I had with the show, which is that a the world outside of Ginko\u2019s experiences seems quite empty. No one besides the mushishi, who are only briefly shown between the show, seem to really retaliate or give a crap about these mythical beings. It\u2019s a letdown that show\u2019s universe is hollow, as there are a few scenes in the show that DO give us some actual worldbuilding, such as Ginko fiddling with his di-, I mean, \u201cmushi toys\u201d tucked away in his pant-, I mean, \u201ctoolbox\u201d that he uses to counteract the mushi and they are genuinely some of the most memorable moments in the show. I\u2019ll make things clearer: I\u2019m not disappointed because the people in the show don\u2019t begin a first world war between the mushi \u2013 I\u2019m disappointed because the world seems too ordinary even with the mushi coexisting alongside humanity.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode follows a basic formula: Ginko meets a guy > Guy explains troubles > Ginko identifies mushi and problem > Character goes through trauma or development > Ginko saves the day or ultimately fails. This however doesn\u2019t get stale which I\u2019ll explain later. Thankfully, the mushi don\u2019t lack in depth in any department, which makes the lack of worldbuilding only a teensy irk. It\u2019s also good as it would be a sloppy shart in the pants if the show failed at executing the main thing it revolved around. Each episode introduces a new mushi that works differently and has a weirder Japanese-y name than the last, so the series never runs low on steam. They can influence their surroundings in many intriguing ways, whether that be through diminishing certain human senses, cursing objects or people or maybe even forcing whole environments or nations to go under an abrupt or dangerous change. Some bring blessings, others bring curses but a staple and good theme that Ginko brings up in the show is that the mushi aren\u2019t really friendly or antagonistic beings, and that people should learn not to picture them as either. The amount of abilities the writers could think of to give the mushi is something quite applaudable. It\u2019s also great that the ending of each episode all turned out a different way: some had the protagonists getting their way, some succumbed to the mushi but my favourite endings were when sometimes the flavour was bittersweet, and both sides lost a bit of something. \\n\\n\r\nSomething Mushishi has a trademark for is its atmosphere and this is because of its powerful serenity. Nearly every aspect of its execution, whether it be the fantastic music (which I\u2019ll talk about later), its enchanting scene depiction in certain areas and its relatively slow pacing all wrap together into a thick bong, ready to be enhaled to make you feel drowsy. Nothing feels out of place\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2026Except for one thing. While nearly every element that makes Mushishi makes you feel relaxed, it\u2019s sad that the script lacks any form of subtlety. Many key events that happen through an episode, whether that be how a character is feeling, how a mushi works or how a problem is solved, is shoved into the viewer\u2019s face. It\u2019s a bit of a shame, as the characters in turn do lose a layer of depth as there aren\u2019t any intricate scenes of character behaviour or small lines with expansive intent in the script which could have founded strong characterisation (see Ping Pong the Animation) and the use of show-and-don\u2019t-tell during backstory scenes (see Cowboy Bebop) could have made the atmosphere even denser in the show if it was implemented.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I kinda just shat on the characters from a drop toilet in the last paragraph, I\u2019m gonna lift them out and finally talk about and shine some light on them. Despite only sticking around for an episode, Mushishi\u2019s characters are actually quite well fleshed out. They are all packaged with a backstory and basic motivations and you\u2019ll feel satisfied with their growth and conclusion by the end of their arcs. The show gave an equal balance of focus to both the mushi and the characters in the same episode, so they don\u2019t trail behind compared to the mushi. On a different point, it was sometimes intriguing to see what each character\u2019s stance WAS on a mushi, and to see if that character welcomed their existence in the world or wanted them to piss off.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve been plotting this Ginko man in and out of this text, and you probably don\u2019t know much about him except that he might be a 60-year-old pirate judging by my eye and hair description from before, so let\u2019s talk about him here. Ginko is a likeable protagonist mostly for being a really cool dude, but he\u2019s not exactly one of the best of his kind. A lot of the time he acts pretty static, and his main prevalence in the episode may just give the viewer in exposition. He does have his quirks though. He is emotionless and very calm and collected a lot of the time, but his behaviour is sometimes fascinating to watch, like hearing his opinions and beliefs about the mushi, or noticing how he sometimes worries more about the mushi during the current problem rather than the people he\u2019s trying to save. In short, mushi to Ginko is like a waifu to an otaku except Ginko doesn\u2019t spend hundreds of dollars on figurines. Anyway, another thing I was a tad annoyed about was that Ginko was sidelined for the mushi and the episodic characters on the pitch way too often. Sure, he had that one episode that exposed his character, that may actually be one of my favourite anime episodes of all time, but you know, that\u2019s totally not enough or anything.  \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get to the music section. In short, it\u2019s bloody fantastic. Actually, that summary\u2019s a bit too rowdy-seeming to describe the music, so let\u2019s just say it\u2019s \u201cearnest\u201d (love ya, JonTron). Every song in Mushishi\u2019s melodic arsenal is very ambient and minimalistic, with even the songs playing during the intense scenes would seem like silence to compared to something played during a fight scene in a shonen. Only a few instruments are used at a time to keep the atmospheric humidity moist. I\u2019m terrible at naming instruments since I only type of music I listen to is the electronicy banger type, so I\u2019ll just quote that the music is \u201cvery-Japanese-y-sounding-but-not-in-the-J-Pop-kinda-way-but-in-a-historical-Japan-kinda-way-get-what-I\u2019m-saying?\u201d. Also, there are episode exclusive tracks: they are wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation meet the bar needed for a show like Mushishi\u2019s and have aged well considering it aired when I was four years old. Character designs are simple and rigid, but a bit samey. The mushi look splendid at times, but a lot of the time they are just represented as generic luminescent plankton. The standout in the art department however are the backdrops of the scenes, all beautifully portraying the vastness of the Japanese countryside. They come in many varieties too, such as rainforest, beach, rainforest, rainforest, rainforest and\u2026 shit\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSo you may ask, \u201cDoes Mushishi have an explosive finale to wrap it all up? Does Ginko-chan need to carry that weight?\u201d Well, unfortunately this is another thing that makes the first season of Mushishi the slightest bit of a downer: there is no definitive ending. While the series ends on an episode very somewhat centred on Ginko, the main character\u2019s journey doesn\u2019t end, he doesn\u2019t learn the secret of the mushi and he doesn\u2019t whimper \u201cbang\u201d before falling to the ground. Thankfully, Mushishi does have a second season but people did have to endure ten years for it to come, and as someone who hasn\u2019t finished season two yet I don\u2019t even know if it definite conclusion by the end of that. I\u2019m glad I watched this anime last December and didn\u2019t need have to sit the agonising wait: it\u2019s good to be a younger anime fan sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nAs something I recommend that you is that it\u2019s a good idea to watch only one or two episodes of Mushishi a day, or you\u2019ll start to feel the side effects similar to eating a bar of soap. While I hold this series dear to me, I will agree that it can get pretty sickening if you stomach down too much. \\n\\n\r\nSo, is Mushishi worth your time you still ask? Well, I hope you weren\u2019t a TL;DR fatass and you actually read the whole thing, because the answer\u2019s already in there. Tuturu~ and have a hupy dey.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOh, fine. I\u2019ll do a summary.\\n\r\nMushishi is a classic and I believe every anime fan, whether they be an assholish snob (like me) or a shonen-tard (like\u2026 me\u2026), should give it a go. The mushi give plenty of ideas to work with for many interesting stories, and while the side characters aren\u2019t as memorable they certainly play their roles well. The melancholic atmosphere is also something particularly special and will make you want to fall asleep (in a good way I hope) and a grin of satisfaction will always stretch across your face as the credits of the episode you just watched begin to roll.\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\n+Great atmosphere\\n\r\n+Huge variety of arcs with fleshed out characters that doesn\u2019t get old\\n\r\n+Mushi are a deep concept\\n\r\n+Music\\n\r\n+Landscapes\\n\r\n+Episode 12 (I hope this is the Ginko one guise\u2026)\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n-World seems too ordinary\u2026\\n\r\n-Lack of subtlety in writing despite atmosphere\\n\r\n-No bombastic ending\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Score: 9\\n\r\nSnob Score: 8",

            "content": "Here we are in feudal Japan (we dont have the exact time given, you can just deduct it yourself). But this simple world of humans consists of a second world, the mushi one. Mushi are the most basic forms of life in the world. They exist without any goals or purposes aside from simply \"being.\" They are beyond the shackles of the words \"good\" and \"evil.\" Mushi can exist in countless forms and are capable of mimicking things from the natural world such as plants, diseases, and even phenomena like rainbows. Basically they are a form of life not coexisting with people. BUT sometimes gettingin a way with our world.\\n\r\nNot all people can see Mushi there is just a few of them.\\n\r\nThe story is connected but not focused on Ginko, a mushishi, which is basically a doctor for problems with Mushi. Mushishi gather knowledge about mushi and then use that to cure people when they interact with human.\\n\r\nStoryline is pretty lazy, which I actually love. There's no actual storyline that we follow, in every episode we have a different story, different thing that happen to come by on Ginkos way. Every episode consist of a story that Ginko tries to solve, where he is not always succesful.\\n\\n\r\nVIBE:\\n\r\nThe atmosphere that this series creates is amazing. I recommend watching only one episode per day, the reason for that will be explained in a second. As you will see throughout this series Im a fan of visual expierience, meaning a anime that will give me shivers just by looking at it. Talking is reduced to minimum, music is minimalistic, animation is slow. Everything gives you this special atmospehere of silence. When you listen about those stories of mushi and people, sometimes sad, sometimes creepy or even scary I would say, you will get the shivers. The reason for watching only one episode per day is that you have to have time to think about every episode, I know when youre pumped about an anime you just have to watch the whole series in one day :P But trust me you need time, the thing that Ginko also travels long distances between episodes gives you this feeling that time actually passed.\\n\\n\r\nART STYLE:\\n\r\nThere's not much to say. It's just astonishingly good, you can see that every place that Ginko was at, was designed with every detail. Each face is masterfully animated. Really not much to say, it's just good.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/VOICEACTING:\\n\r\nLet's start of with voiceacting. I love it. This is srsly the best voiceacting I ever got in any anime, every voice is original and accurately chosen. You also never heard those voice before for sure. Even Ginkos voice. The only big role for the actor behind his voice was Ginko, congrats to producers for choosing such a great actor, Im glad they looked into it. They could have just got someone famous and not care about it.\\n\r\nThe music, daaaaamn. I watched every opening and ending, every single one of them, just because of the music. The openings are original, because they chose indie english music, which is rather weird, often people use just japanese music. Check out Lucy Rose - Shiver, like the best song ever. As I mentioned earlier the music is minimalistic, meaning there is not much to it. 3 sounds cooperating with each other making a simple music, yet it provied superb vibe, and builds up the whole thing.\\n\\n\r\nSTORYLINE: \\n\r\nWell there is not much of a story line, so I can't really talk about it a lot. But I can say that story of every episode is different, I remeber watching only one episode that was worse then the other. Only one, the rest of them are just great, the most are amazing.\\n\\n\r\nWell in concusion I say 10/10, I just love these types of animes, and this one was perfectly excecuted. There's also manga of this, so I need to jump on that!\\n\\n\r\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/E5Pu4O9ki4M",

            "content": "\u201cThe world is filled with life unknown to man.\u201d\r\nThis statement holds deep meaning in this anime, Mushishi. Mushishi is a masterpiece. I cannot find anything like it. \r\nMushishi is very relaxing to watch, though there are times when it gives you a twinge on the heart. It is light and enjoyable. I couldn\u2019t stop watching one episode and another. The stories in each episode are varied and well-written. It gives happiness and sadness or both at the same time. \r\nOne of the things I like in this anime is that you couldn\u2019t predict what happens next. It\u2019s not the same as some animes inwhich you already know how things end up. If you watch this, you\u2019ll be exposed to a world completely unknown. It makes you wonder and anticipate what happens. Your curiosity will be picked on and on. At the end, I was even yearning for more and more mystery. It\u2019s deep I tell you.\\n\\n\r\nThe stories revolves on how two species co-exist, how humans live with the presence of Mushi\u2019s and how their lives are affected by Mushi\u2019s.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode depicts Ginko\u2019s encounter with Mushi\u2019s. Ginko, the main protagonist, is a likeable character. His character fits well with his job. But note, there is more to him than what you see. \\n\\n\r\nThe background music is also quite fitting to the atmosphere of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOne word is all it takes to make any anime worthy to be watched: interesting. It\u2019s simple. If you think it\u2019s interesting, then watch. If not, then don\u2019t. It all boils down in asking yourself: Is it interesting enough to make me watch it? \\n\\n\r\nSo? Is it worth it? \\n\\n\r\nYes, absolutely. I love it. What makes this show interesting is that the mysteries of another life are unveiled in a very subtle yet profound manner.",

            "content": "Have you ever had a conversation with a friend about why \"insert popular anime here\"(Sailor Moon, DBZ, Pokemon) is actually crap, and even after laying down evidence and arguments you can't come to a consensus. All too often this happens because both of you have different values. Some people want to watch an anime just to turn your brain off. Others want to feel a sense of nostalgia about their childhood. \r\nMushi-shi follows that same note where it is an anime that you get or you don't. Where DBZ and Naruto are on one end of the spectrum that we call anime, Mushi-shi is onthe polar opposite end. The late-and-great Osamu Tezuka wrote a manga titled \"Phoenix\", that is to this day revered as one of the best manga of all time. After reading a few volumes, it is not hard to tell why. \"Phoenix\" is very much a philosophical meditation on what it means to be alive/the meaning of life. Mushi-shi, in my opinion, is very similar to \"Phoenix\" in its execution and subject matter.\\n\\n\r\nMushi-shi is very simple. Ginko is a spirit doctor who travels from village to village in order to make a living. The plot of Mushi-shi is trivial because it is\\n\r\nepisodic. Very little changes from one episode to the next. In fact you could watch this show entirely out of order and still enjoy it. Way to often, anime\\n\r\ntreads the same ground and oftentimes makes the same mistake. Every highschool anime in existence is oftentimes the same formula with minor twists, and this is coming from someone who enjoys the high school SOL genre. Mushi-shi masterfully avoids this pitfall of monotony because it is trying to encompass such a large array of human emotions and feelings. There is tragedy, redemption, suffering and anguish, revelation and love, all of these emotions evoked so effortlessly episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnime can serve as a form as escapism, we watch idealized high school scenarios, or we can imagine that we are the OP ace pilot for a gundam, as \\n\r\nviewers we can occupy ourselves in worlds that we desire. As a pessimist, Mushi-shi feels more like the world we do live in. A handful of these characters have endured incredible loss and misfortune. Yet, they go on living. Frankly, for me, there is nothing more uplifting than that. The toil and folly of human life is something rarely addressed as a serious topic in anime, and Mushi-shi basks in that, it bathes in it.\\n\\n\r\nThis was clearly made on a shoestring budget,the animation is poor, sound effects are used sparingly or not at all sometimes. The color pallette is dull. \\n\r\nOverall there is nothing visually engaging about Mushi-shi. My high score really derives entirely from the fact that I can not deny that Mushishi was a moving experience. The show did not need to have great animation, great dialogue, or great direction(which it does for the latter two), because the bedrock of what was being said and why it was being said resonated with me because of the almost immediate empathy I had for nearly all of these characters. \\n\\n\r\nMushi-shi is a slow burn. Similar to shows like Boogiepop Phantom, Paranoia Agent, or Kino's Journey. You have to process it and find meaning in it from your own unique perspective, if you come into it with preconceived notions or trying to interpret it from someone else's lense you will probably leave disappointed. Some might get it right away, some may never get it and discard it altogether. Either way is completely fine, as long as you give Mushishi a chance. It has amassed a cult following for a reason.\\n",

            "content": "Mushishi is an anime that goes episode by episode while following the adventures of the protangonist Ginko. The series is a great watch however is not a show to binge through all in one day as that session can get really boring.\r\nNethertheless the show is worth every 23minutes you pour into it.\r\nplot:\r\n There really isn't any overarching plot as the series goes episode by episode ( completely different plot for each episode ) this means that most episodes are completely unrelated to each other. Due to this you don't really nees to watch the series in order and you can enjoy each episode asif it were it's own movie or show. However due to this some episodes aren't as great as others.\\n\\n\r\nArt&animation:\\n\r\n The visual art in this series is just beautiful and can just leave in awe. Every single background in this show can be it's own stand alone art piece. Also the mushishi in the show look really pretty at times. The animation in this show is solid and never goes down in quality as the studio never goes over the top with the animation as there is no need to.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound:\\n\r\n The sound quality in this show is solid  because of calm the sound frequency and the voices of the characters are. This level of calmness gives the show a nice relaxing estetic that leaves the series a nice comfy feel. However when this atmosphere is dropped during a high action moment it can get pretty panicky and intense ( which is good ). The music fits right in with the mood of the show and sounds really nice. This is quite apparent for the opening and ending that emulates tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters:\\n\r\n You can't really get attached to any characters other than Ginko and one character that reappears rarely (Adashino). Ginko though is actually a really good character and its such a pleasure to follow him on his neverending adventure. However since you only stick with Ginko you can really start to miss the characters from the previous episodes and its pretty sad.\\n\\n\r\nAtmosphere:\\n\r\n This shows pretty sad and many episodes leave a bittersweet feel at the end. This is because most episodes leave an ending that makes the episode feel like it really didn't give an actually conclusion. Due to this feeling the episodes really leave thinking and pondering at the end of each story.\\n\\n\r\nComplaints and last thoughts:\\n\r\n This show's pacing is pretty slow and this speed of progession usually for the most part works in the shows favour. This pacing speed usually works because the of the show's episode by episode layout that only works when the show progresses slowly. Even though i say the episodes are slow the episodes areactually progressing really fast but it just feels like its taking a long time. Due to this some episodes miss this sweetspot for the pacing and the episodes feel way to long and make me wanna die. On the other hand some episodes go by pretty fast and you don't have much time to absorb all the emotions, the episode's themes and mood. So please take that into account when starting an episode of Mushishi.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\n This show is an amazing show that not everybody can get into with its pacing. It will however make you experience wonder, happiness, awe, sadness, despair, and emptiness all in the span of one episode. I totally reccomend Mushishi to anyone with a least some level of paitence and want to be left in awe through Ginko's many relationships , new aquaintences, and jobs thrown at him.",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\n\"Mushishi\" is a very special piece. I would say that it is a \"rara avis\" within the anime. Its main and most striking features are not something that abounds in this sector. I'm not saying it's unique or pioneering (I really don't know), but it does have some very uncommon aspects that catch you from the first moment. \r\nTo begin with, \"Mushishi\" is a procedural series. Each episode transports us to an indeterminate moment in time in which the protagonist, Ginko, is enveloped in a story with the mysterious Mushi as its central axis. There is really no time line, orat least it is never shown directly. It doesn't matter either. It's not necessary. It is true that in the background we are learning more about Ginko or about the functioning of his world or of the Mushi, but this is something inherent to the sum of moments throughout the episodes, not to the existence of a conventional timeline. The best proof of how well implemented it is is that you could see any of the 26 episodes in any order and there would be no problem. Literally. You would still enjoy it the same way.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that they are independent episodes, together with the fact that the stories are usually accompanied by a very strong emotional charge, make \"Mushishi\" an anime to be enjoyed little by little. An anime that to taste slowly while we submerge ourselves fully in its atmosphere and we unconsciously envelop ourselves in its aura. Quiet, relaxed, mystical, magical. Apart also usually requires as much attention as possible, as it is quite intense in terms of depth and complexity philosophical, moral, metaphorical. It is better not to miss a single detail or get lost at any time, since in that case it is possible that it becomes complicated to follow it as it deserves. In my opinion, and because it is so trendy nowadays, I would like to add that to see \"Mushishi\" in one of those episode-eating marathons is a real waste.\\n\\n\r\nI was mentioning before the enveloping atmosphere surrounding \"Mushishi\". This is greatly helped by a technical section that is truly meticulous and bordering on a spectacular level. I want to highlight the beautiful artistic section (although perhaps with its weak point in the repetitive character design), but what really fascinated me completely is the sound section. The sound effects are fascinating and incredibly immersive. In the right amount, at the right times. Pure nature. Never forgetting the soundtrack, its music. And what music, simply great. It is impossible for me to imagine better melodies for \"Mushishi\". They are perfect for it. It's a symbiotic relationship, practically. Melodies like \"Mushishi no Theme\", \"Makura Kouji\", \"Unasaka Yori\" or \"Rinkou\" are a fucking wonder. Just like that. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\n\"Mushishi\" es una obra muy especial. Dir\u00eda que es una \"rara avis\", casi un bicho raro, dentro del anime. Sus caracter\u00edsticas principales y m\u00e1s llamativas no son algo que abunde en este mundillo. No estoy diciendo que sea \u00fanica ni pionera (realmente no lo s\u00e9), pero s\u00ed que tiene unos rasgos muy poco comunes y que te atrapan desde el primer momento. Lejos de conseguir que esto chirr\u00ede o parezca fuera de lugar, se potencia al m\u00e1ximo y se convierte en abanderado de un estilo propio muy peculiar.\\n\\n\r\nPara empezar, \"Mushishi\" es una serie procedimental. Cada cap\u00edtulo nos transporta a un momento temporal indeterminado en el que el protagonista, Ginko, se ve envuelto en una historia con los misteriosos Mushi como eje central. Realmente no hay l\u00ednea temporal, o al menos nunca se muestra de forma directa. Tampoco importa. No es necesario. S\u00ed es cierto que de fondo vamos conociendo m\u00e1s datos sobre Ginko o sobre el funcionamiento de su mundo o de los Mushi, pero esto es algo inherente a la suma de momentos a lo largo de los cap\u00edtulos, no a la existencia de una l\u00ednea temporal convencional. La mejor prueba de lo bien implementado que est\u00e1 es que podr\u00edas ver cualquiera de los 26 cap\u00edtulos sea en el orden que sea y no habr\u00eda ning\u00fan problema. Literalmente. Seguir\u00edas disfrut\u00e1ndola de la misma manera.\\n\\n\r\nEl tema de que sean cap\u00edtulos independientes entre s\u00ed, unido a que las historias suelen ir acompa\u00f1adas de una carga emocional muy fuerte, hacen de \"Mushishi\" un anime para disfrutar poco a poco. Un anime que paladear lentamente mientras nos sumergimos de lleno en su ambiente y nos envolvemos inconscientemente de su aura. Tranquilo, relajado, m\u00edstico, m\u00e1gico. Aparte tambi\u00e9n suele requerir toda la atenci\u00f3n posible, ya que es bastante intensa en cuanto a profundidad y complejidad filos\u00f3fica, moral, metaf\u00f3rica. Es mejor no perderse ni un solo detalle ni despistarse en ning\u00fan momento, ya que en ese caso es posible que se haga complicada de seguir tal y como merece. En mi opini\u00f3n, y debido a que tan de moda est\u00e1n hoy en d\u00eda, querr\u00eda a\u00f1adir que verse \"Mushishi\" en uno de esos maratones devora-cap\u00edtulos es un aut\u00e9ntico desperdicio. Una forma horrible de enfocar una propuesta que es pr\u00e1cticamente la ant\u00edtesis de esos atracones a toda prisa.\\n\\n\r\nHablaba antes de la envolvente atm\u00f3sfera que rodea a \"Mushishi\". A ello contribuye much\u00edsimo un apartado t\u00e9cnico verdaderamente cuidado y que raya a un nivel espectacular. Quiero destacar el bello apartado art\u00edstico (aunque quiz\u00e1 con su punto d\u00e9bil en lo repetitivo del dise\u00f1o de personajes), pero lo que realmente me ha fascinado por completo es el apartado sonoro. Los efectos de sonido son fascinantes e incre\u00edblemente inmersivos. En la cantidad justa, en los momentos adecuados. Pura naturaleza. Sin olvidar bajo ning\u00fan concepto a la banda sonora, su m\u00fasica. Y qu\u00e9 m\u00fasica, simplemente genial. Me es imposible imaginar unas melod\u00edas mejores para \"Mushishi\". Son perfectas, encajan como un guante. Es una relaci\u00f3n simbi\u00f3tica, pr\u00e1cticamente. Melod\u00edas como \"Mushishi no Theme\", \"Makura Kouji\", \"Unasaka Yori\" o \"Rinkou\" son una jodida maravilla. Sin m\u00e1s.",

            "content": "When I first watched Mushishi there was only 1 season out. From the first episode the show stuck with me and calmed me. I knew I had found something that either was a masterpiece, or at least very, very close to it.\r\nStory: The story in Mushishi follows Ginko, a mushi-shi (a kind of spiritualist who deals with problems where creatures known as mushi are conderned). He moves from place to place solving problem, trying to do it as peacefully as possible. The show show many different sides of how people can be, both kind, cruel, evil, smart, stupid, reckless and so on... The pacing isusually quite slow and peaceful, which might not appeal so much for everyone, but for me it was superb, letting me just relax and watch. The story shows that not all things that hurts humans are evil, and focuses a lot on Ginkos vision of coexistence, as he, unlike most other mushi-shi, prefers to avoid killing mushi. The show goes with mostly episodic arc, allowing most people to just drop in on the episode of their choosing.\\n\r\nArt & Sound: The art in the show uses a lot of different techniques and changes fluently between simpler background or characters to more detailed ones without it seeming strange or unnatural. It also has a very specific way of drawing faces, which stand out from most manga/anime. The sound is where this show really shines, with beautiful tunes playing in the background. The music fits perfectly to most of the situations and is almost beautiful enough to make me want to just replay the episodes over and over, just to listen to the background music. The voice acting is very well done as well, making it pleasant to listen to people speak.\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters and creatures are all well done with their own personalities, abilities and characteristics. There aren't many stereotypes in this show, but as most characters (except for Ginko) are only in the show for a few episodes at most, you don't get to know them that well.\\n\r\nOverall: This show is an outstanding show that lulls you into a world filled with fantastical creatures and beautiful music. You can just relax and watch for hours (at least I can). If you don't heavily mind a slow pacing I think most people could enjoy this, with friends/family or alone. If you have kids and they like anime, this could also be a great bedtime watch as the slow pacing and calm music could be used to lull the children to sleep, or to help the relax first at least.\\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "content": "To be honest, when I watched Mushishi for the first time, I hated it! Since it's episodic and doesn't really have an overarching plot; I thought it was boring and has nothing going for it except pretty visuals and nice music. But later on I noticed that you have to be in the proper mood to enjoy Mushishi: I tried to think to myself \"What kind of adventure will await me this episode?\" So instead of expecting plot twists and story progression left and right, I started accepting what Mushishi really is: a collection of supernatural short stories with a heavy emphasis on atmosphere andsubtlety.\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters (7/10)\\n\r\nMushi (Japanese for \"bugs\") are basically spirits that sometimes resemble plants or bugs, and othertimes they're just plain bizarre beings. Mushi are not exactly good or evil, they're just doing their thing, but sometimes this causes trouble for people.\\n\\n\r\nThis is when people seek help for Mushi-shi: experts on the topic of Mushi. The main character Ginko is one of those. Ginko has the nasty habit of attracting Mushi, so he can't stay for too long in one place. This is why he's just wandering from one place to another and in every episode he helps people who have trouble with those Mushi. Most of the time they don't even realize that their problems are caused by Mushi, but Ginko usually enlightens them.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nEven though the towns people that Ginko comes across all look and act very simmiliar to each other, they usually have a dramatic and emotional backstory, that makes the viewer care for them. You'll get the feeling that you got to know these peope really well in those 20 minutes of an episode (even if you didn't). Still, you most likely won't remember most of the characters, but insteadt the mysterious incedents that these people witness.\\n\\n\r\nGinko himself is a really chill dude. You could argue that he is somewhat bland; and that might be true to some extent, but a loud and exagerated character would just be really distracting in an anime like this. It's always a pleasure listening to Ginko's explaination on how the various types of Mushi work. Of course this is also because his Japanese voice actor did a great job on capturing Ginko's laid back personality.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Music: (9/10)\\n\r\nEasily the strongest aspect of Mushishi is it's audio visual department. The enviroments look really nice, there is a lot of detail in the backgrounds and the surreal places Ginko travels through create an amazing atmosphere. The characters look relatively simple though and are a contrast to the backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I didn't like is that a lot of times the characters don't have faces. This isn't unusual in anime, especially when characters are more in the background (so it's not as noticeable), but in Mushishi these characters are clearly visible in the foreground!\u00a0 That's only a very minor flaw however, the shows looks still really impressive for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nAnother important aspect of Mushishi's atmosphere is the great music. Lots of traditional Japanese instruments are used, which I found very fitting. There wasn't that much of variety however, they mostly reused the same 4-5 tracks every episode, or at least that's what it felt like. But that's not a big deal, since there isn't constantly music playing. At least every episode had a different ending song, that was pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mushishi is a fantastic series. It's a really unique and relaxing anime, and it's especially fun it short bursts. For me personally, it's the show that finally sparked by interest in episodic anime.\\n",

            "content": "Mushishi intrigued me, the beginning hook drew me in and made me curious.  It had a science fiction feel about it but most of the things were explaining natural phenomena in a different way.  \r\nIn some ways the anime was very focused on realism, the various diseases and symptoms the characters displayed could be connected to real diseases.  Although the way these diseases were cured and diagnosed was where the science fiction and fantasy came into play.  \r\nTo those who like puzzles, mysteries, and are of scientific mind be sure to take a look at this anime.  When watching throughthe anime it gives the viewer the sense of tipping their head to the side and thinking about what was going on.\\n\r\nThe storyline of this anime is fairly non existent, there are brief summaries of the main character's past but for the most part it is focused on his various encounters with the mysterious creatures known as mushi.  Each episode features it's own story, they slightly build on each other but a person who watches this anime from somewhere in the middle will be able to grasp the concept without an incredible amount of difficulty.\\n\r\nThe art is very well done and have spectacularly drawn scenes that could easily be used as backgrounds or posters.  The animation itself is very fluid and the details from scene to scene are intricate and complex.  It also has a very mystical feel about it.\\n\r\nThe sound is very good, there is nothing spectacular about it but it was fluid and fit nicely in with the rest of the anime.\\n\r\nThe characters or the main character was very in depth and unique he had a calm reflective personality and I was drawn in by his actions.  Whenever presented with a situation he would have a logical solution out of it, very interesting to see his reactions to different situations.\\n\r\nOverall I thought that this was a spectacular anime, it saddened me to learn it was only twenty-six episodes long but each were unique and captivating.  My only complaint would be the lack of the story and about the way it ended.  It was outstanding in every other way, I was very impressed.",

Even the tiniest of plants look alive and the hills buried in fog seem hazy and weary.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters are too bright or standing out. And a very important reason for that, is that the show isn't about the characters. It is about the stories they tell. The person telling the story might play a very big part in it, but you can't help but forget the person's face as you drift away into the fantasy world as if you're lying next to the campfire, feeling its warmth, hearing the distant sounds, feeling the sweet smell of the atmosphere that surrounds you, while listening to stories not one person apart from you and the storyteller has ever heard of.\\n\\n\r\nWhen an episode reaches the end, the story always reaches its conclusion, be it something that is too unfathomable for our world, or something personal, maybe even too simple or obvious to be noticed straight away. A soothing ending theme composed especially for each episode takes off, as your mind enters a dreamworld of its own.\\n\\n\r\nMushishi is not pretending to be something it isn't. It does not try to enliven its stories with anything that has since become a clich\u00e9 element. It expects you to understand that at this moment you're only the listener, and not the storyteller.

As though it didn't just completely understand you and your experience as a person, but in some way had evolved itself from your own thoughts or ideals?\r\nWell, for me, watching Mushishi is like breathing after a thunderstorm. Or like a refreshing cup of tea. It is passion condensed. It is a practice in meditation.\r\nLike the films of Kunio Kato or Miyazaki, the environment is what makes the film's story feel so full of life. Each story has a completely different energy from the lastand yet one comes away feeling at perfect harmony and peace. One of the most impressive aspects of it, to me, is the use of sound - and particularly the quiet, the silence and what lies in between to fully capture and harness this energy and transfer it into moods. \\n\\n\r\nI love films where the real main characters are not our protagonists, but some outside force - such as the landscape, a background, the weather, a memory -  all of these are a shadow of something else. Something, maybe behind the scenes or possibly a thing that is yet to come. And in this anime, for me, the utilization of sounds and silences, particularly silences, were what made up my real main characters. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, the Mushishi were like the interpretations that represented the different forms of these sounds and silences. (Who knew there was more than one kind of silence, but in a moment of one's deepest reflections?) And being able to see and hear all the varied manifestations of each gave every episode a kind of ...atmosphere. A kind of PLACE, in the world it had made, as well as my own. \\n\\n\r\nIt was as though the film took all the moments from my life that had included silence and reflection; every memory I had associated with a sound (snow, a moment in the sun, the smell of a library or an old book,discovering you have  found a person whom you really love, the enjoyment of a real conversation, pudding) and documented them into these stories that although completely separate in chronicle, in feeling were utterly similar. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is phenomenal in every sense of the word. But, honestly, I would only consider watching it alone or with those whom you feel complete trust with because it can leave one feeling somehow exposed, which we soemtimes like to guard from most. I can only think of possibly three, maybe four, others in the world I could be near while watching this. And even then, I might be wary.",

But even without a full plot, it is very entertaining and I was excited to see the weekly mushi and plot resolution. 8\r\nArt- It's beautiful. The show describes these abstract beings called mushi and then shows them to you. The entire idea ofthe show is to let your imagination run wild. It's the most visually appealing show I've seen in a while. 10\\n\\n\r\nSound- The OP and EP are the same for all 26 episodes.... Good! The EP and OP are really f*cking good and I want to hear them. I watched the Dub and Ginko's voice is very soothing and fit his character. This is also one of the only shows I've seen that actually makes good use of silence and nature sounds. 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- The same deal as plot. Ginko is kind of this enigmatic journeyman with a mysterious past and I can get behind that. The weekly characters are all somewhat similar: downtrodden, good farm folk. But if it works, it works and it all fit together. The show definitely didn't take any risks in the character department, but it didn't need to because the mushi are the real characters. 8\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- If you don't like this show or think it's boring then you need to reevaluate your life. Go back to watching some weird harem wish-fulfillment or predictable battle shonen (*cough* SAO *cough* Bleach). This show doesn't have great effects or \"action\" but has a masterful use of sound and art. It's just really good. 10\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Just watch it and appreciate it. You could watch it in a language you don't even know (like Japanese) and still be mesmerized by the visuals and sound. If you don't like it, then go watch Pokemon or something more your pace. \\n",

Every character has a story of their own, their own reasons, motivations. The challenge for alternate world perspectives is always to balance the development of details with character development. Often this need to simultaneously reconcile the character's progression with the world's produces glaring inconsistencies. Mushishi beautifully resolves this by not circumscribing itself to any one character. The plot development is beautiful.\r\nCharacter: 8\r\nExtremely lively characters.Personalities in Mushishi are brimming with life, motivations. It is very exciting to identify what the possible motivation was. However, personality progression is located within episodes and rarely outside it. This is understandable given how this really helps enhance the consistency of the world development. \\n\r\nIf the second and third seasons are to be counted this would count as a 9.\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is phenomenal. It resonates with the storyline, amplifying every moment.\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nMushishi is an excellent series. However, one should be warned against binge watching it.

            "content": "This is a very interesting series.  The deliberate pacing can be very off putting at first but if you give it the chance it becomes almost hypnotic pulling you into a world of secrets and magic.  In Mushi-Shi the world is inhabited with tiny creatures known as Mushi.  Though generally not malicious theses creatures, invisible to nearly everyone, can cause great difficulty and pain to humans who stumble upon them. Though the common character throughout the episodes is Gin, a Mushi Master, it is wrong to think of him as a protagonist.  The episodes rather focus on the normal people who'slives have been disrupted by the intrusion of a Mushi into their lives.  This is an affecting and arresting series well worth a watch.  Give it a few episodes, it takes a while to fall under the spell but once you do it leaves a mark.  Stunning art including watercolor backgrounds add to the arresting atmosphere of the show.  Well worth a watch",

            "content": "STORY [9] \r\nIt's difficult to describe the genre Mushishi would qualify as, the best I can do is a kind of 'Shamanistic Medical Drama' but even that doesn't really do it justice. The story follows a travelling 'Mushi-shi', an expert in the ways of mushi; spiritual creatures that often gather and manifest symptoms similar to diseases in other life forms. He travels rural japan treating the ailments of those negatively effected by the mushi. \r\nEach individual episode is it's own independent story, and as such the show could potentially be watched in any order. (A big plus as some of the volumes of the dvdsare unavailable) \\n\\n\r\nHowever some may find the episodic nature of the show formulaic and repetitive or even a little dull. This show definitely isn't for everyone, particularly those seeking lots of action or romance should look elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER [7] \\n\r\nYes not characters, character. As Ginko, the travelling Mushishi is the only recurring character throughout the series. He takes a very non-judgmental approach with both the Mushi and the \"patients\" he meets focusing only on saving lives. This, in my opinion, preserves the more philosophical aspects of the show from pretentiousness. As it allows the viewer to interpret how right or wrong each character's actions were based on their own moral/philosophical views rather than have the \"right\" answer shoved down our throats like we seen so often in other anime (particularly shounen). Episode 22 in particular had a huge impact on me because of this.\\n\\n\r\nOn the downside I felt he was a little to passive at points, even in the event of other character's deaths he showed little to no emotional reaction. \\n\\n\r\nART [8] \\n\r\nThe real star of the visuals in this series is rural japan itself. The beautiful backdrops that make up this show, be it huge forests, mountains or rocky shores create an atmosphere for the show that I've never seen done so well anywhere else, even in Miyazaki films. The colour pallet is soft and the show carries a certain elegance purely from the art style, similar to how shows like 'Usagi Drop' pull off a simple yet sublime style.\\n\\n\r\nOn the downside however many of the side characters look almost identical, particularly the men and boys as they all have short dark hair. This is because the art doesn't have the rainbow of hairstyle colours that other anime have relied on to differentiate the characters. Also some of the mid-distance shots do not have faces drawn on the characters which becomes very noticeable later on. The opening and ending visuals were also too plain in my opinion, particularly the latter.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND [9] \\n\r\nOne of the true tragedies of this show is that it has such a fantastic soundtrack, but most people will miss it almost entirely as it is so subtle throughout most of the show. For example each episode has a unique song as the ending theme that fits the tone of the particular episode perfectly (though the viewer is likely to deep in thought deciding their own take on the events of the episode to notice) This soundtrack combined with the aforementioned art style create an atmosphere I've never seen done as well elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT [9] \\n\r\nThe show currently holds the number 7 spot on my all time favorite anime list. It is a must see for fans of shows like \"Kaiba\" and \"Kino's Journey\" (with those two being my alternate anime recommendations for those who have seen Mushishi) \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL [8.4]",

If you are interested, don't hesitate.. you will have to see for yourself... \r\nBesides, Ginko is also COOL!!! His white hair and marble-green eyes does it all. Even though the style of drawing of environment and character is different from other anime or manga, but still, it has it's own style and beauty. One thing though, almost everyone inside besides Ginko look almost the same..(haha) The scenery is just PERFECT!! The settings ofthe story is located normally on seasides, mountains and forests. It looked very classical but yet special. \\n\\n\r\nMushi(s) also cause the anime to become wild. There is less scene of blood appear throughout the anime, but the peaceful pace is enough for everyone to enjoy it. Well, for the most, the settings is in JAPAN!! A nice and warm country for me...\\n\\n\r\nI also learned some good values from this anime. For me, nothing is good nor evil. Well, this anime also mentioned something similiar to that (not too same, but quite...) There is also the appearance of sakura and bamboo through the anime.. (nice) \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing is, never hesitate if you are going to choose this anime. It is a MUST SEE ANIME for everyone. If you missed it, it will be a waste, because this is the masterpiece and the essence of pure anime...\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mushishi is a very unique show. Its a show that needs several conditions to be met if one wishes to enjoy it. Its a relaxing anime, often with a melancholic tone. Before we get to the review my suggestion is this: Download it, put your flash drive on the tv, and when no one else is around and its night time, sit on the couch, relax and turn it on. If you have an air-conditioner available, use it.\r\nNow let's get to the review:\r\nStory 10/10\r\nOur main character ginko travels in rather exotic places, from one village to another, helping people he encounters. The story is simpleand yet solid. As i watched this show i had a strong urge to visit such places, to go camping and admire the nature, to sleep while watching the night sky. That kind of lifestyle has been a dream of mine, and when i watched this show i felt that something began to awaken within me. Its precisely that feeling that makes you really enjoy an anime, hence the 10/10...\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBeautiful sceneries, gorgeous landscapes, and a very good looking main character. Considering the date this anime was first released (2005-2006), the animation and art are truly outstanding. If tou like eye-candy and you also like nature, then this anime is for you.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is something that took some time to get used to, but once that happened, i stopped skipping it, and listened to it everytime. The soundtracks however are the real masterpiece here. Soothing, relaxing, each and every one matching the situation perfectly. The sound managed to compliment the beauty of the art, tying everything in a nice little bow. I would've liked it if a couple of the songs had lyrics though, but its alright.\\n\r\nI watched the dubbed version of this anime, and i've got to say that ginko's voice still echoes inside my head. Wonderful!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nUnlike other episodic shows, every new character you meet in one episode, will not appear in the rest. As such, you don't get to know each character deeply and get attached to them. So i am basing my rating on ginko alone. He is a smart man, rather bold, eager to help anyone who is in need. Using his wisdom he tries to always find the best solution to the problem he is facing although there are times that even his deep knowledge can't fix the issue.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, this anime was a masterpiece. Most anime nowadays are action-packed just because it attracts fans. This show proves that the enjoyment of an anime does not depend on action but rather the entire premise and back story. What i especially enjoyed about this series is that it is rather realistic despite having supernatural elements. The problems that people face are unique, interesting and dramatic. Not every one of those problems could be solved and that's what's realistic about it. Each episode was a life-lesson. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9,6/10 \\n",

But in the case of Mushishi it is not.  The anime is great but lacks a central plot.. Each episode has a different story.. So there are only few recurring characters. So whether u watch the 15th or the 23rd episode doesnt make a difference... Each episode is done pretty well..I liked it a lot but it is not addictive.. The intro music is pretty good. And if u are into philosophy, this a mustsee.. The beauty of this anime is that u can watch this anime at any time , may be after 20-30 days..:P The entire anime is like short stories ....not related to each other ...except for the main character...",

It brings it in quite nicely to where it seems natural, and they actually make it natural.\r\nPretty much if an anime has excellent art, animation, then it should be a worth while anime.  \"Mushi-shi\" does not lack in the category, and might be the best for the amount of episodes and running time that comeswith it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, definitely worth watching even for people who don't like those episodic animes.",

Mushishi on the other hand is that rare gem in the darkness that is the exact opposite. Mushishi captivates others through it's artistic value. The atmosphere that it brings through it's score and it's art style is like never seen before. A streamlined story is replaced with an episodic nature where each story holds a weight as strong as those of the longest running anime.. It could be the fact that everything is shroudedunderneath a blanket of unknown. The fact that so many questions are left unanswered leaves the imagination space to roam free. If you have not seen an episode of mushishi i highly recommend this masterpiece.",

            "content": "Simply put, I think that Mushishi is the best anime ever to be made. None other nears the masterful storytelling, excellent technical completeness and richness of Mushishi, which coexists with its strongly defined style, far from clich\u00e9 and stereotypes. But the greatest thing about Mushishi is that it's one of the extremely few animes that reach the point of being poetic (along with Kino no Tabi, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei and Mononoke Hime). These four animes have become art and are the only ones I have watched to do so.\r\nMusishi overtakes them most importantly for the structural perfection of its plot and the amazing contrast oflyrical stories told in an epic overarching set, bound by the setting and Ginko himself. Narrating tales of few, but that however manage to encompass humanity itself.\\n\r\nThere is no more that I can say, other than that you should watch this and that it may feel to have a more natural (slower) pace than almost any other anime, but the use of inserts, scenic sound and other resources allow the story to flow amazingly.",

There was a bit of confusion in the beginning but the captivating interest of the Mushi within the various stories held my attention until I linked Ginko (I think that's his name) to his actual role and origins in the story was. \r\nSo if you like a slow but steady pace of story telling with a super natural twist then this is a title to watch. The characters are well thought out and each episode has you wanting a bit more.",

            "content": "First Review on MAL, any constructive feedback would be appreciated:Anime has always truly been a beautiful branch of media, and I can't think of an anime that exemplifies this statement better than Mushishi. Now before I start I would like to say that this show definitely isn't for everyone, slow pacing and it's episodic and and unusual nature may throw people off. However if you like episodic animes this is glorious. If you need heart pounding action and romance mushishi is not for you. If you need a story that continues on a weekly basis this anime is not for you. However if you wantsomething that isn't ordinary but truly extraordinary, an anime with such great themes and beauty, this is definitely for you. What makes mushishi special is that the entire anime focuses on one character. Now this character is well developed and interesting and as he interacts with different side character that appear briefly you realize that they are great too. The musical score and art compliment each other perfectly and the voice acting is great as well. Mushishi is a show that asks you to reflect on various themes each episode presents. And the episodes in this series range from happy to sad to in between there is such variety in this. The story is beautiful being just a wandering man and the idea of mushi,these minute forms of life gives the story so much depth and simplicity is where this anime succeeds.\\n\r\n In conclusion mushishi was an anime that firmly implanted itself in my top 3 favorite animes with it's themes, art, music, and atmosphere. While watching this, relax, enjoy the ride you'll never see anything quite like it again.",

Mushishi with its subtlety calls out so loudly to its audience, and I imagined myself in this side of life where mushi are, without consciously deciding to do so. I felt the pain and the happiness of the characters. I felt like I saw all of this happening with my own eyes, inches from me. All episodes had this something to them that kept mewanting more. Especially towards the end, I was in awe of the creators of Mushishi and the magic this series possesses. I enjoyed the freedom to interpret its complexity, because while it is governed by some rules, there is no set in stone right or wrong for each situation Ginko and the other people encounter. The mood of this anime is tangible and alive, in a completely unique way.\\n\\n\r\nAlso when I decided to start watching this, I read a review that said to get the full enjoyment out of this series, you should watch one or two episodes a day \u2014 I'm so glad I listened! This experience is so special, it deserves more than a day or two of binging.",

It shows old Japan and that's something I'm a sucker for. The old everyday lives and co-existence with spirits is a beautiful and cultural part of Asia. So much so, the choice of opening songs is extremely shitty compared to ending themes in all the seasons. All the ending theme songs are beautiful Japanese traditional music but for some reason the opening songs are all unrelated English love songs and that's a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Using any beautiful ending theme or a Japanese song would have fitthe anime. This was the only sad part about the anime.",

An aspect that makes mushishi in a very open mind anime. nevertheless mushishi is many times flat and I felt bored to watch another chapter , and at the end the most important thing in a anime or mange is how this catch the attention.
