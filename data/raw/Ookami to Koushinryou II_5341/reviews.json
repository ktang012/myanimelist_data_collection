            "content": "Perhaps I'm ranting about this, and with the score I'm giving I be expecting a lot of disagreements here. To be honest, I was sorely disappointed in Spice and Wolf (S&W), not because it was plain bad, but I cannot see anything worth remembering at all.\r\nCharacter-wise Both Lawrence and Holo showed little to no development at all throughout the series, and watching the anime made me question what the hell is going on more than how interested in the anime I am. In the case of Lawrence, it seemed like he's lost in how he views his relationship with Holo and   his job.Especially the 'Prioritise Profits' part, I cannot fathom why the anime needs to bring itself to mention that time and time again, and then act the opposite. Lawrence's relationship to Holo is even more confusing. In the start of Season 2, the Amarty-Pyrite Arc was the most captivating arc yet, and it ended so, so badly. It was when the tension was the greatest, and yet it was resolved so damn easily. The most disgusting part is that Lawrence seems to have learnt nothing from the ordeal. Slow pacing with the already awkward ending in Season 1 made this a turn-off.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation of Holo herself was a mess as well. I cannot fathom a centuries old demigod to be, of all things, a tsundere. Despite being the Wise Wolf, Holo has not shown her wisdom, using her instincts at best and failing to grasp the situation she is in all the time. In the last episode. One simple sentence from a person she barely knows can affect her that much? What the actual F*ck? If you want to showcase Holo's behaviour to be a result for her centuries in suffering solitude, at least make some effort to emphasise on it. Similar to Lawrence, its seems that Holo has learnt nothing from all the ordeals she faced, and her ever-changing mood made me question whether she is bipolar.\\n\\n\r\nThe music itself was extremely refreshing at first, with the Openings and Endings to be rather good. Then comes the OST... Is it me or several episodes start with the same music? the lack of variety itself was very obvious as well, and it was as though I was listening to a broken radio.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I acknowledge I might be 6 years late for this anime. But considering the fact this anime is so highly rated confuses me. To me, S&W is a mess, that tries to add the intelligent elements of trade and romance with a questionable storyline and extremely confusing and bipolar characters. It was as though the anime tried very very hard to seem intelligent, but backfired extremely hard. Then again, I might be wrong and have interpreted the storyline line wrongly, but for me to question almost every single segment of this anime? There should be a lot of questionable segments about Spice and Wolf we can agree on.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Don't watch*\\n\\n\r\n1. Still, watch Season 1\\n\r\n2. Move on to light novel\\n\r\n3. Pray Season 3 (If it ever comes out) can redeem this mess",

            "content": "*A surprisingly successful sequel with emphasis on the romance between a man and a (cute) wolf.*\r\nAs foreshadowed by the prequel OVA, Spice and Wolf II focus heavily on the romance aspect between our protagonists. By and large, this second adaptation has been regarded as equally successful as its predecessor (if not more successful). In terms of the light novels adaptation, it has been widely accepted for its accurate following of the \u201cactual\u201d story, unlike most anime adaptation. While previous knowledge of the series is not absolutely required to enjoy the show, it is highly recommended for viewers to watch the first season as well asthe OVA, which act as the prelude, before watching Spice and Wolf II. For those who wish to try this series with no previous background, here is a little summary of what to expect. Wordy. To be precise, the show is filled with dialogues from start to end, from episode one to episode twelve. \\n\\n\r\nOne common question people tend to have for this series often relates to the balance between romance and (merchant) trading. While there are still a decent dose of merchant-like business talks that may confuse viewers from time to time, the spotlight for this sequel seems to land on the character developments over anything else. Hence Horo and Lawrence fans will most likely enjoy the show much more than those who seek for nothing but story content (ie. business trades in medieval times). \\n\\n\r\nThe world of Spice and Wolf can often serve as a history textbook (that focuses on the medieval era in Europe). This is once again proven in the second season as viewers are exposed to the corrupted nature of the slave markets and the power of churches at the time. Although the inspiration of merchant trade has been greatly diminished, the believable surroundings of the medieval setting make this anime still interesting to watch even for those who are not too into the romance aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe character department, without doubt, is the selling point this season. Lawrence, for once, no longer seems like an undefeatable merchant. While viewers may remember him as a successful businessman, particularly when it comes to negotiation during trade, in season one. Many of us will be surprised to see that Lawrence, ultimately, is still a human being and thus he must also have his illogical and \u201cstupid\u201d moments especially when it comes to something he has no experience with. Something called love. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation this season is by Brains Base (as oppose to IMAGIN which was responsible for the previous season). There are some very minor changes in the character facial expressions and sometimes their looks at various angles, but overall the quality is similar to the first season and there is no reason for one to be disappointed with it. Re-using a quote from my review on the OVA, \u201cFor the most part, one can safely say Brains Base did a great job in taking over the series\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyu are the same as before with Jun Fukuyama being Kraft Lawrence and the lovely Ami Koshimizu acting as the equally lovable Horo (can\u2019t get enough of that thick \u201cHoro-only\u201d accent). Other notable great seiyu that took part in this season include Romi Paku, and Saeko Chiba. In terms of music, the OP and ED are quite enjoyable and the BGM generally suit the particular scene in the question reasonably well. On the whole, this anime is still unique just like its predecessor. However, the big twist this season is the more intense character relationship developments rather than the merchant trading. In hindsight, there seems to be a certain lack of cleverness in plot development. But then again, the various Horo x Lawrence moments are enough to make up for that.",

            "content": "For those reading this review w/o finishing the first season will be spoiled so be forewarned\r\nThis anime continues where the last one left off, Horo and Lawrence slowly make their way to Horo's hometown. Along the way they happen upon various opportunities for profit and gain useful knowledge. All that while trying to keep a strong relationship between a human and a goddess. Some also might wonder if this can stand up against the hype from the fame of the last series. I can easily tell you it does, but with one Achilles heel....\r\nIts definitely not story or the cast that brings this show downfrom a perfect 10, its the bad decision to use a completely different production companies to fill in place of the original greats Imagin (animation) and Studio Bihou (Background art). But at the very least keep Studio Bihou as this is what made Spicy Wolf 1 extra special. The animation in S&W2 would appear perfectly the same as before except you will notice many mistakes upon viewing, such as awkward angles, skinny limbs turn to fat limbs, back ground characters, and other minor/major details. Albeit not as exact as the original, it still provides that spice and wolf feel. \\n\\n\r\nIf the story of Horo and Lawerence are the heart of the show, the background art would have to be the soul of the show. Amazing amounts of detail were made in S&W1. If you rewatch it, you WILL see things that you haven't seen before. Sadly,  the 'soul' of the show appears to be bland, lifeless, and uninhabited. So many angry feelings bubble up when i saw how many simple angles and lines are in one show. Towns don't look like towns. They more resemble a horrible copy paste job that does not fit any point of view angle at all. Small intricate details like wheat in wheat fields or cobblestones  appear to be nonexistent. It indeed does hinder the experience considerably. But I am confident you will oversee all the faults once you realize that this story is after all, Spice and Wolf 2. \\n\\n\r\nLawrence is still very 'crafty' (heh) and Horo is still foxy as ever. Now that their feelings are more established, we will see more character progression this time around and this alone trumps anything a bad artist can draw up. Most of their emotions are still worn on their sleeves, but now they start to rely on each other implicitly. It's just a wonderful thing to see Lawrence and Horo interact with each other. Like a young boyfriend and girlfriend scheming to do things their way no matter how crazy it may seem. You will also notice how much these two characters have grown from before. For better or worse it does make the chemistry between them much more intense. The acting between the two is something of pure win as you will laugh, cry, and everything in between. Such a play on emotions is also a clever way of dissuading the viewer of thinking one way or another when a choice or problem arises for the fearless duo. \\n\\n\r\nThis will definitely lead the viewer to varying degrees of thinking about the outcome. Its a formula that definitely works great with a mercantile anime. These situations that they face definitely appear to be more difficult than before and it is apparent through the first story arc. It might be because the stronger relationship between the two or just the trading is more intense. Either way, it will leave you wanting for more. Not in a shounen anime sort of way but more like a good book you just can't put down. \\n\\n\r\nEverything pertaining to the light novel appears as anime gold and everything pertaining to animation production (sans the seiyuu cast) seems to have slipped considerably. Do not let the downgrade fool you though, this is till a very solid iteration to Spice and Wolf.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note:  you will love Training With Horo (S&W2 special #2)",

            "content": "Continuing a beloved series and making it greater or just as great can be a challenging task to take. This is not much of a problem for anime that are step-by-step adaptations of any type of original source medium. Spice and Wolf, if you don\u2019t know, is one series that won me over from the previous season. Likewise, I was hoping that this 2nd season would have the same positive impact that the 1st season did for me. While it is not better than the first season in many aspects, it definitely possessed the same fascinating qualities that the 1st season had, with a fewimprovements to the original.\\n\\n\r\nIt is impossible to review a the sequel to a show you\u2019ve already reviewed before without writing similar thoughts on certain aspects. For the sake of being thoughtful, it is important to note these aspects from the previous title and determine whether they improved overtime or not. These include how the character progression has matured over time and if the plot arcs are just as entertaining or thought-provoking as before.\\n\\n\r\nTo start out, our lovable duo, Kraft Lawrence and Holo, continue their journey in order to besting the world of mercantile and business ventures in order to survive the political landscape. In the beginning, we see these two start out their relationship as people who don\u2019t immediately have one that is romantic. It was one that still had a sense of distrust, but they still wanted to have a friendship in order to work out each others\u2019 problems they are having. Now with the 2nd season, with the amount of development both Kraft and Holo had together, they flourished into blossoming partners that have a great connection to one another. It all works because the pacing of their growth is logically slow and based on realistic expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThat connection seems inseparable in hindsight, due in part with the brilliant dialogue both Holo and Kraft share between one another. Then that connection soon fades when, in one plot arc, they go there their separate ways because of a fierce argument amidst each other. What makes this significant to bring up is the fact that the relationship is powerfully written that when you see these two break off from that connection, you can feel nothing but despair watching it fold through. Emotional investment from observing characters in a show growing into fleshed-out characters is important to achieve when you want the audience to care for them in the first place. Spice and Wolf did it brilliantly in the first season, and yet they managed to mold it into something riveting that pulls our emotions without the need of manipulating them.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the plot is concerned, there is no sense of improvement or decline in quality in terms of writing. In season 2, there are definitely higher stakes in the amount of depth they put into the troubles of mercantile that Kraft has to face head-on. Kraft uses language that people, who are not necessarily experts in economic lingo, might have some trouble wrapping their heads around. It is here where we finally see some critical progress towards a romance in Holo and Kraft\u2019s relationship. The only negative that came of this is how they executed it in a rather out-of-character moment that didn\u2019t feel in line with the tone of the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nYes I know, this review ends on a rather short note, but that is only because of the fact that I reviewed the first season in great detail. So it would be pointless to rehash similar arguments I have on the art and music because they have no change in quality whatsoever. In other words, they are all magnificent to experience whether you started on the 1st season or not. However, you obviously have to start with the 1st season to gain any sort of preconceived notion of what is going on. That is, unless, if you want to watch it for the glorious Holo cuteness, which I can\u2019t blame anyone who has that reason.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A\\n",

All the small \\n\r\nthings, the jokes, the spontaneous hugs, all that stuff make me angry deep inside, cause i feel so jealous about them. For me the best relationship of love have not be perfect, to be true with myself, it cant be, cause what make you love someone? Is not the imperfect things of a person that make you love her?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n All that make me rate this Anime with a 9. Not masterpiece, because the final make upset to be honest, just a little, I was curious about Horo past, and the anime finish off without answering me all the questions about her past, I cant forget the origin of the journey of them, was all because of her home, I know her city was destroyed, but I know too that she wanted to go anyway to her place.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Finally I think everyone should see this 2 seasons of Ookami to Koushinryou, is just too good, too memorable, too different to just avoid.\\n",

            "content": "Vulnerability is the essence of romance. It's the art of being uncalculated, the willingness to look foolish, the courage to say, 'This is me, and I'm interested in you enough to show you my flaws with the hope that you may embrace me for all that I am but, more important, all that I am not.'\r\nNope, not a Tennyson quote. This one by Ashton Kutcher, of all people. I never would have guessed, myself. \r\nWhat do we think of when we hear the word romance? A vision of a couple sitting in the sunset, fingers intertwined, lips together? A complex, irrevocable, inimitable bond formed betweentwo people over time? Perhaps something as goofy as even Mr. Krabs and his money (you can't tell me that's not true love). No matter your idea of the term- there are basic tenets of romance that everyone can agree upon- the building of a relationship between two people out of mutual respect and love for each other. \\n\\n\r\nAs my muse Mr Plinkett once said, \"I'm no expert on relationships, as most of mine have ended in several large trash bags\" but I'm going to do my best to analyze what it is about Spice and Wolf that makes it an exemplary romance anime, and what sets it apart from others in the genre. First, I must pose a question, though. Like the concept of romance as a nebulous term, everyone who's seen any romance based anime has expectations of them. \\n\\n\r\nI would pose this question: is the bar set so low in romance anime that even a modicum of realism in terms of how the relationship is formed and nurtured is perceived as a romantic masterpiece? Is our idea of what a romance in anime should be like so skewed that when something comes along with even a small amount of something believable that's not \"5 girls fall in love with a guy and he chooses none of them after solving their problems\", that we think it's the most romantic thing since pick-a-Jane Austen? \\n\\n\r\nI'm seeing Spice and Wolf through this lens. It stands with authority among the best romance anime I've seen, but I've seen heralded romance anime that are supposedly notable examples- but it's a shallow, childlike romance- like your first middle school relationship with that girl who makes you sign a contract of things you can and can't do, which may or may not include talking to, or even looking at other girls, and you have to text her after EVERY class and sit with her at lunch, and walk her to the breezeway to get picked up.\\n\r\nWait, is real life getting in the way again? Whoops.\\n\\n\r\nBut, like my silly example of a middle school romance- romance anime seemingly follow a checklist like my 7th grade girlfriend's contract - a list of things they need to contain to be a \"successful romance\" anime. Or, as most people know it- the formula for \"AUGH, MY FEELS\". \\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf, fortunately, takes a turn away from the formulaic, and trailblazes down a largely uncharted path of showing how a slowly nurtured relationship develops and evolves over time- no one is thrown into action immediately. (Fans of the falling on boobs, prepare to be disappointed. Lawrence doesn't have a seizure when he sees his lady friend naked (multiple times) nor does he act like he's being electrocuted when she touches him). They even remark about that in episode 11 of the 2nd half, where Holo says that \"you don't even tremble slightly when I lay against you anymore\". \\n\r\nNo, it starts off small, like real life. An awkward introduction turns into a friendship. A partnership emerges, and trust is built. A budding romance is born, but it's not without its tenuous and fragile moments. Real insecurities such as defining the relationship, jealousy, learning how to give your partner space, and knowing when and how to talk with them when they're pissed off, sad, drunk, or acting crazy, plus a myriad things that happen to real couples appear in the series- and aren't dismissed with laughing it off. No, the show treats its audience with some respect and maturity, trusting that they're able to watch people act like real people- not a cookie cutter feel good romance. There are moments where Holo and Lawrence are legitimately angry or put out with each other, and it very well could be the last time they see each other- and how they deal with that- forgiveness, rage, acceptance, rejection, all of these make an appearance- as it would with a real couple. \\n\\n\r\nNo one is smitten at first sight- no love is declared within the first half hour of our characters having met. No, their circumstance of being together develops entirely of their own volition, not out of any convenience by the writers as an excuse to shove in romance. It's a fact, that audiences love the tease, the threat, the promise, the unspoken between two romantic partners- and that when the moment finally happens- whether it's the achievement of couple status, the first kiss, marriage, or whatever the goal may be- there's a relief in the audience that their wishes (or perhaps to the contrary) have been fulfilled in the characters. The buildup of tension (sexual or otherwise), emotion, and sometimes frustration is all paid off at some point in romances. \\n\\n\r\nTake Star Wars Episode V for example. The budding romance of Han and Leia from A New Hope reaches a height of nearly tangible tension when Han is taken prisoner by the Empire and they finally confess their love for each other- despite having shared a first kiss and plenty of sexual tension in the preceding 3 hours of film between the two movies. It's a very real and raw moment, with Leia never knowing if she'll ever see the man that she's grown to love again, and there's not much she can do about it. Find me a moment like that in an anime not named Spice and Wolf, and we'll talk. \\n\\n\r\nTo its credit, the romance is largely between the lines. Outward displays of affection are great as visual aids- but in this case, show, not tell. It's in how Lawrence and Holo edge closer together through their experiences throughout the show, in their growth as partners, their verbal sparring and teasing, their mutual respect and trust, and in the contrast between how traumatic and peaceful/happy events shape their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nSo is the bar for romance just set really low, and that puts Spice and Wolf high up the list, or is it that it's just a really good romance? I'd say that because of the care and maturity with which the story is handled, that this goes above and beyond any other anime by showing a true love story between adults, and not a childish, shallow tale of middle school romance with a checklist, physical attraction, or convenience. Any one episode of Spice and Wolf has more actual romantic content in it than almost any other show I've ever seen. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnough about that sap, though. Excuse me, I just need to close off the spigot and dump the bucket of sap i just drained out, and get to the real pulp of the show now. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of how the story is presented and the artwork- the art is serviceable- but far from being Akira or anything. Having undergone a studio change between seasons and more than a year between the airdates is certainly not the best for a show, but the quality improves somewhat between where Imagin left off and Brain's Base picks up, without being jarring. What is jarring, however, is the pacing, particularly in the first season. It has a lot of weird jump cuts that will throw you off at least twice every other episode. They try to do the \"rosebud' thing  couple times, and it just doesn't work for the story they're trying to tell. There are also breaks where you can tell there was a commercial edited out (and this wasn't some bootleg, either) and the return shot is completely different, like you missed half a scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe music however, is excellent. The little madrigal insert tune works perfectly with the atmosphere, and there's a lot of Baroque and Renaissance style music- with heavy solo/quartet vocalists and frequent use of violin. \\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is set in the 1450s, a time that was honestly pretty crappy to live in. Life expectancy in the Renaissance era was approximately 35-40, and despite the advances to come in medicine (ayo Leonardo Da Vinci with the autopsy) life was short, brutal, and hard. Lawrence enjoys relative wealth as a merchant, but the show doesn't shy away from showing that life isn't always peachy with the threats of death and the consequences of being in debt or broke- but all that glitters is gold, and for a merchant of the times- that was your (short) life's work. With the church and the inquisition out to get you if they discover you sheltering a witch (read: Holo the Wise Wolf girl), vicious, greedy trading companies and guilds trying to rip you off, dangerous bands of thieves and wild animals threatening on the country roads between towns, and the chance of just going broke serve to provide a compelling period drama that's surprisingly accurate and representative. The treatment of women as near-property, slavery being a shockingly normal thing in addition to self imposed indentured servitude, the consequences of being broke, or worse, in debt, and the church being the ruling governmental body are also certainly signs of the times- and provide a realistic backdrop onto which the story is set. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is also known for its presentation of economics... and as far as I know, is probably the only anime that's tackled economics as a main theme for the plot. The story's drama revolves largely around tension and dramatic moments from Lawrence taking risks for huge payoffs involving contractual obligations, market manipulations, credit, money exchanging, and  some other Renaissance era innovations in trade and finance come into play, making Spice and Wolf, at times somewhat of an info-tainment show. As an economics major myself, I can verify that the premises in the show are generally valid, if fairly basic. Someone did their homework, anyway. \\n\\n\r\nAll told, Spice and Wolf is a unique show, blending a mature romance with an economics based theme to tell a period drama with convincing results. They sold me on it, anyway.",

            "content": "*This is a non-spoiler review of both seasons of Spice and Wolf\r\nWhen I first found out about Spice and Wolf I was skeptical. I had heard that the series revolved around monetary and economic principles, and wondered how entertaining a like that could be. I\u2019d also heard that there was a lot of dialog in this this series. I feared that I would be bored by discussions about economics that I\u2019m not particularly interested in. I\u2019m very glad to say that I was dead wrong about this series. Spice and Wolf managed to take topics I cared nothing about, and make them very entertaining andinteresting.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story stars two main characters, a traveling merchant named Kraft Lawrence, and a wolf goddess named Holo. The story is about their journey to find Holo\u2019s homeland, while trying to make some money along the way. As stated earlier, the story has a lot to do with economic and monetary principles, but the best part of the story is the interaction between Lawrence and Holo. The dialog between the two is funny and witty. Through their experiences and verbal exchanges you get to see the steady progression of their relationship. My main issue with the story is the ending, because there really isn\u2019t one. The last season concludes before they reach the end of their journey, and in order to learn the rest of the story you\u2019ll have to read the light novels. Which is disappointing considering how much I enjoyed the story, and since there most likely will never be a third season.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in the series is good. The backgrounds are really well done and, at times, it felt like I was looking at watercolor paintings. The scenes look fantastic, and really fit the atmosphere the show is trying to portray. The characters are also animated well. Spice and Wolf\u2019s animation feels like it has its own style. The way the backgrounds and characters come together fit really well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Spice and Wolf is fantastic. The sound track is varied and sets the mood for the scenes very well. The music can be bright and cheerful, but also can be really somber and melancholy. It also helps to immerse you in to the middle ages setting of the show. The music sounds like something that something that you might hear at a renaissance fair, which is a good thing. The openings and endings in this show are really well done, and fit the show both lyrically and sonically. The first ending was so catchy it was stuck in my head for days.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Spice and Wolf are what make the story, and the series, work so well. The interactions between the characters take up a majority of the show, and this is fine because that is the most interesting part. The dialog between the characters not only advances the plot, but it also serves as the story\u2019s source of humor. While Lawrence doesn\u2019t have the most interesting motivations or backstory, he is very likeable character. This is partly because he is good at what he does, which is being a merchant, and also partly because he is a very smart character. Holo, who is one of, if not, my favorite female anime characters compliments him really well. This is not only because she is a smart character, but also because she doesn\u2019t really fit any female anime stereotypes. While there maybe times where she falls into those stereotypes in the series, those are temporary and don\u2019t change how she acts as a character. Both of the main characters are well rounded and interesting to watch. The side and supporting characters in this series are also good. They are given a good amount of screen time, and their motivations and backgrounds are explained pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching Spice and Wolf. Even though the show has a lot of dialogue, I didn\u2019t get bored while I was watching this series. I found conversations between the characters, even the ones about economics, to be very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict & Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4.2/5\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 3.8/5\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4.4/5\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 4.1/5\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf isn\u2019t a typical anime. With its unique premise and characters Spice and Wolf is enjoyable from start to finish.",

            "content": "I just need to preface this review with the fact that I have an intense love in my heart for analytical, deep thinking and outside of the box \"anything\". I had such, such high hopes for this show. I mean, I poured through the reviews, and I was so freaking PUMPED. I was that kid who was obsessed with games on building, trading...empires...history... By the end of the 2nd season I was just F***** PISSED. The first season was sheer dent of will...this was a crucibal. \r\nI really had to sit back an question the tastes of people and their anime, and really could notwrap my head around all these stellar 9/10 reviews. There were so many glaring problems with this show, I just... can't. I do not mind slow. I can even suffer through boring. Monologues, sure why not? But this show really made me want to \"reclaim my time\". I cannot stand wishy-washy bi-polar a** characters and the femme fatale here just makes you want to punch a baby in the face. Yeah... I freaking said it. This show had so much hope and promise, but these sadistic a**hats (writers) have created something that was \"breathtaking\" and not in a good way... \\n\\n\r\nEven if this was written with the \"times\" in mind in regards to humor and how things were laid out, I found myself wanting to rip my hair out from the lack of effing cohesion! You picked up some neat trading tidbits, but even half of that ish wasn't believable... furs become exponentially more expensive because they smell like f****** apples, and it could be used as a \"tactic\"... give me a f****** break...She is supposed to be the wise wolf yet she acts like a petulant child 90% of the time with 0 emotional control... he has fallen in love with a maniacal and abusive tyrant with a jacked up sense of justice ... *mega eye roll*... I was not going to leave a review because I was so disgusted, but after a few weeks, I just could not let this crap stand without throwing some spaghetti at the wall and hoping it sticks.... \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason this show is not rated a 1 is that I totally respect the effort it took to tie this many threads of history together for educational purposes. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "To start things off, I loved the first season... Howevvveeerrrrrr.......\r\nSeason 2 Is nothing like the first.\r\nFirst off the story...\r\nHorrible, In the first season it was great, we see many many new towns and have a good few trades and exciting moments with a diverse cast of characters and actual thinking involved.\r\nIn the second season, we have one town, mainly one trade, a extremely smaller cast of characters and almost no progression besides mostly dribble, cut towards the end and they rush everything because they did not have the source material for another season. Making anyone who does another season either redo season 2, please godlet that be, or B ignore the last episode and continue from there or C, hope not, skip a lot of story from the novels....\\n\\n\r\nAnyways.... The story aside, it was still entertaining at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art was still amazing, although not enough background scenery was shown. The first season did way better. I honestly think the problems at hand are from the studio change. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the new company still did well to continue it. Here is where they really MESSED UP!!! The damn characters! How can you ruin their personality this way! I gave it a 9, but moved it to a 8 upon re-watching, honestly it deserves a 7, but I cannot bring myself to do it until a new season comes. Although that might not happen sadly... \\n\r\nThere is a new book though, so there is still hope!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nSo! Here is the problem, lawerence although dumb at love is way to dumb at it this season, before the banter and arguing was cute and mature and understandable. Now he acts all blushy and confused, that happened maybe twice in the first season and stood out like a sore thumb, if anything they should have made it happen once or not at all this season, instead its none stop. Holo what do you mean? Why say that! What are you talking about? Everytime she flirts! He also does not seem to be as quick witted before and complains more about money then the first season, like that is suppose to be funny or cute or something?\\n\\n\r\nAND THATS ANOTHER THING! She does nothing, I swear!!!!!!! Nothing!!! But flirt! And talk about drinking or eating, and she is less wise then before which was a bad choice for the character. She became like a tsundere. And she might have been a little bit of one in season 1. But in the first season she still had personality. She wouldn't push it or hang on him or act, literally,,,,, like a kid..... She is hundreds of years old. Sure she made mistakes, but she was in a simple village for 500 years. That can put a stop on wisdom. But in season 1 She learned fast and made less mistakes as they season went on. She grew by the end of it. In season 2, she learns nothing, neither does lawerence, they actually progress in love in a okward way and then regress in intelligence in the most awful way...\\n\\n\r\nWhen she would originally flirt she was mature, waiting for lawerence to act before she responded, never pushy, she expressed her feelings but she did not force it or even sob unless it was something extreme.\\n\r\nIT WAS FUN! They fed off each others energies and it felt like you could be there with them bantering back and forth! But now....\\n\\n\r\nNow thats been put out the window by the new studio, all the growth she did is gone and shes a bi-polar insane girl who doesn't know what to do with herself... If i watched season 2 first, I would of hated spice and wolf! It is nothing compared to the first & defiantly different. And although the first let me watch the second for the love of Holo.... Holo is no longer Holo in season 2 and i therefore cannot enjoy it the same way as I did the first. Not in the least likeliness... \\n\r\nI mean she could of got clingy, but like maybe wait for season 3 or 4 or give them a reason to make them clingy instead of just doing it because fuck it we can, hate when production changes hands, only so few do it right....\\n\\n\r\nSound!\\n\r\nMusic is way better, the pipe music when they bicker back in forth is quiter and you can here them speak when it happens lol. But the soundtrack is rather repeaty....\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nI enjoyed it, but alas, it could have been so much more. Still worth a watch for holo fans or romance fans or even economics, but its not as fun as the first season so be warned. The economic lessons are toned down, still informative but it lacks the same intrigue it once had, it could of been better and again, it really needed more traveling and trading like before.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL!\\n\r\nIt was ok... It was almost good. But that is actually sad, because the first season was great, it was borderline masterpeice. With a good second season it could of been one. \\n\r\nThe only things that held this season back was to much love. Holo going from mature to immature which makes no sense. Holo becoming a full tsundere instead of teasing like the first, she pushes and shoves now, which kills the mood.\\n\r\nThere was no travling, if they would of seen more then one town or made more then one or two trades, it could of been fun.\\n\\n\r\nThings that helped move it forward, the sound was better although limited, the art was better although limited as well with backgrounds and the enjoyment was still there. It just wasn't as great...\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict. Is to watch it if you like spice & wolf. If you find spice & wolf ok or good and not great or at least a fun ride. Then stop at season 1, because it was the best. If you haven't seen season 1. By all means. Watch it! If you cannot stand romance or dribble dribble, don't watch season 2, but still watch season 1 lol. \\n\r\nThanks for reading, and if only I had the money to resurrect the show and do it the right way I would...\\n\r\nI'm out, Later my dudes,, & Later My Loves. --- GodOfWolves...",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nThinking back to the different relationships that I've formed over the years, it's pretty easy to tell when I'm truly close to someone. Whether this be my younger brother, my best friend, or my greatest lover, there is a distinct connection that I share with them that is incredibly hard to emulate and even describe. Instead, people have to experience this feeling for himself or herself. It's not something that is gained by resting on one's laurels; like everything else, developing this relationship takes considerable time, effort, and a smidgen of luck. In Spice and Wolf 2, weget to see this special connection blossom, making it one of the best anime-viewing experiences in my short career.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf 2 more or less begins where Spice and Wolf 1 left off. Lawrence and Holo, continuing their journey, arrive at the next city in hopes of discovering information pertaining to Holo's origins.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season did two things quite well: depict the economic side to trading and establish the relationship between Lawrence and Holo. Here again, these ideas are well under way. In terms of economy, we get to see aspects of supply and demand and the troubles brought about by taxes and tariffs. On the lover side of things, our couple's relationship continues to move forward through their everyday interactions. But this time, the second season does something even more significant. And that is using both money and love to drive each side forward. As an analogy, think of it as a see-saw; when one side sees movement, so does the other. In other words, the economy isn't just there as a vessel for plot-points. Instead, its actually used to drive Lawrence's and Holo's relationship to even greater heights. This is also true for the opposite end; Lawrence and Holo use their care and love for one another to bring about success in the business deals they get into.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the better components of the series is the explanations behind all of the business transactions. This time, the same occurs, but there is even more attention to detail when it comes to the explanations behind everything. The show often used \"mini-flashbacks\" in conjunction with the relevant dialogue to better let the audience understand where these ideas were coming from. These flashbacks are also used outside of the deals; when Lawrence or Holo allude to previous conversations or dealings, it was nice to have those \"Oh, yea!\" moments so that I could more readily follow everyone's trains of thought. Overall, using this technique and even just better writing, the show did an even greater job of explaining everything that the anime had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that the show does quite masterfully is also quite difficult to do. This is in making the audience feel the emotions that the characters are experiencing. At certain moments during this second season, the characters go through varied states: panic, despair, happiness, sorrow. While it's arguably easy to just showcase these separate emotions, it's another beast entirely to be able to make someone feel the same way when he or she has no relation to that character's current predicament. As an example, when Lawrence is in the market attempting to sell his fool's gold, the story sets up the situation in such a fantastic way, that you begin to honestly feel how he does at every turn; panic when waiting for a certain someone, confusion at the continually rising prices, content when he realizes that what he's needed has been nearby all along. It's beautifully done throughout the season, and should be looked at as an example for such well-done execution.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf 1 was, analytically, a presentation of trust and everything that it entails. Trust plays a role in this season as well, but season two focuses on something else; hope. Going analytical once more, one of the show's purposes this time around is to demonstrate the idea that hope, while existential, is something that's not only wanted but something that's desperately needed. The season is split primarily into two arcs: the fool's gold arc and the fur arc. Both feature characters, Amarty and Eve respectively, who's ultimate saving grace is that hope will allow them to see their plans come to fruition. Even more important is in how hope ties to Lawrence and Holo. For Mr. Spice, it's the hope of opening that shop, the hope of striking it big wherever he goes. For Mrs. Wolf, it's the hope of finding her home, the hope that she will never be lonely again. Hope is interesting because it is there at almost all times but is one of the easiest things to be snatched away. And in this second season, they capture the essence of what hope is wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for Spice and Wolf Season Two is a considerable improvement from season one for three distinct reasons: crisper design, better environments, and \"camera\" direction.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the show, and comparing it to its counterpart, it becomes somewhat obvious how much cleaner a lot of the animation and art is. It doesn't feel \"old\" anymore, for starters. The characters themselves look more detailed, their animations are improved slightly (this is especially the case for Holo), and there is generally more \"action\" going on per scene. Once again, there is a lot of talking that goes on, but this potential stall in animation is alleviated by the camera work, which I will get to shortly.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching the second season, I also felt as if the show was better able to capture more distinct settings or environments. For the most part, season one typically felt more or less the same atmospheric-wise. This time, however, the show incorporates better mood creating: cool autumn sunsets, serene nights, and gloomy overcasts. It mostly helps to give the world more detail besides it being just day or night, so this addition was quite welcomed.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the camera work. I started noticing this more closely as it was happening. Spice and Wolf 2 does a great job of using the camera to its advantage. While it does do single-face shots, it also changes the formula up quite a bit. It uses low shots, panning shots, wide-shots, and more intricate ones such as far shots and \"one-on-one\" shots, where the camera rotates between characters who are facing off against one another. This seems like something rather arbitrary to bring up, but many shows don't take into account that the \"camera\" is a tool to be used for the anime's advantage in order to create better detail and atmosphere. Thankfully, season two is not one of them.\\n\\n\r\nFor argument's sake, besides these three new additions, everything else that was done well in season one was carried over. It still feels like an era where bartering is the go-to method, the town feels like a community, and Lawrence's and Holo's character designs feel right. These feelings were already established, but seeing it not tampered with is a sign of good artistic direction.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf Season Two introduces two rather significant side characters, Amarty and Eve. I'll talk briefly about them, but like last time, I will focus majorly on Lawrence, Holo, and the relationship they share.\\n\\n\r\nAmarty is a young man looking to prove himself in the world of merchants. Cunning, intelligent, and knightly, his actions are seemingly simple. But the implications he has behind what he does are far greater than what most people realize, and by the time they do, it's usually already too late. Amarty's presence in the story serves one major purpose: to let Holo understand how important Lawrence is to her.\\n\\n\r\nEve is a woman who is initially shrouded in mystery. \"Friendly,\" wise, and formidable, her past experiences shape her to be outwardly cold and inwardly hostile. It's difficult to get a read on her, not only because of the way she dresses but also in the way she talks and handles herself during conversations. Like Amarty, yet contrasting him as well, she serves one major purpose: to let Lawrence understand how important Holo is to him.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping these two purposes in mind, let's jump to our main duo. Lawrence is the man of the hour. Witty, determined, and as good-natured as ever, he loves to talk, investigate, and tease Holo on a daily basis. In season one, his characterization was about realizing that its not about profiting but about not losing. Season two narrows this focus even more; it's not about just losing, it's about losing Holo.\\n\\n\r\nHolo is, once again, the star of the show. More playful than ever before, relishing in teasing Lawrence not on a daily basis but on an hourly basis, she brings about good humor and incredibly romantic moments. At the same time, we also get to witness incredibly uncharacteristic sides to Holo that, like her aversion to loneliness, help to make her be even more human. Along the same lines as Lawrence, season one was about her being afraid of becoming alone. Once again, this focus narrows further into not just becoming alone but losing Lawrence along the way.\\n\\n\r\nTaking all of this into account -- Amarty's and Eve's purposes and Lawrence's and Holo's newfound passion -- what we discover is a beautiful and charming relationship that nearly fully blossoms between peddler and wolf. The circumstances they find themselves in form stunning amounts of emotion from both parties, but their ability as characters to respect, remember, and reflect upon what occurs between them allows them to come to their respective realizations. The beginning of their journey saw the creation of their relationship. The middle part here pushed it to the very brink between extremely close companion and lover for life. Such a development (not having it fully come to a head) works well here because such a climax honestly should take place during the climax of the series; namely the ending to their journey. As it stands, the second season is another fine example for when it comes to love and how to properly expand upon and further develop it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nIf I'm speaking from the heart, season two's OP is not as good as season one's OP, but that isn't really saying much considering how incredibly well-done the first one is. This time, the OP starts off extremely calming, giving off a false-sense of safety that contrasts nicely with the anime. By the half-way point, it picks up tempo, bringing about delicate singing that is pleasing to hear.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED, likewise, pales in comparison to season one's ED, but again that's not saying much. Once more, it's quite upbeat and follows Holo's theme of, \"play now, play always.\" I think besides being a cute little song, it actually serves its purpose rather well, namely that it further outlines why the two of them, Lawrence and Holo, will be together forever.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is in top-form once again, with the flute playing and the high-tension violin. Along with the more instrumental/old-time-y bar music, the sound pieces really help to captivate the audience and place us in the world it is trying to convey.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting wise, I will say that Holo's VA, Ami Koshimizu, grew on me. The acting performance itself is nothing downright spectacular, but I don't think I'll ever be able to hear a similar voice from her or anyone else again and not immediately think about the lovable wolf-goddess.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nProbably my favorite moment from the show is when Holo removes the \"spell\" placed on Lawrence, and everything that follows it for the next five minutes. It's heart-warming, comedic, and romantic all in one stroke. While these types of feelings only make up about half of the show, when they are there, it's quite the joyful experience.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the first arc concluded, I actually got pretty mad at myself for doubting certain things that were going on. It's pretty funny to me how these 2-D characters that will really never exist in corporeal form are able to elicit immense feelings just by acting in particular ways, either good or bad.\\n\\n\r\nAs with season one, I often found myself re-watching certain scenes to make sure I caught the little details, such as Holo's nuanced mannerisms or how certain deals would be handled. This time, I actually re-watched an entire episode because I had that much fun going through it. Beyond that, I was also looking up plot synopses and comparing certain sub-groups because I was having way too much fun indulging in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Spice and Wolf Season Two is the second installment to a trilogy. It's funny, dramatic, romantic, and memorable due to it's interesting story-telling and more importantly its unique characters. Like all anime, it isn't without its flaws. But it's as close to a masterpiece as you are going to get.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, money and love serve one another, while hope shines through\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, visuals, setting, and camera work are on point\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, supporting cast develop the mains, Lawrence and Holo are as fantastic as ever\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, good OP and ED, good soundtrack, nice VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, one of the best couples in anime\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 10/10",

            "content": "After an epic final in the first season which left me stunned. I was expecting the second season to slow down and turn more romantic. Found out i am right, but the mercantile stuff is still going strong and there is even a merchant duel on par with death note quality. Backstabbing and market values etc. It all returns in its great glory!\r\nAt start, the first episode gave me an impression of \"Hmm... it's turned soft.\" But at the same time it was nice too see the cute side of our heroes. But it doesn't take long before they leave the town in episode 2and move out. That is when i got the magic feeling as i had when watching season 1! The gorgeous nature scenery returns as does the merchant drama. But this season also focuses on the relationship between our heroes, there are more frequent blushes and silly episodes. Towards the end it was all going out of hand and i litteraly begged for a good ending!\\n\\n\r\nThe story in this one is a continuation, there is no episodic feel to this series. Each episode flows nicely and the plot twists never stop to surprise you. Although it's not as epic as the first season, it's a good one which manages to keep the same magic feeling you had during season 1.\\n\\n\r\nArt is even more polished in this so this can only be better than season 1. Nature scenery is gorgeous and characters are drawn well. They have managed to keep the unique personalities and showing us new sides of them which we didn't get in season 1.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects is improved. Furious door bashing that made me turn my head around to see if it was my door. The music in this one borrows many of the same songs from first season, but some new ones are there which is nice for a change. The opening is slow paced like the first one but more beautifull than epic. Ending song is also good.\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters. They have the same voice actors which is a big relief. Unlike other animes where the cast and studio is changed which ruins everything. The characters turn to their soft sides more often now and even the wolf girl seems weak sometimes. Characters are deep and lovable. And the male protagonist is still an idiot sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this almost as much as season 1. I felt like i was watching the same anime but in season 2 there is many changes, but those are changes done in a way that it felt just like season 1. Something you RARELY find in anime sequels, which tend to turn worse than the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters returns to themselves and seing a cute relationship unfold is always nice. The merchant drama, marked values, mercantile stuff also returns, although it's relationship that is the big focus this time. All in all this was an excellent sequel which didn't dissapoint! The first episode was a letdown as i watched this in a marathon. I was still pumped and excited from the ending of season 1. But don't let the first episode fool you, season 2 turns great already on the next episode!",

Even though the Light Novels ended and even fully translated by now, they should animate all of Light Novels,not for the profit from it or to advertise Light Novels, but to leave an example of pinnacle for all japanese animation made from Light Novels and the pinnacle for Light Novels alike. It would not be far fetched to say that this is the pinnacle of them all, byoverall story, by overall character development,  by overall execution of the story and by execution of light novels into anime while story staying intact. P.S. : 2 seasons only consist 2 books,1st to 5th 4th being excluded. And whole book series have 17 books, leaving are much more books to animate... This is what a \"Masterpiece\" is.",

            "content": "This is the first review I have ever written on anime, however, that is only testament to the fact that I have never been so moved by one. Spice and Wolf's greatness stems from the fact that they do not pander to the lowest common denominator. Spice and Wolf does not intend to be an extremely popular anime, what it intends to, and succeeds in doing is being the very best anime for a niche audience. \r\nStory: 9.5/10\r\nThe creators obviously spent countless hours studying and researching the economics, politics, culture, religion, and ethics of the time, not to mention the setting and society. Their workshines through brilliantly throughout the story. Even those who consider themselves knowledgeable in history will be delighted to learn some things themselves throughout the story. The sole reason the score is not 10 is because it is overshadowed by the character development.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art style throughout the series is brilliantly subtle, to say the least. Slight blushes by characters, single frame hints, and even body movement, the attention to detail and subtlety in this is simply incredible. They certainly did not cut corners here, they went above and beyond. The art subtly tells the viewer entire stories within of itself. The artists respect the viewer and consider them perceptive and smart enough to pick up on the slightest movements or actions of the characters, which manages to add to the story and fit in perfectly, as, in the merchant world, the characters must be perceptive of those that they are working with.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nPeriod-appropriate sound was a big gamble, but it paid off incredibly, the BGM nearly always fits in with the scene, and contributes to the story. It both scares you and consoles you throughout the series and it is very rarely done so masterfully. The reason this is not 11/10 is because a select few scenes, I felt the music was not appropriate for the situation, however, I very might well be mistaken.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 11/10\\n\r\nThis is simply the best character development I've ever seen, and it will be disappointing return to other anime. This is the real substance of the anime, and if you ignored the entire story, the character development alone would still be brilliant. The romance of this story does not pander to the common tropes, it does not develop overnight, it grows slowly and realistically. The hard work in the Sound and Art departments pays off as it manages to not be overshadowed by the impeccable character development, it even contributes to the development. The development has highs and lows that will leave you always wanting more and never disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is not for everyone, because it was not made for everyone. It is a rather mature anime and younger audiences may not get nearly as much enjoyment out of it. However, if you have the right interests, this anime will forever hold the spot as your favorite, as it does mine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nCarefully constructed entertaining story, Art style that tells a story all on its own, Sound that can drop and lift emotions as if feathers, and, perhaps, the best character development to date all contribute to make this anime a masterpiece.",

And while I was watching it I was waiting for something to blow me away, but even after two seasons nothing did. If I had to describe this show in one word, it would be boring. I can't just chalk the pace of this show up as a deliberate one like I would with an anime like \"Monster\". Instead I have to say that it was uneventful and forgettable, and that was my biggest problem with it. Problems aside for a moment, this animedidn't have any areas it really succeeded in in the first place. Aside from the concept which is unique and its pretty much unprecedented focus on economics, at least in anime, all aspects of this show are average or worse, except for the voice acting (I can't speak for the Dubbed version however).\\n\r\n     The soundtrack fit well, but many of the tracks were overused, and nothing stands out.  The animation and art style were standard. It didn't do anything wrong in that area, its just that even the scenes with action were not visually impressive. Most of this show is conversation and just the animation of the characters' mouths moving, nothing to write home about. The story is not all that captivating, especially the lazy, or if you are optimistic, \"open\" ending with a pitiful payoff. The interactions between characters are somewhat interesting, but there is not much development for the main two characters who are still not fleshed out enough for an anime where the characters are the main focus. I won't lie, it was a chore to sit through this show, no offense to the people that enjoyed it. It felt like a waste of time watching this, and I cannot help but feel that I've missed something.\\n\\n\\n",

The story is good, stick together and does not have too obvious hole. The 2 main characters is lovely, though sometimes have questionable action/reaction since their thinking arent shown in the anime. \r\nAnd that, that is exactly what I enjoy so so much about this anime. The way Lawrence and Holo just became closerand closer to each other is so natural that it makes me feel detach from most other animes. At first I was also surprised that somehow they show affection to each other so natural, unlike tons of other animes where the main character usually spend half of the animes thinking (out loud) that should they or should they not hold each other hands. But then I am used to it, and I absolutely love it. And how their love develop through various challenger is so beautiful that the part where Holo and Lawrence argue about Amarty almost makes me cry. That part is also one of those part that makes me really feel for Holo's loneliness. For some reason, i have watched dozens of animes but only 2 of them makes me contemplate for hours because of the humane part in it, and Wolf and Spice is one (the other is From the New World).\\n\\n\r\nIn short, if we consider the anime for most aspects it will be at the upper average, but the humane part of Spice and Wolf makes me give it an absolute 10 for enjoyment and 10 overall.",

            "content": "Everything that was wonderful about the first season continues on during this second part of the Spice and Wolf saga.\r\nThe plot continues where the first season left off.  Both Lawrence, our beloved travelling merchant, and Holo, his goddess (literally) travelling companion, continue their adventure to the north in hopes of returning Holo to her native homeland.  During their travels, the duo run across old friends and new enemies, making this mecca no easy feat.  And of course, Lawerence, being a skilled barterer and sly businessman, attempts to make a few extra coins to ensure they both travel in style and luxury.\r\nThere area number of reasons why I enjoyed the second season just as much as the first and reasons why this season signifiantly fell short of my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself was enjoyably simple.  However, Lawerence and Holo spent most of the season hunckered down in one of two cities, trying to line Lawerence's pockets with gold and silver, then on breaking ground on a well beaten path.  The adventure part of the first season, one of the most exilerating aspects of the show in my opinion because of its uncertainty, takes a back seat to second-class economic lessons spewed from the lips of our Wolf's protector and his collegues.\\n\\n\r\nNow this was not necessarily all bad.  Exileration comes in many forms, and the sheer excitment of making a fortune or losing the same can be just as heart pounding, if not more so, then escaping the clutches of evil.  Spice and Wolf certainly takes its time in explaining exactly what deals are being made, the risks involved for both parties, the the possible outcomes, be it possitive or negitive, should the deal be struck.  And then they explain it again.  And then once more.  This may come as tedious to some viewers, but I do enjoy the concepts of ancient dealings, and how they closely resemble todays trading as well.\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, Lawerence is not only a skilled merchant, but as suave and charming as they come.  His background knowledge of trade items obviously comes in handy, as do his trustworthy contacts and friends.  He also preforms due dilegence before stricking a deal with an unknown client; a new, yet very necessary trait found in merchants.  His character is that of a classy businessman, based off todays standards, and he is well rounded in his morals.  Because of his trade, he is sometimes required to trust scoundrels, barter those dearest to him, and take the shady path in order to make a profit.\\n\\n\r\nHolo the Wise Wolf is Lawerence's beautiful and enticing travelling companion.  She is the love interest of the series, either beknown of unbeknownst to those who are willing to lay their hearts at her feet.  Her beauty is unparelled, her tounge is sharp, and her taste buds seek only that of meat and mead.  She is truly a goddess, not only as a term of flattery, but as for the fact that she has existed for centuries.  She has amassed a great knowledge of many things worldly, yet is a complete virgin to others.  She lives a care-free existance, with no stress in her life, and enjoys all the small things the world has to offer.  She is a perfect counter-balance to Lawerence.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation thoughout the series sored on high standard wings yet again and I was often dumbfounded by the absolute brilliance of the architecture skewed throughout this season.  The authentic look of churches, markets, and townhouses literally were jaw-dropping.  The lightening was perfect, and with flawlessly timed background music, set the mood, so the viewer could feel like a fly on the wall.\\n\\n\r\nBut the most enjoyable part of this season was in the interaction between characters.  It should go without saying that the most passionate and profound conversation invovled Lawerence and Holo, but all the dealings with all the minor characters were just as enjoyable.  Each one felt very thought out.  Words were not wasted and it felt like I was sitting in on two intellegent people conversing about meaningful topics.  This was a nice change from the usual one liners, mindless quips, and filler speechs throwen in to extend many other anime series of today.\\n\\n\r\nThe slow pace, lack of adventure, and dialogue marathons, took some time to get used to.  And the ending of the series, without spoiling anything, was very lack-luster, and empty feeling.  But once you get into the series, once you embrace it for what it is (a unique and interesting story, a lesson in trade, and a \"finding yourself\" series), you will be hard pressed to not enjoy it.  Without question, worth a watch.",

            "content": "Perhaps I'm ranting about this, and with the score I'm giving I be expecting a lot of disagreements here. To be honest, I was sorely disappointed in Spice and Wolf (S&W), not because it was plain bad, but I cannot see anything worth remembering at all.\r\nCharacter-wise Both Lawrence and Holo showed little to no development at all throughout the series, and watching the anime made me question what the hell is going on more than how interested in the anime I am. In the case of Lawrence, it seemed like he's lost in how he views his relationship with Holo and   his job.Especially the 'Prioritise Profits' part, I cannot fathom why the anime needs to bring itself to mention that time and time again, and then act the opposite. Lawrence's relationship to Holo is even more confusing. In the start of Season 2, the Amarty-Pyrite Arc was the most captivating arc yet, and it ended so, so badly. It was when the tension was the greatest, and yet it was resolved so damn easily. The most disgusting part is that Lawrence seems to have learnt nothing from the ordeal. Slow pacing with the already awkward ending in Season 1 made this a turn-off.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation of Holo herself was a mess as well. I cannot fathom a centuries old demigod to be, of all things, a tsundere. Despite being the Wise Wolf, Holo has not shown her wisdom, using her instincts at best and failing to grasp the situation she is in all the time. In the last episode. One simple sentence from a person she barely knows can affect her that much? What the actual F*ck? If you want to showcase Holo's behaviour to be a result for her centuries in suffering solitude, at least make some effort to emphasise on it. Similar to Lawrence, its seems that Holo has learnt nothing from all the ordeals she faced, and her ever-changing mood made me question whether she is bipolar.\\n\\n\r\nThe music itself was extremely refreshing at first, with the Openings and Endings to be rather good. Then comes the OST... Is it me or several episodes start with the same music? the lack of variety itself was very obvious as well, and it was as though I was listening to a broken radio.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I acknowledge I might be 6 years late for this anime. But considering the fact this anime is so highly rated confuses me. To me, S&W is a mess, that tries to add the intelligent elements of trade and romance with a questionable storyline and extremely confusing and bipolar characters. It was as though the anime tried very very hard to seem intelligent, but backfired extremely hard. Then again, I might be wrong and have interpreted the storyline line wrongly, but for me to question almost every single segment of this anime? There should be a lot of questionable segments about Spice and Wolf we can agree on.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Don't watch*\\n\\n\r\n1. Still, watch Season 1\\n\r\n2. Move on to light novel\\n\r\n3. Pray Season 3 (If it ever comes out) can redeem this mess",

            "content": "*A surprisingly successful sequel with emphasis on the romance between a man and a (cute) wolf.*\r\nAs foreshadowed by the prequel OVA, Spice and Wolf II focus heavily on the romance aspect between our protagonists. By and large, this second adaptation has been regarded as equally successful as its predecessor (if not more successful). In terms of the light novels adaptation, it has been widely accepted for its accurate following of the \u201cactual\u201d story, unlike most anime adaptation. While previous knowledge of the series is not absolutely required to enjoy the show, it is highly recommended for viewers to watch the first season as well asthe OVA, which act as the prelude, before watching Spice and Wolf II. For those who wish to try this series with no previous background, here is a little summary of what to expect. Wordy. To be precise, the show is filled with dialogues from start to end, from episode one to episode twelve. \\n\\n\r\nOne common question people tend to have for this series often relates to the balance between romance and (merchant) trading. While there are still a decent dose of merchant-like business talks that may confuse viewers from time to time, the spotlight for this sequel seems to land on the character developments over anything else. Hence Horo and Lawrence fans will most likely enjoy the show much more than those who seek for nothing but story content (ie. business trades in medieval times). \\n\\n\r\nThe world of Spice and Wolf can often serve as a history textbook (that focuses on the medieval era in Europe). This is once again proven in the second season as viewers are exposed to the corrupted nature of the slave markets and the power of churches at the time. Although the inspiration of merchant trade has been greatly diminished, the believable surroundings of the medieval setting make this anime still interesting to watch even for those who are not too into the romance aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe character department, without doubt, is the selling point this season. Lawrence, for once, no longer seems like an undefeatable merchant. While viewers may remember him as a successful businessman, particularly when it comes to negotiation during trade, in season one. Many of us will be surprised to see that Lawrence, ultimately, is still a human being and thus he must also have his illogical and \u201cstupid\u201d moments especially when it comes to something he has no experience with. Something called love. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation this season is by Brains Base (as oppose to IMAGIN which was responsible for the previous season). There are some very minor changes in the character facial expressions and sometimes their looks at various angles, but overall the quality is similar to the first season and there is no reason for one to be disappointed with it. Re-using a quote from my review on the OVA, \u201cFor the most part, one can safely say Brains Base did a great job in taking over the series\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyu are the same as before with Jun Fukuyama being Kraft Lawrence and the lovely Ami Koshimizu acting as the equally lovable Horo (can\u2019t get enough of that thick \u201cHoro-only\u201d accent). Other notable great seiyu that took part in this season include Romi Paku, and Saeko Chiba. In terms of music, the OP and ED are quite enjoyable and the BGM generally suit the particular scene in the question reasonably well. On the whole, this anime is still unique just like its predecessor. However, the big twist this season is the more intense character relationship developments rather than the merchant trading. In hindsight, there seems to be a certain lack of cleverness in plot development. But then again, the various Horo x Lawrence moments are enough to make up for that.",

            "content": "For those reading this review w/o finishing the first season will be spoiled so be forewarned\r\nThis anime continues where the last one left off, Horo and Lawrence slowly make their way to Horo's hometown. Along the way they happen upon various opportunities for profit and gain useful knowledge. All that while trying to keep a strong relationship between a human and a goddess. Some also might wonder if this can stand up against the hype from the fame of the last series. I can easily tell you it does, but with one Achilles heel....\r\nIts definitely not story or the cast that brings this show downfrom a perfect 10, its the bad decision to use a completely different production companies to fill in place of the original greats Imagin (animation) and Studio Bihou (Background art). But at the very least keep Studio Bihou as this is what made Spicy Wolf 1 extra special. The animation in S&W2 would appear perfectly the same as before except you will notice many mistakes upon viewing, such as awkward angles, skinny limbs turn to fat limbs, back ground characters, and other minor/major details. Albeit not as exact as the original, it still provides that spice and wolf feel. \\n\\n\r\nIf the story of Horo and Lawerence are the heart of the show, the background art would have to be the soul of the show. Amazing amounts of detail were made in S&W1. If you rewatch it, you WILL see things that you haven't seen before. Sadly,  the 'soul' of the show appears to be bland, lifeless, and uninhabited. So many angry feelings bubble up when i saw how many simple angles and lines are in one show. Towns don't look like towns. They more resemble a horrible copy paste job that does not fit any point of view angle at all. Small intricate details like wheat in wheat fields or cobblestones  appear to be nonexistent. It indeed does hinder the experience considerably. But I am confident you will oversee all the faults once you realize that this story is after all, Spice and Wolf 2. \\n\\n\r\nLawrence is still very 'crafty' (heh) and Horo is still foxy as ever. Now that their feelings are more established, we will see more character progression this time around and this alone trumps anything a bad artist can draw up. Most of their emotions are still worn on their sleeves, but now they start to rely on each other implicitly. It's just a wonderful thing to see Lawrence and Horo interact with each other. Like a young boyfriend and girlfriend scheming to do things their way no matter how crazy it may seem. You will also notice how much these two characters have grown from before. For better or worse it does make the chemistry between them much more intense. The acting between the two is something of pure win as you will laugh, cry, and everything in between. Such a play on emotions is also a clever way of dissuading the viewer of thinking one way or another when a choice or problem arises for the fearless duo. \\n\\n\r\nThis will definitely lead the viewer to varying degrees of thinking about the outcome. Its a formula that definitely works great with a mercantile anime. These situations that they face definitely appear to be more difficult than before and it is apparent through the first story arc. It might be because the stronger relationship between the two or just the trading is more intense. Either way, it will leave you wanting for more. Not in a shounen anime sort of way but more like a good book you just can't put down. \\n\\n\r\nEverything pertaining to the light novel appears as anime gold and everything pertaining to animation production (sans the seiyuu cast) seems to have slipped considerably. Do not let the downgrade fool you though, this is till a very solid iteration to Spice and Wolf.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note:  you will love Training With Horo (S&W2 special #2)",

            "content": "Continuing a beloved series and making it greater or just as great can be a challenging task to take. This is not much of a problem for anime that are step-by-step adaptations of any type of original source medium. Spice and Wolf, if you don\u2019t know, is one series that won me over from the previous season. Likewise, I was hoping that this 2nd season would have the same positive impact that the 1st season did for me. While it is not better than the first season in many aspects, it definitely possessed the same fascinating qualities that the 1st season had, with a fewimprovements to the original.\\n\\n\r\nIt is impossible to review a the sequel to a show you\u2019ve already reviewed before without writing similar thoughts on certain aspects. For the sake of being thoughtful, it is important to note these aspects from the previous title and determine whether they improved overtime or not. These include how the character progression has matured over time and if the plot arcs are just as entertaining or thought-provoking as before.\\n\\n\r\nTo start out, our lovable duo, Kraft Lawrence and Holo, continue their journey in order to besting the world of mercantile and business ventures in order to survive the political landscape. In the beginning, we see these two start out their relationship as people who don\u2019t immediately have one that is romantic. It was one that still had a sense of distrust, but they still wanted to have a friendship in order to work out each others\u2019 problems they are having. Now with the 2nd season, with the amount of development both Kraft and Holo had together, they flourished into blossoming partners that have a great connection to one another. It all works because the pacing of their growth is logically slow and based on realistic expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThat connection seems inseparable in hindsight, due in part with the brilliant dialogue both Holo and Kraft share between one another. Then that connection soon fades when, in one plot arc, they go there their separate ways because of a fierce argument amidst each other. What makes this significant to bring up is the fact that the relationship is powerfully written that when you see these two break off from that connection, you can feel nothing but despair watching it fold through. Emotional investment from observing characters in a show growing into fleshed-out characters is important to achieve when you want the audience to care for them in the first place. Spice and Wolf did it brilliantly in the first season, and yet they managed to mold it into something riveting that pulls our emotions without the need of manipulating them.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the plot is concerned, there is no sense of improvement or decline in quality in terms of writing. In season 2, there are definitely higher stakes in the amount of depth they put into the troubles of mercantile that Kraft has to face head-on. Kraft uses language that people, who are not necessarily experts in economic lingo, might have some trouble wrapping their heads around. It is here where we finally see some critical progress towards a romance in Holo and Kraft\u2019s relationship. The only negative that came of this is how they executed it in a rather out-of-character moment that didn\u2019t feel in line with the tone of the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nYes I know, this review ends on a rather short note, but that is only because of the fact that I reviewed the first season in great detail. So it would be pointless to rehash similar arguments I have on the art and music because they have no change in quality whatsoever. In other words, they are all magnificent to experience whether you started on the 1st season or not. However, you obviously have to start with the 1st season to gain any sort of preconceived notion of what is going on. That is, unless, if you want to watch it for the glorious Holo cuteness, which I can\u2019t blame anyone who has that reason.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A\\n",

All the small \\n\r\nthings, the jokes, the spontaneous hugs, all that stuff make me angry deep inside, cause i feel so jealous about them. For me the best relationship of love have not be perfect, to be true with myself, it cant be, cause what make you love someone? Is not the imperfect things of a person that make you love her?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n All that make me rate this Anime with a 9. Not masterpiece, because the final make upset to be honest, just a little, I was curious about Horo past, and the anime finish off without answering me all the questions about her past, I cant forget the origin of the journey of them, was all because of her home, I know her city was destroyed, but I know too that she wanted to go anyway to her place.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Finally I think everyone should see this 2 seasons of Ookami to Koushinryou, is just too good, too memorable, too different to just avoid.\\n",

            "content": "Vulnerability is the essence of romance. It's the art of being uncalculated, the willingness to look foolish, the courage to say, 'This is me, and I'm interested in you enough to show you my flaws with the hope that you may embrace me for all that I am but, more important, all that I am not.'\r\nNope, not a Tennyson quote. This one by Ashton Kutcher, of all people. I never would have guessed, myself. \r\nWhat do we think of when we hear the word romance? A vision of a couple sitting in the sunset, fingers intertwined, lips together? A complex, irrevocable, inimitable bond formed betweentwo people over time? Perhaps something as goofy as even Mr. Krabs and his money (you can't tell me that's not true love). No matter your idea of the term- there are basic tenets of romance that everyone can agree upon- the building of a relationship between two people out of mutual respect and love for each other. \\n\\n\r\nAs my muse Mr Plinkett once said, \"I'm no expert on relationships, as most of mine have ended in several large trash bags\" but I'm going to do my best to analyze what it is about Spice and Wolf that makes it an exemplary romance anime, and what sets it apart from others in the genre. First, I must pose a question, though. Like the concept of romance as a nebulous term, everyone who's seen any romance based anime has expectations of them. \\n\\n\r\nI would pose this question: is the bar set so low in romance anime that even a modicum of realism in terms of how the relationship is formed and nurtured is perceived as a romantic masterpiece? Is our idea of what a romance in anime should be like so skewed that when something comes along with even a small amount of something believable that's not \"5 girls fall in love with a guy and he chooses none of them after solving their problems\", that we think it's the most romantic thing since pick-a-Jane Austen? \\n\\n\r\nI'm seeing Spice and Wolf through this lens. It stands with authority among the best romance anime I've seen, but I've seen heralded romance anime that are supposedly notable examples- but it's a shallow, childlike romance- like your first middle school relationship with that girl who makes you sign a contract of things you can and can't do, which may or may not include talking to, or even looking at other girls, and you have to text her after EVERY class and sit with her at lunch, and walk her to the breezeway to get picked up.\\n\r\nWait, is real life getting in the way again? Whoops.\\n\\n\r\nBut, like my silly example of a middle school romance- romance anime seemingly follow a checklist like my 7th grade girlfriend's contract - a list of things they need to contain to be a \"successful romance\" anime. Or, as most people know it- the formula for \"AUGH, MY FEELS\". \\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf, fortunately, takes a turn away from the formulaic, and trailblazes down a largely uncharted path of showing how a slowly nurtured relationship develops and evolves over time- no one is thrown into action immediately. (Fans of the falling on boobs, prepare to be disappointed. Lawrence doesn't have a seizure when he sees his lady friend naked (multiple times) nor does he act like he's being electrocuted when she touches him). They even remark about that in episode 11 of the 2nd half, where Holo says that \"you don't even tremble slightly when I lay against you anymore\". \\n\r\nNo, it starts off small, like real life. An awkward introduction turns into a friendship. A partnership emerges, and trust is built. A budding romance is born, but it's not without its tenuous and fragile moments. Real insecurities such as defining the relationship, jealousy, learning how to give your partner space, and knowing when and how to talk with them when they're pissed off, sad, drunk, or acting crazy, plus a myriad things that happen to real couples appear in the series- and aren't dismissed with laughing it off. No, the show treats its audience with some respect and maturity, trusting that they're able to watch people act like real people- not a cookie cutter feel good romance. There are moments where Holo and Lawrence are legitimately angry or put out with each other, and it very well could be the last time they see each other- and how they deal with that- forgiveness, rage, acceptance, rejection, all of these make an appearance- as it would with a real couple. \\n\\n\r\nNo one is smitten at first sight- no love is declared within the first half hour of our characters having met. No, their circumstance of being together develops entirely of their own volition, not out of any convenience by the writers as an excuse to shove in romance. It's a fact, that audiences love the tease, the threat, the promise, the unspoken between two romantic partners- and that when the moment finally happens- whether it's the achievement of couple status, the first kiss, marriage, or whatever the goal may be- there's a relief in the audience that their wishes (or perhaps to the contrary) have been fulfilled in the characters. The buildup of tension (sexual or otherwise), emotion, and sometimes frustration is all paid off at some point in romances. \\n\\n\r\nTake Star Wars Episode V for example. The budding romance of Han and Leia from A New Hope reaches a height of nearly tangible tension when Han is taken prisoner by the Empire and they finally confess their love for each other- despite having shared a first kiss and plenty of sexual tension in the preceding 3 hours of film between the two movies. It's a very real and raw moment, with Leia never knowing if she'll ever see the man that she's grown to love again, and there's not much she can do about it. Find me a moment like that in an anime not named Spice and Wolf, and we'll talk. \\n\\n\r\nTo its credit, the romance is largely between the lines. Outward displays of affection are great as visual aids- but in this case, show, not tell. It's in how Lawrence and Holo edge closer together through their experiences throughout the show, in their growth as partners, their verbal sparring and teasing, their mutual respect and trust, and in the contrast between how traumatic and peaceful/happy events shape their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nSo is the bar for romance just set really low, and that puts Spice and Wolf high up the list, or is it that it's just a really good romance? I'd say that because of the care and maturity with which the story is handled, that this goes above and beyond any other anime by showing a true love story between adults, and not a childish, shallow tale of middle school romance with a checklist, physical attraction, or convenience. Any one episode of Spice and Wolf has more actual romantic content in it than almost any other show I've ever seen. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnough about that sap, though. Excuse me, I just need to close off the spigot and dump the bucket of sap i just drained out, and get to the real pulp of the show now. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of how the story is presented and the artwork- the art is serviceable- but far from being Akira or anything. Having undergone a studio change between seasons and more than a year between the airdates is certainly not the best for a show, but the quality improves somewhat between where Imagin left off and Brain's Base picks up, without being jarring. What is jarring, however, is the pacing, particularly in the first season. It has a lot of weird jump cuts that will throw you off at least twice every other episode. They try to do the \"rosebud' thing  couple times, and it just doesn't work for the story they're trying to tell. There are also breaks where you can tell there was a commercial edited out (and this wasn't some bootleg, either) and the return shot is completely different, like you missed half a scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe music however, is excellent. The little madrigal insert tune works perfectly with the atmosphere, and there's a lot of Baroque and Renaissance style music- with heavy solo/quartet vocalists and frequent use of violin. \\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is set in the 1450s, a time that was honestly pretty crappy to live in. Life expectancy in the Renaissance era was approximately 35-40, and despite the advances to come in medicine (ayo Leonardo Da Vinci with the autopsy) life was short, brutal, and hard. Lawrence enjoys relative wealth as a merchant, but the show doesn't shy away from showing that life isn't always peachy with the threats of death and the consequences of being in debt or broke- but all that glitters is gold, and for a merchant of the times- that was your (short) life's work. With the church and the inquisition out to get you if they discover you sheltering a witch (read: Holo the Wise Wolf girl), vicious, greedy trading companies and guilds trying to rip you off, dangerous bands of thieves and wild animals threatening on the country roads between towns, and the chance of just going broke serve to provide a compelling period drama that's surprisingly accurate and representative. The treatment of women as near-property, slavery being a shockingly normal thing in addition to self imposed indentured servitude, the consequences of being broke, or worse, in debt, and the church being the ruling governmental body are also certainly signs of the times- and provide a realistic backdrop onto which the story is set. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is also known for its presentation of economics... and as far as I know, is probably the only anime that's tackled economics as a main theme for the plot. The story's drama revolves largely around tension and dramatic moments from Lawrence taking risks for huge payoffs involving contractual obligations, market manipulations, credit, money exchanging, and  some other Renaissance era innovations in trade and finance come into play, making Spice and Wolf, at times somewhat of an info-tainment show. As an economics major myself, I can verify that the premises in the show are generally valid, if fairly basic. Someone did their homework, anyway. \\n\\n\r\nAll told, Spice and Wolf is a unique show, blending a mature romance with an economics based theme to tell a period drama with convincing results. They sold me on it, anyway.",

            "content": "*This is a non-spoiler review of both seasons of Spice and Wolf\r\nWhen I first found out about Spice and Wolf I was skeptical. I had heard that the series revolved around monetary and economic principles, and wondered how entertaining a like that could be. I\u2019d also heard that there was a lot of dialog in this this series. I feared that I would be bored by discussions about economics that I\u2019m not particularly interested in. I\u2019m very glad to say that I was dead wrong about this series. Spice and Wolf managed to take topics I cared nothing about, and make them very entertaining andinteresting.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story stars two main characters, a traveling merchant named Kraft Lawrence, and a wolf goddess named Holo. The story is about their journey to find Holo\u2019s homeland, while trying to make some money along the way. As stated earlier, the story has a lot to do with economic and monetary principles, but the best part of the story is the interaction between Lawrence and Holo. The dialog between the two is funny and witty. Through their experiences and verbal exchanges you get to see the steady progression of their relationship. My main issue with the story is the ending, because there really isn\u2019t one. The last season concludes before they reach the end of their journey, and in order to learn the rest of the story you\u2019ll have to read the light novels. Which is disappointing considering how much I enjoyed the story, and since there most likely will never be a third season.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in the series is good. The backgrounds are really well done and, at times, it felt like I was looking at watercolor paintings. The scenes look fantastic, and really fit the atmosphere the show is trying to portray. The characters are also animated well. Spice and Wolf\u2019s animation feels like it has its own style. The way the backgrounds and characters come together fit really well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Spice and Wolf is fantastic. The sound track is varied and sets the mood for the scenes very well. The music can be bright and cheerful, but also can be really somber and melancholy. It also helps to immerse you in to the middle ages setting of the show. The music sounds like something that something that you might hear at a renaissance fair, which is a good thing. The openings and endings in this show are really well done, and fit the show both lyrically and sonically. The first ending was so catchy it was stuck in my head for days.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Spice and Wolf are what make the story, and the series, work so well. The interactions between the characters take up a majority of the show, and this is fine because that is the most interesting part. The dialog between the characters not only advances the plot, but it also serves as the story\u2019s source of humor. While Lawrence doesn\u2019t have the most interesting motivations or backstory, he is very likeable character. This is partly because he is good at what he does, which is being a merchant, and also partly because he is a very smart character. Holo, who is one of, if not, my favorite female anime characters compliments him really well. This is not only because she is a smart character, but also because she doesn\u2019t really fit any female anime stereotypes. While there maybe times where she falls into those stereotypes in the series, those are temporary and don\u2019t change how she acts as a character. Both of the main characters are well rounded and interesting to watch. The side and supporting characters in this series are also good. They are given a good amount of screen time, and their motivations and backgrounds are explained pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching Spice and Wolf. Even though the show has a lot of dialogue, I didn\u2019t get bored while I was watching this series. I found conversations between the characters, even the ones about economics, to be very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict & Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4.2/5\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 3.8/5\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4.4/5\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 4.1/5\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf isn\u2019t a typical anime. With its unique premise and characters Spice and Wolf is enjoyable from start to finish.",

I had such, such high hopes for this show. I mean, I poured through the reviews, and I was so freaking PUMPED. I was that kid who was obsessed with games on building, trading...empires...history... By the end of the 2nd season I was just F***** PISSED. The first season was sheer dent of will...this was a crucibal. \r\nI really had to sit back an question the tastes of people and their anime, and really could notwrap my head around all these stellar 9/10 reviews. There were so many glaring problems with this show, I just... can't. I do not mind slow. I can even suffer through boring. Monologues, sure why not? But this show really made me want to \"reclaim my time\". I cannot stand wishy-washy bi-polar a** characters and the femme fatale here just makes you want to punch a baby in the face. Yeah... I freaking said it. This show had so much hope and promise, but these sadistic a**hats (writers) have created something that was \"breathtaking\" and not in a good way... \\n\\n\r\nEven if this was written with the \"times\" in mind in regards to humor and how things were laid out, I found myself wanting to rip my hair out from the lack of effing cohesion! You picked up some neat trading tidbits, but even half of that ish wasn't believable... furs become exponentially more expensive because they smell like f****** apples, and it could be used as a \"tactic\"... give me a f****** break...She is supposed to be the wise wolf yet she acts like a petulant child 90% of the time with 0 emotional control... he has fallen in love with a maniacal and abusive tyrant with a jacked up sense of justice ... *mega eye roll*... I was not going to leave a review because I was so disgusted, but after a few weeks, I just could not let this crap stand without throwing some spaghetti at the wall and hoping it sticks.... \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason this show is not rated a 1 is that I totally respect the effort it took to tie this many threads of history together for educational purposes. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "To start things off, I loved the first season... Howevvveeerrrrrr.......\r\nSeason 2 Is nothing like the first.\r\nFirst off the story...\r\nHorrible, In the first season it was great, we see many many new towns and have a good few trades and exciting moments with a diverse cast of characters and actual thinking involved.\r\nIn the second season, we have one town, mainly one trade, a extremely smaller cast of characters and almost no progression besides mostly dribble, cut towards the end and they rush everything because they did not have the source material for another season. Making anyone who does another season either redo season 2, please godlet that be, or B ignore the last episode and continue from there or C, hope not, skip a lot of story from the novels....\\n\\n\r\nAnyways.... The story aside, it was still entertaining at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art was still amazing, although not enough background scenery was shown. The first season did way better. I honestly think the problems at hand are from the studio change. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the new company still did well to continue it. Here is where they really MESSED UP!!! The damn characters! How can you ruin their personality this way! I gave it a 9, but moved it to a 8 upon re-watching, honestly it deserves a 7, but I cannot bring myself to do it until a new season comes. Although that might not happen sadly... \\n\r\nThere is a new book though, so there is still hope!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nSo! Here is the problem, lawerence although dumb at love is way to dumb at it this season, before the banter and arguing was cute and mature and understandable. Now he acts all blushy and confused, that happened maybe twice in the first season and stood out like a sore thumb, if anything they should have made it happen once or not at all this season, instead its none stop. Holo what do you mean? Why say that! What are you talking about? Everytime she flirts! He also does not seem to be as quick witted before and complains more about money then the first season, like that is suppose to be funny or cute or something?\\n\\n\r\nAND THATS ANOTHER THING! She does nothing, I swear!!!!!!! Nothing!!! But flirt! And talk about drinking or eating, and she is less wise then before which was a bad choice for the character. She became like a tsundere. And she might have been a little bit of one in season 1. But in the first season she still had personality. She wouldn't push it or hang on him or act, literally,,,,, like a kid..... She is hundreds of years old. Sure she made mistakes, but she was in a simple village for 500 years. That can put a stop on wisdom. But in season 1 She learned fast and made less mistakes as they season went on. She grew by the end of it. In season 2, she learns nothing, neither does lawerence, they actually progress in love in a okward way and then regress in intelligence in the most awful way...\\n\\n\r\nWhen she would originally flirt she was mature, waiting for lawerence to act before she responded, never pushy, she expressed her feelings but she did not force it or even sob unless it was something extreme.\\n\r\nIT WAS FUN! They fed off each others energies and it felt like you could be there with them bantering back and forth! But now....\\n\\n\r\nNow thats been put out the window by the new studio, all the growth she did is gone and shes a bi-polar insane girl who doesn't know what to do with herself... If i watched season 2 first, I would of hated spice and wolf! It is nothing compared to the first & defiantly different. And although the first let me watch the second for the love of Holo.... Holo is no longer Holo in season 2 and i therefore cannot enjoy it the same way as I did the first. Not in the least likeliness... \\n\r\nI mean she could of got clingy, but like maybe wait for season 3 or 4 or give them a reason to make them clingy instead of just doing it because fuck it we can, hate when production changes hands, only so few do it right....\\n\\n\r\nSound!\\n\r\nMusic is way better, the pipe music when they bicker back in forth is quiter and you can here them speak when it happens lol. But the soundtrack is rather repeaty....\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nI enjoyed it, but alas, it could have been so much more. Still worth a watch for holo fans or romance fans or even economics, but its not as fun as the first season so be warned. The economic lessons are toned down, still informative but it lacks the same intrigue it once had, it could of been better and again, it really needed more traveling and trading like before.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL!\\n\r\nIt was ok... It was almost good. But that is actually sad, because the first season was great, it was borderline masterpeice. With a good second season it could of been one. \\n\r\nThe only things that held this season back was to much love. Holo going from mature to immature which makes no sense. Holo becoming a full tsundere instead of teasing like the first, she pushes and shoves now, which kills the mood.\\n\r\nThere was no travling, if they would of seen more then one town or made more then one or two trades, it could of been fun.\\n\\n\r\nThings that helped move it forward, the sound was better although limited, the art was better although limited as well with backgrounds and the enjoyment was still there. It just wasn't as great...\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict. Is to watch it if you like spice & wolf. If you find spice & wolf ok or good and not great or at least a fun ride. Then stop at season 1, because it was the best. If you haven't seen season 1. By all means. Watch it! If you cannot stand romance or dribble dribble, don't watch season 2, but still watch season 1 lol. \\n\r\nThanks for reading, and if only I had the money to resurrect the show and do it the right way I would...\\n\r\nI'm out, Later my dudes,, & Later My Loves. --- GodOfWolves...",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nThinking back to the different relationships that I've formed over the years, it's pretty easy to tell when I'm truly close to someone. Whether this be my younger brother, my best friend, or my greatest lover, there is a distinct connection that I share with them that is incredibly hard to emulate and even describe. Instead, people have to experience this feeling for himself or herself. It's not something that is gained by resting on one's laurels; like everything else, developing this relationship takes considerable time, effort, and a smidgen of luck. In Spice and Wolf 2, weget to see this special connection blossom, making it one of the best anime-viewing experiences in my short career.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf 2 more or less begins where Spice and Wolf 1 left off. Lawrence and Holo, continuing their journey, arrive at the next city in hopes of discovering information pertaining to Holo's origins.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season did two things quite well: depict the economic side to trading and establish the relationship between Lawrence and Holo. Here again, these ideas are well under way. In terms of economy, we get to see aspects of supply and demand and the troubles brought about by taxes and tariffs. On the lover side of things, our couple's relationship continues to move forward through their everyday interactions. But this time, the second season does something even more significant. And that is using both money and love to drive each side forward. As an analogy, think of it as a see-saw; when one side sees movement, so does the other. In other words, the economy isn't just there as a vessel for plot-points. Instead, its actually used to drive Lawrence's and Holo's relationship to even greater heights. This is also true for the opposite end; Lawrence and Holo use their care and love for one another to bring about success in the business deals they get into.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the better components of the series is the explanations behind all of the business transactions. This time, the same occurs, but there is even more attention to detail when it comes to the explanations behind everything. The show often used \"mini-flashbacks\" in conjunction with the relevant dialogue to better let the audience understand where these ideas were coming from. These flashbacks are also used outside of the deals; when Lawrence or Holo allude to previous conversations or dealings, it was nice to have those \"Oh, yea!\" moments so that I could more readily follow everyone's trains of thought. Overall, using this technique and even just better writing, the show did an even greater job of explaining everything that the anime had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that the show does quite masterfully is also quite difficult to do. This is in making the audience feel the emotions that the characters are experiencing. At certain moments during this second season, the characters go through varied states: panic, despair, happiness, sorrow. While it's arguably easy to just showcase these separate emotions, it's another beast entirely to be able to make someone feel the same way when he or she has no relation to that character's current predicament. As an example, when Lawrence is in the market attempting to sell his fool's gold, the story sets up the situation in such a fantastic way, that you begin to honestly feel how he does at every turn; panic when waiting for a certain someone, confusion at the continually rising prices, content when he realizes that what he's needed has been nearby all along. It's beautifully done throughout the season, and should be looked at as an example for such well-done execution.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf 1 was, analytically, a presentation of trust and everything that it entails. Trust plays a role in this season as well, but season two focuses on something else; hope. Going analytical once more, one of the show's purposes this time around is to demonstrate the idea that hope, while existential, is something that's not only wanted but something that's desperately needed. The season is split primarily into two arcs: the fool's gold arc and the fur arc. Both feature characters, Amarty and Eve respectively, who's ultimate saving grace is that hope will allow them to see their plans come to fruition. Even more important is in how hope ties to Lawrence and Holo. For Mr. Spice, it's the hope of opening that shop, the hope of striking it big wherever he goes. For Mrs. Wolf, it's the hope of finding her home, the hope that she will never be lonely again. Hope is interesting because it is there at almost all times but is one of the easiest things to be snatched away. And in this second season, they capture the essence of what hope is wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for Spice and Wolf Season Two is a considerable improvement from season one for three distinct reasons: crisper design, better environments, and \"camera\" direction.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the show, and comparing it to its counterpart, it becomes somewhat obvious how much cleaner a lot of the animation and art is. It doesn't feel \"old\" anymore, for starters. The characters themselves look more detailed, their animations are improved slightly (this is especially the case for Holo), and there is generally more \"action\" going on per scene. Once again, there is a lot of talking that goes on, but this potential stall in animation is alleviated by the camera work, which I will get to shortly.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching the second season, I also felt as if the show was better able to capture more distinct settings or environments. For the most part, season one typically felt more or less the same atmospheric-wise. This time, however, the show incorporates better mood creating: cool autumn sunsets, serene nights, and gloomy overcasts. It mostly helps to give the world more detail besides it being just day or night, so this addition was quite welcomed.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the camera work. I started noticing this more closely as it was happening. Spice and Wolf 2 does a great job of using the camera to its advantage. While it does do single-face shots, it also changes the formula up quite a bit. It uses low shots, panning shots, wide-shots, and more intricate ones such as far shots and \"one-on-one\" shots, where the camera rotates between characters who are facing off against one another. This seems like something rather arbitrary to bring up, but many shows don't take into account that the \"camera\" is a tool to be used for the anime's advantage in order to create better detail and atmosphere. Thankfully, season two is not one of them.\\n\\n\r\nFor argument's sake, besides these three new additions, everything else that was done well in season one was carried over. It still feels like an era where bartering is the go-to method, the town feels like a community, and Lawrence's and Holo's character designs feel right. These feelings were already established, but seeing it not tampered with is a sign of good artistic direction.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf Season Two introduces two rather significant side characters, Amarty and Eve. I'll talk briefly about them, but like last time, I will focus majorly on Lawrence, Holo, and the relationship they share.\\n\\n\r\nAmarty is a young man looking to prove himself in the world of merchants. Cunning, intelligent, and knightly, his actions are seemingly simple. But the implications he has behind what he does are far greater than what most people realize, and by the time they do, it's usually already too late. Amarty's presence in the story serves one major purpose: to let Holo understand how important Lawrence is to her.\\n\\n\r\nEve is a woman who is initially shrouded in mystery. \"Friendly,\" wise, and formidable, her past experiences shape her to be outwardly cold and inwardly hostile. It's difficult to get a read on her, not only because of the way she dresses but also in the way she talks and handles herself during conversations. Like Amarty, yet contrasting him as well, she serves one major purpose: to let Lawrence understand how important Holo is to him.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping these two purposes in mind, let's jump to our main duo. Lawrence is the man of the hour. Witty, determined, and as good-natured as ever, he loves to talk, investigate, and tease Holo on a daily basis. In season one, his characterization was about realizing that its not about profiting but about not losing. Season two narrows this focus even more; it's not about just losing, it's about losing Holo.\\n\\n\r\nHolo is, once again, the star of the show. More playful than ever before, relishing in teasing Lawrence not on a daily basis but on an hourly basis, she brings about good humor and incredibly romantic moments. At the same time, we also get to witness incredibly uncharacteristic sides to Holo that, like her aversion to loneliness, help to make her be even more human. Along the same lines as Lawrence, season one was about her being afraid of becoming alone. Once again, this focus narrows further into not just becoming alone but losing Lawrence along the way.\\n\\n\r\nTaking all of this into account -- Amarty's and Eve's purposes and Lawrence's and Holo's newfound passion -- what we discover is a beautiful and charming relationship that nearly fully blossoms between peddler and wolf. The circumstances they find themselves in form stunning amounts of emotion from both parties, but their ability as characters to respect, remember, and reflect upon what occurs between them allows them to come to their respective realizations. The beginning of their journey saw the creation of their relationship. The middle part here pushed it to the very brink between extremely close companion and lover for life. Such a development (not having it fully come to a head) works well here because such a climax honestly should take place during the climax of the series; namely the ending to their journey. As it stands, the second season is another fine example for when it comes to love and how to properly expand upon and further develop it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nIf I'm speaking from the heart, season two's OP is not as good as season one's OP, but that isn't really saying much considering how incredibly well-done the first one is. This time, the OP starts off extremely calming, giving off a false-sense of safety that contrasts nicely with the anime. By the half-way point, it picks up tempo, bringing about delicate singing that is pleasing to hear.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED, likewise, pales in comparison to season one's ED, but again that's not saying much. Once more, it's quite upbeat and follows Holo's theme of, \"play now, play always.\" I think besides being a cute little song, it actually serves its purpose rather well, namely that it further outlines why the two of them, Lawrence and Holo, will be together forever.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is in top-form once again, with the flute playing and the high-tension violin. Along with the more instrumental/old-time-y bar music, the sound pieces really help to captivate the audience and place us in the world it is trying to convey.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting wise, I will say that Holo's VA, Ami Koshimizu, grew on me. The acting performance itself is nothing downright spectacular, but I don't think I'll ever be able to hear a similar voice from her or anyone else again and not immediately think about the lovable wolf-goddess.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nProbably my favorite moment from the show is when Holo removes the \"spell\" placed on Lawrence, and everything that follows it for the next five minutes. It's heart-warming, comedic, and romantic all in one stroke. While these types of feelings only make up about half of the show, when they are there, it's quite the joyful experience.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the first arc concluded, I actually got pretty mad at myself for doubting certain things that were going on. It's pretty funny to me how these 2-D characters that will really never exist in corporeal form are able to elicit immense feelings just by acting in particular ways, either good or bad.\\n\\n\r\nAs with season one, I often found myself re-watching certain scenes to make sure I caught the little details, such as Holo's nuanced mannerisms or how certain deals would be handled. This time, I actually re-watched an entire episode because I had that much fun going through it. Beyond that, I was also looking up plot synopses and comparing certain sub-groups because I was having way too much fun indulging in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Spice and Wolf Season Two is the second installment to a trilogy. It's funny, dramatic, romantic, and memorable due to it's interesting story-telling and more importantly its unique characters. Like all anime, it isn't without its flaws. But it's as close to a masterpiece as you are going to get.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, money and love serve one another, while hope shines through\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, visuals, setting, and camera work are on point\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, supporting cast develop the mains, Lawrence and Holo are as fantastic as ever\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, good OP and ED, good soundtrack, nice VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, one of the best couples in anime\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 10/10",

            "content": "After an epic final in the first season which left me stunned. I was expecting the second season to slow down and turn more romantic. Found out i am right, but the mercantile stuff is still going strong and there is even a merchant duel on par with death note quality. Backstabbing and market values etc. It all returns in its great glory!\r\nAt start, the first episode gave me an impression of \"Hmm... it's turned soft.\" But at the same time it was nice too see the cute side of our heroes. But it doesn't take long before they leave the town in episode 2and move out. That is when i got the magic feeling as i had when watching season 1! The gorgeous nature scenery returns as does the merchant drama. But this season also focuses on the relationship between our heroes, there are more frequent blushes and silly episodes. Towards the end it was all going out of hand and i litteraly begged for a good ending!\\n\\n\r\nThe story in this one is a continuation, there is no episodic feel to this series. Each episode flows nicely and the plot twists never stop to surprise you. Although it's not as epic as the first season, it's a good one which manages to keep the same magic feeling you had during season 1.\\n\\n\r\nArt is even more polished in this so this can only be better than season 1. Nature scenery is gorgeous and characters are drawn well. They have managed to keep the unique personalities and showing us new sides of them which we didn't get in season 1.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects is improved. Furious door bashing that made me turn my head around to see if it was my door. The music in this one borrows many of the same songs from first season, but some new ones are there which is nice for a change. The opening is slow paced like the first one but more beautifull than epic. Ending song is also good.\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters. They have the same voice actors which is a big relief. Unlike other animes where the cast and studio is changed which ruins everything. The characters turn to their soft sides more often now and even the wolf girl seems weak sometimes. Characters are deep and lovable. And the male protagonist is still an idiot sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this almost as much as season 1. I felt like i was watching the same anime but in season 2 there is many changes, but those are changes done in a way that it felt just like season 1. Something you RARELY find in anime sequels, which tend to turn worse than the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters returns to themselves and seing a cute relationship unfold is always nice. The merchant drama, marked values, mercantile stuff also returns, although it's relationship that is the big focus this time. All in all this was an excellent sequel which didn't dissapoint! The first episode was a letdown as i watched this in a marathon. I was still pumped and excited from the ending of season 1. But don't let the first episode fool you, season 2 turns great already on the next episode!",

            "content": "This is the first review I have ever written on anime, however, that is only testament to the fact that I have never been so moved by one. Spice and Wolf's greatness stems from the fact that they do not pander to the lowest common denominator. Spice and Wolf does not intend to be an extremely popular anime, what it intends to, and succeeds in doing is being the very best anime for a niche audience. \r\nStory: 9.5/10\r\nThe creators obviously spent countless hours studying and researching the economics, politics, culture, religion, and ethics of the time, not to mention the setting and society. Their workshines through brilliantly throughout the story. Even those who consider themselves knowledgeable in history will be delighted to learn some things themselves throughout the story. The sole reason the score is not 10 is because it is overshadowed by the character development.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art style throughout the series is brilliantly subtle, to say the least. Slight blushes by characters, single frame hints, and even body movement, the attention to detail and subtlety in this is simply incredible. They certainly did not cut corners here, they went above and beyond. The art subtly tells the viewer entire stories within of itself. The artists respect the viewer and consider them perceptive and smart enough to pick up on the slightest movements or actions of the characters, which manages to add to the story and fit in perfectly, as, in the merchant world, the characters must be perceptive of those that they are working with.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nPeriod-appropriate sound was a big gamble, but it paid off incredibly, the BGM nearly always fits in with the scene, and contributes to the story. It both scares you and consoles you throughout the series and it is very rarely done so masterfully. The reason this is not 11/10 is because a select few scenes, I felt the music was not appropriate for the situation, however, I very might well be mistaken.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 11/10\\n\r\nThis is simply the best character development I've ever seen, and it will be disappointing return to other anime. This is the real substance of the anime, and if you ignored the entire story, the character development alone would still be brilliant. The romance of this story does not pander to the common tropes, it does not develop overnight, it grows slowly and realistically. The hard work in the Sound and Art departments pays off as it manages to not be overshadowed by the impeccable character development, it even contributes to the development. The development has highs and lows that will leave you always wanting more and never disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is not for everyone, because it was not made for everyone. It is a rather mature anime and younger audiences may not get nearly as much enjoyment out of it. However, if you have the right interests, this anime will forever hold the spot as your favorite, as it does mine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nCarefully constructed entertaining story, Art style that tells a story all on its own, Sound that can drop and lift emotions as if feathers, and, perhaps, the best character development to date all contribute to make this anime a masterpiece.",

            "content": "I had very high expectations for this anime since I had heard nothing but praise for it. And while I was watching it I was waiting for something to blow me away, but even after two seasons nothing did. If I had to describe this show in one word, it would be boring. I can't just chalk the pace of this show up as a deliberate one like I would with an anime like \"Monster\". Instead I have to say that it was uneventful and forgettable, and that was my biggest problem with it. Problems aside for a moment, this animedidn't have any areas it really succeeded in in the first place. Aside from the concept which is unique and its pretty much unprecedented focus on economics, at least in anime, all aspects of this show are average or worse, except for the voice acting (I can't speak for the Dubbed version however).\\n\r\n     The soundtrack fit well, but many of the tracks were overused, and nothing stands out.  The animation and art style were standard. It didn't do anything wrong in that area, its just that even the scenes with action were not visually impressive. Most of this show is conversation and just the animation of the characters' mouths moving, nothing to write home about. The story is not all that captivating, especially the lazy, or if you are optimistic, \"open\" ending with a pitiful payoff. The interactions between characters are somewhat interesting, but there is not much development for the main two characters who are still not fleshed out enough for an anime where the characters are the main focus. I won't lie, it was a chore to sit through this show, no offense to the people that enjoyed it. It felt like a waste of time watching this, and I cannot help but feel that I've missed something.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This like some other reviews, are for both seasons, though since I like season 2 more I will put my review here. \r\nAfter watching a lot of fan service stuffs, I finally be able to touch an anime about romance that actually (or almost actually) make romance close to real life. The story is good, stick together and does not have too obvious hole. The 2 main characters is lovely, though sometimes have questionable action/reaction since their thinking arent shown in the anime. \r\nAnd that, that is exactly what I enjoy so so much about this anime. The way Lawrence and Holo just became closerand closer to each other is so natural that it makes me feel detach from most other animes. At first I was also surprised that somehow they show affection to each other so natural, unlike tons of other animes where the main character usually spend half of the animes thinking (out loud) that should they or should they not hold each other hands. But then I am used to it, and I absolutely love it. And how their love develop through various challenger is so beautiful that the part where Holo and Lawrence argue about Amarty almost makes me cry. That part is also one of those part that makes me really feel for Holo's loneliness. For some reason, i have watched dozens of animes but only 2 of them makes me contemplate for hours because of the humane part in it, and Wolf and Spice is one (the other is From the New World).\\n\\n\r\nIn short, if we consider the anime for most aspects it will be at the upper average, but the humane part of Spice and Wolf makes me give it an absolute 10 for enjoyment and 10 overall.",

            "content": "Everything that was wonderful about the first season continues on during this second part of the Spice and Wolf saga.\r\nThe plot continues where the first season left off.  Both Lawrence, our beloved travelling merchant, and Holo, his goddess (literally) travelling companion, continue their adventure to the north in hopes of returning Holo to her native homeland.  During their travels, the duo run across old friends and new enemies, making this mecca no easy feat.  And of course, Lawerence, being a skilled barterer and sly businessman, attempts to make a few extra coins to ensure they both travel in style and luxury.\r\nThere area number of reasons why I enjoyed the second season just as much as the first and reasons why this season signifiantly fell short of my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself was enjoyably simple.  However, Lawerence and Holo spent most of the season hunckered down in one of two cities, trying to line Lawerence's pockets with gold and silver, then on breaking ground on a well beaten path.  The adventure part of the first season, one of the most exilerating aspects of the show in my opinion because of its uncertainty, takes a back seat to second-class economic lessons spewed from the lips of our Wolf's protector and his collegues.\\n\\n\r\nNow this was not necessarily all bad.  Exileration comes in many forms, and the sheer excitment of making a fortune or losing the same can be just as heart pounding, if not more so, then escaping the clutches of evil.  Spice and Wolf certainly takes its time in explaining exactly what deals are being made, the risks involved for both parties, the the possible outcomes, be it possitive or negitive, should the deal be struck.  And then they explain it again.  And then once more.  This may come as tedious to some viewers, but I do enjoy the concepts of ancient dealings, and how they closely resemble todays trading as well.\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, Lawerence is not only a skilled merchant, but as suave and charming as they come.  His background knowledge of trade items obviously comes in handy, as do his trustworthy contacts and friends.  He also preforms due dilegence before stricking a deal with an unknown client; a new, yet very necessary trait found in merchants.  His character is that of a classy businessman, based off todays standards, and he is well rounded in his morals.  Because of his trade, he is sometimes required to trust scoundrels, barter those dearest to him, and take the shady path in order to make a profit.\\n\\n\r\nHolo the Wise Wolf is Lawerence's beautiful and enticing travelling companion.  She is the love interest of the series, either beknown of unbeknownst to those who are willing to lay their hearts at her feet.  Her beauty is unparelled, her tounge is sharp, and her taste buds seek only that of meat and mead.  She is truly a goddess, not only as a term of flattery, but as for the fact that she has existed for centuries.  She has amassed a great knowledge of many things worldly, yet is a complete virgin to others.  She lives a care-free existance, with no stress in her life, and enjoys all the small things the world has to offer.  She is a perfect counter-balance to Lawerence.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation thoughout the series sored on high standard wings yet again and I was often dumbfounded by the absolute brilliance of the architecture skewed throughout this season.  The authentic look of churches, markets, and townhouses literally were jaw-dropping.  The lightening was perfect, and with flawlessly timed background music, set the mood, so the viewer could feel like a fly on the wall.\\n\\n\r\nBut the most enjoyable part of this season was in the interaction between characters.  It should go without saying that the most passionate and profound conversation invovled Lawerence and Holo, but all the dealings with all the minor characters were just as enjoyable.  Each one felt very thought out.  Words were not wasted and it felt like I was sitting in on two intellegent people conversing about meaningful topics.  This was a nice change from the usual one liners, mindless quips, and filler speechs throwen in to extend many other anime series of today.\\n\\n\r\nThe slow pace, lack of adventure, and dialogue marathons, took some time to get used to.  And the ending of the series, without spoiling anything, was very lack-luster, and empty feeling.  But once you get into the series, once you embrace it for what it is (a unique and interesting story, a lesson in trade, and a \"finding yourself\" series), you will be hard pressed to not enjoy it.  Without question, worth a watch.",

            "content": "What I mostly love about this anime is the setting it is put in. Middleages, Austria (kinda Austria, a kingdom based on Austria back in that day). Even though it sounds quite generic, you will be surprised how nicely is the whole setting executed. I was satisfied with the middleagy setting more than in any other anime out there. All the people, the taverns, festivals, markets, roads. Everything was made with a thought of middleages, and it felt like middleages all the way through.\r\nI could say that this story is about love. To be specific about a love that can't exists, not because of personalproblems. Just because it can't, there's no such way for a human to live and love a god, and a god can't love a mortal. Sooner or later the god will be left alone, with nothing but himself.\\n\r\nBut yeah if I said its a story about love only, I would be very wrong. It is also about a tradesman. A very smart one, trying to live in this world by buying and selling goods. Which is nicely done too, considering that every detail of the process of trading is explained. All the schemes they plan, and all the things\\n\r\n they would do to make more money.\\n\r\nThis is a story of exceptional life and love.\\n\\n\r\nVIBE:\\n\r\nAll right so as I mentioned before, this one is great. You can feel all the middleagey people and culture. I love all the scenes in taverns or at festivals, when they dance, drink and sing. You feel the warmth and freedom of those people. If you're a person that likes middleagey stuff, you will enjoy this sky high. It's a perfectly executed vibe, which will just suck you as you go through the cities, roads, woods and ports.\\n\\n\r\nART STYLE:\\n\r\nPersonally I like it. Buildings and cities are pretty, the landscape shows how this world is open. The forest and mountains will make you hold your breath.\\n\r\nEveryone loves Horo, the main character, the tailed one. Her model is beatutiful and Im not surprised people love her. Overall the artstyle is quite nice.\\n\r\nBut sometimes you can see halfassed animations or drawings, and it's a pity, this anime would have been almost perfect if not for this.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/VOICEACTING:\\n\r\nWell they had to compose music that would be cooperative with the theme. So yeah you can hear a lot of instruments that poeple of the age would use. And it's pretty good. It fits the whole thing, and basically is nicely done. \\n\r\nBUT I do reckon that openings are masterpieces, in the terms of music and animation the put up for both of them (we've got two seasons that's why). Both of them are in japanese, sang by a woman. I listen to them on a daily basis, can't get enough.\\n\\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\\n\r\nI just love the story line it is one of my dearest, when I think about it I get goose bumps.\\n\r\nMaybe you can't really put yourself in the situation of protagonists, but when you try to do it, or just think about it, it gets you. You get, you just know how sad it is and how tragic, the whole story (even though you will laugh, and smile a lot) is. \\n\r\nA love that can't exist and you can do nothing about it. The problem of mortality and immortality. Which is better?\\n\r\nWhen you look at them, you'll see the suffering, the blockades they want to put up, to not hurt each other or themselves. \\n\r\nIt's a sad story packed in a nice setting with jokes around. You have to read into it. And when you understand it, you will be blown away.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nI reckon that in the romance department, it's one of the best animes. It shows the true meaning of \"I love that person, but I want her to live a better life\".\\n\r\nBut on the other side you get a great adventure, of a tradesman and his companion, trying to live a good life. Which is amazing, with all the detail presented.\\n\r\nIt's a great expierince for a person that can read thorugh the lines, and loves middleages. Just like me, I was blown away.\\n\\n\r\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/ysqhSELOJXg\\n",

But still keeps some of the main issues of the first season.\r\nWhen i finished the 1st season i had two major complaints.\r\n1. How the story talks way to much about the economy and the coin value with also tons of talk about how to make more money. \r\n2. Unneeded evil schemes that fill forced and made me keep delaying watching the next episode. \r\nAll of these together were annoying cause instead of us spending time with the two MC's spending time together and building a better relationship. We aregetting talks about how to make money in this world that doesn't even exist .\\n\\n\r\nWhy the first complaint i had is mostly gone from the second season. The 2nd complaint still remains but to a lesser extent\\n\\n\r\nMost of the story is actually focused on the two of their relationships witch is just a better experience to watch than previously. \\n\\n\r\nBut the biggest problem with the 2nd season is how much of an idiot the male MC is. He is constantly taking unneeded big risk that always fails and ex machina manages to save the day. The only reason why these big unneeded disasters happen or tragedy befalls the two MC's is cause the Male MC is at fault.\\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of mind boggling how they have set the character up. \\n\\n\r\nBut the rest of the story is still fun to watch and like i said it's an improvement over the 1st season by a good margin.",

            "content": "*Some minor spoilers. Proceed at your own risk.*\r\n*Have not read the manga or light novels, nor am I aware of what goes on in them. I will likely not be reading them.*\r\n*This review assumes that you have yet to watch the first season!*\r\nIf you've seen any of the other media associated with this anime, you probably think you know what it's about. Cute wolf girls, lots of fan service, medieval action, etc. It is with no small amount of surprise that I can report that this show is not at all what it appears to be on the surface. I believe that I'd go sofar as to call it truly unique--at least, I've never encountered another anime (or really, television show period) that's comparable. Yes, it draws you in with the furry manic pixie dream girl element, but two episodes in it reveals its true intentions: Spice & Wolf is not about mindless, hyperactive cuteness and adventure. At the risk of sounding off-putting, it's equal parts Renaissance-era Wall Street and Linklateresque talky romance. Let's approach these two halves one at a time.\\n\\n\r\nAnime fans are used to action. Even the rom-com and every-day life drama anime equivalents typically have action sequences. Consider the mindlessly cute and mostly harmless Fruits Basket--sure, the kung-fu is mostly used for comedic effect and nothing is really at stake, but that doesn't stop these action sequences from being choreographed carefully (well, within the context of the show) and from being absorbing at a character level. There are exceptions to this generalization, but even if there's no strict action there still tend to be sequences of increased hyperactivity that pass for action--characters bouncing around the frame and super-deforming to ramp up the emotion, drama, or absurdity of a sequence are very common, as are moments of un-explainable magical realism or characters showing off previously unseen skills to liven up the on-screen happenings a bit.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Spice & Wolf doesn't break completely from the above conventions (obviously--there's a wolf-girl, after all!), it does so more drastically than any other anime I've seen, with the possible exception of Paradise Kiss. The key difference between the two is that Paradise Kiss built tension by relying on coming-of-age storytelling elements and teenage angst. Spice & Wolf is concerned with economics and trade. And I'm not saying that it's concerned with economics and trade in the same way that Hikaru no Go is concerned with Go. There is very little effort to hold the viewers' hand or to make the tension of the central machinations 'more exciting.' Spice & Wolf's plot twists revolve around market crashes, unexpected fees, and the ebb & flow of supply and demand. Its characters talk at great length and (and so far as I can tell) display great knowledge about market influences, financial risk assessment, credit poisoning, etc. Occasionally (particularly in the first season), surprise violence pushes the plot forward, but more frequently it's the hazards of being a traveling merchant in a volatile market that supplies the series' tension, at least on the plot-arc level. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not for everyone. Some are going to find it incomprehensible. I actually had to rewind and pause frequently while watching the subtitled version to fully understand what was happening in some scenes (and some moments are still beyond me), and I was pleasantly surprised to realize that the characters were 'coming' to conclusions more quickly than I was--which almost never happens in anime. Anime is fully capable of being heady and difficult--though frequently when it is challenging your intelligence it's doing so from a post-modern/avant-garde/metaphorical position. Spice & Wolf instead challenges your logic and your intuition. When its characters sit down to discuss business, you realize that they are playing a very advanced game of chess, or perhaps poker, with one another. They are gambling, and the stakes are high, and if you're not as in-tune with their dealings as they are, you will get left behind. I thought it was actually sort of exhilarating. Frustrating, yes, but challenging and stimulating. Of course, I suspect that this aspect of the show won't hold up as well on repeat viewings--which is where the romance comes into play, and where the writers really, really deserve credit.\\n\\n\r\nThe story gets its start when Holo, a wolf goddess who influences wheat yields for a small southern town, sneaks onto a travelling merchant's cart on his way out of town. The townsfolk, through their own ingenuity, no longer require her supernatural intervention, and she is tired of being alone and unneeded. She wants to journey north, to her place of origin, and reunite with entities she has not seen in centuries, and has largely forgotten. The series hints (or maybe I'm reading into it way too deeply) that her hugely extended lifespan may be coming to its drawn-out conclusion--she seems to suffer physically from a weak constitution, and mentally from years of regret and a desire to do things over again. The merchant she imposes herself upon is Lawrence, and he is truly a breath of fresh air, insofar as male leads in anime are concerned. He's got a head of grey hair and has already been through his 'coming-of-age' story. Lawrence has learned how to be an adult and has been one for some time. He's set in his ways, wise, and sure of himself. He does have some weaknesses, particularly for pretty women and for gold, but he knows what he wants in life, and is already working toward it when he discovers the very naked Holo in the back of his cart.\\n\\n\r\nLet me quantify 'very naked' here. Holo is shown nude frequently throughout the series--as a wolf goddess, the only reason she really wears clothes at all are to hide her ears and tail from prying eyes when in her 'human' form. This sounds like a weak attempt to defend the nudity, but it helps that Holo's nudity is rarely sexualized, thanks to her Barbie doll anatomy--by which I mean not only in the lack of explicitly drawn detail (contrast this to the frequently disgusting nude fan service in a show like Elfen Lied), but in her unrealistic features (her conical breasts). She does know that she's attractive and uses her sex appeal to her advantage, but in another rare turn for anime, she manages to do so while being clothed head to foot. (Indeed, when in public, she looks almost like a nun, albeit a stylish one.)\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, Lawrence, in awe of her power, agrees to aid her in her journey north. Along the way they become business partners after Holo demonstrates uncanny business sense and intuition, and they quickly thereafter become fast friends. They consistently and amusingly banter with one another, and their teasing and flirting (sometimes gentle, sometimes not) is a pleasure to behold. They both relish wit and wordplay, yet both seem afraid of their emotions, and occasionally wound each other deeply. By the time the second season starts, we realize that Holo may love Lawrence in ways that he either does not reciprocate or is afraid of returning, and Holo is afraid of the emotional harm she'll do to herself if she allows herself to love a mortal, whose lifespan is but the blink of an eye, compared to hers. It's a well-worn idea in fiction (and in myth), but is here spiced up considerably by their complex relationship that balances business and flirtatious friendship with Holo's need to go home and Lawrence's dreams of owning his own storefront in a large city. They cannot travel together for forever, no matter how much they enjoy one another's company. The two come to the conclusion that it may take in excess of a year to find Holo's home-this is presumably not a problem for Holo, but a year is a long time for Lawrence. Lawrence can only put his life on hold for her for so long, and when Holo realizes this fact, she begins to consider leaving him early and letting him move on with his life.\\n\\n\r\nViewers conditioned to expect certain things from romantic relationships in anime might be frustrated. (Typical YouTube comment: 'I would sell my family just to see Holo and Lawrence kiss!') Both strive to keep the heat between them low, but both eventually become possessive of one another, and commonly-explored themes like jealousy and self-sacrifice are given time in the limelight, though in ways viewers may not be used to seeing. In a sense watching the relationship between the two grow can be maddening--the writers treat the romance on a slightly cool and reserved level (outside of Holo's seemingly playful attempts to seduce Lawrence), and so much depends on what the viewers think of the characters themselves. It'd be easy to just call Holo a manipulative tease and Lawrence a greedy idiot and just move onto another anime with more 'satisfactory' character development. In fact, it almost seems like the writers are trying to do this on purpose--as if they were weeding their audience. Viewers that become truly invested in Holo and Lawrence will be physically pained when the two genuinely fight--others will just shrug and say that they don't get it. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending will please even fewer people. The ultimate destination is not reached, with the writers opting for an emotional climax instead--albeit it a hugely understated one that relies on a close, almost literary reading of the characters and an important development in the penultimate episode to get anything out of. It will please those who admire restraint, but people who want definite conclusions will either be itching for a third season or will just be turned off completely. Truthfully, I would not mind seeing a third season myself, and since the anime is based on a still ongoing series of novels and/or manga, there is more than enough material to justify another season. Still, it's a finely honed ending to a finely honed series that has subverted expectations throughout. I realize that I haven't yet written about the art or the music (both fine, but neither amazing), but let's leave it at this: Spice & Wolf is a series that boasts incredibly well-developed characters, fantastic writing, and a unique sensibility with regards to conflict and resolution. It trades in action for talkiness, and ease of appreciation for real challenge. Its greatest flaws (the mercantile plot, the tricky romantic angle) are also its strongest attributes. It's not for everyone, but you won't know if it's not for you until you give it a try. Or if you possess greater respect for my reviews than I do, myself. Lol.",

            "content": "The second season is story-arc and dialogues wise on par if not better than the first season. The main difference is the lack of novelty that the first season establishes with the merchant focus. The second season instead treads more common ground and focuses on character development and romance.\r\nThemes change from distrust to vulnerability, from alien to distinctively irritated about the difference in details. While without season one the emotional connection wouldn't be established it is here that we get to see the payoff. I love the detail of the difference in problem-solving. The character development is careful, deliberate and steady without ever forgoing conflictor overdramatising none-issues. The exploration of their relationship and the problems that stem from their divergent realities is excellently-executed. Personal stakes are raised even further while the worldbuilding comes along and reveals the shape of larger political aspects.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it never breaks the promises of an adventure story each MICE aspect gets explored during different arcs never once breaking immersion. Regarding the historical setting few mistakes only lead to minor irritation and are likely invisible to most consumers as a period drama it is astonishingly well-executed and highlights issues, ideas, innovations and social concepts of the time for the most part.\\n\r\nThe animation and art are a straight downgrade compared to season one, but the aural aspects are still stellar.\\n\r\nJourney before destination remains the concept that also worked so well in season one.",

It is one of the most magical and sentimental story I ever watched and on top of it there were many words play which I love.\r\nStory is outstanding. It is about Lawrance (traveling merchant) and Horo (the wise wolf) who are traveling all over the world together and heading towards Holo's home town while making trades along the way. The story is building atmosphere from the 1st to the last second of each episode. The plot is great and everybodywill enjoy it. What catch an eye is great balance between romance, jokes and money-making stuff :)\\n\\n\r\nArt is great, surroundings and backgrounds are well detailed, the colors are showing atmosphere, feelings sharp and clearly. The line is good too with old fashioned anime noses and eyes ^^  Animation is good and smooth. Characters are beautifull detailed in every aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound is well matched to the middle age action. It is good prepared for the background and in many important scenes is well matched and don't disappoint. It gives me chills then =]  Voice actors suites well and are full of emotions when it is needed (bravo for them). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is obviously great and I think this anime is one of the best in this year so far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I can say just this 99% of you will be attached to this story because it is one of the uniqe and unforgetable anime.

            "content": "Well, how do I write my very first review?\r\nLet me start by talking about the main male character, Lawrence. Lawrence is your typical average anime MC. He is nothing exceptional. Sure, he has some pretty good moments and dialogs, but none of them would've happened without one of the best written characters in anime - The Wise Wolf of Yoitsu, Holo.\r\nI honestly cannot put it in words, how perfect the character design is. This is a dialog driven anime, purely because that's how Holo made it to be. I was not planning on watching this anime at all, because of the negative association of Holowith a very specific taboo group in the real world. But boy, what a folly would that have been.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime flows like a poem, with a deep melancholic undertone. The parts where Holo talks are the parts you would highlight and discuss in class if this anime were actually a poem. The setting is also very realistic and definitely lends to the charm of the story. \\n\\n\r\nBut most importantly, the background score for this anime is THE best of any I've watched. It transports you into a sombre, yet romantic and fleeting middle age Europe. It is just perfect!\\n\\n\r\nThat doesn't mean this anime was perfect though,\\n\r\n1) No memorable characters apart from the two main ones. Maybe it suffered from being only 13 episodes long.\\n\r\n2) Nothing much to take away from the story.\\n\r\n3) In an arc, a particular character made the show incredibly frustrating to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, Holo alone makes this anime worth it (without taking anything away from the other good aspects of the show).\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Watch one of the best characters in anime in action!",

            "content": "I'll do my best to write this without spoiling anything.\r\nI'm going to start with what I didn't like being that it might give some insight into my judgement regarding the series as a whole.\r\nMy least favorite thing about this series was the romance.\r\nI know, I know. Hear me out.\r\nThe romance was far better than most of what I've witnessed in many series.\r\nI go for romance. It's my thing. I watch and read a lot of it.\r\nSaying it's my least favorite thing is not my implying that it was bad or poorly done. I'm merely lending perspective towards my attitude.\r\nI felt the romance was often blindfoldedand spun around all while having had too much to drink.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it felt intelligent and mature at times, it often ended up frustratingly familiar. I understand the need to include themes that are familiar to a certain demographic, I really do.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it can get to a point where trying to maintain the excitement of not knowing the answer, or watching the characters suffer through needless anguish over the very same question, can become tiresome and fatiguing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion (and this is based on an opinion formed without having read the novels) the romance could have fared much better if it had climaxed sooner in the story. I believe this story should have been about the struggles of such a unique couple in an unforgiving world during an even more unforgiving time rather than your typical guessing game between characters who clearly love each other.\\n\\n\r\nI guess what I'm saying is, it seems too childish and immature for this series.\\n\\n\r\nI get it, Holo may be wise but she is also portrayed as very emotionally immature. The same can be said of Lawrence, I suppose. However, I say it again, the feel and tone of this series was far too serious and mature for that kind of romance.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to my next point regarding the romance: the end was far too anti-climactic for its own good.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, even the romance simply didn't hit me like I'm used to and, trust me, I'm not hard to convince.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't get that spine-tingling joy I always get when I see such a development. I didn't feel like I wanted more of it in my life. I didn't feel very much at all for it.\\n\\n\r\nWhich hurts to say, considering how much I respect this series.\\n\\n\r\nAll the negative aside, it was a fun ride.\\n\\n\r\nThe part of the romance I did enjoy was how disgustingly adorable those two could be. I simply ate it up. With every time she rested on his shoulder. With every grip of each other's hand. With every blush and moment of realization of their love for each other.. it was all well and good, indeed. This would probably further explain my frustration at how their relationship developed. I'll say again, I truly believe it would have done more good for them to have gone through at least some of the series knowing how they felt. I wanted to see more of that sincerity. I wanted to see them go through trials as lovers and not simply two people who feel they love each other but haven't realized it in the other..\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, on to some more positive thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nThis series made me think. It really did. The amount of work the original writer put into gathering knowledge about economics during that period is truly admirable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the studio who produced it did a fantastic job of putting me in a 14th century town filled with everything you'd expect of it.\\n\r\nThe art, the sounds, the music. It was all so well done and really brought the world to life.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I feel a certain level of undeniable dissatisfaction. I do want more, I won't bother denying it. I wanted to see so much more from this series. All the anime did was make me want to buy each novel and read them just to rid myself of this cumbersome feeling..\\n\\n\r\nWhich, I suppose, is a good thing in itself, right?\\n\\n\r\nIf the creators of this series were trying to get me do that, they certainly succeeded.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: give it a watch. Honestly. You'll enjoy the ride as much as I did, provided you can ignore some of the more obvious flaws. Which are, thankfully, pretty far and few in between. Just.. don't expect to walk away feeling totally satisfied. This series won't give you that much. You'll likely have to read all 17 volumes to achieve that much.",

            "content": "The second season of \"Ookami to Koushinryou\" picks up exactly where the first season left off. The two seasons share the same strengths and weaknesses, so your enjoyment of this season should match how well you liked the previous one! I gave season 2 a lower score because they should have attempted more with these 13 episodes, rather than double down on their previous formulae.\r\nStory [6/10]: Spice and Wolf season 2 continues in the same vein as before, with Holo the wolf deity traveling towards her ancient home up north. Again there are two major plot arcs, with adventures in different towns, though this timethere is less action and more drama.\\n\\n\r\nPacing [5/10]: By replacing action with more financial maneuvering, Spice and Wolf loses momentum and is forced to make up for lost time at the end. The denouement is rushed, with a complete shift in focus to give some sense of closure although nothing practically changes.\\n\\n\r\nArt [9/10]: As before, the artwork is stellar!\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]: Again and again, slow and frustrating scenes in Spice and Wolf are saved by its soundtrack. It would not be much exaggeration to say that its music raised the series out of mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [6/10]: With a greater focus on drama, you might think that season 2 would be more have more character/relationship development. This is not the case; in fact, I would argue that our two protagonists remain largely stagnant within these 13 episodes. Fortunately, they are likable and well-textured enough to hold their own.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [7/10]: Going into this season, I had hoped for more than just variations of the story arcs of season 1. It was still enjoyable and offers an ending of sorts (with no third season in sight, it will have to do), so I would still recommend seeing it to the finish!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [7/10]",

            "content": "I also wrote a review on the first season of Spice and Wolf so you can check that out as well! This review is mostly focused on comparing season 1 and 2 so I may not be reviewing deep enough the specific things about season 2.\r\nThis review does not contain spoilers but if it was absolutely necessary to write a spoiler, I will warn you in time.\r\nFirst of all, I am clamoring for a Third Season!! Where is it??!! \r\nThe second season of Spice and Wolf definitely reached my expectations. Similar to building a house, the first season of Spice and Wolf built the foundationand the outer skeleton of the house. It also built in the wiring and plumbing but the season 1 has yet to make the house pretty. Now, season 2 adds the walls and decorations. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nOnce again, the story begins with Holo and Lawrence leaving the city from the end of the first season and moving onto a new one. This time in season 2, they are not going after profit but rather, Lawrence is trying to guide Holo to her native home. Similar to the last season, they encounter obstacles along the way and they have to solve them. Unlike season 1, their obstacles in season 2 are mostly testing Holo and Lawrence's relationship. I really enjoyed the contrast in that now the dialogue mostly shifts to how Holo and Lawrence reconcile their feelings for one other. Of course, we still have economic talk scattered throughout the dialogue. In a way, the story has evolved from a story of a merchant travelling on the road to riches to a couple who is on a spiritual journey. \\n\r\nOnce again, the anime is still dialogue heavy so if you are not into that both seasons of Spice and Wolf are not for you (but I do urge you to give this anime a chance!)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nA different studio took over the artwork for season 2. I believe it's Brain-Base who did it. There were probably subtle differences in the facial expressions and scenery but I could not notice them. The colours are still consistent to season 1 but it may have taken on some more darker tones. In addition, I felt the framing was a little bit off from the first season. At times, I felt that the framing was not as well-done compared to season 1. Nevertheless, the artists were able to capture the beautiful romance between Lawrence and Holo. After watching season 1, you will not be disappointed by Brain-Base's animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe only reason I gave this a 9 is because I didn't really like the OP. I felt it was unable to capture the blossoming relationship between Lawrence and Holo. It is still solid nonetheless. The anime soundtrack is still the same as the first season so no disappointments there!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nIf you happened to read my review on Season 1, you would know how much I love Holo. In season 2, I still love Holo. Since she's developing a more intimate relationship with Lawrence, she exhibits more jealous behaviour. As a result, she may act like a Tsundere. If you don't like that character archetype, fear not for Holo is still treated as a very charismatic female character like in season 1.\\n\\n\r\nLawrence definitely changes in this series. I felt he is not as shrewd as he was in season 1 but now, he shows much more passion and love towards Holo. We definitely see more of his vulnerable side and I welcomed that change. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance between Holo and Lawrence is still there but it is even stronger now. This season has much more relationship building so we get to see more of Lawrence's and Holo's inner struggles. I felt that they really took care of developing these two main characters. You will definitely not be disappointed in that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nIn season 2, Spice and Wolf still has the problem of not flushing out the side characters. But this only makes for more cute Lawrence and Holo moments (and we all want that right??). \\n\\n\r\nI realized that I didn't review the voice acting in season 1 so I say right now that season 1 voice acting and season 2 voice acting were superb!! I absolutely loved the voice actor for Holo as she brought out Holo's snappy and flirty remarks. The voice actor is the reason why Holo's character is so lovable. Of course, we can't forget about Lawrence and the voice actor for him was solid as well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThe only reason that this is a 9 and not a 10 is because the ending did not feel like an end. You may or may not be satisfied by it but I feel that most people are in the same boat as I am and want to see SEASON THREE!!! Nevertheless, I definitely enjoyed Spice and Wolf Season 2 and would recommend it to all!!",

            "content": "After watching the original Spice and Wolf, it leaves me a feeling of wanting more and after a year of waiting here comes the sequel entitled \"Spice and Wolf II\"\r\nHoro and Lawrence are still on their journey north to where they believe Horo originally resided. While the story is still all about medieval European economics and trade. Moving from one town to another, running into quite a bit of trouble, and solving it. This time around, the two travelers feel much closer to each other. As romance blooms, the story finally focuses on what lies ahead at the end of their journey...what lies after Hororeaches her hometown?\\n\\n\r\nThe female lead \"Horo The Wise\" is still as witty, cute, and adorable as ever! being much closer to Lawrence, she finally shows more of her female cute side. She appears much more vulnerable and a little bit dependent on Lawrence. Lawrence on the other hand has also matured, he is more reliable and stronger in personality. The support cast is also good, they added depth and challenge that only solidify and confirms the relationship of the main cast of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a strong element of Spice and Wolf II, it is noticeably better than S1. The almost sepia like color tone of the animation for a story that has taken place somewhere in the medieval period fits the story and mood quite well. Each town they visited feels unique in every way, not a dull moment for a series that shows little action, and more character interactions. Character design has also improve, Horo is A++. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is also a strong element of the series. Both OP and ED is fantastic, especially the ED \"Perfect World\" which I found really good and cute. The series is also well covered by its BGM as it captures the scenes its trying to convey very well.\\n\\n\r\n\"Spice and Wolf II\" did a good job on what a sequel should be, for those who watch S1 this is a must watch! For newbies I recommend watching S1 first as it shows how Lawrence and Horo meet each other. One of the best anime of 2009, I give my respect to the animation studio Brain-Base.",

            "content": "And so the journey continues...\r\nThe second season is very much like the first season, with economics driving the plot to our main duo of Lawrence and Holo being at the forefront of it scheming for profit as a good honest merchant and partner. The second season is formed from two arcs, what LA calls the Amati arc and the Renos arc, LA has both strengths and weaknesses to talk about both arcs so...\r\nThe Amati arc focuses on Holo and Lawrence's trust with one another being tested to one of utmost limit in this arc, with not necessarily betrayals as Lawrence acting on his pride asa merchant than trusting in Holo a bit more and it bites Lawrence HARD in this arc. LA was probably the most invested in this arc the most, not only for it's higher stakes, that of Holo being taken away from Lawrence as it were but also for the fact that Lawrence is being tested as a merchant against the titular rival LA dubbed this arc, Fermi Amati voiced by Saeko Chiba ALSO having a one-sided romance towards Holo. The economics involved in this arc is the fairly simple \"supply and demand\" and it's used fairly well and the investment and how most of the plans work only got LA to be invested in Lawrence's plans due to the higher stakes. Several things comes to light in this arc as well, that of Holo's homeland Yoitsu being brought up a bit more since they are nearing their major focused destination and what that means for Lawrence and Holo's relationship coming to a close, so a bit of both relational and world building is formed from this arc, it also shows of Lawrence's development and proper feelings of Holo when Holo is taken away from Lawrence and to this fact that Lawrence is kinda the one at fault in this arc too. If there was a sentence to say what the Amati arc is trying to get at economics aside would be...\"You Don't Know What You Have Until It's Gone\" and it shows. LA thinks this is probably the best arc of the second season due to this.\\n\\n\r\nNow the Renos arc sorta goes through the same thing as the Amati arc once again Lawrence finds a good deal and wants to profit off it like a good merchant does, this time in trying to partner with the mysterious Fleur Boland voiced by Romi Park with the fur trading in Renos but Renos more specifically it's Church has secrets of it's own that's causing conflict with both Fleur and Lawrence due to this. The economics used this time in this arc is that of corruption and how it affects the trading of a town (that of fur and fur processing) and it's strict restriction in trading and how Fleur plans of getting the furs at the best time to turn in a profit. If there was anything that the Renos arc developed was it's world building for the town of Renos itself, with how the trade and Church works but once again shows Lawrence's reckless side but also him somewhat maturing from his last ordeal in the previous arc concluding his own profits not just in money but Holo as well. The outcome of this arc is fairly ok and is concluded well, however there are still some lingering plot points still left hanging.\\n\\n\r\nLawrence and Holo's banter is still the same as ever, them both trying to play mind games with one another with witty dialogue here and there as well the many double meanings their conversations lead too, however it's shown in this second season at least that Lawrence as wised up in some ways to Holo and Holo also opening up to Lawrence in the process of it. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation done once again by Imagin and assisted by Marvy Jack has the same consistency as the first season if not with a bit of polish with the character designs. The backgrounding is beautiful when it needs to be as well. Overall the animation is consistent for a second season just with a bit of polish added.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is once again pretty decent with Ami Koshimizu and Jun Fukuyama as our leads and LA would praise Jun Fukuyama as Lawrence in this second season as he went through the most emotions as Lawrence in this second season. For minor voice roles, Aki Toyosaki, Sara Nakayama, Romi Park and Saeko Chiba did great in their respective roles. Overall a pretty decent voice cast.\\n\\n\r\nSo the second season still has some lingering plot points it hasn't resolved, mainly due to the fact that this second season only end in the Renos arc and doesn't get to the point of Holo and Lawrence going to Holo's homeland, LA is thankful that the Amati arc \"tried\" to include in Holo's homeland giving more world building and backstory to Holo but yeah LA thinks you know what the problem is with this element of the story, is that no resolution at all occurs this season. LA gets it, it's a light novel that had not concluded yet thus it leaves itself open ended and that defence is somewhat enough to dismiss this flaw but still the potential of following through with this would have been great if not for the world building. Still just because of that is LA gonna discredit this season? No, as we see Lawrence most of all grow and learn from this second season not only as a merchant but also his feelings towards Holo opens up in this second season, that and the world building of Renos and Kumerson (Amati's arc setting) was brilliantly done with the economics being played in this season too.\\n\\n\r\nLA will say like with how LA compared Black Lagoon's first and second seasons that Ookami to Koushinryou first and second seasons have both their strengths and weaknesses to be had to the point that both a equally interesting for those liking fantasy economics as well as romance blossoming through it all at the same time. Sure the second season didn't finish the light novel material thus left itself open-ended but that's just how it is. But did LA enjoy the second season?..yes the Amati arc was probably the most interestingly nicely packed arc filled with what Spice and Wolf is all about and the Renos arc helped develop Lawrence even further, did the second season have it's faults just like the first season also did...yes it did. So once again LA sees a second season to be on par with it's first season to sum it up.\\n\\n\r\nOokami to Koushinryou is a witty and clever anime that both world builds not only in economics but it's settings but also builds on it's relationship of our main duo not only as partners but lovers. Ookami to Koushinryou is a tight and well constructed anime that by the end of it LA can see why Ookami to Koushinryou is soo loved of an anime series and it shows upon LA finishing this second season.",

            "content": "SPICE AND WOLF SEASON 1 & 2 ANIME REVIEW\r\nWARNING: SPOILER ALERT!\r\nOVERALL: 9.8/10\r\nPLOT: 10/10\r\nThe story focuses on a merchant, Lawrence, and a pagan wolf God, Horo. Lawrence whose heart is kind enough to help Horo in finding his homeland and take her there. Along there adventure, they encounter many troubles about the deals they take. Honestly, it is somewhat complicated for me to understand some scenarios that I needed to repeat it again but once I did, it is really interesting. The story did a really great job in tackling every significant information on every decision Lawrence take as a merchant. Not only Lawrence but mostof the story. It revolves around how a barter system works, how to think when you're an entrepreneur, I guess. The economy of the town they go into and what are the advantage they can get in order to make a credit for it. Of course, there will also wrong decisions, a bad reading of the people who you make deal with, a sudden change in the economy, a downfall as a merchant. It is all in this series. This anime keeps me goings and click the next episode button. It is a great anime to watch, even though it is a classic one. The season 1 is great while the season 2 is much more greater.\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\r\nLawrence and Horo is a funny combination, I guess. Horo is too talkative, too comical, too teaser. While Lawrence, is kinda old and serious and the type who can't even break a plate. He is too kind. But eventhough it's like that, they have a funny way to express their likeness with one another. Along the story, Lawrence successfully show the character of a real merchant, the struggle and the effort he did in order to keep the thing he owned intact. And the emotion which is growing inside of him that affects the way of his thinking as a merchant. While on the other side, Horo, also change and opens up to Lawrence more. How she is scared on being alone, how she helps Lawrence on making a decision when she knows it is needed. How they don't leave each other even after every quarrel and misunderstanding they get into. It is a lovestory, yes. But it more focuses in the economy side. And eventhough it is like that, you can still feel the love or likeness from them in a sweet or small gesture they did with one another and that is what makes it cute. Eventhough Lawrence is not something like a protagonist like, a common one I mean. The one who is handsome and charismatic and the like. What I'm pointing is he is a simple one. A normal one. And even if he is like that, you can still take interest on him. This is where personality takes action.\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\r\nI love the voice of Horo, really. It is too good in the ear. It is too regal. Like I am listening to a queen's voice and the like. While Lawrence voice is a mature one. Sometimes, a sarcastic tone is sliding and it still depends on the scenario they're in. The other voices will make you think that there is something hidden on it. That they are planning on something. Thus, it all made the series really great. The opening and the ending song is cute. It is solemn and easy and light to listen to.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed it. I learned new things in these series. And there is no single episode that bore me. Every action of the two protagonist, will either make me laugh or think. Though, it is somewhat an old anime compare to the new ones, it is one of the best for me. It can level on the other new series that's been release. It is a great watch and it's worth it.\\n\r\nENDING: 9/10\\n\r\nI want more. I want to see more of Horo and Lawrence story. The ending is satisfying, I guess. But since it is a great series, there is nothing I can feel that to need more of it. Something like how they really end up. Sinve Horo is a pagan God, she won't get old unlike Lawrence. I want to watch more struggle they will take. But yeah, the ending was also good. I mean, great.",

Their love story is extremely beautiful and something barely anyone gets to experience in the modern age. \r\nThe opening and ending of both seasons were peaceful and calming.\r\nI loved the peacefulness of the entire anime. There wasnt any crazy fights, insane powers, or extreme fanservice. It was nice and simple. \r\nThe character development is the gold in this show. The way Holo and Lawrence act and tease each other while not so obviously hiding their feelings is something I can watch forever. They are just so cute together! \r\nthe onlyreason im writing this review is to get it off of my chest and vent a little. im off to read the light novels next.\\n\\n\r\nIt really sucks that there isnt a third season. Thats the only drawback to this series. Also its inconclusive. theres still a lot more to the story, so ALL of that isnt covered. \\n\\n\r\noverall, it was a peaceful and very cute experience.",

            "content": "My impressions about second season remain the same as I wrote about the first season.\r\nThe thing that is most interesting and captivating in Spice and Wolf is the female character Holo. Holo is the type of character crafted to trap the viewer during the display. The temperamental features and intelligent lines of the character captivated me from the start. It is a character without the vices found in most of the anime characters.\r\nLawrence is different. Like other male characters he is more assertive, but still as silly as the others.\r\nSecondary characters and supporting characters are well presented and always play a significant role when theyappear.\\n\\n\r\nThe intelligent speeches of the characters always refer to very realistic situations in the relationship between people. Holo, for example, makes people forget that she is a wolf, however much her ears are always on display.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama is well-crafted. There is always a problem to be solved. The problems that appear are always well introduced, and because they are very similar to real problems, they have always been able to convince me and get me involved.\\n\\n\r\nThe negatives are due to the low visual quality, although I find the design of the characters very beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI am very satisfied with this work and I always review what I can.",

            "content": "The first season of Spice and Wolf was one of the biggest surprises for me since I started watching anime. After reading a review about it and wondering how it got 4 out of 5 stars, I gave it a go and was not disappointed at all. I recommend watching the first season first but it's not essential; there are some references to previous events, but apart from the two main characters the others are new to the series.\r\nContinuing on the story from the first season, Spice and Wolf II is basically more of the same and that is a good thing. It will pleasefans of the series but won't change the opinions of those who didn't like it. At first glance, the plot seems rather original but boring, and sometimes episodes have to be rewatched in order to fully understand the talks about economics. It's about a travelling merchant and a wolf goddess, and their journey to return the latter to her home in the north. Along the way the merchant, Lawrence, makes business dealings with others while his companion, Holo, helps him to make more profit. However, the business talks are actually quite fascinating, and Holo's nature as a wolf in human form as well as Lawrence's risk-taking tend to get them into dangerous situations.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot though, plays second fiddle to the characters. The two main leads and their interaction with each other is, in my opinion, the main highlight of both seasons, effortlessly carrying the series by themselves. I would say that Lawrence and Holo complement each other perfectly, with contrasting personalities that have multiple layers to them. Lawrence usually has a business face on when dealing with others while Holo is prideful of being wise and self-sufficient. However, underneath that they both have a lonely side, especially Holo, who has been in isolation for hundreds of years. The supporting cast aren't bad at all, as they have interesting encounters with the main duo, and play a big part in strengthening the plot, but they pale in camparison to Lawrence and Holo. The light-hearted dialogue between the two is always witty and entertaining, and more often than not verbal battles between them finish with Holo comfortably outsmarting him; as a merchant Lawrence is proud of his speaking ability, but Holo isn't known as the \"Wise Wolf of Yoitsu\" for nothing. As their journey progresses, a growing affection develops between them and they both start to fear the day when they must separate.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is decent. The medieval-ish world in which the story takes place in is well presented, the characters have distinct appearances and their facial expressions are excellent at portraying emotions. The background music is solid if unspectacular, while the opening and endings song are soothing and fit the theme of the anime. On the other hand, the voice acting is great, particularly those of the two main leads. Jun Fukuyama sounds confident as Lawrence, whereas Ami Koshimizu is wonderful at voicing Holo by having a playful and cheeky tone which matches with her personality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found Spice and Wolf II to be an enjoyable watch, even if it is a little light on action, as the drama and dialogue make up for it. The twelve episodes are divided into two story arcs, but the extended absence of Holo in a few of the episodes does ruin it for me a little; it just proves how crucial it is for both Lawrence and Holo to be a part of the show, otherwise it wouldn't even be half as good. The anime is adapted from novels, which are still ongoing, so I am looking forward to a third season in the future.",

Just fair warning in the beginning. \r\nThis anime in S1 started off in confusion for me with little context in some things, and the comedy falling a bit flat where the only parts that stood out were the romance/hurt & comfort moments.  S2 of S&W fixes this.  The characters are as good if not much better than S1 because I feel like Lawrence has changed to have better lines than he did before, and these lines in combination with Holo's responses to them create some hilarious scenes (Like forme the wagon scene in EP1 S2).  It makes the comedy work this season unlike S1 where it felt like they were trying to hard to make you laugh at certain points.  With this being said they still manage to maintain the same level of emotion in the romance and hurt&comfort scenes.  My only gripe with this series is that the ending left much to be desired and basically says go read the novels if you want more.  I rated this a 10 even with that in mind because I simply had fun and felt a lot of emotions with this season, and that's what I base my final score off of, if you can enjoy it and if you can walk away from it with a smile on your face in the end.  (S&W S2 reference hehe)",

But I dropped S2.\r\nI think the characters are really great with the exception of Lawrence. Even then it's not as if I wholly dislike his character. my complaint is that after nearly losing her to a rival merchant  (at least he thinks so) due to a bet he made out of ego. He does it again at the end. I know that he probably wins hands down because this time he trusts her and there's progression in their relationship but I cannot get over the fact that he didit twice. Yes I know she is the one that told him to go along with it but I just could not get past it and it really ruined my enjoyment at the end. So after watching S1 the OVAs and most of S2 I dropped Spice and Wolf. I still think it's a great anime over all and most others who watch it will likely enjoy it.",

Luckily this season manages to keep everything that was good about the first season whilst ramping up the tension in the plot, I'll leave that vague. The pacing i found to be pretty spot on all the way through, a little rushed at times but not enough to bother me. The Art and Sound really go well together, a good example of mixing soundtrack and setting. The best thing i can say is that due to it's abrupt end i am now motivated to buy the lightnovels which hasn't happened before with an anime, having said that for those who don't read the season finishes of in a good enough way that it can bring some closure. In a sense it's actually pretty ironic how the show ends, but i'll say no more. Would definitely recommend, one of the better shows like this out there",

It would simply be like picking up a novel, and begin reading it in the middle of the story. That being said, the story is continuing from where Craft Lawrence promised Holo to bring her back to her home town.\r\nI can't really say much about the art other than its good. There really isn't anything to mention about it other than it's not horrible. (Some people like towrite 2 paragraphs about this)\\n\r\nThe sound in Spice and Wolf was well done. The opening theme in my opinion fits it just perfectly. The music is also perfect, it fits the time of year and it also gave the atmosphere in certain scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are probably one of the best things this show has to offer. So we have a skilled, kind merchant who's trying to make a living (and also a profit) named Craft Lawrence, and then we have a wolf, a cute wolf named Holo. Both characters are very entertaining through out the show, and together they make \"Spice and Wolf\".\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing this I was a bit disappointed because of the lack of episodes. The end definitely left me on a cliff-hanger. The story did not yet come to a conclusion and there most definitely should have been more episodes, but this can mean there will be a season 3. \\n\r\nOverall, the second season was a success and it even seems to be a bit better than the first. If your someone who's interested in Economics or Business than you can understand and enjoy this show. For those of you who are not interested in Economics/Business, it may be hard for you to find a connection in this.",

            "content": "Okay Lion Tamers. Long time until now, 'cause I finally found one I like!\r\n'Ookami to Koushinryou II', also known as 'Spice and Wolf'; is a new take on the traveling duo story. At least in a mechanical sense.\r\nUnder the hood of this story is a true romance, involving two completely different species of creatures. The story even has dialog, from time to time to make that case.\r\nAnd, as many will point out, there is a lot of dialog. In the anime's defense tho, I would much rather have a lot of good dialog, than one line of the wrong kind of dialog.\r\nSo let's take alook at this thing, in a little more depth.\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\n1). The artwork is absolutely stunning. There are almost no anime that shows docked ships, in a rolling coastal sea, bobbing in the water. This show does this in almost 3d splendor. It is gorgeous and should not be missed. And it's not the only example of high-quality artwork.\\n\\n\r\nYou will find incredible motion art in many places, that defy description. For instance, how many anime show a heartfelt handshake, showing all the artwork, with individually articulated fingers? Very few. And this kind of thing is what makes the artwork stand out.\\n\\n\r\nMy only criticism, is the same as many other reviews I've made; does the Wolf character have to have bright Red Eyes? No living wolf in nature has red eyes, and it isn't necessary to make the case of this supernatural form of wolf. Sheesh.\\n\\n\r\nYahoo reports this: Best Answer: A wolf's eyes may be brown, orange, yellow or pale green...\\n\\n\r\n2). Music is actually quite good. While I don't wish to own the soundtrack, the music was artful and appropriate to the shows' atmosphere. Three cheers for the authors not going for the J-Pop only meme.\\n\\n\r\n3). Dialog was mainly driven by the events within the context of the character activities. As well they should be, and almost never happens with any accuracy, in other anime.\\n\\n\r\n4). Romance! And lots of it. While I'm not a huge fan of romantic anime, in this particular case, 'Ookami to Koushinryou II' carries this out properly, with tenderness, comedy where appropriate, and subtleties rarely found in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor clarification, I become too often tired of comments involving the notion that if there is no sex in the story, then romance is not present. This is a naive notion, that requires adult maturity to understand with clarity. For those of you who don't understand this point; many of us, that have some age on us, often have romantic friendships with the opposite sex, that might continue for decades. Neither one of those people ever have the thought that sex is necessary to continue this romantic and fun relationship. That's not stupid; the thought that this cannot function is stupid.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the proper and correct tack, in Spice and Wolf. They make this case, eminently clear. Besides, common sense would tell you that it is probably not possible for biological events following from a sexual relationship between a Human and a creature that exists only in fairly tales, lives almost forever, and rarely has anything to do socially, with Humans. Especially a female Wolf that has already eaten Humans for survival, and reveals this point in the dialog.\\n\\n\r\n5). My main criticism for this season-2 of the anime, is a breach in the story line.\\n\r\nThe last arc of this story is heavily flawed. Wolf goes to great lengths, through two entire seasons to make a case that she is intelligent, independent, and insists on being a free-spirit. Only to give it all away to support a plan to place her in Slavery-Bondage. Something in which the story has her undying support for. This becomes a rational non-sequitur. She would never do this, for any reason, not even for temporary reasons. It's not something she would be able to tolerate. But there it is in the second season. It's a very large and repulsive breach, and I need to clarify by mentioning it in this review.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, it is a serious story flaw, but I can get over it, as the rest of the season continues to hold up as a much recommended anime.\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\\n\r\nIf you like a great travelers anime, and want to see a Wolf in Human form, that actually does not act very Human; then this may be your anime. For those with the knowledge, and experience to understand it; Spice and Wolf might be your anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a clean and solid 9!",

            "content": "This review covers Season One, the bridge OVA and Season Two.\r\nYou can buy meetings, but you can't choose their quality. Words of marketing brilliance that ring no matter your profession. So when a fateful encounter with another person occurs, not matter the barter cost, it's one to be treasured.\r\nSpice and Wolf seems to run parallel story lines of business and romance that both fall under a slice of life category. Countless times the two sides cross paths but almost always come out bad for business. With the second season playing out more casually than the first, it was almost a disappointment that they both endedthe same way but under different circumstances. The first season could not have been played out better while the second season lacked the same thrill.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is that of a typical pre industrial revolutionary anime setting with a strong European style influence. It makes for much beautiful scenery but at the same time can instantly make for an ominous, back water town, style in the quick turn of a corner. Lighting effects are used to a great extent to add a certain feel to many scenes and really do add to the over all environment on both a small scale conversation, to the larger scale environmental setting of a town or city.\\n\\n\r\nWhile scenery music is used a lot throughout both seasons, it was far more predominant in the first than the latter season as everything from a thick, tense atmosphere to a cheerful humor scene had an addition of music where as the second season still had it, but far less for the latter, which made for more bleak humor.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as character development goes, both seasons played separate parts. The first playing more of an introduction to the main hero and heroine and their early journey, while the second season was far more focused on the relationship of the two. We learn very little about the past of either main character, but it seemed to be irrelevant as what is learnt is deemed sufficient as their past is something their past is not something of an easy topic for either of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is where the story story lines come back into the fray. In both business tactics and as a romance anime, many will find great amusement out of Spice and Wolf as their wits are sharp about their marketing but their intimacy is something that is forever growing but always poked at. Humor on both accounts is strongly present in the first season while in the second its more on the marketing side while the relations of the two take a more serious turn, for better or for worse.",

            "content": "If you are a type that likes to watch romance, then I do not recommend you to not watch this anime just yet. \r\nI consider romance anime romantic if they are focused on romance. However this anime has the exact story set up as Maoyuu Maou Yuusha. \r\nDon't get me wrong, the story is good....its just that it's really boring an lengthy. I have watched the complete series twice, so I say that I have a pretty good knowledge about the anime as a whole. \r\nAs seen, the anime is NOT focused on romance, if you have a liking towards marketing, then this is aperfect anime for you! But the anime is mainly focused on the \"marketing\" with very few romantic moments. I would consider this anime as adventure, because they travel to a lot of places to trade. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is so frustrating because it holds so much potential, because the story is good. If the creators added more romantic moments, then I would consider this as a romance anime. However...the anime is really boring, it's literally trade, marketing, gets in trouble, trade, some romance, trade, trade,trade, trade,trade, trade.....etc. The worst thing is that the trade usually has an insane amount of dialogue so there are literally 4 episodes in a row where it's just talking......But hey don't let me stop you! This anime has a high score so it must be entertaining to watch for most people!",
