            "content": "Tokyo Ravens Review:\r\nSometimes shows come around that are completely generic and average on paper, but are unusually fun to watch. Looking at my 6 score for this show, many of you may think I didn't think the show was good. But this couldn't be further from the truth. Tokyo Ravens wasn't groundbreaking, memorable, or brilliant. In fact, it was pretty a pretty generic fantasy action anime with romance elements which is why I withhold too high of a score. However, Tokyo Ravens is without a doubt a very enjoyable show. \r\nStory - 7.1:\r\nWhere Tokyo Ravens' story shines isn't through it's rather generic premise or predictableplot twists, but the solid pacing and backstories of the characters and the setting. The pacing of Tokyo Ravens is nearly flawless in my opinion, giving proper amount of air time to the intro, the time at school, and the more climactic parts at the end. The background of the setting is also very well realized and had me captivated with its mechanics. The lore of the world of Tokyo Ravens is also rich and actually significant when it comes to later events in the story. Yes, the overall story of a boy who gains powers teams up with his classmates to stop the bad guys has been told many times before, but the execution and care put into it all kept me caring from start to finish. Rarely were there moments that left me shaking my head in disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6.8:\\n\r\nFor the most part, the art in this show is great.... Until they decide to use CG. The character designs are good, and the non CG action scenes are well done. Everything is fluid and the varied locations display a wide array of colors and artstyles. However, when they decide to use CG for familiars in fight scenes, things break down. Sometimes CG is done well in Anime, but for the most part it feels out of place and really cuts into your immersion as a viewer. Without the use of CG, this score would have been higher because the visuals were good. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 6.3:\\n\r\nThere's not a whole lot to say about Tokyo Ravens in terms of the sound department. The voice acting was solid all around with a large cast of diverse voices. The OST was good and fit the show well. There weren't really many stand out songs however so I wouldn't say it was too far above average. I did enjoy the openings and endings especially the first ED. Really the sound aspect of this show was definitely good but didn't really stand out particularly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6.7:\\n\r\nNow, the characters in Tokyo Ravens are interesting for me. Because for the most part, the characters were just cookie cutter stereotypes. However, I found myself much more invested in the than I usually do for such one dimensional and predictable characters. This may just have been a personal thing, but who knows. A big plus of the cast of characters was just its pure size and variety. There was a large ensemble of good guys, bad guys, and characters that were in the Grey area of their intentions. None of the characters were necessarily weak, and a few were quite intriguing. The two main leads have a very interesting history and the interactions between characters rarely failed to be entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7.5:\\n\r\nTokyo Ravens was without a doubt, very enjoyable to watch. It had this nostalgic kind of feeling to it and exceded all my expectations going into it. The plot twists were well placed and at times shocking, and the array of humor, drama, and action was well mixed to create an all around very enjoyable show. I personally find it hard to keep watching a show on a weekly basis for months on end unless I really care about the characters and and entertained by the events in the show, and Tokyo Ravens resoundingly delivered in those departments. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6.88:\\n\r\nWhile it never really shined, Tokyo Ravens was still 100% worth the time to watch it. Keep in mind that a 6 in my books means \"good\", and if a 6.88 is any indication, this show was unquestionably good in my opinion. It isn't a caliber of a show that I would recommend to all, but if you are looking for an enjoyable generic action fantasy anime with romantic elements, look no further. \\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nA well executed anime that plays it safe, but was a pleasure to watch. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Solid job of executing its wide array of genres (action, fantasy, romance, comedy) \\n\r\n+ Large cast of characters (all of whom are bearable) \\n\r\n+ Lore/Backstory\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- CGI poorly used\\n\r\n- Predictable story\\n\r\n- Failure to stand out\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Tokyo Ravens, watch... \\n\r\nFate Stay Night\\n\r\nStrike the Blood\\n\\n\r\n6.88/10 - Good\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u00b4ll admit that I fell pretty stupid for putting this anime on hold for such a long time. As it started of with a meh and ended with a YEAH, this anime was surprisingly fun to watch.\r\nAs I started watching this anime, I had a feeling that the main character Harutora was going to be one of those boring mains to watch in the long run, but as I kept following the story, it became more and more interesting to follow this boring main and his friends. Taking on enemy after enemy, trying to become powerful shamans (exorcists) was only a fraction of what thestory was really focusing on. \\n\\n\r\nStill there are parts in the story that is halfheartedly explained, leaving you with a big question mark  as to what is really going on and why. They also seemed to overcomplicate the story, making it harder to get in \"The Zone\" when it comes to characters and scenery. Still the story has plenty of upsides to it. As it is an well though story with good plot twists and a great rhythm and backstory to it, this story leaves me in nothing but awe. \\n\\n\r\nThe art itself were also pretty good, fitting well in with the story and providing well expressed characters when it was needed. Some part were also a bit sloppy when it came to the art, but when it came to the fighting, the art were perfectly done in a way that fits perfectly with what I am looking for in a action anime. I was easily taken by the fighting scenery and style.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the sound goes, I have hardly much to say. The openings and the endings of the anime provides as beginnings and endings of the anime itself, making it easy for one to get right into the anime and the fighting without as great of a shock as what Ive seen other animes do. Following the story was no problem with such an intro to it. Yet I missed that little extra in the sounds, that little extra that leaves you with the impression \"Oh, shits about to go down now\" kinda sounds/music. Still it was fairly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nAs for characters I feel it could have been done a little better. The amount of history put into them, doesnt add up to the amount we are shown. I feel as if I know the teacher Ootomo better than Harutora and the rest. Even though there is given alot of history to them, I still have no clue as to what really happened when Harutora was younger or when anyone was, theres simply a lack of debts to them. I mean, isnt it weird that the story is mainly focused around this Tsuchimikado Yakou guy, and we hardly know shit about him or what happened to him when he was alive. Maybe they should have freed some room for a little backstory instead of providing us with small, unnecessary fillers.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I said all that, this show still provided me with a lot of enjoyment and fun, and as to the ending being an ending I prefer over any other, there was no major disappointments to this show (that i noticed). So dont do as me and put it on hold after 6 episodes, make sure to watch it trough to the end straight away so it doesnt get confusing. I highly recommend this anime to all you out there who hasnt watched it, and lets all pray for a Season 2 :)",

            "content": "-I'm going to skip the synopsis as you can go ahead and read that on your own - I'm strictly writing a review as to my reaction when watching Tokyo Ravens-\r\nTo be honest, when I first began watching this show I felt as though I was lacking originality, in both character and story. The originality wasn't so bad like 'I've seen it a million times' sort of deal, but It was interesting enough to make me want to watch the next episode. The characters seemed overdone and over the top, opening with the feisty chick friend of the male protagonist picking on him and hiscool and calm best friend. Even if it started out quite cliche, I still kept watching it, mostly for lack of other anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIt was worth it because this show had a lot more depth than meets the eye and gets better as it moves along.\\n\\n\r\nFor people who enjoy magic fantasy action anime, you will probably like this as it has a nice mix of all of those genres with interesting plot twists. \\n\\n\r\nThough most characters remain stagnant throughout the anime, at least half of them have some sort of basic development, be it mind set, or physical ability. What bothered me the most about this anime's characters though is how most characters pick on the main protagonist. The anime already outlines him as 'dumb' and 'having a major lack of talent' so much so you wonder why he's even the main character . His interactions with other characters tend to end or start out with them calling him 'baka-tora', and describing how pathetic he really is. Even though he proves himself more than once to the gang, they still proceed to stick with that nick name. As usual, he is a typical shounen character that tries his best, despite his obvious lack in talent. The anime later drops these undertones though, making it A LOT more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe music I found to be quite nice, the opening and ending were okay, not bad but not my favorite anime openings. The music during the anime is very nice, giving it a nice sorta mystic aura, adding a lot more epicness to the show. Without the music, I swear the scenes would feel a lot less intense.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is a nice mix of magic and action, though it might not be the most original story ever written. Its enjoyable enough to keep watching. It may not be one of your favorite animes, but if you watched all the anime there is and happen to come across Tokyo Raven's, its pretty good, and you'll like it better towards the end so i recommend not judging it until you get at least half way.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I wouldn't consider it my favorite show, I did enjoy watching it. Its not one of my most memorable animes, but you definitely wont be wasting time.",

            "content": "There\u2019s a saying that goes something like this: \u201ctwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right\u201d. In Tokyo Ravens, this doesn\u2019t apply as onmyouji magic is accepted by society as a form of dealing with spirits and apparitions in general. The show builds itself with the basic concepts and principles of a modern fantasy involving characters dealing with onmyouji, otherworldy beings that have been causing trouble in Japan. While most anime involving magic is forbidden, Tokyo Ravens takes the liberty to accept it as a form of art. Thus begins the adventurous tale of Harutora Tsuchimikado as he learns the truth about the world he lives in.\r\nTokyoRavens is an animated series based off the light novels of the same name written by Kohei Azano. It\u2019s easy to notice quickly that the show is colored with modern fantasy themes such as the shrines and stylistic clothes that our characters wear. There\u2019s also no doubt that the show has potential with its concepts. But what\u2019s more important is the execution. After all, Harutora is labeled more as babyface with little skill in onmyouji magic. He has potential and Tokyo Ravens explores it in various aspects. What Tokyo Ravens went wrong in this part is its execution that becomes blend and sometimes insufferable. But despite this, the show itself does handle its structural set up in a tolerable fashion with credibility. \\n\\n\r\nTake the series\u2019s story as a modern fantasy with the magic, curses, and spells in an all-you-can-eat buffet. There\u2019s no special appetizer because everything is conventional and expected in terms of its general set up. The first few episodes establishes the premise and delivers itself in its traditional fashion. We meet Harutora and his friends whom doesn\u2019t seem so different from folks you see from our society. However, realize there are abnormal beings that exists in their world. There\u2019s a lot of information to absorb in the beginning, in ways that seems to cloud the story until we meet some antagonists. It also becomes more and more clich\u00e9d with the characters involving a typical childhood friend named Natsume that comes to visit, the flashy fireworks in the sky with a misunderstanding, and mecha-like gadgets popping out as adversaries because they look flashy and demonstrates a lethal presentation of modern fantasy. While all is fine when presented in the right fashion, Tokyo Ravens introduces everything together all at once that feels rushed. More than that, there\u2019s also predictable plot twists that at times becomes bizarre and lands nowhere with Harutora\u2019s characterization.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, there\u2019s quite the diversity. Thankfully, none of them sits in the background but instead get their spotlights, some even more so than our main protagonist. Still, that isn\u2019t exactly a gift to accept so easily because Tokyo Ravens only develops them on a substantial level. Natsume for instance never really changes with her time on the show. She is portrayed as an innocent girl who is willing to protect others. There\u2019s obvious affections coming from her towards Harutora despite the latter being oblivious to her some of her words and advances. To make matters worse, most of the school they attend are under the belief that she is a guy. This is where the silliness comes into play with their \u201cyaoi relationship\u201d. As quirky as it sounds, the series actually doesn\u2019t hide this as they play on this trope many times with almost the entire female student body believing it as reality. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters in the series serves as the support for Harutora\u2019s development but most of them are more like friends to him rather than a coach. They offer him advice, training sessions, and details to unlock his potential. Unfortunately, Harutora is presented as an irrational man when it comes to textbooks and learning. He even earned the nickname \u2018Bakatora\u2019 which is a played as a joke as baka translates to \u2018idiot\u2019 by Japanese standards. At the same time, we do witness Harutora become stronger through experiences and determination to protect others. There\u2019s a sense of hope when he really puts effort or when the people close to him are in danger. It\u2019s there that we see Harutora shines by moments of his selflessness. Other times though, Harutora is hard to get attached to for his abilities and dull personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe series itself also follows sequential arc style in presenting stories and characters. Like I mentioned previously, almost every main character gets their spotlight whether you\u2019re former delinquent (Tojo), the youngest of the Twelve Generals (Suzuka), a shikigami (Kon), or heir of a famous family (Kyoko). Speaking of the Twelve Generals, the series presents themselves as a testimony of strength. Each of them possesses their own unique abilities that makes them both fear and respected. Unfortunately, because the show itself focuses on more of the main characters, they lose focus and only gets their chance to shine when the action calls for it. The action itself also can be a mixed bag. The usage of CGI and magic at the same time is certainly an odd mix. It almost feels like the show is running on an engine with a different set of gears. However, the show does well with its mechanics in terms of explanation. Every episode contains a little bit of explaining whether it\u2019s the backgrounds or just in general of what\u2019s there. Various terminologies such as onmyouji, shikigami, as well as events are usually easily understandable with attention. Furthermore, the term raven is symbolic for death (foreshadowing in the beginning) and matches perfectly with its presentation of magic linked to Shamanism. It could also be something refreshing to watch as it sometimes brings that fantasy taste in a way you might not get used to.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes Tokyo Ravens hard to get used though might be the asinine comedy that tends to be an overused way of delivery. This includes but not limited to Harutora being an accidental pervert, Suzuka\u2019s fake relationship with Harutora, and Kon\u2019s obsessiveness with her master. It also uses cheesy lines with little favor that often lacks sense. Natsume\u2019s cross-dressing makes her a subject of attraction for girls at the academy they attend. It spells out laughter in the wrong way because the misunderstandings should be so obvious. Really, does Natsume look that much like a guy with her fragile face and long hair? Some of the characters\u2019 personalities are also hard to figure out such as Suzuka and her manipulative actions. Kon\u2019s personality changes almost every episode according to what circumstance she is and whom she is with. Tenma, a classmate of Harutora, also seems to be in the background most of the time and plays almost no significant role. While the show doesn\u2019t explicitly present fan service or the typical beach episode, Tokyo Ravens still reveals more skin than it should thanks to mostly Harutora\u2019s stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork remains standard on most parts for Tokyo Ravens. It is noticeable that 8bit is also in charge of producing both Infinite Stratos 2 and Walkure Romanze at the same while this show is also airing. But for judging its animation, Tokyo Ravens does it well only in terms of credibility. Supernatural familiars are believable with their designs while backgrounds reflects the modern fantasy style that it should be. Unfortunately, most of the characters stands out as blend. Kon is perhaps the most noticeable character because of her animalistic features. Suzuka on the other hand has bits of fan service in her design while Natsume\u2019s cross-dressing literally covers almost every inch of her body besides her face. The strange usage of CGI will take time to get accustomed to. At several times, I almost thought this had mecha-esque concepts.  \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack wise, Tokyo Ravens surprisingly works out well. While Harutora\u2019s voice is nothing special, there\u2019s something noticeable about its OST with the way that fuses fantasy elements with reality. Not only that but the OP song \u201cX-encounter\u201d by Maon Kurosaki had an intense beat with bits of foreshadowing. Most of the characters\u2019 voices also fits well that matches each scene. In later episodes, some of the characters\u2019 voices also convey emotions well through their dialogues that almost seems realistic despite the show having fantasy elements.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ravens is nowhere close to a masterpiece but neither is it an abomination. I guess in most ways, it takes time to get used to for its style of fantasy. The series offers a diverse cast of characters that the audience might favor. Unfortunately, their personalities are hard to describe and their characterization are limited. The story itself also takes time to get used to with every arc that has some sort of message or morality. Whether you get that message might feel different for everyone. For me though, Tokyo Ravens is just another standard series of modern fantasy that depicts the life of young man with much to learn. \\n",

            "content": "There's a certain feeling of mediocrity that arises from simply looking at Tokyo Ravens. It doesn't really look like anything new, innovative, or fresh. Despite its generic appearance Tokyo Ravens still manages to do what it's supposed to: entertain. \r\nAs far as story goes, there really isn't much of an intricate, deep, or immersive plot. The story is pretty sub par for a good amount of the first half, adhering to countless generic cliches like the childhood friend promise, amnesia, and what have you. Although it gets better during the second half, it's still not anything amazing. The key aspects that make the second halftake flight and become more enjoyable to watch is that there are actually Onmyo spell battles, familiar battles, the plot finally breaks out of its run-of-the-mill school life trope, and the concept of the shaman society is fleshed out a bit more. With all of that being said, it's awfully apparent that the adaption of Tokyo Ravens from the light novel to the animation is fairly bad. There are countless instances where moments, events, and key turning points in the story felt extremely underdeveloped, unexplained, rushed, or skipped over. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of Tokyo Ravens seemed pretty average, if not below average, in most cases. Most animes nowadays at least bring decent art and animation to the table, but that doesn't appear to be the case with Tokyo Ravens. The art isn't all that great and animations can feel stiff at times. Overall, the art and animation felt a bit behind the times in comparison to many of its visual contemporaries. The sound criteria was fairly average. There's nothing that stands out, but it's not bad. \\n\\n\r\nI think it's become pretty standard in anime for the male MC to be a fool and dense for a majority of the series. Unfortunately for the audience, Tokyo Ravens falls victim to this generalized male lead personality. Harutora, along with most of the other characters, are extremely generic and cliche. If you've watched a good handful of anime you can recognize most of the character tropes that are used here. Childhood friend blossoms into friendship(s) after many years? Preposterous. There are a few interesting characters amongst the Divine Generals, but they get far too little screen time to make much of an impact. There isn't much character development and most of the characters retain their original personalities throughout the series. Supporting characters often felt more interesting and almost as equally developed as main characters and that's saying a lot.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are many aspects about Tokyo Ravens that are extremely ordinary and plain, it still did a fair job of at least keeping me entertained. There are certain instances when watching average is entertaining. This is one of those times.",

The promotional artwork and brief synopsis I read, while somewhat interesting, gave me the vague impression of a mediocre anime with throwaway characters and a wasted chance at a good plot. I write this review in an attempt to dispel those misconceptions in anyone else.\r\nTokyo Ravens, an anime with a plot initially not too unfamiliar involving magic usersin modern-day Japan, starts off rather slowly and doesn't promise much. However, after just a few episodes, the tempo changes rapidly and soon a well-thought-out, refreshingly unique story begins to develop. What originally seems like a straightforward plot becomes increasingly deep, with enough twists to keep you wondering from one episode to the next who's really the good guy. Add to that a major plot twist that completely changes the direction of the show, and you get a very satisfying, entertaining story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was really the only slightly detracting feature of the show for me, as it was close to being sub-par, but at times where it really mattered the animation was good enough to not take away from the drama of the moment. Both the voice acting and the soundtrack were done well, the latter having moments where it went from being sufficient to excellent, and the over-all delivery was handled very well.\\n\\n\r\nNow to address my favorite aspect of the show: the side characters. Something that consistently annoys me about many anime is the one-dimensional supporting characters that are often present. Whether they're there to simply fill the stereotypical niches, to be killed off for the sake of adding drama, or whatever role they're given, side characters in many anime are simply unnecessary. Their lack of presence, importance, and screen time makes them feel hollow when compared to the main character/characters. Tokyo Ravens, however, had a well-rounded cast of supporting characters that actually played important roles in the story, and had distinct personalities tempered by whatever problems they had/things they had experienced. Beyond the main character's \"party\", the other characters in the series felt very real in the way they were presented. Rather than trying to include a ton of other characters and explain their every facet, they were presented at face value. Many of their motivations/convictions remained unclear, which, realistically, would be the case in a conflict on the scale of the one in Tokyo Ravens. Every character in the series felt like they weren't written into the story to make some specific part of it move forward, but were first and foremost members of Tokyo Raven's universe who participated in the story on an equal level with the characters who got more screen-time. That gave the series a very realistic feel to me, something I don't often get in comparable anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say that Tokyo Ravens is a good, well-written anime that may be overlooked by many people (such as myself) that would think it's just another harem-ish shounen. I would recommend giving it try, and letting it prove or disprove that preconception itself.",

But, there were times whereby you would feel it's rushed in some episodes. I personally feel that some instances of the show might not have been explained properly. (I looked it up the forum to see what actually happened as some people read the light novel and kindly explained it in the forum.)\r\nI personally like the art, animation of the characters and especially thefights, pretty well-defined and impactful.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds for the show were pretty decent. The openings were pretty impactful and the endings simply give a soothing yet slow feel which I liked it. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, this would be one of the points where I feel it brings down the score just a tad bit. The main character, Hakutora, isn't very perceptive at the start which I would say was his flaw.\\n\r\nSecondly, I personally feel Toji started off well in the series but I feel and would have liked if he could be given more attention to make him a stronger supporting character due to his past, having gone through a painful experience.\\n\\n\r\nI personally felt that Othomo gave the biggest impact to how the story transitioned and flowed and how he stuck to people who he wished to protect. Last point, There were also a few occurences whereby I felt the internal monologues or thinking processes of some charaters were not expressed properly.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show overall, to be honest, the fights hype things up, the story keeps me hanging on what's going to happen next.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ravens is surprisingly not entirely about ravens. Tokyo Ravens is about shamanism infused in the modern world. This show is apparently average at best but it did not fail to entertain me. In the end, I really enjoyed it.\r\nTokyo Ravens has no major problems in the story but its exposition sometimes is tedious. First half can be lacking in actual story and action but it was justified by the second half. The characters are created well but development seems rushed sometimes. Drama in Tokyo Ravens is basically the story\u2019s weakest point. A good example of this is when Tenma was guilty in the Doumanarc, where he was blaming himself for letting Douman invade the school but after a minute or two, he was not guilty anymore. The drama is too unbalanced and too rushed to earn the emotional weight Tenma feels. The visuals and animation are fine but the CGI can be sometimes cringe-worthy. Music is nice but nothing special\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tokyo Ravens is enjoyable and entertaining but it isn\u2019t ambitious enough to put a higher score",

            "content": "When I first heard of Tokyo Ravens from my friend, I was like OMG! I'm so going to watch it. But then, my expectations of this show died as the series progress. I was practically lost and confused as the series moved along which is something I don't like. Tokyo Ravens is not bad, but it's not good either. It is mediocre at best.  \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThis show is about a teenage guy named Harutora who can't see spiritual spirits like his family. Then he met his childhood friend and the Onmyoji drama starts from there. Afterwards he moved to Tokyo and attended a schoolto hone his Onmyoji skills. This where the plot started to fall apart. During the few episodes of the series, it started off with action, explosion, and magic. However, instead of continuing the action, the plot decided to throw a long laid back school life series. It's a nice touch to show their school life and how normal teenagers interact but there's too much. Most of it doesn't push the story forward. It is just there to create humor and well, meaningless dragging of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThen here comes the part where I want to smack my head against the wall. Tokyo Ravens has a lot of CONFUSION/PLOT HOLES. When watching this series, I keep having questions in my head. What happen to Natsume? What are phases? What's Suzu's purpose? How can you conjure up spiritual disasters? CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS TO ME?! *sigh* I think the producers needs to execute this series better... \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are good points as well. The action and fight scenes were well done. The positioning of the romance is also well done. They kept me slightly interested towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of the end, the ending of Tokyo Ravens is unsatisfying. It is like they drop another big plot hole on top of the old one without fixing it. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the mediocre and confusing plot, the art in Tokyo Ravens is AMAZING. The colors and brightness are so beautiful. Even though there are some *cough* problematic CGIs, I'm not the type of person to judge the quality of it. All CGIs to me look the same so yeah...\\n\\n\r\nOverall the art in Tokyo Ravens is beautiful. Period.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like the first opening of Tokyo Ravens. It brings out the hidden darkness of the series. The song also fits with the ongoing action. The second opening is a little bland for me. It doesn't really bring out the darkness of the series anymore. Instead, it beings out well, action/adventure.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOh boy. Here comes my rant. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters that there are WAY TOO MANY! There's too many characters to keep up with. If there's too many characters, it leaves little room for the other characters to shine *cough* main character Harutora *cough*. It also left me the impression of what the hell is his or her purpose in this story. Then there's one part of the show where they introduced this side character but he didn't appear for like ten episodes but then appeared during the end, claiming that he has an important role to serve. I completely forgot his name and who he is. This shows that they should lessen the characters or give them enough screen time in order to make them more memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThen as for the main cast, I feel like their action in this story is minimal. Harutora has not taken action until towards the end of the story, which is kind of sad. Heck, even the side characters does more actions than him. The side characters help move the plot along until it's time for Harutora to shine. However, the other main characters serve their purpose in this story well. They played their part in the right time and place. But, there's little character development form them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite all those negative comments I said about this series, I actually enjoyed it till the end. The humor made me laugh a couple of times and the fight scenes were spectacular. If only the series explain all those plot holes and give some spotlights to some characters, then it will be even more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ravens has its ups and downs, but it is an enjoyable show. It's just that the confusion and plot holes kill the show for me. I feel like this show needs a season two to explain all those unanswered questions. But that's all in the near future. So if you're a person who is indifferent to plot holes and likes a story about magic, Onmyojis, and romance, then this is a show for you. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Expectations are scary...They can greatly influence someone's opinion on a show! If going into it with really high expectations, it can end up being way more disappointing! If you go into it with really low expectations, you might even end up enjoying it! I personally always try to watch with an open mind and try to not get hyped for a show too much so I can still enjoy it! For this particular show though, it is the exact opposite of my example earlier! This show did not end up being way worse than I had expected but the other way around! Ladies andGentlemen, today's topic shall be the Underdog of the Spring and Fall Season, Tokyo Ravens!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story of Tokyo Ravens takes place in an alternate universe, that is rather similar to ours, except for the fact that there exist spirits and familiars. In this world there also exist Exorcists, who learn how to handle those spirits. They learn to summon them, exorcise them and even how to fight using them, for the sake of preventing a spiritual disaster. The main character is Tsuchimikado Harutora, a teenage boy that is part of the branch family of one of the most popular Onmiyou-Exorcist families in Japan. However, other than most others in his families, Harutora is not able to see Spiritual Power and thus can't become an Onmiyou-Exorcist like most others he knows. That's why he has lived a rather quite life up until now, simply hanging out with his friends Hokuto and Touji. That is, until he meets his old childhood friend from the main family, Tsuchimikado Natsume!\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Setting for Tokyo Ravens is rather interesting and even though this kind of supernatural thing is not really uncommon anymore, I do really enjoy those kind of shows! What Tokyo Ravens does really well is taking what it is given and turning it into something good! The show is really good at world building! Almost too good I would like to say...While the world is really well explained and it's potential is used really well, that has a certain price attached to it! The show takes way too much time fleshing out the world, that it could have spent on it's characters or bringing it's story forward. Of course this is not necessarily a bad thing, as this makes the second half even more enjoyable due to the really well explained world, but the first half falls flat due to this! The characters are uninteresting, the pacing is all over the place while it is still enjoyable, the first half of the show is mediocre at best. However the show does pick up quite nicely around half of the show! With the first really big fight starting, the show finally shows it's scale and just how badass it can be! From there on it seems as if I was watching a completely different show, as basically all the pacing problems get solved, the viewer is finally able to really get attached to the characters and the plot twists have a lot more impact that they used to have! Tokyo Ravens second half was one of the most surprising things that happened to me in this winter season and it even included one of the best episodes of this entire season! It got me surprisingly emotional, something that I wouldn't have expected from this show as well! However there is one thing that I am not completely content with and that would be the ending! The ending for Tokyo Ravens itself was rather good and did leave a lasting impression, however it did not quite end the way I wanted it to end! The ending doesn't really give any sense of closure and since there is only 10 Light Novels as of now, of which 9 got adapted in this TV Anime, there probably won't be any more too soon! However hope dies last and maybe we will end up having a second season at some point in time...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe Characters for Tokyo Ravens mostly suffer from the same problem that I mentioned in the story, the first half! The characters I would argue, while still being the best part of the first half, aren't really well fleshed out! While the interactions are quite well written and I have to say that the more quite Slice of Life moments of the show definitely were my favourite parts of the beginning episodes, the characters don't seem to develop at all! It kind of plays out like Index, just not as bad!\\n\r\nHarutora at first is your generic Light Novel Main protagonist, that stands up for his friends and doesn't have much of a personality except that, but just as the story, Harutora's character gets a lot better halfway through the series. While I can't really reveal too much about that, due to spoilers, all I can say is that his character got a lot more conflicted later on. The second character to talk about is Tsuchimikado Natsume. She is the daughter of the Tsuchimikado Main family and as such has to go to the Onmiyouji-Acadamy in Tokyo, meaning she lives far away from her home. She also happens to be Harutora's Childhood friend and also due to the family\u2019s tradition has to go to school pretending to be male. She is a rather quite character at first, but soon turns out to be pretty strong herself as she is really good at judging a situation and acting in the appropriate way. If I were to go over the rest of the characters in detail now, this Review would probably just take way too long, so let me just say really quick, that most of the characters are rather interesting to watch. They may neither be the most original characters of all time, nor the most well written, but the show certainly has a good enough cast to be enjoyable! The only other thing that kind of bothers me, is that while the Slice of Life character interactions seem to be really interesting at first, they get a little more generic later on. That may be caused by the show not really having that many Slice of Life moments anymore, but it still is something that bothers me. The longer you watch the Anime the easier it is to get attached to everyone. The Anime also has a huge cast of Side characters, that are all somewhat interesting and that I would love to see more about. However the Size of the cast itself prohibits the Anime from digging deeper into them. All in all the characters are flawed but likeable. It doesn't make the show a lot worse, but they don't really do a lot to make it better either.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWith the OST being done by Maiko Iuchi, the same person that did the Soundtrack to shows like Railgun, the OST was sure to be somewhat good. While it was not a masterpiece and nothing I would listen to outside of the show, it perfectly fit the show it was attached to. It mostly consists of quiet Piano and Violin pieces, mixed with some rather intense fighting themes. My personal favourite at this point is the track \"Dairenji Suzuka\", which plays every time Suzuka gets on screen in the early stages of the show, as the music makes her entrance really badass and fits her attitude perfectly!\\n\\n\r\nFor the Openings, both are rather good. Same as with the OST, they are not absolutely amazing and unskippable, but they set the tone for the show quiet nicely. While most people like the first Opening better, I personally do enjoy the second one just as much and honestly couldn't decide which one of the two were better. However, the animation for Opening Number 1 is a lot more interesting and the Direction does look a lot better! That said, the second one by no means looks bad, the first one just looks better! For the endings it basically is the same, while I did not like the first ending as much, the second ending ended up being my favourite song of the show!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nTokyo Ravens has been produced by 8bit, the same company that also did Infinite Stratos and Aquarion Evol and has been directed by Takaoki Kamasaki, the director of \"Is this a Zombie?\". The Animation for the show is average at best. It's not really fluent and doesn't really have anything eyecatching about it. It is not abysmal, but it certainly is not good! I feel like the bad animation kind of makes the show a little less badass than it should have been and it really does not do a good job at complimenting the show! Another huge fault with the Animation of this show, is the CGI. It looks really out of place and honestly is some of the worst I have seen in quite a while. It is mostly used for some of the familiars and it really is painfully obvious.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ravens has been the Underdog of the season and by far the most surprising one to me in a while! The show has a good amount of action, likeable characters and a well paced story. In the second half that is! The show has huge problems at the beginning, but does solve them halfway through it's run. It may start off as a rather boring show, but the later parts are definitely worth standing through the first episodes! I would definitely recommend it to basically anyone that is into Supernatural and Fantasy Anime.",

            "content": "*This Review Contains Spoilers*\r\nWell then, that was a bitter sweet ending, so the anime has ended and quite frankly, I was part ecstatic but also part dissapointed as to how this 24 anime has come about, so I'm just gonna get down to the point, ORDER!!!!!\r\nStory and enjoyment: Good 7.\r\nOk, it might be just your typical good vs evil run of the mill plot, where magic was involved. But unlike the typical run of the mill kinda thing, this has has romance that involves an incest where it was among cousins and it has a lot of suspenses as to how each climax comes aboutpertaining to the spiritual disasters kind of scenario. However, the whole plot was all about Harutora and Natsume.....well, it maybe overhyped, but then again seeing Natsume's dedication towards Harutora basically makes this story plot good.......enough, to be enjoyed ORDER!!!!!  \\n\\n\r\nArt and  character: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nOk, at first I don't understand as to why Natsume has to dress up like a guy in school, until it was reveled as to why. But pertaining to the school uniform and the divine generals attire....well, let's discuss the school uniform, it was too fancy to say the least, but it so cool on Kyouko, the guys school uniform, eeeeh its just too late 60's retro to say the least, but it looks good on Toji. Now I gave it such rating because despite of the fanciness, it kinda looks good on some of the character's. Natsume, on the other hand, makes her hair a give away that she is a girl despite of being in s boy's uniform, however in this anime, the characters role has it to over look it, which I have to say make's it rather stupid. About the adults in this anime....well pretty typical of them to be in business attire, but I'd never understand as to why Kon has to be this chibi familiar when she could have sport an adult look, there also the divine general Reji, that at one point I could have forgiven if he stayed on as a dark protagonist, but since there is the part where he has to be the antagonist makes me wish that he should have died. Now, I gave this anime's art and character such score was because at one point one would have like them, but in another point one would also despises them as well, especially when the antagonist whom we thought where the good guys are actually the ones who wanted to revived the Yukon inside of Harutora. As to Harutora, he does play as a typical oblivious guy at one point, but then he becomes this mature guy in the end and I kinda hate to see that we won't probably see as to what is next , now that the Yukon inside of him has awaken, well probably in the manga we will see, but I'm yet to get started on it, ORDER!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nNo comment for this part, ORDER!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nBecause we were left with a bitter sweet ending where the so called Taizan Fukun Ritual was able to be performed by Harutora on Natsume, but it was only half successful and something sort of whatsoever happened to Harutora where I wish I know what the fuck it is, so overall what we have is a glass that it either half full and half empty kinda of thing where I went for the half empty part. DISORDER!!!!!!!!! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ah, surprises. Don't we all love them? Whether good or bad, they always add something in our life - something that spices it up and moves it out of the monotone stillness we are ever so used to.\r\nGood surprises are common, and usually with very little significance attached to them. However, a slight surprise can put a smile on your face and leave you in awe of our large world. \r\nWhen I first started watching this series, I expected a typical shouen that would keep me entertained for a while. I really liked the magic system present in this show, along with its impeccable execution.This is why I kept watching, despite lowering my rating to 6/10 during the first half, and dismissing it as your average shouen, with no real content or anything memorable...\\n\r\nThis however, slowly changed during the second half. Things started to pick up their pace quickly and kept me watching, sitting on the edge of my seat. The second half of this show saved it, and made it worth the watch in every way possible. This show let me enjoy myself in a way I haven't for a long time now, and I can reassuringly say that it was one of the best \"feeling packed\" shows I've ever watched. \\n\\n\r\nRead on to see my views on the characters, sound, animation, story and the overall \"feel\" of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the story of this show is nothing spectacular. In essence, it is about a person who is supposed to be the incarnation of a military prodigy - nothing new, and it has been done before.\\n\r\nHowever, the way it is executed in the show makes for a feeling packed ride that is very memorable. It's hard to say more without spoiling so I'll just end my opinion with this:\\n\\n\r\n\"A slightly generic story turned interesting and further redeemed by avoidance of typical shouen moments.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow that the story is out of the way, I'm free to elaborate freely on every other aspect of the show without worrying about spoilers :) \\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show was nothing short of amazing. The character designs felt fresh and fit the characters' personalities perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nApart from this, the effect design for the various spells used by the characters were literally spot on. From the growing roots, to the raging fire and instantaneous flowing rivers, the mood and feel of the spells was completely captured and portrayed to the viewers perfectly. \\n\r\nYou would never look at the screen and say to yourself \"wow, for talking so much that sure is a weak looking spell\". Even the simple \"paper\" spells seem to be executed well, it's as if the \"paper\" is given command and as a living being is executing it.\\n\\n\r\nThe use of CG might be off-turning for people, but I personally didn't mind it. The only use of CG was for animating Machine - like beings, which fit perfectly well. Similarly to how Berserker was incorporated in to Fate/zero, the CG doesn't make you feel like anything is out of place.\\n\r\nPersonally, watching traditionally animated robots is a bit weird to me, as no matter how hard you try it's near impossible to achieve the feeling of machinery without putting too much time in to it.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing I feel obliged to mention, is the backgrounds. They were absolutely BREATHTAKING and I would even compare them to kara no kyoukai. There was absolutely no scene with a dull background with a deficiency of details... My eyes always had places to look at to notice all of the details and, honestly, it was a pleasure to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10+\\n\\n\r\nThis is largely personal preference, but the sound completely captivated me. I always felt as if the sound fit the scenes perfectly, from the abstract whistling sound when Suzuka first appeared to the catchy poprock-esque themes present in the battles. \\n\r\nSometimes there was pure silence, and it was appropriate for the situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a great job imo, and the voices never felt out of place. This added to my immersion in the show and helped me relate to the characters in many ways. The only voice that slightly bothered me was the voice of Kyouko's father, but that's a minor \"flaw\" based purely on taste.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings gave you a decent taste of the show, and the endings did well to close off the feeling packed rides and get you excited for the future events.\\n\\n\r\nAs I'm writing this, I'm listening to various tracks from the show and I'm enjoying them fully! ^_^\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show had a fairly large cast of characters, and even if all of them weren't fully developed, they still had their progression and enough time to shine.\\n\r\nTo add on to this, none of the characters fit a certain stereotype and no character was annoying, irritating or just plain out badly written. In essence what I'm trying to say is that all the characters were bearable and worked as a whole really, really well.\\n\\n\r\nA few honorable mentions I personally really liked were:\\n\\n\r\nOur main character, your typical shouen hot head (kind of) who developed so much, even before the miraculous \"power up\". Also, he had a high level of maturity which is nowhere to be seen in your usual shouen main character.\\n\\n\r\nThe homeroom teacher, though I can't explain why due to spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nKyouko, for being a mature friend and her adult like behaviour in the (emotionally) intense situations and times where a typical character would've just cried dramatically.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume, for trying her hardest and her bravery. Also what I said about Kyouko.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuka, for her gradual development and evolution in to a normal girl...\\n\\n\r\nI really could mention so many here since all of them (well, with SOME exceptions) were special in their own way, kudos to the writer for coming up with these characters and designing them in a realistic way without slapping a bunch of stereotypes on to them.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie, I enjoyed this anime much, much more than I thought I would and I feel confident enough to recommend it to anyone reading this review!\\n\r\nThis anime just made me feel excited, didn't leave me sad or mad about certain parts of the ending, didn't leave a bittersweet taste in my mouth and never made me facepalm at certain events.\\n\r\nI laughed, I felt sad for characters at times, felt happy for them at other times and was cheering and watching in awe as the show unraveled. \\n\r\nI truly had fun watching it, and simply because of this reason I believe it to be a gem in the rough that needs to be discovered by everyone out there! \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I loved this anime, it pains me to say that it had a fair share of flaws, mostly present in the first half... The critic in me (assuming I went out and pointed out every little flaw and didn't factory enjoyment and immersion whatsoever) would say the score of this show is hovering around 6.5/10, however factoring in the fun and enjoyment, the lovable cast, the amazing art and music.. I feel as it's deserving of a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my mixed feelings on this, I've decided it's a safe bet to rate the show as 8/10 which I figure most people can agree on.\\n\r\nIt's not a masterpiece, it's not a one of a kind show... but it's good and nobody can deny that. It's simply that, good and there is no other way for me to explain it.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know what to recommend to you if you liked this show, apart from maybe Kara no Kyoukai or Fate/Zero due to the similar approach to the magic systems.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of the music of this show, I'd point you towards the To Aru series.\\n\\n\r\nI believe no other show really manages to achieve the \"feel\" of this show, which is why I can't truly recommend something.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT:\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't watch this show, you won't be missing out on the masterpiece of the year. You will be, however, missing out on a lot of potential fun that might just brighten up your day.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ravens is often described as a prototypical high-school fantasy style anime. While the description is accurate, it is far and away better than most of the stereotypical high-school fantasy anime that are rolled off the factory line every year. Tokyo Ravens does an outstanding job creating a universe in which you feel fully connected to both the past, present and future of many of the characters and their world. Although I do not do much reading of manga or light novels, I will be pick up the Tokyo Ravens light novel where the anime left off as the anime leaves little closure.\r\n{Story} - Easilyone of the highlights of Tokyo Ravens, the story is well developed and cohesive throughout the anime. Set in an alternate universe of post-world war II filled with magic, it comes with a few surprising twists and turns. The story is filled with hits of romance, action and fantasy and they all come together to form a story that will have you craving more once it comes to an end.\\n\\n\r\n{Art} - As with many anime that make use of magic, Tokyo Ravens is gorgeous. Top notch visual graphics are used throughout the anime and they really come to the forefront in the final episodes.\\n\\n\r\n{Sound} - As with the visuals, Tokyo Ravens had an excellent audio profile. The anime made excellent use of background music in both emotional and action scenes that never distracted you from the focus point but very much created a beautiful atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\n{Character} - Along with the story, I consider character development to be one of the most important aspects of an anime. Tokyo Ravens did not disappoint. While the anime makes use of quite a few central characters, they're all given fleshed out identities and evolve over the anime. Each character will take turns surprising you and showing why they are as important to the anime as the next character. Unlike many anime, this anime will connect you to characters from the first episode and will leave you wanting to know their future once the anime ends.\\n\\n\r\n{Enjoyment} - Quite frankly, I enjoyed this anime much more than I expected. I binge-watched the entire thing in one day and I do not regret it for a moment. I was surprised when reading other reviews that people found it average and just another fantasy anime - I found it to be head and shoulders above much of the average shows that the anime machine sends out these days. \\n\\n\r\n{Overall} - Overall I gave this anime a 9/10. Much higher than the MAL average but fully deserving of more recognition. I believe Tokyo Ravens is extremely underrated and looked over. With an excellent story and character development along with immersive visuals and audio - this anime needs to be watched.",

            "content": "I've loved magic since the time I was a child. I don't know why but I always dreamed of having some cool powers, being able to cast spells etc. That's the reason I, for instance, love Harry Potter, Avatar, I used to love Winx, and now I came across an awesome anime that is also about magic. This time, as promised, I have for you Tokyo Ravens. \r\n Plot and Storyline\r\nIn the beginning of this story we have the main character Harutora, a boy born in the prestigious Onmyoji (Magic) family Tsuchimikado. Although born in such a family he still isn't able to see \"spiritenergy\", meaning he is not able to use magic. Or he wasn't able until he met his childhood friend Natsume, who is also the heir to the main Tsuchimikado family. After the accident with one of the Twelve Divine Generals (first class Onmyoji) Harutora decides to become Natsume's familiar (protector).*(Just as a little add, the Twelve Divine or Heavenly Generals exist in the Japanese belief as the protectors of the Medicine Buddha).* He becomes able to see spirit energy, and shortly after that enrolls the Onmyo Prep School. In the now \"new world\" for Harutora, everybody is speaking about Natsume being the reincarnation of Yakou Tsuchimikado, a genius Onmyoji who is told to be The Father of Modern Onmyoudo. But is she really the reincarnation? Hmmm...\\n\r\nThe storyline of this anime is great. You have the slowly (yet not too slow) developing story whose peaces are placed one by one, like a puzzle, until you get the whole picture. I have to say, after the 14th episode I was scared that they will just ruin the rest with the episodes to come, but they did not. The opposite actually happened. The story became more and more interesting and it kept me on tenterhooks until the very end. A couple of plot twists also contributed to the show, leaving actually no plot holes at all. \\n\r\nThe mix of magic and action fights also did they bit in this show. \\n\r\nAnd finally an anime that has a finished love story. It didn't left me with the stupid thoughts: \"Will they be together\", \"Will he tell her how he actually feels about her\" etc. I hate unfinished stories in anime which don't have a second season. Make an OVA at least, that would make me really happy. \\n\r\nAnd while talking about second seasons, this anime really deserves one. It did leave some open questions and a movie or another 12 episodes would be great. I could read the finished novel, but I am too lazy to read something. School is coming after all.\\n\r\nAnyways, Tokyo Ravens is a catchy, awesome and in some parts very emotional story that is worth every single second of watching. There are not much anime which have a great story that is not ruined in one or the other way. And even if the beginning seems a bit like there is no progress, be patient. The best is yet to come.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWhat a crazy bunch of personalities we have here. We have the cool guy, the stupid one, some prodigies, a girly, a shy boy, an awesome teacher, a cute familiar...\\n\r\nThis anime really has awesome characters, and I could talk about them the whole day, but the main two will also do good. Ladies first...\\n\r\nTsuchimikado Natsume is a prodigy onmyoji and as said before the heir to the main family. Don't be confused, she will just pretend to be a boy in most of the show. She is a very caring person and she takes her obligations as the heir very seriously. She proves that there is no success without hard work and sacrifice.  An awesome and interesting character, Natusme-san. \\n\r\nJust as everybody in the anime says : \"Baka-Tora\" or \"Stupid Tora\". Harutora Tushimikado is really what the world calls stupid. It takes some time before he understands some things. What I like about his personality is that he's not afraid to take some risks. And also he wasn't very confident in the beginning , but because he knew that learning magic is the only way to save the people he loves, he didn't give up.  A very funny and determine main character, with some flaws that actually just made him so unique as he is.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nWell there is no much to talk about the animation. It is good just like in other anime shows too. The characters look good, the style is awesome and the landscapes and backgrounds are also well done. The thing that needs to be commended is the animation of the spells and the powers. Even the monsters look awesome. Nice job!\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nAt first glance, I didn't think that this anime would turn out this great. The only thing I have to criticize is that there is no release date for season 2. I really hope that the makers will make one. In short, Tokyo Ravens is a great story, with no plot holes but with some awesome reviews on the past. The background stories  are not boring, I liked them actually, and the romance, shounen, action mix was just epic. MAL scored it with 7,88 but I would give it  a 9,27. Almost a masterpiece, TOKYO RAVENS.",

            "content": "Excuse me in advance for there will be minor use of profane language; I do not intend to offend anyone or anything. However, given that the review guidelines only consider the use of \"crap\" every three words, profane, I think (...I hope) I will be all right.\r\nCrap...crap...goose!\r\nAlright. Attempted humour spree go!\r\nIt was the best of anime; it was the worst of anime.\r\nNow when I say that, I mean it. This is probably the most conflicted I've ever been about an anime. Half of me is like this was awesome, and half of me is like...what the hell is the other half of me talking about.\r\nAllin all, Tokyo Ravens is probably one of the most unoriginal, cliche, done to death animes this season. And frankly, I have no problem with that. Being original is nice, but you're always sitting on the fence because you never know how people will react. Being cliche is great because you know you already have an established fanbase for whatever overused plot line you're dishing out.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the very reason I started it was because I read the premise of the story (much more then the premise actually, I spoiled the whole plot for myself); anyways, I got to the part where a huge secret about the main character is revealed (I'm a sucker for these types of plots), and I figured, this is just what I was looking for! Tokyo Ravens has everything set up right, but after watching the series, I can only say that everything so magnificently flopped, rolled over, and died.\\n\\n\r\nThe perpetrator? Poor execution.\\n\\n\r\nSome people have complained that the first half of the anime was too slow. On the other hand, I found that the first half was paced perfectly. Great character introductions, great background explorations, great steady buildup...to a climax which never happened and a denouement which decided to switch places with where the climax should have been, just for kicks.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the anime was a complete mess. With all the buildup, you would have expected the second half to unravel all the tangles in the yarn laid out in the first half, but no. It's like they tossed the ball to a cat who started playing with it and ended up wrapping the whole house in yarn.\\n\\n\r\nHere's my very adolescent explanation: I remember watching the last six episodes, thinking \"SHIT'S GONNA GO DOWN NEXT EPISODE\", only to have no shit go down. And this continued until I finished the last episode, whereupon I felt extremely disappointed and empty inside. How is this possible you ask? Every single plot device/scene I was looking forward to was rushed, butchered, or omitted entirely. Stuff just started happening all over the place at the same time with minimal explanation. It made me totally lose track of characters and their personalities, philosophies, and motives - all the things that define them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you're wondering how I still ended up rating this an 8...despite all my complaints, I found Tokyo Ravens to be very addicting and enjoyable. I thought the magic system was really cool and the few fight scenes that existed were extremely noteworthy; definitely some of the better action scenes I've seen recently. On the art and sound front, I would say the series is near flawless. Even the story, I thought it was cliche, but great. My only complaint would be with the characters, who were (for the most part, few exceptions) so one-dimensional that it's amazing how they managed to keep the suspense going.\\n\\n\r\nThere were just so many things in Tokyo Ravens that I thought could have been done better. But alas, as I don't plan to take up the director's seat anytime soon, these aspirations will remain unrealized. Takaomi Kansaki probably did a better job than I could ever do anyways.",

Granted there was a lot more back story than some anime I have watched but I still felt like it was lacking a little.\\n\r\nThe ending, while it was good, ended very suddenly and was rather cliff hangery. To be honest it left a little room for a sequel but more often than not, a lot of them do and we never get one so I'm not holding any hopes just yet.\\n\r\nI guess another dislike I had is, well it did fell like it was something I'd seen before, it lacked a little originality and while I did enjoy it, it was rather similar to other anime in the same genre.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the anime but there were times I did consider dropping it, not so much because I didn't like it but because there were quite a few main arcs (if you can call them that) and I felt it dragged on little.\\n\r\nSaying this, It did work well as a 24 episode anime and I do not think it would have done so well being any shorter.\\n\\n\r\nSo this review is probably not helpful but thats not really why I write them so...

            "content": "Here's an easy review to sum up the strengths and weaknesses of Tokyo Ravens--SPOILER FREE for your enjoyment!\r\nOVERALL--\r\nTokyo Ravens takes about five episodes before it really finds its footing; however, once it does, this show progresses with a great pace that will keep viewers interested through all 24 episodes! The ending is slightly open to interpretation, but comes to a satisfying conclusion. It leaves the viewer ready to continue on with the characters into their next big adventure, while still bringing the current story arc to a close. Overall, a very enjoyable show and well worth the watch!\r\nMAGIC SYSTEM--\r\nA huge part of this anime isthe magic system, which presents some of the show's highest and lowest points. Tokyo Raven's magic system is never given clear cut rules or limitations, which may leave some viewers frustrated. However, this lack of definite limitations allows for some excellent fight scenes because the magic can be used is so many creative and varied ways. A highlight of the series is the magic battles, which are interesting and never repetitive; they almost never use the same trick twice!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS--\\n\r\nAt first, the characters may seem a little cookie-cutter, with some of the typical \"anime friend group\" cliches; however, the show is not limited by this because each of the mains ends up so gosh darn likable! The mains are believable, with enough backstory to give them depth.\\n\r\nThe cast of supporting characters is wide, which allows for a lot of interesting personalities. Unfortunately, for a show with only 24 episodes, I found the cast a little TOO wide to keep track of all the characters at some points. Despite this, the wide range of characters allows the show to build up an interesting motif examining the reality and meaning of trust. As a viewer, you are never quite sure who you can trust, which mirrors the struggles of the characters. This gave the story extra intrigue as allies split into factions, friends turn into opponents, and previous enemies unite as accomplices.\\n\\n\r\nART--\\n\r\nThe major flaw in the art is how starkly the CGI stands out against the traditional animation. The CGI is mainly used on the familiars in battle scenes, but I found it both jarring and distracting. Other than that, the art is fairly consistent throughout the show, with vivid colors, enjoyable character designs, and beautifully animated spell work.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND--\\n\r\nThe show presents a strong voice acting cast with bright sound editing and mixing, but falls short in musical composition. I didn't find either of the opening or ending themes memorable. Furthermore, the show did not make good use of background music, even though there were many instances where music could have provided a great boost to the emotion or energy of the scene. \\n\\n\r\nSUBS OR DUBS?\\n\r\nFinally, as a lover of both subs and dubs in different situations, (and having watched Tokyo Ravens in both), I recommend the subs on this one. I found the subs to be slightly better in their explanations of plot intricacies, and the Japanese voice actors to be better suited to the characters as I understood them.\\n\\n\r\nPROS--\\n\r\n+good pacing\\n\r\n+creative magic battles\\n\r\n+likable main characters\\n\r\n+visually appealing spell work\\n\r\n+strong Japanese voice cast\\n\\n\r\nCONS--\\n\r\n-slow and slightly confusing start\\n\r\n-lack of clear rules/limitations to magic\\n\r\n-some distracting CGI\\n\r\n-little to no effective background music\\n",

            "content": "OBSERVE : A score below 7 doesn't mean its bad, it means whatever that score originally is supposed to represent. Score five is mediocre. That means that you will still probably get some enjoyment out of it. \r\nRATING: 7.68 - Read rest of my review/rant to see my reasons why\r\n- - - - - - - - - \r\nAs many others have mentioned, this anime starts off quite weak with a rather non-unique setting, but then during its second act has a very, very exciting plot development that keeps you striving for more. Although unfortunately, there isn't anything more, and you are left with ahefty amount of new unanswered questions. \\n\\n\r\nStory & Plot - - -\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the anime starts off with giving a generic shounen vibe, and you can almost find all the shounen clich\u00e9s there are. For example; main character fails school but compensate for his intelligience with practical skills, there's the childhood friend, there is the ever so important promise from early childhood. A majority of the series takes place in high school setting. Also there is the glasses-guy, the big anime tiddies girl, the tsundere,  the friendship is magic and will rescue the day and so on and so on.\\n\r\nSo far it might not seem like  too much of a premise, but becuase of a fast introduction followed right up by action, drama and mystery, you the viewer is immediately invested in the series. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, during its first half of the story, it is somewhat underwhelming. Events occur, but there is a lack of character developement and story progression. It is almost like the first half of the series is dedicated to introduce the viewer to this fictional universe (unfortunately, there isn't too much interesting, a lot of generic shounen magic-stuff with  no real explanation to why things are like they are.) \\n\r\n It is not until at least after episode 14/15 things start to unravel itself and it starts to show some story heavy stuff. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's my point really. I just finished rewatching this anime for the second time, and previously having fond memories of this show, I was shocked. Halfway through the series it was nothing more than another mediocre, shounen-seasonal like anime. \\n\\n\r\n...Buuut then things start to happen. The plot picks up some good pace and a well thought story starts to unravel. The second half/ the last episodes make up for the previously dull arc. \\n\\n\r\nArt ~ ~ ~\\n\\n\r\nArt/style/animation is mediocre. Little attention to detail and no interesting backgrounds.  The CGI is really obnoxious, but.. sad but true, you get used to it, and it is used in moderation (except the first couple of epsiodes... Oh god my eyes). \\n\r\nChoreography is good. Not too many moving still-shots or \"guy's so fast he zaps past his opponent, and seconds later opponent falls over/is cut apart because for some reason there is a delay to the blow becuase guy is faster than goddamn light\". (Like it or not, but you can't deny it is bad/lazy animation technique).\\n\\n\r\nSound - - - \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is decent, not memorable though.  Though there is one especially nice piano melody which plays during sad/bittersweet moments. Unfortunately it gets kind of repetitive after 24 episodes. \\n\r\nSound design is fine, but again, not memorable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters ~ ~ ~\\n\\n\r\n At first the cast is not impressive at all. Main character follows typical shounen clich\u00e9s and the rest of the cast is- you guessed it, super generic. It's only a bit into the series each character start to develop into something interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some interesting characters with even more interesting development, but... Okay it feels like I am repeating myself so I'll just finish this and then get to my point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall rating : : :\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is generic, mediocre, and at first very predictable. In this wall of text I have repeatedly said those specific words, generic,unfortunately and mediocre. There is no coming away from that. Though, during the second act it starts going into a great direction with lots of interesting twists, new revelations and lots of character developement, only to end with a bad conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending isn't bad, but all suddenly there are all these new problems and you the viewer is filled with both old and new questions; Who is that? How is he their \"master\"? What the hell did she do towards the last episode? What is going on, and what the hell is going to happen next?! \\n\\n\r\nThere is no conclusion. They introduce way too many story heavy/interesting characters right in the end of the series. Real shame. \\n\r\n No questions are answered and when it finally starts to get reeaaally good, it just kind of ends. \\n\\n\r\nI found it very enjoyable, or rather, the finale of the series makes up for the otherwise dull and generic shounen anime you have seen too many times. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with this anime is that it ends with no conclusion, and it just teases you with the possibility of a sequel. Also it kind of states that \"oh no how is it going to end? You should probably read up on the maangaa!\" Goddamnit, I just wanted a finished anime. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict, Good to very good, but maybe not a priority choice of what to watch anime.  \\n",

I can understand the mechanics of the writing behind it, but its not satisfying at all.   The only time, imo, that a show should leave off like it did, is if there is a guarantee of a second season.  I understand it continues in the Light Novels, but I don't read LN's.\\n\\n\r\nI felt the need to warn all who dare enter this with certain expectations.  It's definitely not all bad, in fact most of it is very enjoyable.  I felt the pacing was a little off, but the over dramatization really killed it for me.  However, some people will love this sort of thing.  So in the end, i'll just say its certainly not everyone's cup of tea.",

Each character has their own secrets that is gradually brought to light for the viewer.  They all get to know each other better as they go through some comedic moments.   While the plot does seem very overused, which makes the story seem lacking...until episode 13.  That is where the plot picksup and shows that it can do something right.

            "content": "Tokyo Ravens Review:\r\nSometimes shows come around that are completely generic and average on paper, but are unusually fun to watch. Looking at my 6 score for this show, many of you may think I didn't think the show was good. But this couldn't be further from the truth. Tokyo Ravens wasn't groundbreaking, memorable, or brilliant. In fact, it was pretty a pretty generic fantasy action anime with romance elements which is why I withhold too high of a score. However, Tokyo Ravens is without a doubt a very enjoyable show. \r\nStory - 7.1:\r\nWhere Tokyo Ravens' story shines isn't through it's rather generic premise or predictableplot twists, but the solid pacing and backstories of the characters and the setting. The pacing of Tokyo Ravens is nearly flawless in my opinion, giving proper amount of air time to the intro, the time at school, and the more climactic parts at the end. The background of the setting is also very well realized and had me captivated with its mechanics. The lore of the world of Tokyo Ravens is also rich and actually significant when it comes to later events in the story. Yes, the overall story of a boy who gains powers teams up with his classmates to stop the bad guys has been told many times before, but the execution and care put into it all kept me caring from start to finish. Rarely were there moments that left me shaking my head in disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6.8:\\n\r\nFor the most part, the art in this show is great.... Until they decide to use CG. The character designs are good, and the non CG action scenes are well done. Everything is fluid and the varied locations display a wide array of colors and artstyles. However, when they decide to use CG for familiars in fight scenes, things break down. Sometimes CG is done well in Anime, but for the most part it feels out of place and really cuts into your immersion as a viewer. Without the use of CG, this score would have been higher because the visuals were good. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 6.3:\\n\r\nThere's not a whole lot to say about Tokyo Ravens in terms of the sound department. The voice acting was solid all around with a large cast of diverse voices. The OST was good and fit the show well. There weren't really many stand out songs however so I wouldn't say it was too far above average. I did enjoy the openings and endings especially the first ED. Really the sound aspect of this show was definitely good but didn't really stand out particularly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6.7:\\n\r\nNow, the characters in Tokyo Ravens are interesting for me. Because for the most part, the characters were just cookie cutter stereotypes. However, I found myself much more invested in the than I usually do for such one dimensional and predictable characters. This may just have been a personal thing, but who knows. A big plus of the cast of characters was just its pure size and variety. There was a large ensemble of good guys, bad guys, and characters that were in the Grey area of their intentions. None of the characters were necessarily weak, and a few were quite intriguing. The two main leads have a very interesting history and the interactions between characters rarely failed to be entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7.5:\\n\r\nTokyo Ravens was without a doubt, very enjoyable to watch. It had this nostalgic kind of feeling to it and exceded all my expectations going into it. The plot twists were well placed and at times shocking, and the array of humor, drama, and action was well mixed to create an all around very enjoyable show. I personally find it hard to keep watching a show on a weekly basis for months on end unless I really care about the characters and and entertained by the events in the show, and Tokyo Ravens resoundingly delivered in those departments. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6.88:\\n\r\nWhile it never really shined, Tokyo Ravens was still 100% worth the time to watch it. Keep in mind that a 6 in my books means \"good\", and if a 6.88 is any indication, this show was unquestionably good in my opinion. It isn't a caliber of a show that I would recommend to all, but if you are looking for an enjoyable generic action fantasy anime with romantic elements, look no further. \\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nA well executed anime that plays it safe, but was a pleasure to watch. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Solid job of executing its wide array of genres (action, fantasy, romance, comedy) \\n\r\n+ Large cast of characters (all of whom are bearable) \\n\r\n+ Lore/Backstory\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- CGI poorly used\\n\r\n- Predictable story\\n\r\n- Failure to stand out\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Tokyo Ravens, watch... \\n\r\nFate Stay Night\\n\r\nStrike the Blood\\n\\n\r\n6.88/10 - Good\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u00b4ll admit that I fell pretty stupid for putting this anime on hold for such a long time. As it started of with a meh and ended with a YEAH, this anime was surprisingly fun to watch.\r\nAs I started watching this anime, I had a feeling that the main character Harutora was going to be one of those boring mains to watch in the long run, but as I kept following the story, it became more and more interesting to follow this boring main and his friends. Taking on enemy after enemy, trying to become powerful shamans (exorcists) was only a fraction of what thestory was really focusing on. \\n\\n\r\nStill there are parts in the story that is halfheartedly explained, leaving you with a big question mark  as to what is really going on and why. They also seemed to overcomplicate the story, making it harder to get in \"The Zone\" when it comes to characters and scenery. Still the story has plenty of upsides to it. As it is an well though story with good plot twists and a great rhythm and backstory to it, this story leaves me in nothing but awe. \\n\\n\r\nThe art itself were also pretty good, fitting well in with the story and providing well expressed characters when it was needed. Some part were also a bit sloppy when it came to the art, but when it came to the fighting, the art were perfectly done in a way that fits perfectly with what I am looking for in a action anime. I was easily taken by the fighting scenery and style.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the sound goes, I have hardly much to say. The openings and the endings of the anime provides as beginnings and endings of the anime itself, making it easy for one to get right into the anime and the fighting without as great of a shock as what Ive seen other animes do. Following the story was no problem with such an intro to it. Yet I missed that little extra in the sounds, that little extra that leaves you with the impression \"Oh, shits about to go down now\" kinda sounds/music. Still it was fairly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nAs for characters I feel it could have been done a little better. The amount of history put into them, doesnt add up to the amount we are shown. I feel as if I know the teacher Ootomo better than Harutora and the rest. Even though there is given alot of history to them, I still have no clue as to what really happened when Harutora was younger or when anyone was, theres simply a lack of debts to them. I mean, isnt it weird that the story is mainly focused around this Tsuchimikado Yakou guy, and we hardly know shit about him or what happened to him when he was alive. Maybe they should have freed some room for a little backstory instead of providing us with small, unnecessary fillers.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I said all that, this show still provided me with a lot of enjoyment and fun, and as to the ending being an ending I prefer over any other, there was no major disappointments to this show (that i noticed). So dont do as me and put it on hold after 6 episodes, make sure to watch it trough to the end straight away so it doesnt get confusing. I highly recommend this anime to all you out there who hasnt watched it, and lets all pray for a Season 2 :)",

            "content": "-I'm going to skip the synopsis as you can go ahead and read that on your own - I'm strictly writing a review as to my reaction when watching Tokyo Ravens-\r\nTo be honest, when I first began watching this show I felt as though I was lacking originality, in both character and story. The originality wasn't so bad like 'I've seen it a million times' sort of deal, but It was interesting enough to make me want to watch the next episode. The characters seemed overdone and over the top, opening with the feisty chick friend of the male protagonist picking on him and hiscool and calm best friend. Even if it started out quite cliche, I still kept watching it, mostly for lack of other anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIt was worth it because this show had a lot more depth than meets the eye and gets better as it moves along.\\n\\n\r\nFor people who enjoy magic fantasy action anime, you will probably like this as it has a nice mix of all of those genres with interesting plot twists. \\n\\n\r\nThough most characters remain stagnant throughout the anime, at least half of them have some sort of basic development, be it mind set, or physical ability. What bothered me the most about this anime's characters though is how most characters pick on the main protagonist. The anime already outlines him as 'dumb' and 'having a major lack of talent' so much so you wonder why he's even the main character . His interactions with other characters tend to end or start out with them calling him 'baka-tora', and describing how pathetic he really is. Even though he proves himself more than once to the gang, they still proceed to stick with that nick name. As usual, he is a typical shounen character that tries his best, despite his obvious lack in talent. The anime later drops these undertones though, making it A LOT more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe music I found to be quite nice, the opening and ending were okay, not bad but not my favorite anime openings. The music during the anime is very nice, giving it a nice sorta mystic aura, adding a lot more epicness to the show. Without the music, I swear the scenes would feel a lot less intense.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is a nice mix of magic and action, though it might not be the most original story ever written. Its enjoyable enough to keep watching. It may not be one of your favorite animes, but if you watched all the anime there is and happen to come across Tokyo Raven's, its pretty good, and you'll like it better towards the end so i recommend not judging it until you get at least half way.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I wouldn't consider it my favorite show, I did enjoy watching it. Its not one of my most memorable animes, but you definitely wont be wasting time.",

            "content": "There\u2019s a saying that goes something like this: \u201ctwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right\u201d. In Tokyo Ravens, this doesn\u2019t apply as onmyouji magic is accepted by society as a form of dealing with spirits and apparitions in general. The show builds itself with the basic concepts and principles of a modern fantasy involving characters dealing with onmyouji, otherworldy beings that have been causing trouble in Japan. While most anime involving magic is forbidden, Tokyo Ravens takes the liberty to accept it as a form of art. Thus begins the adventurous tale of Harutora Tsuchimikado as he learns the truth about the world he lives in.\r\nTokyoRavens is an animated series based off the light novels of the same name written by Kohei Azano. It\u2019s easy to notice quickly that the show is colored with modern fantasy themes such as the shrines and stylistic clothes that our characters wear. There\u2019s also no doubt that the show has potential with its concepts. But what\u2019s more important is the execution. After all, Harutora is labeled more as babyface with little skill in onmyouji magic. He has potential and Tokyo Ravens explores it in various aspects. What Tokyo Ravens went wrong in this part is its execution that becomes blend and sometimes insufferable. But despite this, the show itself does handle its structural set up in a tolerable fashion with credibility. \\n\\n\r\nTake the series\u2019s story as a modern fantasy with the magic, curses, and spells in an all-you-can-eat buffet. There\u2019s no special appetizer because everything is conventional and expected in terms of its general set up. The first few episodes establishes the premise and delivers itself in its traditional fashion. We meet Harutora and his friends whom doesn\u2019t seem so different from folks you see from our society. However, realize there are abnormal beings that exists in their world. There\u2019s a lot of information to absorb in the beginning, in ways that seems to cloud the story until we meet some antagonists. It also becomes more and more clich\u00e9d with the characters involving a typical childhood friend named Natsume that comes to visit, the flashy fireworks in the sky with a misunderstanding, and mecha-like gadgets popping out as adversaries because they look flashy and demonstrates a lethal presentation of modern fantasy. While all is fine when presented in the right fashion, Tokyo Ravens introduces everything together all at once that feels rushed. More than that, there\u2019s also predictable plot twists that at times becomes bizarre and lands nowhere with Harutora\u2019s characterization.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, there\u2019s quite the diversity. Thankfully, none of them sits in the background but instead get their spotlights, some even more so than our main protagonist. Still, that isn\u2019t exactly a gift to accept so easily because Tokyo Ravens only develops them on a substantial level. Natsume for instance never really changes with her time on the show. She is portrayed as an innocent girl who is willing to protect others. There\u2019s obvious affections coming from her towards Harutora despite the latter being oblivious to her some of her words and advances. To make matters worse, most of the school they attend are under the belief that she is a guy. This is where the silliness comes into play with their \u201cyaoi relationship\u201d. As quirky as it sounds, the series actually doesn\u2019t hide this as they play on this trope many times with almost the entire female student body believing it as reality. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters in the series serves as the support for Harutora\u2019s development but most of them are more like friends to him rather than a coach. They offer him advice, training sessions, and details to unlock his potential. Unfortunately, Harutora is presented as an irrational man when it comes to textbooks and learning. He even earned the nickname \u2018Bakatora\u2019 which is a played as a joke as baka translates to \u2018idiot\u2019 by Japanese standards. At the same time, we do witness Harutora become stronger through experiences and determination to protect others. There\u2019s a sense of hope when he really puts effort or when the people close to him are in danger. It\u2019s there that we see Harutora shines by moments of his selflessness. Other times though, Harutora is hard to get attached to for his abilities and dull personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe series itself also follows sequential arc style in presenting stories and characters. Like I mentioned previously, almost every main character gets their spotlight whether you\u2019re former delinquent (Tojo), the youngest of the Twelve Generals (Suzuka), a shikigami (Kon), or heir of a famous family (Kyoko). Speaking of the Twelve Generals, the series presents themselves as a testimony of strength. Each of them possesses their own unique abilities that makes them both fear and respected. Unfortunately, because the show itself focuses on more of the main characters, they lose focus and only gets their chance to shine when the action calls for it. The action itself also can be a mixed bag. The usage of CGI and magic at the same time is certainly an odd mix. It almost feels like the show is running on an engine with a different set of gears. However, the show does well with its mechanics in terms of explanation. Every episode contains a little bit of explaining whether it\u2019s the backgrounds or just in general of what\u2019s there. Various terminologies such as onmyouji, shikigami, as well as events are usually easily understandable with attention. Furthermore, the term raven is symbolic for death (foreshadowing in the beginning) and matches perfectly with its presentation of magic linked to Shamanism. It could also be something refreshing to watch as it sometimes brings that fantasy taste in a way you might not get used to.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes Tokyo Ravens hard to get used though might be the asinine comedy that tends to be an overused way of delivery. This includes but not limited to Harutora being an accidental pervert, Suzuka\u2019s fake relationship with Harutora, and Kon\u2019s obsessiveness with her master. It also uses cheesy lines with little favor that often lacks sense. Natsume\u2019s cross-dressing makes her a subject of attraction for girls at the academy they attend. It spells out laughter in the wrong way because the misunderstandings should be so obvious. Really, does Natsume look that much like a guy with her fragile face and long hair? Some of the characters\u2019 personalities are also hard to figure out such as Suzuka and her manipulative actions. Kon\u2019s personality changes almost every episode according to what circumstance she is and whom she is with. Tenma, a classmate of Harutora, also seems to be in the background most of the time and plays almost no significant role. While the show doesn\u2019t explicitly present fan service or the typical beach episode, Tokyo Ravens still reveals more skin than it should thanks to mostly Harutora\u2019s stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork remains standard on most parts for Tokyo Ravens. It is noticeable that 8bit is also in charge of producing both Infinite Stratos 2 and Walkure Romanze at the same while this show is also airing. But for judging its animation, Tokyo Ravens does it well only in terms of credibility. Supernatural familiars are believable with their designs while backgrounds reflects the modern fantasy style that it should be. Unfortunately, most of the characters stands out as blend. Kon is perhaps the most noticeable character because of her animalistic features. Suzuka on the other hand has bits of fan service in her design while Natsume\u2019s cross-dressing literally covers almost every inch of her body besides her face. The strange usage of CGI will take time to get accustomed to. At several times, I almost thought this had mecha-esque concepts.  \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack wise, Tokyo Ravens surprisingly works out well. While Harutora\u2019s voice is nothing special, there\u2019s something noticeable about its OST with the way that fuses fantasy elements with reality. Not only that but the OP song \u201cX-encounter\u201d by Maon Kurosaki had an intense beat with bits of foreshadowing. Most of the characters\u2019 voices also fits well that matches each scene. In later episodes, some of the characters\u2019 voices also convey emotions well through their dialogues that almost seems realistic despite the show having fantasy elements.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ravens is nowhere close to a masterpiece but neither is it an abomination. I guess in most ways, it takes time to get used to for its style of fantasy. The series offers a diverse cast of characters that the audience might favor. Unfortunately, their personalities are hard to describe and their characterization are limited. The story itself also takes time to get used to with every arc that has some sort of message or morality. Whether you get that message might feel different for everyone. For me though, Tokyo Ravens is just another standard series of modern fantasy that depicts the life of young man with much to learn. \\n",

            "content": "There's a certain feeling of mediocrity that arises from simply looking at Tokyo Ravens. It doesn't really look like anything new, innovative, or fresh. Despite its generic appearance Tokyo Ravens still manages to do what it's supposed to: entertain. \r\nAs far as story goes, there really isn't much of an intricate, deep, or immersive plot. The story is pretty sub par for a good amount of the first half, adhering to countless generic cliches like the childhood friend promise, amnesia, and what have you. Although it gets better during the second half, it's still not anything amazing. The key aspects that make the second halftake flight and become more enjoyable to watch is that there are actually Onmyo spell battles, familiar battles, the plot finally breaks out of its run-of-the-mill school life trope, and the concept of the shaman society is fleshed out a bit more. With all of that being said, it's awfully apparent that the adaption of Tokyo Ravens from the light novel to the animation is fairly bad. There are countless instances where moments, events, and key turning points in the story felt extremely underdeveloped, unexplained, rushed, or skipped over. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of Tokyo Ravens seemed pretty average, if not below average, in most cases. Most animes nowadays at least bring decent art and animation to the table, but that doesn't appear to be the case with Tokyo Ravens. The art isn't all that great and animations can feel stiff at times. Overall, the art and animation felt a bit behind the times in comparison to many of its visual contemporaries. The sound criteria was fairly average. There's nothing that stands out, but it's not bad. \\n\\n\r\nI think it's become pretty standard in anime for the male MC to be a fool and dense for a majority of the series. Unfortunately for the audience, Tokyo Ravens falls victim to this generalized male lead personality. Harutora, along with most of the other characters, are extremely generic and cliche. If you've watched a good handful of anime you can recognize most of the character tropes that are used here. Childhood friend blossoms into friendship(s) after many years? Preposterous. There are a few interesting characters amongst the Divine Generals, but they get far too little screen time to make much of an impact. There isn't much character development and most of the characters retain their original personalities throughout the series. Supporting characters often felt more interesting and almost as equally developed as main characters and that's saying a lot.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are many aspects about Tokyo Ravens that are extremely ordinary and plain, it still did a fair job of at least keeping me entertained. There are certain instances when watching average is entertaining. This is one of those times.",

            "content": "I generally try to have an open mind when it comes to anime, and when I start a new series I attempt to take as few preconceptions into it as possible. That said, when I started Tokyo Ravens I had already pretty much given up on it. The promotional artwork and brief synopsis I read, while somewhat interesting, gave me the vague impression of a mediocre anime with throwaway characters and a wasted chance at a good plot. I write this review in an attempt to dispel those misconceptions in anyone else.\r\nTokyo Ravens, an anime with a plot initially not too unfamiliar involving magic usersin modern-day Japan, starts off rather slowly and doesn't promise much. However, after just a few episodes, the tempo changes rapidly and soon a well-thought-out, refreshingly unique story begins to develop. What originally seems like a straightforward plot becomes increasingly deep, with enough twists to keep you wondering from one episode to the next who's really the good guy. Add to that a major plot twist that completely changes the direction of the show, and you get a very satisfying, entertaining story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was really the only slightly detracting feature of the show for me, as it was close to being sub-par, but at times where it really mattered the animation was good enough to not take away from the drama of the moment. Both the voice acting and the soundtrack were done well, the latter having moments where it went from being sufficient to excellent, and the over-all delivery was handled very well.\\n\\n\r\nNow to address my favorite aspect of the show: the side characters. Something that consistently annoys me about many anime is the one-dimensional supporting characters that are often present. Whether they're there to simply fill the stereotypical niches, to be killed off for the sake of adding drama, or whatever role they're given, side characters in many anime are simply unnecessary. Their lack of presence, importance, and screen time makes them feel hollow when compared to the main character/characters. Tokyo Ravens, however, had a well-rounded cast of supporting characters that actually played important roles in the story, and had distinct personalities tempered by whatever problems they had/things they had experienced. Beyond the main character's \"party\", the other characters in the series felt very real in the way they were presented. Rather than trying to include a ton of other characters and explain their every facet, they were presented at face value. Many of their motivations/convictions remained unclear, which, realistically, would be the case in a conflict on the scale of the one in Tokyo Ravens. Every character in the series felt like they weren't written into the story to make some specific part of it move forward, but were first and foremost members of Tokyo Raven's universe who participated in the story on an equal level with the characters who got more screen-time. That gave the series a very realistic feel to me, something I don't often get in comparable anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say that Tokyo Ravens is a good, well-written anime that may be overlooked by many people (such as myself) that would think it's just another harem-ish shounen. I would recommend giving it try, and letting it prove or disprove that preconception itself.",

The openings were pretty impactful and the endings simply give a soothing yet slow feel which I liked it. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, this would be one of the points where I feel it brings down the score just a tad bit. The main character, Hakutora, isn't very perceptive at the start which I would say was his flaw.\\n\r\nSecondly, I personally feel Toji started off well in the series but I feel and would have liked if he could be given more attention to make him a stronger supporting character due to his past, having gone through a painful experience.\\n\\n\r\nI personally felt that Othomo gave the biggest impact to how the story transitioned and flowed and how he stuck to people who he wished to protect.

First half can be lacking in actual story and action but it was justified by the second half. The characters are created well but development seems rushed sometimes. Drama in Tokyo Ravens is basically the story\u2019s weakest point. A good example of this is when Tenma was guilty in the Doumanarc, where he was blaming himself for letting Douman invade the school but after a minute or two, he was not guilty anymore. The drama is too unbalanced and too rushed to earn the emotional weight Tenma feels. The visuals and animation are fine but the CGI can be sometimes cringe-worthy. Music is nice but nothing special\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tokyo Ravens is enjoyable and entertaining but it isn\u2019t ambitious enough to put a higher score",

            "content": "When I first heard of Tokyo Ravens from my friend, I was like OMG! I'm so going to watch it. But then, my expectations of this show died as the series progress. I was practically lost and confused as the series moved along which is something I don't like. Tokyo Ravens is not bad, but it's not good either. It is mediocre at best.  \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThis show is about a teenage guy named Harutora who can't see spiritual spirits like his family. Then he met his childhood friend and the Onmyoji drama starts from there. Afterwards he moved to Tokyo and attended a schoolto hone his Onmyoji skills. This where the plot started to fall apart. During the few episodes of the series, it started off with action, explosion, and magic. However, instead of continuing the action, the plot decided to throw a long laid back school life series. It's a nice touch to show their school life and how normal teenagers interact but there's too much. Most of it doesn't push the story forward. It is just there to create humor and well, meaningless dragging of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThen here comes the part where I want to smack my head against the wall. Tokyo Ravens has a lot of CONFUSION/PLOT HOLES. When watching this series, I keep having questions in my head. What happen to Natsume? What are phases? What's Suzu's purpose? How can you conjure up spiritual disasters? CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS TO ME?! *sigh* I think the producers needs to execute this series better... \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are good points as well. The action and fight scenes were well done. The positioning of the romance is also well done. They kept me slightly interested towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of the end, the ending of Tokyo Ravens is unsatisfying. It is like they drop another big plot hole on top of the old one without fixing it. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the mediocre and confusing plot, the art in Tokyo Ravens is AMAZING. The colors and brightness are so beautiful. Even though there are some *cough* problematic CGIs, I'm not the type of person to judge the quality of it. All CGIs to me look the same so yeah...\\n\\n\r\nOverall the art in Tokyo Ravens is beautiful. Period.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like the first opening of Tokyo Ravens. It brings out the hidden darkness of the series. The song also fits with the ongoing action. The second opening is a little bland for me. It doesn't really bring out the darkness of the series anymore. Instead, it beings out well, action/adventure.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOh boy. Here comes my rant. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters that there are WAY TOO MANY! There's too many characters to keep up with. If there's too many characters, it leaves little room for the other characters to shine *cough* main character Harutora *cough*. It also left me the impression of what the hell is his or her purpose in this story. Then there's one part of the show where they introduced this side character but he didn't appear for like ten episodes but then appeared during the end, claiming that he has an important role to serve. I completely forgot his name and who he is. This shows that they should lessen the characters or give them enough screen time in order to make them more memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThen as for the main cast, I feel like their action in this story is minimal. Harutora has not taken action until towards the end of the story, which is kind of sad. Heck, even the side characters does more actions than him. The side characters help move the plot along until it's time for Harutora to shine. However, the other main characters serve their purpose in this story well. They played their part in the right time and place. But, there's little character development form them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite all those negative comments I said about this series, I actually enjoyed it till the end. The humor made me laugh a couple of times and the fight scenes were spectacular. If only the series explain all those plot holes and give some spotlights to some characters, then it will be even more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ravens has its ups and downs, but it is an enjoyable show. It's just that the confusion and plot holes kill the show for me. I feel like this show needs a season two to explain all those unanswered questions. But that's all in the near future. So if you're a person who is indifferent to plot holes and likes a story about magic, Onmyojis, and romance, then this is a show for you. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Expectations are scary...They can greatly influence someone's opinion on a show! If going into it with really high expectations, it can end up being way more disappointing! If you go into it with really low expectations, you might even end up enjoying it! I personally always try to watch with an open mind and try to not get hyped for a show too much so I can still enjoy it! For this particular show though, it is the exact opposite of my example earlier! This show did not end up being way worse than I had expected but the other way around! Ladies andGentlemen, today's topic shall be the Underdog of the Spring and Fall Season, Tokyo Ravens!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story of Tokyo Ravens takes place in an alternate universe, that is rather similar to ours, except for the fact that there exist spirits and familiars. In this world there also exist Exorcists, who learn how to handle those spirits. They learn to summon them, exorcise them and even how to fight using them, for the sake of preventing a spiritual disaster. The main character is Tsuchimikado Harutora, a teenage boy that is part of the branch family of one of the most popular Onmiyou-Exorcist families in Japan. However, other than most others in his families, Harutora is not able to see Spiritual Power and thus can't become an Onmiyou-Exorcist like most others he knows. That's why he has lived a rather quite life up until now, simply hanging out with his friends Hokuto and Touji. That is, until he meets his old childhood friend from the main family, Tsuchimikado Natsume!\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Setting for Tokyo Ravens is rather interesting and even though this kind of supernatural thing is not really uncommon anymore, I do really enjoy those kind of shows! What Tokyo Ravens does really well is taking what it is given and turning it into something good! The show is really good at world building! Almost too good I would like to say...While the world is really well explained and it's potential is used really well, that has a certain price attached to it! The show takes way too much time fleshing out the world, that it could have spent on it's characters or bringing it's story forward. Of course this is not necessarily a bad thing, as this makes the second half even more enjoyable due to the really well explained world, but the first half falls flat due to this! The characters are uninteresting, the pacing is all over the place while it is still enjoyable, the first half of the show is mediocre at best. However the show does pick up quite nicely around half of the show! With the first really big fight starting, the show finally shows it's scale and just how badass it can be! From there on it seems as if I was watching a completely different show, as basically all the pacing problems get solved, the viewer is finally able to really get attached to the characters and the plot twists have a lot more impact that they used to have! Tokyo Ravens second half was one of the most surprising things that happened to me in this winter season and it even included one of the best episodes of this entire season! It got me surprisingly emotional, something that I wouldn't have expected from this show as well! However there is one thing that I am not completely content with and that would be the ending! The ending for Tokyo Ravens itself was rather good and did leave a lasting impression, however it did not quite end the way I wanted it to end! The ending doesn't really give any sense of closure and since there is only 10 Light Novels as of now, of which 9 got adapted in this TV Anime, there probably won't be any more too soon! However hope dies last and maybe we will end up having a second season at some point in time...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe Characters for Tokyo Ravens mostly suffer from the same problem that I mentioned in the story, the first half! The characters I would argue, while still being the best part of the first half, aren't really well fleshed out! While the interactions are quite well written and I have to say that the more quite Slice of Life moments of the show definitely were my favourite parts of the beginning episodes, the characters don't seem to develop at all! It kind of plays out like Index, just not as bad!\\n\r\nHarutora at first is your generic Light Novel Main protagonist, that stands up for his friends and doesn't have much of a personality except that, but just as the story, Harutora's character gets a lot better halfway through the series. While I can't really reveal too much about that, due to spoilers, all I can say is that his character got a lot more conflicted later on. The second character to talk about is Tsuchimikado Natsume. She is the daughter of the Tsuchimikado Main family and as such has to go to the Onmiyouji-Acadamy in Tokyo, meaning she lives far away from her home. She also happens to be Harutora's Childhood friend and also due to the family\u2019s tradition has to go to school pretending to be male. She is a rather quite character at first, but soon turns out to be pretty strong herself as she is really good at judging a situation and acting in the appropriate way. If I were to go over the rest of the characters in detail now, this Review would probably just take way too long, so let me just say really quick, that most of the characters are rather interesting to watch. They may neither be the most original characters of all time, nor the most well written, but the show certainly has a good enough cast to be enjoyable! The only other thing that kind of bothers me, is that while the Slice of Life character interactions seem to be really interesting at first, they get a little more generic later on. That may be caused by the show not really having that many Slice of Life moments anymore, but it still is something that bothers me. The longer you watch the Anime the easier it is to get attached to everyone. The Anime also has a huge cast of Side characters, that are all somewhat interesting and that I would love to see more about. However the Size of the cast itself prohibits the Anime from digging deeper into them. All in all the characters are flawed but likeable. It doesn't make the show a lot worse, but they don't really do a lot to make it better either.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWith the OST being done by Maiko Iuchi, the same person that did the Soundtrack to shows like Railgun, the OST was sure to be somewhat good. While it was not a masterpiece and nothing I would listen to outside of the show, it perfectly fit the show it was attached to. It mostly consists of quiet Piano and Violin pieces, mixed with some rather intense fighting themes. My personal favourite at this point is the track \"Dairenji Suzuka\", which plays every time Suzuka gets on screen in the early stages of the show, as the music makes her entrance really badass and fits her attitude perfectly!\\n\\n\r\nFor the Openings, both are rather good. Same as with the OST, they are not absolutely amazing and unskippable, but they set the tone for the show quiet nicely. While most people like the first Opening better, I personally do enjoy the second one just as much and honestly couldn't decide which one of the two were better. However, the animation for Opening Number 1 is a lot more interesting and the Direction does look a lot better! That said, the second one by no means looks bad, the first one just looks better! For the endings it basically is the same, while I did not like the first ending as much, the second ending ended up being my favourite song of the show!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nTokyo Ravens has been produced by 8bit, the same company that also did Infinite Stratos and Aquarion Evol and has been directed by Takaoki Kamasaki, the director of \"Is this a Zombie?\". The Animation for the show is average at best. It's not really fluent and doesn't really have anything eyecatching about it. It is not abysmal, but it certainly is not good! I feel like the bad animation kind of makes the show a little less badass than it should have been and it really does not do a good job at complimenting the show! Another huge fault with the Animation of this show, is the CGI. It looks really out of place and honestly is some of the worst I have seen in quite a while. It is mostly used for some of the familiars and it really is painfully obvious.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ravens has been the Underdog of the season and by far the most surprising one to me in a while! The show has a good amount of action, likeable characters and a well paced story. In the second half that is! The show has huge problems at the beginning, but does solve them halfway through it's run. It may start off as a rather boring show, but the later parts are definitely worth standing through the first episodes! I would definitely recommend it to basically anyone that is into Supernatural and Fantasy Anime.",

            "content": "*This Review Contains Spoilers*\r\nWell then, that was a bitter sweet ending, so the anime has ended and quite frankly, I was part ecstatic but also part dissapointed as to how this 24 anime has come about, so I'm just gonna get down to the point, ORDER!!!!!\r\nStory and enjoyment: Good 7.\r\nOk, it might be just your typical good vs evil run of the mill plot, where magic was involved. But unlike the typical run of the mill kinda thing, this has has romance that involves an incest where it was among cousins and it has a lot of suspenses as to how each climax comes aboutpertaining to the spiritual disasters kind of scenario. However, the whole plot was all about Harutora and Natsume.....well, it maybe overhyped, but then again seeing Natsume's dedication towards Harutora basically makes this story plot good.......enough, to be enjoyed ORDER!!!!!  \\n\\n\r\nArt and  character: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nOk, at first I don't understand as to why Natsume has to dress up like a guy in school, until it was reveled as to why. But pertaining to the school uniform and the divine generals attire....well, let's discuss the school uniform, it was too fancy to say the least, but it so cool on Kyouko, the guys school uniform, eeeeh its just too late 60's retro to say the least, but it looks good on Toji. Now I gave it such rating because despite of the fanciness, it kinda looks good on some of the character's. Natsume, on the other hand, makes her hair a give away that she is a girl despite of being in s boy's uniform, however in this anime, the characters role has it to over look it, which I have to say make's it rather stupid. About the adults in this anime....well pretty typical of them to be in business attire, but I'd never understand as to why Kon has to be this chibi familiar when she could have sport an adult look, there also the divine general Reji, that at one point I could have forgiven if he stayed on as a dark protagonist, but since there is the part where he has to be the antagonist makes me wish that he should have died. Now, I gave this anime's art and character such score was because at one point one would have like them, but in another point one would also despises them as well, especially when the antagonist whom we thought where the good guys are actually the ones who wanted to revived the Yukon inside of Harutora. As to Harutora, he does play as a typical oblivious guy at one point, but then he becomes this mature guy in the end and I kinda hate to see that we won't probably see as to what is next , now that the Yukon inside of him has awaken, well probably in the manga we will see, but I'm yet to get started on it, ORDER!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nNo comment for this part, ORDER!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nBecause we were left with a bitter sweet ending where the so called Taizan Fukun Ritual was able to be performed by Harutora on Natsume, but it was only half successful and something sort of whatsoever happened to Harutora where I wish I know what the fuck it is, so overall what we have is a glass that it either half full and half empty kinda of thing where I went for the half empty part. DISORDER!!!!!!!!! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ah, surprises. Don't we all love them? Whether good or bad, they always add something in our life - something that spices it up and moves it out of the monotone stillness we are ever so used to.\r\nGood surprises are common, and usually with very little significance attached to them. However, a slight surprise can put a smile on your face and leave you in awe of our large world. \r\nWhen I first started watching this series, I expected a typical shouen that would keep me entertained for a while. I really liked the magic system present in this show, along with its impeccable execution.This is why I kept watching, despite lowering my rating to 6/10 during the first half, and dismissing it as your average shouen, with no real content or anything memorable...\\n\r\nThis however, slowly changed during the second half. Things started to pick up their pace quickly and kept me watching, sitting on the edge of my seat. The second half of this show saved it, and made it worth the watch in every way possible. This show let me enjoy myself in a way I haven't for a long time now, and I can reassuringly say that it was one of the best \"feeling packed\" shows I've ever watched. \\n\\n\r\nRead on to see my views on the characters, sound, animation, story and the overall \"feel\" of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the story of this show is nothing spectacular. In essence, it is about a person who is supposed to be the incarnation of a military prodigy - nothing new, and it has been done before.\\n\r\nHowever, the way it is executed in the show makes for a feeling packed ride that is very memorable. It's hard to say more without spoiling so I'll just end my opinion with this:\\n\\n\r\n\"A slightly generic story turned interesting and further redeemed by avoidance of typical shouen moments.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow that the story is out of the way, I'm free to elaborate freely on every other aspect of the show without worrying about spoilers :) \\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show was nothing short of amazing. The character designs felt fresh and fit the characters' personalities perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nApart from this, the effect design for the various spells used by the characters were literally spot on. From the growing roots, to the raging fire and instantaneous flowing rivers, the mood and feel of the spells was completely captured and portrayed to the viewers perfectly. \\n\r\nYou would never look at the screen and say to yourself \"wow, for talking so much that sure is a weak looking spell\". Even the simple \"paper\" spells seem to be executed well, it's as if the \"paper\" is given command and as a living being is executing it.\\n\\n\r\nThe use of CG might be off-turning for people, but I personally didn't mind it. The only use of CG was for animating Machine - like beings, which fit perfectly well. Similarly to how Berserker was incorporated in to Fate/zero, the CG doesn't make you feel like anything is out of place.\\n\r\nPersonally, watching traditionally animated robots is a bit weird to me, as no matter how hard you try it's near impossible to achieve the feeling of machinery without putting too much time in to it.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing I feel obliged to mention, is the backgrounds. They were absolutely BREATHTAKING and I would even compare them to kara no kyoukai. There was absolutely no scene with a dull background with a deficiency of details... My eyes always had places to look at to notice all of the details and, honestly, it was a pleasure to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10+\\n\\n\r\nThis is largely personal preference, but the sound completely captivated me. I always felt as if the sound fit the scenes perfectly, from the abstract whistling sound when Suzuka first appeared to the catchy poprock-esque themes present in the battles. \\n\r\nSometimes there was pure silence, and it was appropriate for the situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a great job imo, and the voices never felt out of place. This added to my immersion in the show and helped me relate to the characters in many ways. The only voice that slightly bothered me was the voice of Kyouko's father, but that's a minor \"flaw\" based purely on taste.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings gave you a decent taste of the show, and the endings did well to close off the feeling packed rides and get you excited for the future events.\\n\\n\r\nAs I'm writing this, I'm listening to various tracks from the show and I'm enjoying them fully! ^_^\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show had a fairly large cast of characters, and even if all of them weren't fully developed, they still had their progression and enough time to shine.\\n\r\nTo add on to this, none of the characters fit a certain stereotype and no character was annoying, irritating or just plain out badly written. In essence what I'm trying to say is that all the characters were bearable and worked as a whole really, really well.\\n\\n\r\nA few honorable mentions I personally really liked were:\\n\\n\r\nOur main character, your typical shouen hot head (kind of) who developed so much, even before the miraculous \"power up\". Also, he had a high level of maturity which is nowhere to be seen in your usual shouen main character.\\n\\n\r\nThe homeroom teacher, though I can't explain why due to spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nKyouko, for being a mature friend and her adult like behaviour in the (emotionally) intense situations and times where a typical character would've just cried dramatically.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume, for trying her hardest and her bravery. Also what I said about Kyouko.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuka, for her gradual development and evolution in to a normal girl...\\n\\n\r\nI really could mention so many here since all of them (well, with SOME exceptions) were special in their own way, kudos to the writer for coming up with these characters and designing them in a realistic way without slapping a bunch of stereotypes on to them.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie, I enjoyed this anime much, much more than I thought I would and I feel confident enough to recommend it to anyone reading this review!\\n\r\nThis anime just made me feel excited, didn't leave me sad or mad about certain parts of the ending, didn't leave a bittersweet taste in my mouth and never made me facepalm at certain events.\\n\r\nI laughed, I felt sad for characters at times, felt happy for them at other times and was cheering and watching in awe as the show unraveled. \\n\r\nI truly had fun watching it, and simply because of this reason I believe it to be a gem in the rough that needs to be discovered by everyone out there! \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I loved this anime, it pains me to say that it had a fair share of flaws, mostly present in the first half... The critic in me (assuming I went out and pointed out every little flaw and didn't factory enjoyment and immersion whatsoever) would say the score of this show is hovering around 6.5/10, however factoring in the fun and enjoyment, the lovable cast, the amazing art and music.. I feel as it's deserving of a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my mixed feelings on this, I've decided it's a safe bet to rate the show as 8/10 which I figure most people can agree on.\\n\r\nIt's not a masterpiece, it's not a one of a kind show... but it's good and nobody can deny that. It's simply that, good and there is no other way for me to explain it.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know what to recommend to you if you liked this show, apart from maybe Kara no Kyoukai or Fate/Zero due to the similar approach to the magic systems.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of the music of this show, I'd point you towards the To Aru series.\\n\\n\r\nI believe no other show really manages to achieve the \"feel\" of this show, which is why I can't truly recommend something.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT:\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't watch this show, you won't be missing out on the masterpiece of the year. You will be, however, missing out on a lot of potential fun that might just brighten up your day.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ravens is often described as a prototypical high-school fantasy style anime. While the description is accurate, it is far and away better than most of the stereotypical high-school fantasy anime that are rolled off the factory line every year. Tokyo Ravens does an outstanding job creating a universe in which you feel fully connected to both the past, present and future of many of the characters and their world. Although I do not do much reading of manga or light novels, I will be pick up the Tokyo Ravens light novel where the anime left off as the anime leaves little closure.\r\n{Story} - Easilyone of the highlights of Tokyo Ravens, the story is well developed and cohesive throughout the anime. Set in an alternate universe of post-world war II filled with magic, it comes with a few surprising twists and turns. The story is filled with hits of romance, action and fantasy and they all come together to form a story that will have you craving more once it comes to an end.\\n\\n\r\n{Art} - As with many anime that make use of magic, Tokyo Ravens is gorgeous. Top notch visual graphics are used throughout the anime and they really come to the forefront in the final episodes.\\n\\n\r\n{Sound} - As with the visuals, Tokyo Ravens had an excellent audio profile. The anime made excellent use of background music in both emotional and action scenes that never distracted you from the focus point but very much created a beautiful atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\n{Character} - Along with the story, I consider character development to be one of the most important aspects of an anime. Tokyo Ravens did not disappoint. While the anime makes use of quite a few central characters, they're all given fleshed out identities and evolve over the anime. Each character will take turns surprising you and showing why they are as important to the anime as the next character. Unlike many anime, this anime will connect you to characters from the first episode and will leave you wanting to know their future once the anime ends.\\n\\n\r\n{Enjoyment} - Quite frankly, I enjoyed this anime much more than I expected. I binge-watched the entire thing in one day and I do not regret it for a moment. I was surprised when reading other reviews that people found it average and just another fantasy anime - I found it to be head and shoulders above much of the average shows that the anime machine sends out these days. \\n\\n\r\n{Overall} - Overall I gave this anime a 9/10. Much higher than the MAL average but fully deserving of more recognition. I believe Tokyo Ravens is extremely underrated and looked over. With an excellent story and character development along with immersive visuals and audio - this anime needs to be watched.",

            "content": "I've loved magic since the time I was a child. I don't know why but I always dreamed of having some cool powers, being able to cast spells etc. That's the reason I, for instance, love Harry Potter, Avatar, I used to love Winx, and now I came across an awesome anime that is also about magic. This time, as promised, I have for you Tokyo Ravens. \r\n Plot and Storyline\r\nIn the beginning of this story we have the main character Harutora, a boy born in the prestigious Onmyoji (Magic) family Tsuchimikado. Although born in such a family he still isn't able to see \"spiritenergy\", meaning he is not able to use magic. Or he wasn't able until he met his childhood friend Natsume, who is also the heir to the main Tsuchimikado family. After the accident with one of the Twelve Divine Generals (first class Onmyoji) Harutora decides to become Natsume's familiar (protector).*(Just as a little add, the Twelve Divine or Heavenly Generals exist in the Japanese belief as the protectors of the Medicine Buddha).* He becomes able to see spirit energy, and shortly after that enrolls the Onmyo Prep School. In the now \"new world\" for Harutora, everybody is speaking about Natsume being the reincarnation of Yakou Tsuchimikado, a genius Onmyoji who is told to be The Father of Modern Onmyoudo. But is she really the reincarnation? Hmmm...\\n\r\nThe storyline of this anime is great. You have the slowly (yet not too slow) developing story whose peaces are placed one by one, like a puzzle, until you get the whole picture. I have to say, after the 14th episode I was scared that they will just ruin the rest with the episodes to come, but they did not. The opposite actually happened. The story became more and more interesting and it kept me on tenterhooks until the very end. A couple of plot twists also contributed to the show, leaving actually no plot holes at all. \\n\r\nThe mix of magic and action fights also did they bit in this show. \\n\r\nAnd finally an anime that has a finished love story. It didn't left me with the stupid thoughts: \"Will they be together\", \"Will he tell her how he actually feels about her\" etc. I hate unfinished stories in anime which don't have a second season. Make an OVA at least, that would make me really happy. \\n\r\nAnd while talking about second seasons, this anime really deserves one. It did leave some open questions and a movie or another 12 episodes would be great. I could read the finished novel, but I am too lazy to read something. School is coming after all.\\n\r\nAnyways, Tokyo Ravens is a catchy, awesome and in some parts very emotional story that is worth every single second of watching. There are not much anime which have a great story that is not ruined in one or the other way. And even if the beginning seems a bit like there is no progress, be patient. The best is yet to come.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWhat a crazy bunch of personalities we have here. We have the cool guy, the stupid one, some prodigies, a girly, a shy boy, an awesome teacher, a cute familiar...\\n\r\nThis anime really has awesome characters, and I could talk about them the whole day, but the main two will also do good. Ladies first...\\n\r\nTsuchimikado Natsume is a prodigy onmyoji and as said before the heir to the main family. Don't be confused, she will just pretend to be a boy in most of the show. She is a very caring person and she takes her obligations as the heir very seriously. She proves that there is no success without hard work and sacrifice.  An awesome and interesting character, Natusme-san. \\n\r\nJust as everybody in the anime says : \"Baka-Tora\" or \"Stupid Tora\". Harutora Tushimikado is really what the world calls stupid. It takes some time before he understands some things. What I like about his personality is that he's not afraid to take some risks. And also he wasn't very confident in the beginning , but because he knew that learning magic is the only way to save the people he loves, he didn't give up.  A very funny and determine main character, with some flaws that actually just made him so unique as he is.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nWell there is no much to talk about the animation. It is good just like in other anime shows too. The characters look good, the style is awesome and the landscapes and backgrounds are also well done. The thing that needs to be commended is the animation of the spells and the powers. Even the monsters look awesome. Nice job!\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nAt first glance, I didn't think that this anime would turn out this great. The only thing I have to criticize is that there is no release date for season 2. I really hope that the makers will make one. In short, Tokyo Ravens is a great story, with no plot holes but with some awesome reviews on the past. The background stories  are not boring, I liked them actually, and the romance, shounen, action mix was just epic. MAL scored it with 7,88 but I would give it  a 9,27. Almost a masterpiece, TOKYO RAVENS.",

            "content": "Excuse me in advance for there will be minor use of profane language; I do not intend to offend anyone or anything. However, given that the review guidelines only consider the use of \"crap\" every three words, profane, I think (...I hope) I will be all right.\r\nCrap...crap...goose!\r\nAlright. Attempted humour spree go!\r\nIt was the best of anime; it was the worst of anime.\r\nNow when I say that, I mean it. This is probably the most conflicted I've ever been about an anime. Half of me is like this was awesome, and half of me is like...what the hell is the other half of me talking about.\r\nAllin all, Tokyo Ravens is probably one of the most unoriginal, cliche, done to death animes this season. And frankly, I have no problem with that. Being original is nice, but you're always sitting on the fence because you never know how people will react. Being cliche is great because you know you already have an established fanbase for whatever overused plot line you're dishing out.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the very reason I started it was because I read the premise of the story (much more then the premise actually, I spoiled the whole plot for myself); anyways, I got to the part where a huge secret about the main character is revealed (I'm a sucker for these types of plots), and I figured, this is just what I was looking for! Tokyo Ravens has everything set up right, but after watching the series, I can only say that everything so magnificently flopped, rolled over, and died.\\n\\n\r\nThe perpetrator? Poor execution.\\n\\n\r\nSome people have complained that the first half of the anime was too slow. On the other hand, I found that the first half was paced perfectly. Great character introductions, great background explorations, great steady buildup...to a climax which never happened and a denouement which decided to switch places with where the climax should have been, just for kicks.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the anime was a complete mess. With all the buildup, you would have expected the second half to unravel all the tangles in the yarn laid out in the first half, but no. It's like they tossed the ball to a cat who started playing with it and ended up wrapping the whole house in yarn.\\n\\n\r\nHere's my very adolescent explanation: I remember watching the last six episodes, thinking \"SHIT'S GONNA GO DOWN NEXT EPISODE\", only to have no shit go down. And this continued until I finished the last episode, whereupon I felt extremely disappointed and empty inside. How is this possible you ask? Every single plot device/scene I was looking forward to was rushed, butchered, or omitted entirely. Stuff just started happening all over the place at the same time with minimal explanation. It made me totally lose track of characters and their personalities, philosophies, and motives - all the things that define them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you're wondering how I still ended up rating this an 8...despite all my complaints, I found Tokyo Ravens to be very addicting and enjoyable. I thought the magic system was really cool and the few fight scenes that existed were extremely noteworthy; definitely some of the better action scenes I've seen recently. On the art and sound front, I would say the series is near flawless. Even the story, I thought it was cliche, but great. My only complaint would be with the characters, who were (for the most part, few exceptions) so one-dimensional that it's amazing how they managed to keep the suspense going.\\n\\n\r\nThere were just so many things in Tokyo Ravens that I thought could have been done better. But alas, as I don't plan to take up the director's seat anytime soon, these aspirations will remain unrealized. Takaomi Kansaki probably did a better job than I could ever do anyways.",

Granted there was a lot more back story than some anime I have watched but I still felt like it was lacking a little.\\n\r\nThe ending, while it was good, ended very suddenly and was rather cliff hangery. To be honest it left a little room for a sequel but more often than not, a lot of them do and we never get one so I'm not holding any hopes just yet.\\n\r\nI guess another dislike I had is, well it did fell like it was something I'd seen before, it lacked a little originality and while I did enjoy it, it was rather similar to other anime in the same genre.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the anime but there were times I did consider dropping it, not so much because I didn't like it but because there were quite a few main arcs (if you can call them that) and I felt it dragged on little.\\n\r\nSaying this, It did work well as a 24 episode anime and I do not think it would have done so well being any shorter.\\n\\n\r\nSo this review is probably not helpful but thats not really why I write them so...

            "content": "Here's an easy review to sum up the strengths and weaknesses of Tokyo Ravens--SPOILER FREE for your enjoyment!\r\nOVERALL--\r\nTokyo Ravens takes about five episodes before it really finds its footing; however, once it does, this show progresses with a great pace that will keep viewers interested through all 24 episodes! The ending is slightly open to interpretation, but comes to a satisfying conclusion. It leaves the viewer ready to continue on with the characters into their next big adventure, while still bringing the current story arc to a close. Overall, a very enjoyable show and well worth the watch!\r\nMAGIC SYSTEM--\r\nA huge part of this anime isthe magic system, which presents some of the show's highest and lowest points. Tokyo Raven's magic system is never given clear cut rules or limitations, which may leave some viewers frustrated. However, this lack of definite limitations allows for some excellent fight scenes because the magic can be used is so many creative and varied ways. A highlight of the series is the magic battles, which are interesting and never repetitive; they almost never use the same trick twice!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS--\\n\r\nAt first, the characters may seem a little cookie-cutter, with some of the typical \"anime friend group\" cliches; however, the show is not limited by this because each of the mains ends up so gosh darn likable! The mains are believable, with enough backstory to give them depth.\\n\r\nThe cast of supporting characters is wide, which allows for a lot of interesting personalities. Unfortunately, for a show with only 24 episodes, I found the cast a little TOO wide to keep track of all the characters at some points. Despite this, the wide range of characters allows the show to build up an interesting motif examining the reality and meaning of trust. As a viewer, you are never quite sure who you can trust, which mirrors the struggles of the characters. This gave the story extra intrigue as allies split into factions, friends turn into opponents, and previous enemies unite as accomplices.\\n\\n\r\nART--\\n\r\nThe major flaw in the art is how starkly the CGI stands out against the traditional animation. The CGI is mainly used on the familiars in battle scenes, but I found it both jarring and distracting. Other than that, the art is fairly consistent throughout the show, with vivid colors, enjoyable character designs, and beautifully animated spell work.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND--\\n\r\nThe show presents a strong voice acting cast with bright sound editing and mixing, but falls short in musical composition. I didn't find either of the opening or ending themes memorable. Furthermore, the show did not make good use of background music, even though there were many instances where music could have provided a great boost to the emotion or energy of the scene. \\n\\n\r\nSUBS OR DUBS?\\n\r\nFinally, as a lover of both subs and dubs in different situations, (and having watched Tokyo Ravens in both), I recommend the subs on this one. I found the subs to be slightly better in their explanations of plot intricacies, and the Japanese voice actors to be better suited to the characters as I understood them.\\n\\n\r\nPROS--\\n\r\n+good pacing\\n\r\n+creative magic battles\\n\r\n+likable main characters\\n\r\n+visually appealing spell work\\n\r\n+strong Japanese voice cast\\n\\n\r\nCONS--\\n\r\n-slow and slightly confusing start\\n\r\n-lack of clear rules/limitations to magic\\n\r\n-some distracting CGI\\n\r\n-little to no effective background music\\n",

            "content": "OBSERVE : A score below 7 doesn't mean its bad, it means whatever that score originally is supposed to represent. Score five is mediocre. That means that you will still probably get some enjoyment out of it. \r\nRATING: 7.68 - Read rest of my review/rant to see my reasons why\r\n- - - - - - - - - \r\nAs many others have mentioned, this anime starts off quite weak with a rather non-unique setting, but then during its second act has a very, very exciting plot development that keeps you striving for more. Although unfortunately, there isn't anything more, and you are left with ahefty amount of new unanswered questions. \\n\\n\r\nStory & Plot - - -\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the anime starts off with giving a generic shounen vibe, and you can almost find all the shounen clich\u00e9s there are. For example; main character fails school but compensate for his intelligience with practical skills, there's the childhood friend, there is the ever so important promise from early childhood. A majority of the series takes place in high school setting. Also there is the glasses-guy, the big anime tiddies girl, the tsundere,  the friendship is magic and will rescue the day and so on and so on.\\n\r\nSo far it might not seem like  too much of a premise, but becuase of a fast introduction followed right up by action, drama and mystery, you the viewer is immediately invested in the series. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, during its first half of the story, it is somewhat underwhelming. Events occur, but there is a lack of character developement and story progression. It is almost like the first half of the series is dedicated to introduce the viewer to this fictional universe (unfortunately, there isn't too much interesting, a lot of generic shounen magic-stuff with  no real explanation to why things are like they are.) \\n\r\n It is not until at least after episode 14/15 things start to unravel itself and it starts to show some story heavy stuff. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's my point really. I just finished rewatching this anime for the second time, and previously having fond memories of this show, I was shocked. Halfway through the series it was nothing more than another mediocre, shounen-seasonal like anime. \\n\\n\r\n...Buuut then things start to happen. The plot picks up some good pace and a well thought story starts to unravel. The second half/ the last episodes make up for the previously dull arc. \\n\\n\r\nArt ~ ~ ~\\n\\n\r\nArt/style/animation is mediocre. Little attention to detail and no interesting backgrounds.  The CGI is really obnoxious, but.. sad but true, you get used to it, and it is used in moderation (except the first couple of epsiodes... Oh god my eyes). \\n\r\nChoreography is good. Not too many moving still-shots or \"guy's so fast he zaps past his opponent, and seconds later opponent falls over/is cut apart because for some reason there is a delay to the blow becuase guy is faster than goddamn light\". (Like it or not, but you can't deny it is bad/lazy animation technique).\\n\\n\r\nSound - - - \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is decent, not memorable though.  Though there is one especially nice piano melody which plays during sad/bittersweet moments. Unfortunately it gets kind of repetitive after 24 episodes. \\n\r\nSound design is fine, but again, not memorable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters ~ ~ ~\\n\\n\r\n At first the cast is not impressive at all. Main character follows typical shounen clich\u00e9s and the rest of the cast is- you guessed it, super generic. It's only a bit into the series each character start to develop into something interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some interesting characters with even more interesting development, but... Okay it feels like I am repeating myself so I'll just finish this and then get to my point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall rating : : :\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is generic, mediocre, and at first very predictable. In this wall of text I have repeatedly said those specific words, generic,unfortunately and mediocre. There is no coming away from that. Though, during the second act it starts going into a great direction with lots of interesting twists, new revelations and lots of character developement, only to end with a bad conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending isn't bad, but all suddenly there are all these new problems and you the viewer is filled with both old and new questions; Who is that? How is he their \"master\"? What the hell did she do towards the last episode? What is going on, and what the hell is going to happen next?! \\n\\n\r\nThere is no conclusion. They introduce way too many story heavy/interesting characters right in the end of the series. Real shame. \\n\r\n No questions are answered and when it finally starts to get reeaaally good, it just kind of ends. \\n\\n\r\nI found it very enjoyable, or rather, the finale of the series makes up for the otherwise dull and generic shounen anime you have seen too many times. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with this anime is that it ends with no conclusion, and it just teases you with the possibility of a sequel. Also it kind of states that \"oh no how is it going to end? You should probably read up on the maangaa!\" Goddamnit, I just wanted a finished anime. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict, Good to very good, but maybe not a priority choice of what to watch anime.  \\n",

Even amid the wild action scenes and slice of life school backdrop, it's intention is to cause emotional reactions from its viewers.\r\nI usually avoid shows like this b/c i don't like to feel down or depressed after watching sometihing, and that is exactly how you will feel unless you are an akuma.\r\nI would say the drama is a little over the top as well, overplayed, drawn out and a little confusing.  And that leads me to the second point i'd like to make.\r\nThisshow is ultimately confusing.  It does a poor job of explaining anything relevant to the audience and leaves you asking a lot of questions.\\n\\n\r\nspoiler alert\\n\r\n=====================================\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe ending espeically is confusing and leaves off in...well, not so much a cliffhanger but definitely not a place you want a show to leave off.  I can understand the mechanics of the writing behind it, but its not satisfying at all.   The only time, imo, that a show should leave off like it did, is if there is a guarantee of a second season.  I understand it continues in the Light Novels, but I don't read LN's.\\n\\n\r\nI felt the need to warn all who dare enter this with certain expectations.  It's definitely not all bad, in fact most of it is very enjoyable.  I felt the pacing was a little off, but the over dramatization really killed it for me.  However, some people will love this sort of thing.  So in the end, i'll just say its certainly not everyone's cup of tea.",

The main cast consists of 6 magic students and a teacher.  There is Harutora, Natsume, Touji, Kyouko, Suzuka, Tenma, and Jin.  Each character has their own secrets that is gradually brought to light for the viewer.  They all get to know each other better as they go through some comedic moments.   While the plot does seem very overused, which makes the story seem lacking...until episode 13.  That is where the plot picksup and shows that it can do something right.  After this point I found myself needing to see more every week.  The last episode especially made me want to pick up the light novel it is based on.  If you don't mind putting up with some mediocre episodes that while lacking will keep you entertained then you will be rewarded halfway through.",

Don't get me wrong this anime was very enjoyable and i hope they have enough money to make a second season because i liked it that much, but i think overall they should have had at least two more episodes so they could have finished the romance between Natsume and Harutora.

            "content": "Well to start off this review I would like to say that I was really excited about this anime. I am not going to say that this is perfect in an anyway though it does have a few major flaws. I am going to cover those flaws here shortly. So sit back and read this review :) \r\nFlaw #1- Character Development\r\nCharacter development was a major flaw in this anime. I thought that they focused too much on Harutora Tsuchimikado & Natsume Tsuchimikado. They had a string of characters that to me they were just lying them to waste. For the string of characters that weren'tas important as the two main characters there wasn't any back-story for them. For instance a character that that was in the anime every episode was  Touji Ato, he was a great character but they didn't bother to go into any details about him like how he became a half ogre. All they said was that he was in a disaster and thats it. I thought that he should of been the main character to begin with they made him look so much more powerful than harutora. (plus he had common sense) They also didn't fully explain the characters from the magic agency or anything. They also didn't go into very much detail with Yakou Tsuchimikado, they kept saying that he was a super good exorcist and that he developed taboo magic.(not much thought into that character)\\n\\n\r\nFlaw #2- Pacing of the story\\n\r\nI felt that they went from a slow paced to overly rushed. It also felt like they skipped a few scenes throughout every episode, they never started off from where they left off. The ending was very sloppy and rushed, its like they were in a hurry to finish it or something. Despite that i still enjoyed it a bit. \\n\\n\r\nThose are the 2 major flaws of the story now i am going to get into the ratings.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10- Rated this for the reason above pacing of the story. As i said before they rushed and skipped scenes and it makes you get confused about what is going on. To me I thought that the beginning of the anime was slow paced and too annoying for me to watch, but once I toughed it out and completed more and more episodes I started to think that it was an enjoyable show. NO THE SHOW IS NOT ALL ABOUT RAVENS! (tiny spoiler) The ending royally pissed me off because of how they skipped the ritual and also how he leaves into the sunset. I didn't fully understand what was going on. To make matters worse I dont believe they are making a season 3 of Tokyo Ravens which really really makes me mad. time and time again I see myself being dissapointed at the stories begining and ending. Even though at times it felt really confusing it was easy to catch up in what was happening.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10- I thought the art looked fantastic. They went into great detail when coming to the characters, setting, the magic designs, even the dormrooms looked very detailed. Though there isn't much to say about the art all I can say is that I really enjoyed the way this anime looked.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10- The sound was great. I know that they are starting on the dubbed version but I have not seen any episodes of it so I am rating it solely based on the subbed version so far. At times i felt that they characters rushed through enchantments and their sentences but that was okay to an extent. The music at the title screen was catchy, so catchy that I had to find the song on youtube :) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10- As I previously mentioned about the character development they did have a string of characters that I thought to be more interesting than the main 2 characters. I was upset because they didn't give much of a back-story on any of the characters. Each character had their own unique personalities and attributes that they brought to the show to make it more enjoyable. One of my favorite characters that I thought should of been pushed more was Touji Ato. Touji Ato was an half ogre man beast lol. His personality was the best of the characters with him this anime I seemed to be amused in every episode, even though he was a bit cocky at times but it was still great to see this character in the show. They should of focused more on developing the characters to their full extent rather than half developing them.   \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10-  It was enjoyable at points with all of the different characters and settings. Not much to say besides that I liked this show up until the ending. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10- Overall I enjoyed this anime, it had a unique story. For all of the reasons above i chose to give this anime an 8 instead of a 7 because the fighting scenes with the homeroom teacher made a big difference and it caught my interest. \\n\\n\r\nTHANKS FOR READING -_-  (only a second review so it might be a bit sloppy but hope this helps on deciding if you want to watch tokyo ravens)",

I was starting to think it's a bad anime but the final proved me wrong.\r\nStory:(10/10): I really liked how the creator created a new world there. It full of creativity. All of those spells, familiar and so. Natsume vs Yakou Devotees wasn't an interesting story but The Final Arc made it a really good story. The whole thing about Raven Coat andd Othomo Jin's true identity excited me so much!\r\nArt:(8/10): I really didn't like the drawings at some times.The boys chins were too long and there was bad CGI usage like Doman's car was flying BUT after the battle of Doman and Othomo Jin I changed my mind about y drawing. The spells look honestly so cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound:(7/10): None of the endings or openings caught me but the ost was pretty good  especially those whistle songs really givess you the anime's aura.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:(7/10): Harutora, Kyouko, Natsume, Hokuto etc. are pretty cliche characters while Touji, Kon and Othomo was pretty interesting to watch. But I really liked how the anime tranformed those cliche characer into pretty interesting ones using feeling and emotions. And the whole design of all Familiar was amazing too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:(9/10): THATS ONE THRILLING ENDING YOU GOT THERE",

            "content": "Tokyo Ravens attempts to create its own spin on spiritualists within anime as they are incorporated into a modern era setting with Harutora learning more of his family roots as he is trained in being a spiritualist alongside cousin Natsume and finds himself caught up in hostilities between the Onmyo Agency tasked with keeping spiritual disturbances to a minimum and the cult-like Twin Horn Syndicate trying to stir up disturbances that will lead to the revival of their worshiped leader, Yakou.\r\nSaying that things are a mixed bag with this series is quite an understatement. On the one hand, it does rather well for the mostpart at creating a unique world for spiritualists within Tokyo Ravens as the series has laws established in the modern era for spiritualists to continue honing their craft, while have a law enforcement body in the form of the Onmyo Agency tasked with keeping their activities in check to prevent instigators like the Twin Horn Syndicate from wrecking havoc on human society. The Twin Horn Syndicate create much of the conflict within the series as they are responsible for stirring up a series of events throughout the series to try reviving Yakou, a powerful spiritualist whose reception among those in the world of spiritualists is a mixed one due to an infamous event he was a major influence in from the past. This eventually leads Natsume and Harutora to get caught up in the conflict toward the second half of the series, as they are direct descendants of Yakou from being in the same family line. The spiritualist elements also contribute to the show's engaging action scenes as shikigami and magic of various forms are used by spiritualists against one another throughout the show, leading to some great fight choreography in spite of the conspicuous CG animation that is used for rendering many of the powers used by the spiritualists throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of its unique premise though, Tokyo Ravens does have a number of shortcomings that cripple its quality to a good extent. The first half suffers from a number of episodes that are typical of high school comedy anime titles with the character archetypes and situations played up and the show making some failed attempts at trying to milk humor off Natsume's need to cross-dress as a boy while a student at the Onmyo Academy with Harutora. The large cast of characters and conflicts that build up throughout the show can usually make it hard to follow what is going on at points if this is your first time going through the show, especially in its second half when events escalate with the Twin Horn Syndicate. The final episodes also suffer a bit in some rather convenient plot and character developments with how Harutora and Natsume's situations are resolved, mainly coming from some shocking developments that take place regarding the upbringings of our two lead characters and their fates.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I suppose your mileage may vary with how well you warm up to Tokyo Ravens. While offering decent world-building and plot developments with its spiritualist premise, the series peaks in its second half as you have to struggle through mediocre points in its first half and deal with final episodes that offer too convenient a climax for how Harutora and Natsume resolve their situations. I would say rent or stream this series first before you decide on committing to a purchase of it.",

That being said, the show itself was a good watch, I rated enjoyment as 9/10 mostly because prior to this show, I hadn't really seen combat sequences involving magic used SPECIFICALLY the way this show did.  The combo of mantras plus talismans plus magic ability was nifty and for the action spread throughout the show I give the anime in general a 7/10.  I do think the anime peaked a little after the mid point (episode 16-18) because the fight scenes there were really good butbeyond that no particular character or single plot event stood out to me.  There was a couple of things i felt were unanswered in terms of reasoning but I'll let it slide, the show was fun to watch.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ravens is a supernatural story focused primarily on Onmyodo magic a traditional japanese divination of cosmology with a mix of natural science and occultism or known as \"The way of Yin and Yang\" along with a mix of the daily lives of the two main characters Harutora and Natsume.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe idea and overall story follows the theme of the anime and provides decent insight on some of the history of Onmyoujis which helps to support the theme of the story. The story's pacing of the anime was well done it provided a slow start for the viewers to understand what happened prior to thestart of the story and as it progressed it started to learn more towards the story's main plot. The story always kept me in tact and focusing on what might happen next, whereas some other series have me half asleep or I find myself skimming through each episode just to watch the interesting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it wasn't spectacular or anything unseen before, although what may have thrown off some people from starting the series it did attempt to execute the usage of CGI's, and overall it was mediocre at best. Sometimes it was utilized at the right time, but others it felt like there were some issues with it and I felt really awkward at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nNow, there weren't many amazing or beautiful soundtracks, the opening themes were well done, I enjoyed each scene displayed and the music and singer's of each OP/ED theme were very enjoyable. The general OST's used during fights and the story were right and fit the mood of the scene but nothing superb.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nHere's what I really loved about this show. The two MC's are a bit annoying to watch occasionally, especially the density of the male lead that made want to yell \"Are you joking? You must've been hit hard by a brick at some point if your that dense.\" But both of them had some interesting decision making and actions that made me want to keep watching. Now, what really made me say Sugoi! was the character development for each of them especially Kon, and Mr. Ohtmo but I won't be spoiling anything. I really enjoyed how each character appeared to be your average cliched characters in anime, but each of them had at least one unique trait and none of them were weak or useless and unbearable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ravens, for me was undoubtedly one of the better anime that came out in the fall season, and athough there were definitely some flaws within the story's plot and art, the characters and story kept me entertained and I never found myself wanting to drop the series. The plot twists, romance and amount of humor, and drama were in the right amount at the right times. It is a definitely enjoyable show for anyone out there. One of the best part's about this anime is how they keep fanservice to a minimal, there is definitely fanservice, but very little and I did not find it to be a problem.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nI would absolutely recommend this anime to anybody who enjoys the supernatural or fantasy genre, overall the pro's outweighed the con's and is NOT a waste of time to watch. I think it was well written, not perfect but it will definitely keep you entertained. If you're also the type who wants a nice kiss that does not get censored or blocked by some stupid overused object or whatever, and a\" happy\" but not exactly \"happy\" ending (You'll know what I mean if you've read the manga or read spoilers somewhere.) then you will not be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. The rating on my list a 9 just because I enjoyed it so very much, Mr. Ohtmo and another character (no spoilers) made me bump it up +1 and I hope there is a second season, but for reviewing purposes I gave it an 8.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This is the first show I have seen a human become someone\u2019s familiar which I though was pretty interesting. I have to say that one of my favorite characters has to be Kon, Harutora\u2018s familiar. She is so adorable and I found her  delightful and funny. All characters had great developments throughout the show. I did wish there had been a little more action throughout the show. I really liked how the show played out andI hope there is another season. The ending did wrap up pretty well but still left it a little open ended for another season if it continues.",

            "content": "To start off, I'll describe this anime series in four words: great plot, pathetic ending\r\nNow before anyone gets mad at me, lemme try to state it the best I can while keeping it simple, cause why I legitimately enjoyed the series, I can't help but get irritated by a handful of the glaring flaws it had.\r\nSTORY: Even for such a generic setting and genre, this series actually did very well in its niche in terms of the plot, for the most part. The pacing is actually very good compared to the numerous other light novel adaptations, especially of the same genre of \"magic / supernaturalschool / fantasy\". The details about the settings of Tokyo Ravens is also very enriched and actually do come into play during crucial moments in the plot. Yes, the usual trope of a young man gathered with friends to stop the conflict has been replayed numerous times before and often never done correctly or just ends up being straight up cringe and unfulfilling; however, Tokyo Ravens, in particular, did such a great job in terms of execution (until the last episode), to where I was never really puzzled or confused about anything, much less even shake my head in annoyance.\\n\r\nHowever, what would've been a strong point for this series was hit with a dead weight when it all was supposed to come to a conclusion. Okay, so you're telling that the ending comes with Harutora reviving his beloved Natsume only for a little bit in order to meet her, have an emotional moment, and then just walking off with his familiar and some former enemy with the anime series ending right there?! I'm sorry, but......F*** OFF with that sh**! Now, honestly, such an ending would be forgivable if there was an announced second season (which as of right now, there's been no such news)...but even so, to leave off a series like that when the plot was going in a direction it was supposed to end in a legitimate conclusion...it's actually very deflating and unforgivable...and imo, even more deflating than something like the Yugioh Arc V ending (which I thought was still decent in its own right). Nevertheless, at least for the majority of the season, Tokyo Ravens gave us a great ride.\\n\\n\r\nART: The 2D style was fine but very questionable for me, personally. First at all, why do the girls get huge ass eyes compared to the guys in this series?! That was just something that bugged me, but at least it never truly did anything to hurt the plot, though it sorta affected my enjoyment of the series. Otherwise, the 2D style was clean and colorful with no serious issues, and doesn't try to do too much, either. However, when the staff decided to add 3D, it was hard to stomach (though there's been a lot worse) and can ruin one's immersion into a certain scene, especially during the points of conflict. Honestly, the 3D wasn't necessary whatsoever....without that CG, the art would've gotten nearly a perfect score from me, at least.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The voice acting in this series is something worth noting and what I actually appreciated the most, even though there's not a whole lot to say about it. As for the soundtracks, they're unfortunately mediocre and not that impactful in terms of their roles. The opening and the ending themes were pretty good, though.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Funny enough, generic and one-dimensional actually helped me enjoy the characters in this series. They're easy to follow, easy to predict, but easy to find a liking and investment for. The cast of characters is also quite large, with all the good guys, bad guys, and neutral individuals. Each one of those characters turned out intriguing in their own ways (yes, even the side characters that barely get more than one appearance). The interactions between the characters, especially the two main ones, Harutora and Natsume, are all the worth watching for entertainment and drama. As for the character development, Tokyo Ravens did fairly well in that department, but only for the main character and main support cast.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Tokyo Ravens was something I'm glad I did not miss out on (except when it came to that last episode). It had great pacing, great plot twists, great interactions, great drama, great action scenes, and yes, great comedy as well. All of that were well mixed into a series that you would be able to look forward to every week (or every episode if you're binging). The main glaring issue I personally had, though....was that unsatisfying ending...that could've been done a whole lot better.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: I would highly suggest to watch this show despite all the criticism you heard about it. While it never reached a full potential, it should be able to bring great entertainment and drama to any sort of viewer. Granted, it may not be for those whom have a completely opposing preference. This show is well worth it, imo, even with all the cliches and generic setups of any fantasy or supernatural anime, cause they actually do it right.\\n\\n\r\nA parting piece of advice, though...please bear with that inconclusive ending...most of us would really rather see the two main characters end up back together permanently instead of having to go to the books to find out what happened next.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ravens is an anime with quite an unsatisfactory ending, but overall the anime itself was fun and entertaining, switching between serious episodes and your slice of life, laid back episodes in between. I really kind of wish this show would have taken out the serious parts and just tried to be a comedy/romance anime (they just couldn't properly flesh the plot out). \r\n- Nothing was special or memorable about this anime's music/soundtrack. \r\n-Visually the anime looks like your average anime with some heavy CGI use to portray characters called \"Familiars\" ( Not a bad thing though, I liked the use of CGI in thisshow, especially when \"Hokuto\" the dragon appears.\\n\r\n-  Similar Anime: Guilty Crown, Fate/Stay Night, and maybe Soul Eater.\\n\r\n- Our main character is of course your average generic main male character, I would have personally liked to see this series focus on the female lead, Natsume, much more. I think she is a fairly interesting character, who has a lot of paths that can be explored story wise. Similarly there quite a few other interesting characters, that have cool concepts and seemingly interesting back stories. Unfortunately they don't get enough of the spotlight... I demand to know more about them. \\n\r\n-P.S, when you get to episode 22-24, Howl from Howls moving Castle makes a cameo ;), well no he doesn't, but you'll see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the flaws of this show, its pretty entertaining and definitely worth a watch if you like romance, comedy, and Magic. I really want a sequel to this anime, the way they ended it just leaves my heart betrayed. If there is one thing you will get in this show it is magical sutra spells, sutras everywhere!!!!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tokyo Ravens is a functional battle anime that offers just enough to make you enjoy the ride. What I mean with functional is that it offers many potential elements that make an anime of this caliber interesting, but in the end how it runs with them falls a little short. I'm not saying it's bad in any stretch of the imagination, but I am saying there are aspects that could've been handled better. There are many things I'd like to mention about the plot, but since I can't spoil anything I have to be as roundabout as possible.\r\nThe story is in its foundation generic, butalso enjoyable. The world is just about what you expect: teens, magic, battles and school. What actually got me interested was the plot. I found myself invested on how things were going to develop as the show managed to throw several twists I did not expect. This held up my interest enough that I could marathon the show in two sessions. On the other hand some twists were there for the story's convenience and some even were left largely unexplained. At least you can figure out some of them, but some are just left out there. I liked the romantic foundation in the story, but the development was suddenly procrastinated. At one episode it had relevance, but the next episodes just tossed it aside and brought it back a lot later. Very confusing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall they made the story work for the most part. The bigger issue was how the story used some of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part I liked the characters. The main cast was interesting and also well used in the overall story. Their motivations, backgrounds and personalities were well fleshed out and their usage in the story worked to its advantage. There were, however, many characters or characteristics that fell flat in their execution. I found it strange how the show held back on the potential of some protagonists for too long until it was convenient for the plot or developed them traits that the story wouldn't use in any meaningful way. Say, a harem development without the harem for example. Some characters who seemed relevant were also introduced early on , but didn't really play any major role in the end. I liked some of the antagonists, but many of them also had unclear motivations the we never got any light on. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not an expert on art and sound, but I would say the animation wasn't too special or detailed. What excelled though were the animation of the magic as it seemed like the studio had fun making it as flashy as possible and in the end it was enjoyable to watch. It was an admirable effort to throw in CGI, but the stuttering animation threw me off to an extent. It was probably easier and cheaper to use it, but I would've enjoyed more something that blended in better. \\n\\n\r\nThe music wasn't particularly memorable, but it did keep the atmosphere of the show about right. Sound effects were fitting for the show, but I did notice that I've heard many of them before in different places, so they weren't original to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is enjoyable. For a good portion it handles itself well and keeps you attached enough that you won't get bored. I personally would've liked to know more about certain details and loose ends, but generally that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. For a magical battle anime, I'd recommend putting it fairly high on the priority list.\\n\\n\r\nThis has been my first review on the site, so excuse me if it's unpolished.",

            "content": "Tokyo ravens may seem to be an ordinary anime but its far from.\r\nAt first glance this anime has several cliches both in relation to plot and characters but it's more complex than that. Even though there will be several occasions where you will think typical the anime as a whole is very good.\r\nThe story is very interesting and the bits and parts that remind you of a filler just exist to discover the more playful nature of the characters. Yes there could have been more focus on the central plot but that would not have been so much fun.\r\nThe art is pretty great, though Iadmit that certain techniques utilized could have been improved, and by techniques I mean the actual skills utilized by the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound, though not bad, is not something great. If you are looking for an awesome soundtrack you need to look elsewhere. Here you will find something more like nice music but after 10 mins you will not remember a thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very good. Even the secondary characters seem to have a fascinating story behind them ( regrettably you will not know that story from this anime). In general the character structure is pretty solid. Uniquest background stories are well presented or hinted throughout the anime and you pretty much get hooked. I could elaborate further but not point ruining the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment of the series is exceptionally high. Though it may seem just another cliched series the overall result will leave you very happy and wanting for more. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this series for anyone wanting to spend a couple of hours just chilling and having fun whilst watching a very good series without too many complexities and obscure stories.",

            "content": "Prompt medical attention would have saved these characters a whole lotta grief. It would have made the overall show fairly boring, but boy, could have made life easier. \r\nTokyo Ravens has an interesting story line. Unique, but somewhat predictable. Some parts reminded me a lot of Fullmetal Alchemist, except in this case that that taboo worked--but its still not fully clear if it was or not. The story has peaks and troughs, action and a lull. We get somewhere interesting then we end up dwelling on a teenage girl's feelings for a whole episode. It makes you want to stop watching but then all thesudden some development occurs and you end up watching till the end. \\n\r\nThe lines blur in this anime. You think someone or some group is bad and they turn out to be not so bad after all. It is gray. No black, no white. Gray. \\n\r\nThe characters in the anime were quite good. Harutora is an understanding fellow with a good heart, loyal and amusing. Each character has his/her best characteristics or skills emphasized somewhere in the anime, often showing the beast inside.\\n\r\nArt and sound were great. The music and voice actors were suitable for the anime, the music itself was exceptional in my opinion. The best way I can describe it is that it is \"action-y\" music, fast paced, with a touch of grit. \\n\r\nOverall it's pretty enjoyable--enough to write a review. If you're dabbling around in onmyoji anime, it's different than others like Shounen Onmyoji or the like, but still has its own aspect of enjoyment.",

            "content": "As the story says the anime is so freaking supranatural. However it's not just filled with supranatural only. You'll also find other genres mingle in it such as action, romance, and school life which is clear the school based on magic thingy. For me myself, I can't decide whether it's shounen or shoujo anime, to put it only shounen it won't be good because there is still shoujo flavour added (I mean the romance), while claim this one only romance is impossible too because of the damn good shounen spice here.\r\n    The story centers of our main hero named Tsuchimikado Harutora whohas a bloodline of Tsuchimikado branch family (as an Onmyouji--specialist\u2014practitioner of magic). Despite of the family blood flows through his veins, he doesn't have much supranatural skills to use and by that fact he doesn't have enough confident also encouragement to be a Shaman. It's opposite with the daughter of Tsuchimikado main family, Tsuchimikado Natsume. She is so skillful like the blessed onmyouji from the family and the only successor.\\n\r\n    These two were childhood friend, separated because of Natsume's moving. And in this present they meet again, along with few circumstances, Harutora decided to be a Shaman, moves to Natsume's school to train and mastering his skill after become Natsume's shikigami. By the decision Harutora made and moving to this school, one by one issues disclosed and be a scourge which isn't possible to be undone. It is so surprising so it is not just pump your blood to the head just for thinking or guessing what will happen but also we can also feel our heartbeat faster by watching the fascinating show.\\n\\n\r\n    Whether you're the viewer to enjoy a show emotionally or just by the visualization, it won't be a matter since Tokyo Ravens plot somehow a bit drama here can stir your spirit undoubtedly and the animation of its fight using supernatural power is freaking good. The visuals, including the art, details, animation and character designs are well-defined. The colour is not too sharp or too blurry, the fighting scenes are fine with the standout effect and issues narrated nicely.\\n\\n\r\n    I would say the brilliant ideas of story and the subtle shift of each conflicts are the central aspects which make the show and its characters fascinating. By the developed core of plot, the characters following it also be more creditable. Maybe some of you had watched it, or looked for the information of the series which has quite amount of characters. Yes indeed, but no worries, because every characters fill their role precisely and related to each others too. Each of them hold their own surprises secretly.\\n\\n\r\n    The theme songs are good~ The steady beat for OP themes; \"X-encounter\" by Maon Kurosaki  and \"~Outgrow~\" by Gero. The 1st ED theme is sweet, so melodious and this one is my favorite, sung by Yoshino Nanjo \"Kimi ga Emu Yuugure (\u541b\u304c\u7b11\u3080\u5915\u66ae\u308c)\". The 2nd theme song is sung by Mami Kawada \"Break a spell\" has a unique sense with electronic musical instruments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ravens will get its 9+ (or 10 I could say) from me. All Hail Onmyouji  (\u2022\u2304\u2022\u2445)\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nSurprising, marvelous events and story. When the 1st half elaborates the background and characters one by one, and the 2nd half gently enters the critical periods of plot\\n\r\nNice visual & insert songs\\n\r\nVery good character designs and development",

The characters designs are very good, but some characters look like long froggy limbs and stuff... The names are the things that have been messing with my brain. But overall, I recommend watching this anime because it has wonderful 3D arts that actually blended in very well with the 2D arts. But still, I'm hoping for season 2 to come out and solve the cliffhanging in late 2019 or mid-2020. Oh and btw, I don't know if this anime related to the history of Japan emperors or theTsuchimikado families but I think it has something to do with Abe no Seimei.",

The story is nicely paced and the plot gets thicker and more interesting in the second half mostly beacause in the second half there are actual Onmyo battles, familiar battles and magical battles as well as some betrayals and multiple plot twists. \r\nThe first half of the show I found very boring, so boring that I ended up putting the series on hold for 2 months, and that was sort of a mistake. \r\nI did not like tha incantations for the spells, theywere very unappealing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10 \\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t much character development and most of the characters retain their original personalities throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC, Harutora, is the typical shounen character, he is not talented but he tries his best. I did not like the fact that Tokyo Ravens falls victim to this generalized male lead personality where the MC is dense and a fool for the majority of the series. \\n\\n\r\nPart of the supporting characters, the divine generals, were actually more interesting than the leads, especially the director and professor Otomo. \\n\\n\r\nFor the rest of the characters, they are clich\u00e9d, generic and sterotypical.  The mysterious sort of a bad-guy, Yukon, we know almost nothing about him but I liked that the backstories of the main characters were well done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10 \\n\r\nTha art and animation was good except for that atrocious CG. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nThe sound was a letdown: unappealing OPs and endings, lack of the OST that leaves you with the impression \u201eshit\u2019s about to go down\u201d, I did like the whissle music. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI disliked the bitter sweet ending where the revival of the female lead, Natsume, was able to be performed by Harutora, but it was only half-successful and something we won\u2019t find out what happend to her and the Yukon inside Harutora gets sort of awakened and Harutora finally becomes mature and powerfull and we won\u2019t see what the fuck happens next. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.3/10\\n\r\nThe show is worth it because it has a lot more depth than meets the eye and gets better as the story progresses.",

I am sure this type of anime is not foreveryone but in my opinion it is definitely different and not a generic type of anime where you would be able to predict the things that would happen next. The twist in the anime is something I didn't see coming and its ending has the perfect resolution of the story. It surely had me surprised and wanting to watch more of it .

Unfortunately, this show is part of the \"rough\".  \r\nStory-4\r\nReally, this is nothing new- high school boy has some fantasy power and goes to a fantasy school and meets some superior-in-every-way girl and so on.  I found the pacing went from incredibly slow to light speed in the last episode.  Nothing in the story ever surprised me, nor did the outcome of any fights.  Nothing to shabby, just, well, mediocre.\r\nArt-6\r\n The backgrounds were all fairly done and the school felt like a uniquelocation.  But the character designs pissed me off.  How the hell are Harutora's sideburns brown when his hair is blonde? Also, I didn't really see many emotions on they're faces. The fight scenes were okay- except for that one kickass fight between Ohtono and Doman. Once again- mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nSound-6\\n\r\nTo be fair, the OPs were the best part of this show.  Pity they were wasted.  The OST was so unremarkable I can't even remember one song.  Mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-3\\n\r\nHere is where Tokyo Ravens suffers the most.  IMO, an anime is made of three things- character, plot, and interactions between characters.  I've already said that the plot and fighting were okay- leaving it all on the characters to bring up the show.  Sadly, they fail.  Harutora is your average gotta save 'em all protagonist who's weak af at first but gradually (painfully gradually) grows stronger.  Matsumae is your tsundere childhood friend love interest, Touji is standard strong-but-silent best friend character.  Jin Ohtono, despite being a carbon copy of that teacher from vampire Knight (can't remember his name), is the best character.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-5\\n\r\nI personally have a weakness for this category so I found this show at least bearable.  Completely unoriginal and unfunny but also not completely awful in execution.  Bottom line- I didn't hate it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-5\\n\r\nThis show just screams mediocre.  I would have rated it a 6 just because of my love of this genre if the ending didn't suck so much. It's your call whether you watch this show, but I wouldn't.\\n\\n\r\nIDK how close \"branch family\" is but Harutora x Matsumae is kinda creepy.",

In fact, it took me by surprise when he did rant and that his speech held some weight to who we was ranting to-- and then what he did afterwards really separates him from other MC's.\\n\\n\r\nThe deuteragonists have interesting backstories and plots to them (more so best girl, the best friends backstory isn't as fleshed out as it could be).",

First of all the Openings were wonderful, they had nice music that fit the mood of the show (in my opinion the first is better than the second). The story of the show is slow at first but as you adventure on to the later episodes it defiantly picks up but becomes rather predictable. The characters rely too much of tropes but some have a nice touch to them. Kon being the adorable yet loyal little fox girlwho puts a smile on your face every time she appears and Jin Ohtomo being the the powerful protective teacher who has a mysterious past. The show has a reoccurring joke \"Stupid Tora\", which is directed at the main character Harutora Tsuchimikado for wel... being stupid. The characters of the show use spell casting and familiars to do the fighting as well as some hand to hand combat makes for interesting fight scenes. If you look online for reviews of Tokyo Ravens you will find that it wasn't very well received when it first aired in 2013, but I would still give anime a chance.",

            "content": "This anime started out as an average romance school setting. The only thing is there here magic is a real thing. It seemed like with this anime they couldn't decide whether it should be old school or mecha so they combined it.... This anime doesn't really stand out from the rest, but it is by no means a bad anime. It was very enjoyable and hard to put down. \r\nStory: The number of plot twists in this story is enough to drive a few people crazy. Altough even though I didn't know anything about Haratora(? idk how to spell mc's name) and Natsume I couldforesee who mc was actually and his backstory. Lot's of character development to be seen, it's all based around the friendship thing tho. :\\\\n\\n\r\nArt: Something about the way they did the hair rubbed me the wrong way so every time I saw it I would get slightly irritated. The art isn't bad or anything though. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I quite like the 1st OP and ED. Not to mention I THINK Hirata was voiced by Akira Ishida? or too lazy to look but whoever it was had a heavenly voice. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Generic dense af mc + way too many tsunderes. Tenma was cute though he was the fluffiest thing ever. To be a little nit picky Natsume's constant misunderstanding and jealousy was annoying though...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was a nice change of pace. If you like the average magic fighting + a little mecha(?) action and a dose of drama also the best teacher in the universe Ohtomo I think you'd enjoy it. The ending is a little half-assed but the light novel is still going and you can research on forums so not too much to worry about. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading ^~^\\n",

            "content": "All together this anime is okay. Nothing really stunning or amazing. If there was anything in this anime that I truly had to say was good, was the voice actors and the designs for the more complex familiars. Overall this anime was quite generic with a predictable plot. \r\nStory: 6\r\nThis anime had possibly a great story and a great plot, but unfortunately with what good plot they had, they just gave basic tripe that really doesn't stand out. They were more focused on making the main character have a love connection then really make sense to the plot. With 24 episodes, it felt like Ilegitimately went no where. I actually had to skip through most parts of this anime because it was either boring or was just pointless filler, almost like they threw the characters in just to remind you they are there, or to give the VA something to say so they get a paycheck. I'm not sure if it was because I skipped seconds here and there, but I did get slightly confused with who was on what side since they made it so intricate, that unless you really paid attention, you couldn't figure out who is fighting on what side and why they were fighting. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 \\n\r\nLike I said before, the art was pretty good. Nothing really stellar about it, but some of the familiars that the main characters had were quite intricate and cool looking. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 \\n\r\nLike someone else said, they had no real stellar songs that made that moment memorable. The fight scenes felt bland without them. Usually the music motivates you and you feel the energy and emotion the character is feeling, but this anime lacks that. The VA's were well picked and quite a large cast. Nothing sounded funky or weird with the VA's or the sound effects. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5 \\n\r\nAhh the characters. They had so much potential with the characters, but it fell quite short of stupendous or even good. Again, like I said before, they really focused on trying to give our main character a love interest, and unfortunately that meant 3 different females. Thankfully the most they ever really get into the relationship is the females having slight amorous fantasies (off screen, but very evident they are having). As for the other \"main\" characters that weren't Natsume or Haruto, they got little to no character development. Even the main characters got little development past, we grew up and now I kinda like you. I learned little to nothing about any of the characters other than Touji having a notable secret and a bad boy past. That's it. They had such good characters, Touji being special, and the divine guardians or whatever they're called, but you learn nothing about them. I felt like the 12 guardians (if that's even what they were called), was more like the Pirates of the Carribeans, 9 pieces of 8 BS (don't ask why). You only see a whole 5 of them, you don't understand how they are ranked or how they even get that position. They are just there because and they are supposedly super strong, but as seen throughout the anime, apparently that is only when it pertains to the plot. If not they are about as strong as the average character. That's the other thing, the strengths of the characters felt like they were at a stand still. With how much they study and learn, they got no stronger than they were at the beginning of the anime or whenever they first gained their powers. I felt like I was at a complete standstill. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 \\n\r\nI personally only remained watching this because of Touji due to him kinda being cute, and the fact he was being voiced by Ian Sinclair. Overall I felt like the anime developed little in plot and in story. The characters felt like bricks that gained little to no growth. This anime did not take me on an adventure like others did. This one took me on a long long ride that felt like I went no where and gained little out of it, other than some solace that in the end everyone is alright. Not my cup of tea, but that is for you to judge. I definitely say give it a go. It doesn't really pick up until around episode 3 or 4 if I remember correctly.",

Crazy cult followers want the supposed ressurection of their lord(a WW2 magician) another group wants to use him to continue to advance magic, and break stuff in process.\r\nArt: Basic early 2010's art style, not much to say.\r\nSound: The OP theme for the first half is great. While everything else is not terribly memorabile.\r\nCharacters: They arent too bad the MC Tora isnt a coward or an annoying person, could even call him kinda cool. Other then him and is BFF they are all cookie cutter anime characters, Glasses dude, lolicon, Big boobed bimbo, cool dude who dishes out advise.\r\nEnjoyment: Lowvery low. This anime has a lot of tropes shoved into it such as Festivals, all the main girls fall for the MC, yelling eachothers names often, Standing and talking during fight scenes, win-cest(Incest), MC starts weak ends strong, They yell out their attacks, while chanting opposition waits for them to finish the chants before attacking again, and highschool drama. The only thing thats different is the MC girl dresses and pretends to be a dude for a while. (oo yeah and the Main girls all have a annoying phrase they constantly say \"Stupid Tora\" after the 5th time its like yeah we get you bitches have a crush on him stop being annoying.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Basic anime that is cool from start to finish if your looking for a nice basic anime. I really liked the first half theme song and thats about it i can say what i like for sure. (and for you furries theres a fox girl in it to)\\n\\n",
