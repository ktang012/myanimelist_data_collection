            "content": "This is the first time I've ever felt about reviewing a particular show on MAL. Perhaps, my love for this show is significantly greater than any show in existence? What I\u2019m about to state in this review is relatively the truth... \r\nAlright, so what's Overlord III about? What has Ainz-sama achieved so far till this season? What were the main events that took place before this season? Has the premise of the series changed?\r\nTHIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN MILD SPOILERS.\r\nSo, previously in the first season we see Momonga somehow \"mysteriously\" getting teleported to a new world or getting trapped into a game called Dive Massively MultiplayerOnline Role Playing Game, also known as DMMO-RPG Yggdrasil (while Yggdrasil being the new release of the game), on which he spent his whole life at, and finally created the guild weapon, the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown, a symbol of the guild namely Ainz Ooal Gown. Now when the game\u2019s about to see its end, we see the guild members leaving the guild, and hoping to spend their lives much better since they had spent most of their life on this game, which they realized was worth nothing. Momonga, being the guild master, was quite furious over the shutdown of the game and blamed his guild members for not spending their last moment with the game. And calling them traitors, when they actually had spent their whole time on the game and without their efforts, the Overlord, Ainz-sama would\u2019ve never achieved such strength and power. Or shall I say such arrogance and ignorance? Now being teleported to a new world, and being shocked at how this event took place. Momonga summons his guardians and orders Sebas, the butler, to investigate the surrounding of the great tomb of Nazarick. And see if they had really been teleported to a mysterious place/world, while ordering the floor guardians to stay on guard. Then we see Momonga-sama taking a tour of the first floor in his great tomb and being discovered by Demiurge. We see Demiurge outsmarting Momonga-sama. Which outrightly surprises Momonga-sama. But being the great overlord, it also meant him being \u201call-knowing\u201d and he just couldn\u2019t let any of his harem members realize that. Now, while being accompanied by Demiurge, Momonga-sama utters, \u201c...taking over the world might be enjoyable.\u201d Which he obviously didn\u2019t mean it at all, but Demiurge was really surprised and felt outclassed by such thoughts of Momonga-sama. Thus being a side premise of this season. \\n\\n\r\nContinuing on, we see Momonga-sama using the Mirror of Remote Viewing magic item. Where he notices a village being attacked by the knights. To which Momonga-sama rushes to their aid, of course, not with the \u201ctrue\u201d intentions of saving them. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to call himself an evil overlord in front of his harem. Now Momonga-sama outclasses every knight, and chases them away and meets the Royal Head Warrior, Gazef Stronoff. Now the Slane Theocracy strikes back with a trump card at their hands, a 7th tier magic item. Which again is outclassed by the great Momonga-sama. After the visit to the Carne Village, Momonga-sama decides to change his name to Ainz-sama i.e. the guild name. To which the sole purpose was to spread this name, the name of the guild, and see if he meets anyone else in the new world. His objective was to explore this world and see if there were other players from Yggdrasil, and trying to figure out how he could return back to his own world. Which was the main premise of the season.\\n\\n\r\nNow Ainz-sama orders Sebas Tian and Solution to explore more about this world. And orders Shaltear to accompany him. While him visiting the E-Rantel Fortress City accompanied by Narberal Gamma, one of the maid pleiades, as wanting to be adventurers. To spread the name of Momon, the great adventurer, and again to gain knowledge about the new world. The potion given to one of the adventurers by Momon is taken to the best pharmacist. To which to her surprise is the potion that has the healing abilities of a God. Thus, leading to the meeting of Nphirea with the great Momon-san and Ainz-sama. Momon-san joins a guild for new adventures, since those adventures were of no match to him. Also, so that they could be witnesses to the power of Momon-san, the future\u2019s greatest adventurer. But now, even Ainz-sama or Momon-san isn\u2019t perfect, Clementine, a member of the Slane Theocracy, ruins the plan of the great Momon-san by killing all of the adventurers. To which Ainz-sama responds to by crushing her to death, and killing the rest of her comrades. Meanwhile, we see Shaltear, Sebas and Solution on their mission. And at the middle of their travel, a group of mercenaries halt the carriage and attempt to take them to their place. But they are massacred by them, and later they find out the nest of the humans that attacked them. Now Solution and Sebas part ways from Shaltear. And Shaltear heads towards the nest of the humans to test out the skills of Brain Unglaus, a man who knew martial arts and had fought Gazef on equal terms. To her surprise, is disappointed by the the abilities of Brain as he even fails to pass as a nail clipper. Now Shaltear absorbs all the blood, she had gathered by killing the humans and goes berserk. Massacring even the adventurers who arrived to explore the base of the soldiers turned mercenaries. Until she recovers by seeing the red potion, the potion which Ainz-sama had given to an adventurer. And discovers that the adventurers were actually split in two teams, and the second team was already headed to E-Rantel. Knowing that, she immediately chases them in her blood-frenzy mode. At the end someone amongst that group casted a mind-control spell on her, causing her to revolt against Ainz-sama. Accepting the quest as Momon, Ainz-sama heads towards Shaltear for battle. During this battle we see how great Ainz-sama is, completely surpassing Shaltear. And later revives her and plans to use Sebas and Solution as decoys. Sasuga Ainz-sama was secondarily the premise of the series.\\n\\n\r\nNow outraged by the brainwashing of the only loli in his harem, Ainz-sama immediately launches an attack on the lizardmen. And completely overwhelms them and kills the leaders of the tribe. And makes them accept him as their ruler. This arc was of no importance to the series. The whole event took four episodes of the season. Afterwards, we see the second season focusing on Sebas and on the kingdom. Which again was of no significance. Overlord sure knows how to waste its time on insignificant bullshit. The rest of the season focuses on the Eight fingers. Who are captured by Ainz-sama and are experimented on by his harem. While capturing them, Entoma, one of the insects in the harem, suffers a serious damage by the adamantite adventurers. Who\u2019s later saved by Jaldabaoth, the Demon Emperor. At the end, we see Momon emerges as the greatest adventurer of the world. Since he defeats the great Jaldabaoth. And adds another member to his harem i.e. Evil Eye. Perhaps, the only two lolis in his harem? In this season \u201cSasuga Ainz-sama\u201d had become more or less a primary premise of the series. The second season itself had so many plot holes, but since the review is about the third season, I\u2019ll only mention the least concerning one in my eyes. That is, no one ever questioned Momon-san about how was he able to beat Jaldabaoth, a magic caster whose power level was of 66+ according to Evil Eye, without casting away his humanity? There\u2019s no way a human could beat such monster. Yet no one bothered asking him anything. And if they had Ainz would\u2019ve had to reveal his identity. Of course, they wouldn\u2019t either, since the whole show is just \u201cSasuga Ainz-sama\u201d or \u201cSasuga Momon-sama.\u201d Ainz sure knows how to get praised in every single form. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\\n\r\nThis season begins with a filler episode; the only episode which was actually worth watching in the whole season. In the episode, it\u2019s revealed how massive the harem of Ainz-sama is; completely unparalleled, incomparable to any harem anime in existence. After the first episode, the story begins its focus on the objective of Nazarick. And thus, the words that Ainz-sama had uttered in the first season. Now Ainz-sama trying to outsmart his harem clearly fails, and then tries to play along their plans, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be an evil overlord. In simple words, being controlled by them since he\u2019s supposed to be \u201call-knowing\u201d and great, otherwise, you know, he really wouldn\u2019t be the Sasuga. And the whole premise is \u201cSasuga Ainz-sama.\u201d The show either forgets its main aim or just casts it away since \u201cSasuga Ainz-sama\u201d is a very important premise. \\n\\n\r\nIn this season, we see Ainz desperately trying to prove he\u2019s the only Sasuga in the world. He tries to stoop to the lowest level just to prove he\u2019s the Sasuga, instead of acting like all-knowing or all-whatever. This season shows that the whole plot of Overlord isn\u2019t as complex as it was meant or shown to be in the first season. From watching this show, it has become clearly evident that it\u2019s just Ainz-sama and his harem squashing ants. And the series gives off the vibes as if even an amatuer could come up with such a mediocre setting. \\n\\n\r\nSince the first season we\u2019ve been seeing Ainz desperately trying to appeal and please his harem. And now, he even goes further by killing and torturing innocent people and accusing them of being evil. Ainz still thinks about his image, despite getting such loyalty and devotion. They wouldn\u2019t dare say \u201cAinz-sama are you really an evil overlord\u201d? He\u2019s already a god for them. At this point he shouldn\u2019t care about what his harem thinks and just give them orders, yet he doesn\u2019t dare so. Ainz, despite being an evil overlord, still worries about meaningless things.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing on, this series has no plot. We\u2019re constantly introduced to new characters, we get entire episodes of how their lives are, their aim, who they love, etc. What has happened to this series? Why should I care about the ants which will indefinitely get squashed? Ainz will without a doubt rule the world, their fates are sealed from the very beginning. Everyone will either submit to his will or get killed/tortured by him and his harem. This show keeps on introducing more and more insignificant characters who are killed miserably usually with one hit from even the least powerful members of the great tomb of Nazarick. This is a waste of time, yet the show still gets dragged on pointlessly. Ainz can easily conquer the whole world without even using a fraction of his power, yet he and his harem play from the shadows. Plus, the whole series is very slow-paced.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a very terrible character development. For example take the four episodes in the second season, where we were introduced to lizardmen, their lifestyles, who they love, what they wish, etc. and then they get killed and become test subjects. The third season also does the same, this season has been nothing but a waste of time. Where time is spent on developing minor characters who have no future and will contribute nothing to the plot since no matter what Ainz will have his way and they\u2019ll either get killed, experimented, or becomes slaves; just like lizardmen contributed nothing and their struggle i.e. the drama was pointless and useless. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 2\\n\\n\r\nThe 3D animation looks very cheap and is of extremely low quality. For a third season, this is completely unforgivable. And as for the rest, it\u2019s nothing special. The overall quality has dropped immensely. And almost every character looks the same.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 2\\n\\n\r\nThe voices of the characters in the series was quite satisfactory. This series has been re-using the osts of the first season. It hasn\u2019t even introduced any of the new osts; neither this season nor the previous one. It keeps on playing the same osts which were played in the first season. A very very low effort indeed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\\n\r\nFrom the second season, this show had gone down abruptly. And this season is nothing but a disaster with a lot of useless development and unnecessary crap. But I do get the appeal of this show and why many would enjoy it. For example for the harem members. This show has quite a variety of members like vampire loli, a wolf, an insect, a lizard, etc. and there are many other reasons too...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "You know what? Sometimes it is fun to route for the bad guy. Sometimes you are drawn to the villains of a story by their overwhelming power, how cunning and intelligent they are, or their unquestionable charisma. A good villain always leaves a mark during and after the story is finished. So what happens when you take those villains and make them the protagonist of their own stories? Well you get shows like Overlord. A series that has had three seasons now when we thought it was a one and done series. But nope, Madhouse has stuck to this series with another season. And nowOverlord, in my opinion, is taking its stride. \\n\\n\r\nWhy do I say that? Well I'm about to tell you. Sit back, relax and make sure you demand SILENCE! while you are reading this review as I present to you the anime review for Overlord, Season 3. Let begin shall we. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSo Ains Ooal Gown (or Momonga, or Momon or Papa Bone Daddy, whatever you want to call him) has now established Nazerick in the world they they still have no idea how they got there. Now that he has established Nazerick, his next course of action is to take over the world as is power and presence must be known across all of the kingdoms and countries. Or at least that what Demiurge believes and Ains is just rolling with it. In order to maintain control of Nazerick and his subjects, he must essentially go along with it although he never planned it in the first place and confront the nearby kingdoms in order to rule the world. \\n\\n\r\nOnce again the show is separated into two story arcs where each arc follows different characters and how they are tied to Ains' plans and objectives. The first arc follows the village that Ains saved back in season one and how they are progressing. The second arc follows the actions of the Empire, a faction that was teased at the end of season two, and how they are tied to Ains progression of ruling the world. Now world building is once again, focused in Overlord and it is one of its biggest strengths. It doesn't just focus on the inhabitants of Nazerick but the people outside it. It helps give depth to this world and its characters. You get invested into these characters to the point where once they interact with Ains Ooal Gown, you hope that they make it out okay. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the polarity of who to route for in this show has taken full swing in this show. While season two also did this, season three is where I think it now has more weight. As the escalation grows in this show, you hope that some of the world's core characters make it out unscathed, especially when they confront Ains or his subordinates. You want to route for Ains because he his the main protagonist and the character we get invested into the most, but you still want to route for the \"good guys\" because they are developed enough to get invested into them. Sometimes that is the case. Sometimes it is not. This just shows you how defined the world is and how putting investment into it helps flesh it out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis season really does give us more insight into the mind of Ains Ooal Gown as it shows that he is just going along with the ride. Like I said earlier, Demiurge believes that Ains is now planning to take over the world whereas Ains didn't think on doing that. Now that the other floor guardians believe that, he essentially must do what they believe he will do in order to maintain control of Nazerick. He is portrayed as always being 3 or 4 steps ahead but in reality, he is just making it up as he goes along. He also has to practice his lines and poses in his spare time in order to maintain his image. It's a nice reminder that he isn't some all knowing, all seeing Overlord, but rather a simple, human businessman who was invested into an MMORPG pretending to be an evil Overlord. \\n\\n\r\nOf course that doesn't mean he doesn't do it well because when he requires to do some evil deeds, he will do them without remorse. This season just reminds you that Ains is indeed a straight up villain. The previous two seasons sort of portrays Ains as both being good and bad. While he did some evil things, he also did some good things as well (Mainly when he is under the disguise of Momon). BUT NOPE. This series pretty much gives you a solid reminder that Ains is indeed the main evil that puts all other evils to shame. This season is by far the darkest season we've had because the actions that Ains took in this series are just pure villainy. Word of advice, if you ever threaten Nazerick, dig a grave. Then immediately fill up that grave because your body isn't coming back. Then stick a bunch of red flags into your head as you skip ever so gracefully into Nazerick to never be seen again as you will be remembered as the idiot who went into Nazerick looking like a t**t. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters that were focused on in the arcs, we have two to talk about. First there is Enri Emmot, a member of the village that Ains saved personally and Jircniv Rune Farlord El Nix (we will just call him Jircniv), the ruler of the aforementioned Empire who is always at war with the kingdom from the second season. \\n\\n\r\nSo Enri is the main vessel from where we see how the village has progressed since season one. She is somewhat the figurehead of the village as she also the leader of a platoon of goblins that were summoned to protect the village. We see her over the course of the season take more responsibility as she it put into situations where she requires a level head and figure out the best course of action. She is essentially the kind and courageous person you would see take charge as the lead character, unaware that she is serving Papa Bone Daddy who is completely evil. But the problem I find with her is that I don't see nothing more than just a vessel used to show the progression of the village in the show's world building. I don't get invested into her as much than say Zaryusu Sasha from season two because his motives were defined enough for me to get invested into him. For Enri, everything develops around her, rather than she is the main person involved. However, there is good use of foreshadowing where she will have to take center stage and have situations that involve around her in the future. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Jircniv, he is a good case of how looks can be deceiving. First impressions might describe him as a pompous a***ole who doesn't give a s**t. But actually, he is not that. He is cunning as he needs to think what is best for his Empire and plans out what the best course of action is that will benefit him and his Empire and to make sure it does not crumble, mainly when confronting Nazerick and Ains Ooal Gown. While he gets less screen-time than Enri. He is the kind of character that you can get invested in because you know definitely, he is going to play a big part in the future. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say other characters in this show do not get defined enough. From the workers who raid Nazerick to the goblins who protect the village to more established characters like Gazef Stronoff and Nfirea Bareare. Each character is defined enough to get invested into and to look forward to see what happens next for them. Not all of them are hits but the majority of the cast is enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nI think that I should come to expect that the animation quality isn't going to change for the better. So the animation will always be stuck on good but not great. However, I have also noticed that this season has increased the use of CGI animation and yeah, it does not look good. It just lacks detail and polish as it loses some of the impact of some scenes in the anime. Anyone that has watched episode 12 will pretty much agree with that statement. Trust me, you will notice it when the quality of the CGI animation gets bad. What I don't get is that it uses both CGI and hand drawn animation on the same models and likes to switch between them. Why Madhouse won't stick to one type is beyond me. Probably for budget reasons but that just feels like a sorry excuse of not allocating resources properly. While it does make sense for some character models like the Death Knights since they are larger than the average human, it just looks bad for other character models like the goblin and human soldiers. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the same soundtrack returns to Overlord III with haunting instrumentals and bombastic choir vocals. It is the soundtrack that can only be associated with a bad-ass, freaking Overlord. But my problem is a lack of notable new soundtracks (if there were any). The ones that I remember are the ones that we are already established with, which is quite a shame. It is not bad as the OST overall is still good but lets get some new stuff in here shall we? Before we start looping in circles. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is something different and yet familiar at the same time. This time, MYTH&ROID swap with OxT to do the opening and my word, did MYTH&ROID and Tom-H@ck do a good job on the opening. The opening, \"Voracity,\" is much better choreographed than the previous two openings and is the most visually impressive out the three openings. The instrumentals as well are much better with them sounding much more heavy than the previous two but still sounding like an Overlord opening. This is also backed up with the lyrics being catchy as hell and able to stop and start without it feeling tedious. This all culminates to being the best Overlord opening out of the 3 IMO and one I have listened to countless times. \\n\\n\r\nI've never appreciated Overlord's ending sequences till now because this one was an enjoyable ending sequence. OxT did the ending sequence this time with a more slower piece of work than their openings but still using heavy, electrical instruments to match the instrumentals with the opening. But what really stole the show were the illustrations used in the ending as they looked gorgeous; somewhat reminiscing the art style of the Light Novel's. I'll have to make sure not to skip these from now on if they keep up this quality. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\\n\r\nSo what did I mean when I said Overlord is taking its stride? Well what I meant by that was where we are in the story and how established its world and characters are, Overlord is now going full steam ahead with its trajectory and it doesn't look like its planning to stop until it reaches its destination. While its animation quality has taken a dip and the OST is now starting to go in a loop. Its heart and soul will always be its world and characters because that is what it does best. We always look into the world and its inhabitants and get attached to them before Ains and co. swoop in and probably take over their lives. It is kind of funny how this show has gone from finding out where they are and if there are other players there as well to watching a powerful Overlord start to take over the world. \\n\\n\r\nIf you were not a fan on how Overlord II was structured and how the attention was always driven away from Ains, then this season won't change your mind as it is pretty much more of the same. If you were a fan like I was, then you should be happy. I would imagine Madhouse would want to see this anime through since it is popular enough to have three seasons already. And you know what Madhouse? I will still continue to watch Overlord and bow down to THE GREAT SORCERER KING, AINS OOAL GOWN!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Enjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 7.9/10 Recommendation: Watch it (If you haven't already.)",

            "content": "If you've watched and liked the other seasons, you're going to like this. Plain and simple\r\nOn a more serious note, Overlord III is really all of the same stuff that made the first two seasons great: good world building, a grand line of characters, a simple branching out story. The show has a sense of progression and the dynamic between Ainz and the floor guardians is enhanced even more in this season resulting (so far) in a really enjoyable experience. \r\nStory: 10/8\r\nI give it a biased 10 since, as a Light Novel reader, I know the significance of small details that might feel shoehorned inat the last second. But if I have to rate it off of what happens at the moment, I\u2019d have to give it an 8. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nCGI in all anime is a crime against humanity and Overlord is no exception. I totally understand how it makes a scene easier to animate and in the newer episode it\u2019s gotten EXPONENTIALLY better, however, CGI will always be CGI.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nOOOOOOH THAT SOUNDTRACK!! Overlord\u2019s soundtrack is amazing ACROSS THE BOARD. However, sometimes it kinda feels repetitive between tracks and it\u2019s a little disheartening. But, for the most part, it\u2019s great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nCharacters in Overlord are more or less a MASTERPIECE. Sometimes characters feel really fleshed out, just to get one shotted in like ten seconds. (This can be considered good or bad depending on your preference)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIt\u2019s Overlord\u2026 what more do I have to say?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nOverlord is my number one Anime and Light Novel of all time. It\u2019s also one of the best isekai of all time. But if I have to be 100% honest in terms of overall quality, they\u2019re a couple of shows that have it beat.\\n\r\nPersonally: 10\\n\r\nRealistically: 9 \\n",

            "content": "There are four major aspects of Overlord that make it appealing.  \r\n1)\tProtagonists are villains.\r\n2)\tProtagonists are ridiculously overpowered.\r\n3)\tProtagonists are non-human.\r\n4)\tSolid world building. Works well as a hi-fantasy series.\r\nThese points summarize Overlord well, and if you find them appealing then this series is just for you. Tired of goody two- shoe protagonists who are holier-than-thou with no moral faults? Overlord\u2019s protagonists are nonhuman and villains.  Have you had enough of linear progression in storytelling, where the protagonist overcomes progressively stronger antagonists, almost conveniently? Overlord\u2019s protagonist and his minions and the minions of his minions are overpowered compared to the vast majority of everything else inthe world. This is not a tale about knights in shining armor who save the day. This is about the strong and the weak- with heavy emphasis on the strong. No \u201cfriendship triumphs over all\u201d speeches to be found here.\\n\\n\r\nThe last aspect, which does not apply nearly as much to the anime as it does to the light novels it\u2019s based on, is it\u2019s world building. The map is fairly large, with different countries and a large selection of recurring characters representing each country showing up periodically. They all have different traits and while I wouldn\u2019t call most of them \u201cdeep,\u201d the little things they do help give the world of Overlord meaning. They\u2019re not cookie-cutter background characters that do the most predictable and straight-ahead thing. It\u2019s showing the world is alive with many individual people pursuing their own goals. The story is basically a \u201cMMO isekai,\u201d but that it doesn\u2019t go as far as others in the same genre. The MMO feature is just used to explain easily the mechanics of the world and just how powerful Ainz and his minions are. You could almost ignore that fact and the plot works just as well. In essence, this series is almost like Lord of the Rings, with the protagonists being villains.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned in the above two paragraphs the appeal of Overlord's story and characters. To date the series biggest weakness for the light novels has been pacing. Books 4, 5, 7, and 8 are the weakest entries in the currently 13 volume series, and it was primarily because of that fact. A slew of characters for books 4 and 7 in particular were introduced. Many of them weren\u2019t interesting and most of them weren\u2019t important to the plot beyond their respective books.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does glaze over many details from the novels. This works both in its favor and to the vexation of hardcore fans. It skips over many of the details which help make the world feel so alive, while also \u201cfixing\u201d some of the pacing problems a few of the middle volumes in the series had. Season 2 was a good representation of this. This third season adapts volumes 7, 8, 9, so expect more of the same in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s biggest flaw. Although the CGI they use works out in it\u2019s favor at times, particularly with some battles, at other times it can be jarring. Some animation scenes are lazy, such as the one involving Leinas face in a frame. The goblin battle in episode 11 was borderline comical. It\u2019s unfortunate because So-bin, the illustrator for the novels, does a fantastic job. Sometimes it\u2019s good, but there is a lot of mediocrity here as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple of good soundtracks used here and some of the sound effects work well. The English dub is also respectable. Overall it\u2019s good, even if it\u2019s not outstanding. I still think the first season had the best OP and OST. Still good, however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of them, and like any series this can be both good and bad. With so many characters, it\u2019s hard to get significant development on individual characters. When you do get good development, afterwards they may have long absences from the story when the focus shifts to other characters. On the other hand, having so many characters helps make the world feel alive, and with the wide variety, it gives everyone at least a few characters to care about. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned, this series biggest allure is its ridiculously overpowered, nonhuman villain protagonists. Yet neither are they evil for the sake of being evil. They are wholly dedicated to themselves- and if that means killing a few hundred thousand people in the process, then so be it. There\u2019s just something so self-satisfying about seeing a protagonist like that. You don\u2019t get to see that often enough.\\n\\n\r\nI think an understated emotion for any series is that of admiration. When you admire someone, you tend to overlook their flaws. The relationship between Ainz and his subordinates is a tender one. Unsurprisingly, the light novel does a much better job than with developing it\u2019s characters. The anime is only the general story and cuts some details from the novels.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation drags it down, but the story is unique and the characters are engaging enough to keep you invested. Ultimately the most satisfying things in life are the things you didn\u2019t know you wanted until you got it. Overpowered, nonhuman, villain protagonists trying to conquer the world in a high-fantasy setting turned out to be just that. If you love Overlord and are still here for season 3, I highly recommend picking up the light novels ASAP.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n",

            "content": "Franchises like Overlord has a tendency to overrun its ideas with every season. The first season concentrated on Ainz and his goals along with exploring the world fiction while building into the base story. The second season expanded its world although it didn\u2019t exactly live up to its hype when it came to actual character building. Now, here we are. The third season that I crossed my fingers as it\u2019s time for Overlord to prove itself if it\u2019s capable of improving.\r\nRealistically, I came into the third season with moderate expectations. The first episode didn\u2019t exactly get me excited after seeing everyone getting a reintroduction. Ainzis still the same as ever while we see the daily lifestyles of his minions. He is trying to live up to his name even though some of his character behavior comes downright as extremely silly. (I mean, he takes a bath in his \u201cskeletal form\u201d. That\u2019s pretty much throws logic out window) No, what we have here is a season that tries to get fans to invested into the story.\\n\\n\r\nFrequently, I see Overlord\u2019s world as expansive. It explores places with fantasy details that you\u2019d expect from an anime like this and from this season, we visit the Carne Village. Here, we\u2019re introduced to a place where goblins exist. Goblins are a common trend in fantasy shows so seeing them exist this season wasn\u2019t much of an excitement. However, the real attention to pay attention to is a girl named Enri. Serving as a leader of the village, she commits to protect its people and ensure peace. Which is to say, she is a key supporting character this season. One of the more noticeable trends I noticed about Overlord is how it\u2019s able to develop its supporting cast. Enri is a character that I grew to admire for her selflessness and courage. This is especially true with the village facing exterior forces who threatens its peace. Similarly, there\u2019s Nfirea, a character with an inferiority complex yet isn\u2019t afraid to take action when the right time calls for it. \\n\\n\r\nBut meanwhile, there\u2019s also Ainz and his own goals. Supported by his servants and minions, there\u2019s no doubt that world domination is part of their agenda. Yet, Ainz is a calculating character. Despite being incredibly powerful, he isn\u2019t the type that directly goes on the frontlines often. From this season, he commands his servants like Lupisregina on important missions. His other servants such as Demiurge offer their own advice to him. In later episodes, he begins to show a more dominating personality to prove the testament of his powers.\\n\\n\r\nYou better get used to a diverse and growing character cast. In the latter half of the season, we are introduced to Worker Groups of adventurers that includes Foresight, Green Lead, Heavy Masher, and Tenmu. At this point, I feel like it\u2019s where Overlord takes a step back for its character cast. Because let\u2019s face it, some of these characters are going to be jobbed out and treated like fillers. This is proven when some of them fall to victim of the denizens at Nazerick. I can\u2019t even remember some of the names of these adventurers like the one that got tortured by Neuronist Painkill or those killed by monstrous cockroaches. Ainz himself also makes some of these adventurers look fools such as the ones from Foresight. In one particular episode, he shows the difference in their power while crushing all their hope for victory. And to be honest, none of this should come as a surprise. We know how powerful Ainz is and this season continues to prove that. There\u2019s no one who can truly stand a chance against him whether it\u2019s Emperor Jircniv (a character that appeared at end of Season 2) or army by numbers. Even an alliance between The Baharuth Empire and Kingdom\u2019s army feels more like a desperate struggle to survive. When it comes to war, Ainz is able to decimate forces with his powerful arsenal of spells such as summoning death knights and the Dark Young. It\u2019s the type of curb stomp battle that doesn\u2019t last very long. \\n\\n\r\nWith season 3\u2019s unorthodox story structure, I feel like it\u2019s important that they don\u2019t make us forget about its established cast. Remember Albedo or Shalltear from the previous seasons? While they get their moment of fame, it\u2019s definitely not on par when they were first introduced. Others like Sebas is pretty much forgotten despite their development from season 2. To me, that\u2019s a bit of shame since I grew attached to some of the main supporting characters. I do have to admit that Season 3 managed to commit to some of its other supporting cast such as Enri though. Hell, even the goblins became relevant with names given by her. I just wish more characters got treated in such a way.\\n\\n\r\nBy now, the meme of Madhouse not making sequels should be more long disregarded. Not only did Overlord receive a third season but the break is only 3 months. This implied that the second and third season may have been planned as a split cour from the start. Regardless, I feel like Madhouse should\u2019ve committed more time for at least a half year break to boost its production quality. Don\u2019t get me wrong though. The third season definitely had some great visual quality moments especially during some of the battle segments. World building in Overlord still stands out as a prominent feature that people shouldn\u2019t overlook. And those character designs really evoke emotions. Just looking at characters such as Neuronist Painkill or Shalltear\u2019s killing instincts should be enough to get a reaction. Unfortunately, not all reactions for this season will be positive such as the case with the Dark Young. Thanks to the atrocious CGI, their presence reminds me exactly how NOT to adapt character models for a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nThree seasons of light novel adaptations doesn\u2019t come by too easily these days. And often, they get treated poorly with the pacing or omission of content. Overlord doesn\u2019t fall under those pitfalls but still suffers from its character building at times. I\u2019m not going to lie. I enjoy the novels but this adaptations isn\u2019t really a great representation of value. The fact is, Overlord is a reputation by name but is far from perfection.",

This show has amazing potential in its very large cast and dedicates enough time to make you care about them. You WILL be pleased with this season.

            "content": "Basically Sword Art Online for people who are too embarrassed to admit they like Sword Art Online or think they're above it when they're not. Three seasons in, and Overlord III still manages to be as embarrassingly terrible as the series has ever been. Apparently Madhouse managed to split up the budget for one cour worth into three, and it really shows. How this series is still so popular despite Madhouse's awful adaptation and the original material's abysmal writing can be very easily described in two words: Power fantasy.\r\nBut what makes this particular power fantasy so profitable and appealing? \r\nIt's the fact that the protagonistis a spooky skeleton man with very stereotypical villainous role archetype assets. Ability to summon undead minions? Powers that generally involve darkness(tm) and death? Completely loyal evil minions that are comically cynical towards humans and also have similar abilities, all with their own gimmicks? He's got them all, and kids love him. There's a reason why something like \"Dark Flame Master\" is a running joke in shows like Chuunibyou, and it's because it's pretty common for kids to love the bad guys more than the good guys. They have cool abilities, look cool, and act cool! It's every kid's dream to be Dark Flame Master. But does that mean every Overlord fan is a kid or a manchild? Not necessarily. The series does have some merit, but it's certainly not the animation or the writing. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty abysmal- The OP animation is incredibly lazily made, and the ED animation is just a slideshow of still images, which goes to demonstrate how little budget went into the show. Add that up with constant stillshots of Ainz's completely unmoving skeleton face and just embarrassingly common usage of bad looking CGI in nearly every episode, and one could feasibly argue that Madhouse really did split the budget for one cour into three. Even the worst of the worst harem isekai shows tend to have fairly impressive, or at the very least, decent looking openings to pull people in, but it seems that Madhouse knew their fans will eat this shit up regardless of how little money they spend on it. There's quite literally nothing positive to say about the animation. The soundtrack is pretty mediocre, and doesn't really distinguish itself from other similar shows, which is also a disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is the writing of the show, which is easily the worst part of the series. \\n\\n\r\nConceptually, this should be interesting- It's supposed to be a story from the perspective of the villainous protagonist, which is genuinely rare. Sure, there are plenty of stories where the main character is some variation of demon lord or whatever, but at the end of the day, they still end up being no different from just any generic isekai harem protagonist. Did Ainz manage to separate himself from this common trend? Sure, if being a cardboard with a different coat of paint counts as a separation from the norm.\\n\\n\r\nThe issue with telling a story from a villain's perspective is that it's not very easy to make the protagonist likable for the audience to care about. Essentially, when a character becomes too villainous, they become harder to be relatable because they would have to be borderline sociopaths, and the focus shifts from the character to what the character does. One exception to this would be if the character's motives were interesting or empathetic, but Ainz's motives are boring as shit and he's more or less just going by what his minions tell him, so sadly he doesn't make the list. Ainz has never been interesting as a character, and the focus has always been on the spectacle of what he does with his power, rather than him as a character. Basically, he's barely a character, and the power he wields is more of a character than Ainz himself. If a main  protagonist is solely defined by their power, then the writing has already irredeemably failed. \\n\\n\r\nThe another issue with this is how this different perspective affects the antagonists of the series, who would naturally be heroes, and rarely other villains that belong to other factions nobody cares about. When the focus is mainly on the villainous protagonist, it becomes difficult to portray the would-be heroic antagonists as anything but generic \"good\" guys. Normally this wouldn't be too much of an issue by itself, but yet another major problem makes this a significant issue: Lack of an actual antagonist. Throughout all three seasons, there hasn't been a single character that was a credible threat to Ainz that also had consistent screentime to get proper development past their character page description. Not only does this make every encounter completely predictable, but it also kills any anticipation for what could happen next because the outcome is always preordained. And when there isn't an antagonist that fits this criteria, then every heroic antagonist ends up being just carbon copies of another with no distinguishable feature of their own beyond surface-level general characterization and motive. And if they're not going to be dynamic characters, it makes them harder to empathize with, which in turn, doesn't make them seem interesting to be distinguishable from every other character. They're essentially cardboards that just say some cliche'd throwaway lines that a typical protagonist would say, and that's all there is to them. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, villains generally don't need much screentime to begin with, because most of the time, their villainy is portrayed just through their villainous actions. Meanwhile, heroic characters need them, because heroism is a trait that requires empathy. Instead, Maruyama decided that it was a smarter idea to make more irrelevant fodders for Ainz to defeat and conquer, and devote way too much time into their vague, generic characterization that will stop mattering after their inevitable loss. If the writing is good, empathy for the characters should ideally come naturally through storytelling that actually adds to the plot, rather than attempting to force it through Overlord's patented method of wasting your goddamn time telling you about how Tom loves his kids and how he's the family man. \\n\\n\r\nWhen that isn't happening, it's devoted for long inner monologues about the antagonists to think about how strong Ainz and his minions must be, which Ainz and his minions do for themselves already, which just makes it incredibly repetitive and pointless. It's just shit writing at its finest. And the lack of credible, persisting threat makes every arc feel like a filler arc that serves very little to no purpose to whatever the overarching story is, which is why all three seasons of this series are nearly indistinguishable from each other. The common defense for this is \"But Ainz is the threat!\" but that completely misses the point. The heroes should ideally be a constant threat to the villains as much as the villains are a constant threat to the heroes. One sided victories are boring as shit when villains are the ones doing it just like how it's boring when shounen protagonists always win in the end. \\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that neither an overpowered protagonist nor a story told from a villainous perspective is inherently bad. It's the combination of the two being handled incompetently at the same time that puts the writing of this series into absolute trash territory. Sadly, Maruyama is a terrible writer, and Overlord as a series is like watching a grown man playing with his action figures alone in his room while indulging himself in the same old dance that he's done a million times with his self-insert Skeleton Stu that never loses, which really does reflect in Ainz as a character. Maybe this is some galaxy brain tier 4th wall poetry and all Maruyama wants is for his friends to play DnD with him again. \\n\\n\r\nBut just because the writing is complete garbage doesn't mean it doesn't have any merit- One of the most common misconceptions is that something bad can't be enjoyable, which is why a lot of people will really reach to defend the poor writing if they enjoyed the series. Most common method is to cite the original source and pretend it's better than the adaptation when it's pretty much just as bad. I mean, if they enjoyed it, clearly it must have been good! Somehow! You just didn't GET it. But that's just childish narcissism, and a lot of people fail to understand or just refuse to admit that trashy writing can still be fun. While Overlord may be just as poorly written as Sword Art Online, what it has over SAO is that the spectacle is sometimes genuinely fun to watch when the focus of the series isn't on the side characters, albeit repetitive and poorly animated. And that's basically what the appeal of power fantasy is- Watching smug protagonists stay smug while watching smug antagonists getting blown up.",

Now there is just a village full of weak, needy, annoying, and UNNECESSARY characters. From a little potion maker who is on his way to making a potion 1/100 as useful as those made by Ainz to a weak and pointless village chief who is therefor literally no reason other than Ainz gave her a damn flute full of weak goblins. This entire season so far has been pointless. Why are Ainz's extremely OP maids risking their lives just to save these little shits? I don't care about the village, I don't care about the goblins, and I absolutely don't care about this useless diplomacy with a government that Ainz could crumble with a snap of his fingers. I see no point in their complete reroute from \"take the world by force\" to \"lets just protect these humans that we have made it extremely clear that we despise.\" Isn't the whole point of the show that Ainz has no emotions and is now a skeleton bent on ruling the world? WHERE IS THAT? It's like it went from Game of Thrones OP version to a video of a really long and really boring NATO conference. What I'm trying to say is that they need to bring back the entertaining parts because they are making an entertaining series boring and stupid with all the comedy and the incorporation of useless and weak side characters who bring nothing to the table. Kill off the side characters and let Ainz rule the world, that's all I ask for.",

            "content": "Overlords 3rd season continues the overrated story of anime\u2019s most beloved skeleton without facial animations.\r\nVERDICT: 3 \u2013 Bad.\r\nSTORY: Slow, boring and confusing.\r\n3rd season starts with a filler episode and proceeds with mediocrity and boredom from then on. The drive behind every action in this show is not apparent to the viewer, so that in the end I was questioning the events happening on screen. Why was Ainz destroying Carne Village again? \r\nNext topic is the pacing. Boi does this season move S L O W. In addition, it is void of any substance, significant characterization or development. Noteworthy action \u2013 also nonexistent. \r\nCHARACTERS: Huh? \r\nWeget to see more reoccurring characters in this season, Overlord himself being one of them, since his presence in the 2nd season was minimal. Maybe it was this long absence from the viewer, but Mr Momonga turned into a sadistic psycopath. It was hinted, that due to his undead nature Ainz loses affection towards humans, however presented changes are sudden and harsh, some in between stages would make this development plausible. Oh, and he got another name tagged on to his greatness. What a conceptional disaster. \\n\r\nThe second most important character is the blond girl from the 1st season, whatever her name was. Well, she develops some useful skills, reasoning behind this development is yet unknown. \\n\r\nEveryone else is just there as a requisite. \\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION: Wouldn\u2019t look good 15 years ago. \\n\r\nCharacter models are inconsistent and backgrounds thrive in mediocrity. Animation did not strain the budget either. Just like horrific CGI. Mass produced soldiers, goblins, skeletons or ogres look unbelievably bad, nothing you would expect in 2018: especially those abominations in episode 12.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: They gave up. \\n\r\nIt feels like everyone on this project, be it voice actors or music composers, have enough of this IP. Music is more of the same, sound design got worse or even laughable. Voice act is boring. I was missing new impusles or joy from involved stuff. Then episode 12 happened and I wanted to stab my ears \u2013 well done.\\n\\n\r\nOne day before the final episode aired, I got a chance to see \u201cTensei shitara Slime Datta Ken\u201d. The amount of emotions or joy blue slime blob shows in 15 minutes surpasses 3 seasons of Overlord. If you are looking for \u201cIsekai\u201d anime with an overpowered non-human protagonist and noticeably better production quality, I suggest the story of the slime. \\n",

            "content": "If you fell in love with watching Ainz explore the world as the adventure Momonga trying to spread his name, doing quests, interacting with different characters and doing epic shit- basically everything that made Overlord season 1 enjoyable and garnered so much popularity in the first place, well you can kiss that goodbye. Warning, spoilers included.\r\nEverything that was enjoyable about the first season goes downhill in the second season. In this season, that\u2019s where it goes to shit. The story shifts it\u2019s focus once again onto the side characters, politics, how Ainz affects the world and world building. If you\u2019ve watched season 2, that seemsto be the premise of Overlord now. However, the writer can\u2019t even do that right and fails at every turn.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: (1/10):\\n\r\nAssuming you\u2019ve seen the previous seasons already, I\u2019ll keep this brief:\\n\r\nAinz is a neet, self-insert, overpowered Overlord to everyone in Nazarick. Here he\u2019s worshipped and adored by his guardians as they treat him like a god who can do no wrong, and Ainz assumes the role of being a supreme ruler. Ainz\u2019s motivation becomes doing what he believes best benefits Nazarick instead of focusing on I don\u2019t know... trying to find a way back home (because fuck that when you\u2019re a Overlord amirite?)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot this season? There\u2019s not much of a story. It just so happens that all of the events Ainz has committed and the fame he\u2019s spread across the world as Momonga was conveniently all setup for his master plan to rule the world or at least that\u2019s what Demiurge says and Ainz agrees. It\u2019s poor writing, I know.\\n\\n\r\nThe first step for Ainz to rule the world is to create his own country and to do that he needs a village to test on for reasons unclear. The first 7 episodes focuses on Carne Village. The next few episodes focuses on these workers who get staged by Ainz to try invade Nazarick so he can kill them for trespassing and use it as an excuse to start a war. The plan was so awful that I stopped caring. The rest of the season focuses on the Empire, the newly founded Sorcerer Kingdom led by Ainz, and the war where they demanded the Kingdom cede over the city of E-Rantel. \\n\\n\r\nThe arcs follow the same repetitive formula of introducing a bunch of new characters e.g. a new race/species, spend a couple of episodes giving them screentime and then have Ainz or his guardians either enslave or kill them. Rinse and repeat and you have Overlord. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1/10):  \\n\r\nWhat do you already know about Ainz and the guardians? Well, it\u2019s pretty much the same this season. They receive no meaningful character development or exploration, since it focuses on the uninteresting side characters that you\u2019ll end up forgetting once you\u2019ve watched this season. \\n\\n\r\nThe side stories are awful. Every time the POV shifts from Ainz it\u2019s infuriatingly boring because the side characters we spend several episodes with are bland, weak and uneccessary.\\n\\n\r\nEnri is a cliche, \u201cnice\u201d village girl who everyone loves and becomes the village chief because the plot required her to. Otherwise no sane person would put a village girl in charge. Enri is a clear case of writers pet, getting everything handed to her (becoming the village chief and now owning her own massive goblin army) because she\u2019s a plot device to show the progression of the village. Nphi is a beta potion boy who\u2019s a pussy and has a crush on Enri. If you thought the lizard men were bad, the goblins are another level of trash. The goblins are  so one dimensional, their only trait is arguing about who likes Enri more. At least a few of the lizard men had some depth to them, these goblins don\u2019t even have names ffs.\\n\\n\r\nThe workers are one dimensional forgettable fodder who\u2019s only role is to jobb against Ainz for trespassing, be killed for shock value, and to remind us how \u201cevil he is\u201d. Arche\u2019s the only one we learn a bit about with her being broke and wanting to take her sisters away from her parents, but that\u2019s about it. Oh yeah, there\u2019s a bootleg Gilgamesh too\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (1/10):\\n\r\nIt\u2019s as if Madhouse realised that Overlord goes to shit after s1 and stop putting effort in because the animation has declined as well. The art is worse this season than s2. The CGI is Berserk (2016) levels of trash e.g. look up Ainz massacre 70 000 soldiers instantly and you\u2019ll see how laughably bad it was. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I can overlook bad CGI as long as the writing is great. However, Overlord hasn\u2019t been delivering in that aspect either. LN readers kept overhyping \u201cSPLAT SPLAT SPLAT!\u201d for weeks, but I wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it if it had OPM tier animation. The \u201cslaughter fest\u201d of Ainz massacring 70k soldiers in a instant and ugly ass goats stomping generic, snobby nobles was shock value and another excuse for Ainz to flex how overwhelmingly overpowered he is compared to everyone. \u201cSasuga Ainz-Sama!!1!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSounds (3/10):\\n\r\nThe opening is one of the few saving graces of this season. S3\u2019s opening is one of my favourites so far. However, the OSTs are pretty much the same as the previous seasons, uninspired and forgettable.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1/10):\\n\r\nHonestly, I hated this season. The fact that there\u2019s no struggle whatsoever in Overlord and that all the strongest characters are serving under Ainz has made me come to despise this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhere are the guild players? Will there ever be a real threat?\\n\\n\r\nAinz and his guardians are so ridiculously overpowered that every fight/conflict is always the same repetitive, one-sided, curb stomp that it\u2019s not even fun to watch anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no semblance of stakes, tension or difficulty for anything they do. The weaker characters can\u2019t even outsmart Ainz because he\u2019s always 5 steps ahead and his plans always go off without a hitch. Idc about how great \u2018muh world building\u2019 is, or how Ainz affects the world because knowing that he\u2019ll always come out on top has made the story become boring and predictable. There\u2019s no plot twist to spice up the story. It\u2019s wish fulfilment, nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nAinz can just launch a full scale attack using all his guardians and be done with conquering the world in a month or two, find out the information about his friends and solve the mystery to go home. Yet we are dragging on to what would seem 100+ episodes, across multiple seasons on giving screentime and developing all these uneccesary side characters (e.g. lizardmen, goblins) who will always end up being fodder compared to the gods that are fighting (Ainz & the guardians). The writer tries to come up with some convenient, shitty reason of \u2018Ainz not wanting to rule by power/fear\u2019, but he\u2019s supposed to be a evil protagonist!\\n\\n\r\nOverall (1/10):\\n\r\nOverlord has devolved into a dragged out, pointless story with uninteresting side characters, uneccessary horny scenes with Albedo & Shaltear, and the guardians sucking off how great Ainz is all the damn time. We get it! \u201cSasuga Ainz-Sama!\u201d has gotten old and is just annoying at this point. Overlord is simply a emotionless, evil skeleton and his giant harem killing everyone who opposes them like they\u2019re squashing ants.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t fathom why fans praise Overlord so much, giving it such high reviews because \u201cmuh world building\u201d, despite it being a typical, power fantasy isekai about a overpowered, Gary Stu MC who\u2019s the magic user equivalent to Kirito.",

            "content": "Based on the reviews, you will either love or hate this show. I already gave a couple of chances with the show, but I failed to like any single detail about it. If I could describe this show, it would be like this: a knight plans a great adventure, yet he moves around insignificant villages to bully peasants with very slow pace. Peasants from other villages don't care about his power, so few of them gather and attack him no matter that he's got thick armor and a powerful sword. He beats them and other peasants. That's what Overlord is about, if you like anoverpowered protagonist who flexes to everyone around after a long drama, you may like this show.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the story is poor as usual. It's so prolonged that it's painful to watch, a simple event lasts episodes, full of insignificant events, characters and other stuff. The same formula from previous seasons, lots of long moments where everyone adores Ainz, the moments where something happens and Ainz goes there, long drama starts, new characters are introduced, a drama before action, Ainz snaps his finger and enemies are dead, the end. It's also little odd that Ainz spent time on adventures to spread his name and power, yet some kingdom hasn't heard of him and, of course, played ignorant role - \"hey, let's destroy this nobody!\", like every other enemy of Ainz in previous seasons. Also... All the events are done to show his power, no matter that they are recycled over and over, ignoring the logic and some characters lose their brain for a while to do something stupid which would just keep the image of Ainz being the most powerful being in the world.\\n\\n\r\nAfter giving rights on One Punch Man to focus on Overlord, I was stunned that Madhouse came up with this, a studio which has made some great shows and movies. The art is mediocre at its best, but CGI is horrendous. The sound is so-so, nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are flat like in previous seasons. The continuous problem with the show is that way too many characters are introduced, only simple premises are shown (whether they do stuff for money, fame or duty) and they don't last long at all, after some generic chit-chat they enter combat and die. The harem continues to adore Ainz all the time and make pathetic threats to humans who are trying to fight Ainz. Ainz doesn't seem much like a generic harem wimpy protagonist, but that's mostly because the focus is more on things outside Nazarick. We don't learn anything new about Ainz and the harem, all the new characters are on the spot and get thrown away after they made their purpose to make Ainz look powerful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? The show could have been fit in one episode. It's way too long, the conversations are dull and boring, the \"action\" is done in an instant. I don't even know what this show is supposed to be - a shounen, a harem, a comedy, a dark themed show, a fantasy world, a drama? The harem characters are shows as cute and innocent at one moment, the next moment they are horny and want to please Ainz, later they try to look scary and threaten some people. You cannot mix so many things without a bad outcome, I don't know whether LN is like that, even if it is, anime creators should have picked two themes, for example dark fantasy, that could work. Not so many elements to make everything last long and pathetic attempts of comedy or dark moments which confused me that I wondered what was I watching. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch or read something with fantasy theme, check out Warhammer, LOTR or Dungeons and Dragons, unless you want a pathetic story about an overpowered protagonist who beats nobodies to prove himself that he's the most powerful being in the world.",

We didnt really get any interactins with the supreme being i feel like. \r\nIf your looking for an isekai anime i would reccomend overlord most of the time because it's way better then most isekai anime's i have seen. \r\nWhat i didnt really like about season 3 is that it's kind of getting repetitive. Ainz is trying to bullshit his way out of the questions of the supremebeing's. We see him trying to expand his territory. It's getting kind of boring honestly. \\n\\n\r\nOverlord needs to end with a bang like in the first season.",

The 24 minute episode force Madhouse to have to cut out a lot of stuff making this inconsistent story. People sometimes say to read the light novel but that is just silly. Why should you need to read a whole book to just understand a show. If all parts of the story were to be in the show it would go well beyond the 24 minute mark so they have to cut some content but that sometimes just breaks theimmersion. Not only that but the world building episodes are often long and boring. World building is necessary yes, but in this case the anime spent way too long on it and focused solely on it. It became more of a side story than anything making it feel like a filler episode. \\n\\n\r\n(For anime only watchers I recommend reading Djinn's Posts in the Reddit Discussion of Overlord III episodes Just Google Overlord 3 episode # discussion and scroll down till you find his post)\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nFor the most part, the art is great, everything looked nice and was quite beautiful, however, the CG was to say the least, unrealistic. Especially in episode 11, (Which at the time of this review, is the latest episode) the anime did a nice job of portraying the numbers of the army, but each of the models looked so bland and unrealistic, the movement was fine, but it just did not fit with the art style. Pulling me out of the immersion\\n\\n\r\nSound(10/10)\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are phenomenal and I do like the soundtrack quite a bit. I never felt like the sound was distracting, but enhancing the overall the experience. Although I can not recall a specific time, I got chills whenever a character is overwhelmed at a sight of a huge army or absolute power.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(9/10)\\n\r\nIf anything, the world building also helped shape the character building. We get a good sense of what the characters personalities are just from their design but when the show goes more in depth we see it more or see a hidden side (Such as lupus's sadistic nature).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10)\\n\r\nI did enjoy the show quite a bit, from Ainz's show of power, the ironic humor, and the not so humorous death of the workers. 24 minutes of content felt like only 5 and I was always eager to watch the newest episode. If anything the part I did not enjoy was a the slow pace of the world building but that is about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9/10)\\n\r\nThe combination of Characterization, Art, and sound help elevate the story and the only things holding it back is the CG and its own time constraint.",

Do you remember the lizardmen? The giant Hamster? Tuare? Maybe, probably not though. Not even their names.\r\nThey took up so much screen time and then become unimportant, it's not interesting anymore.\r\nUnfortunately, S3 follows the same path, and only a handful of episodes are actually progressing the story, while 80% of the anime is \"fillers\"\r\nI've been told many times that it'sfor \"World Building\" but one does not come at the cost of another. See One Piece, and Made in Abyss to some extent. Both have worldbuilding that comes along with an actual story. \\n\\n\r\nWe still don't know anything about the \"other players\" that might've been Isekai'd as well, and Ainz is the same geek who plays like a lord. And ofc everyone wants his D.\\n\\n\r\nThere are no more cool adventures of Adventurer Momonga like in S1, it's just \"Let's slaughter people because it 'Benefits Nazarick'\" now.\\n\\n\r\nCombine it with horrible CGI and here you go, a recipe for disaster.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing, imagine the titans in AoT.

            "content": "Cheap isekai anime has ravaged the industry for a number of years now. Without a working vaccine, the disease continues to kill the brain cells of viewers everywhere. The Sasuga Skeletor Sama Series is just another symptom of this plague. \r\nThe story has been done thousands of times. It's the generic MC self insert type of story. I can literally predict the outcome of every episode after about two minutes since nothing will ever stump Skeletor Sama. He will always achieve victory no matter what. He would conquer the world in 7 days but apparently the author thinks resisting the urge of dicking around inhis harem should be the main obstacle Skeletor Sama needs to overcome throughout the series. After three seasons I still have no idea where this show is going. Then the realization dawned on me. The point of the show is not to actually tell a good story, but for the author to mentally masturbate onto a piece of paper so the target audience will lap up the discharge like a bunch of coco addicts trying to snort a bag of baking soda. \\n\\n\r\nSkeletor Sama is the character equivalent of play-doh. He will change and do whatever seems the edgiest and coolest in the moment. Side characters are irrelevant since the series is focusing on Skeletor Sama himself. They will either circlejerk how they want to bone him or get killed and have only one or two episodes of screen time. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I think studio Madhouse did brilliantly is saving a ton of money not animating Skeletor Sama. If not for the sound and subtitles changing on the bottom of the screen I would have thought that my internet went out whenever Skeletor Sama is on screen. I was wondering why this show looks Master of Ragnarok tier despite it being popular and lucrative enough to have three seasons until I realized that both shows takes place in Yggdrasil where things look cheap and lacking in pixels.\\n\\n\r\nI totally get it. We all occasionally want to just turn off our brain and watch a show like this when we are bored. Sometimes we do have no other choice but to pull over at that really dirty KFC on the side of the road at 3 in the morning. But why would I do that when Popeyes and Church's are just next door, are cheaper, and doesn't taste like diarrhea? There are 40-50 shows airing every single season and are you seriously telling me that you cannot find a single other show on that list that will be a better time spent than watching this?\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I would just like to say thank mr skeltal for the good bones and calcium to heal my head after slamming it on my desk thinking about the possibility of this getting a fourth season.",

            "content": "This is a very troubled, very flawed anime with many many many problems. It is also extremely frustrating to watch. \r\n*sighs*\r\nThe main issue is that it is In DIRE need of a better director. The pacing is shot, and too many times the anime starts building up for something important, then the important scene suddenly happens offscreen, is botched in some crazy way, or fail to deliver. Every time you think... but it'll get better! Just soon! Just around the corner! The one awesome episode is nearly there! And then it ends, and you realize that you watched 13 episodes of teasing and cliffhangers thatresulted in nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is that it utilizes really badly done CG visuals. There are titles that know how to use CG well (for example, Sidonia no Kishi, Ajin 1st season, Seikai Suru Kado)... but this is not one of them. CG monsters look like cel-shaded video game characters, and are not impressive. And there are a lot of CG monsters. I also suspect that they blew half their animation budget on certain creature, judging how horrible certain soldiers looked in comparison. \\n\\n\r\nThe most irritating thing is that through all that mess you see glimpses of genius now and then, but the glimpses never blossom into anything bigger. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose at this point I should jsut read the damn sourrce material in japanese. It looks like the writer was onto something, it is just anime isn't good in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nDetailed breakdown below:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nGood things about it is that we have villain protagonists, malevolent protagonist, monster protagonists... this is a breath of fresh air. Sometimes it results in pointlessly brutal sequences that don't see to have any real reason to be there, and characters being intorduced only to be killed off by protagonsits (in a horrible way), but.... it is possible to live with that.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad part of the whole thing is horrible slow pacing, and too much teasing, playing bait and switch and displaying important events offscreen. Remember how in 2nd season certain grand battle with sebastian happened offscreen? Same happens here too. Basically, the anime tries to build up, then slow things down, stretch story arc out, and when you think it is about to deliver something amazing, it fails to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to 1st and 2nd season there is significantly small number of \"awesome!!\" moments, to the point where I'm not sure if it was worth watching at all.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, it badly needs better director. There's something good in the source material, just the anime should've been better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nA lot more CG in this season, and CG is quite bad. I mean, it wasn't great in 2nd season either, but there wasn't a whole lot of it, but now it is in every frame to the point of being eyesore.\\n\\n\r\nCG Animation is bad, with awkward movement, and  certain models look extremely cheap. They definitely haven't gotten hang of this tech in this season. \\n\\n\r\nCertain special effects look like they were lifted straight from the nineties, to be honest. They definitely should take a look at Ajin (1st season), Sidonia no Kishi, and nother CG anime. To see how the technology can be used in better way. Hell, just Guilty Gear Xrd Sign would teach them a lot.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10: Nothing outstanding, although on occasion some themes are real nice. The anime doesn't let those tunes play for long, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10:\\n\r\nI spent most of the time being irritated by poor directing, so I don't remember much about them. Which means they're not very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10:\\n\r\nConstant bait and switch with teasing cliffhangers, promises of amazing events around the corner, which fail to materialize. All. The. Time. This results in extreme irritation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10;\\n\\n\r\nI didn't like it at all. The anime did spark my interest in source material, but it is too poorly done to recommend it. Might be worth a watch if you're bored out of your mind or something.",

            "content": "First of all, I have to mention that the original story is great. This anime adaptation however is an abomination and clear cash grab trying to profit from a dedicated fan base. I'm going to keep this review short because I can not be bothered.\r\nJust search \"Overlord goblin army cgi\" on YouTube and you can deduce my opinion. The show is filled with stuff like this. For a bit more of a rant and a more grounded opinion, read below:\r\nStory: This adaptation suffers from major pacing issues. While the original story is great, the anime can not do it justice. While we are shown thedark side of Ains' campaign to conquer the world, we also have to sit through several episodes of failed character building for the people of Carne Village. It's slow, it's boring but there was potential for these characters. Madhouse just squandered that potential.\\n\\n\r\nArt: What art? The story is plagued with bad CGI, to the point that is seems to want to compete with Berserk for worst CGI of the last decade. It might even win that competition as even Berserk knew that some stylisation was required, but here an army consisting of a single copy-pasted soldiers just bounces of a shield wall, like cartoon characters. The thing is, this is no cartoon. Like I said previously, just search  \"Overlord goblin army cgi\" on YouTube\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: awful story pacing and truly bad CGI squanders the potential of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: not bad, not great. As usual, both the OP and ED are good, though seasons 1 and 2 were better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  and overall score: I could not enjoy this show due to the disrespect of studio Madhouse in regards to this show and its fanbase. The only reason I watched this show to completion is because the underlying potential is great. But I now regret waiting for it and not reading the LN instead",

            "content": "This is the first time I've ever felt about reviewing a particular show on MAL. Perhaps, my love for this show is significantly greater than any show in existence? What I\u2019m about to state in this review is relatively the truth... \r\nAlright, so what's Overlord III about? What has Ainz-sama achieved so far till this season? What were the main events that took place before this season? Has the premise of the series changed?\r\nTHIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN MILD SPOILERS.\r\nSo, previously in the first season we see Momonga somehow \"mysteriously\" getting teleported to a new world or getting trapped into a game called Dive Massively MultiplayerOnline Role Playing Game, also known as DMMO-RPG Yggdrasil (while Yggdrasil being the new release of the game), on which he spent his whole life at, and finally created the guild weapon, the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown, a symbol of the guild namely Ainz Ooal Gown. Now when the game\u2019s about to see its end, we see the guild members leaving the guild, and hoping to spend their lives much better since they had spent most of their life on this game, which they realized was worth nothing. Momonga, being the guild master, was quite furious over the shutdown of the game and blamed his guild members for not spending their last moment with the game. And calling them traitors, when they actually had spent their whole time on the game and without their efforts, the Overlord, Ainz-sama would\u2019ve never achieved such strength and power. Or shall I say such arrogance and ignorance? Now being teleported to a new world, and being shocked at how this event took place. Momonga summons his guardians and orders Sebas, the butler, to investigate the surrounding of the great tomb of Nazarick. And see if they had really been teleported to a mysterious place/world, while ordering the floor guardians to stay on guard. Then we see Momonga-sama taking a tour of the first floor in his great tomb and being discovered by Demiurge. We see Demiurge outsmarting Momonga-sama. Which outrightly surprises Momonga-sama. But being the great overlord, it also meant him being \u201call-knowing\u201d and he just couldn\u2019t let any of his harem members realize that. Now, while being accompanied by Demiurge, Momonga-sama utters, \u201c...taking over the world might be enjoyable.\u201d Which he obviously didn\u2019t mean it at all, but Demiurge was really surprised and felt outclassed by such thoughts of Momonga-sama. Thus being a side premise of this season. \\n\\n\r\nContinuing on, we see Momonga-sama using the Mirror of Remote Viewing magic item. Where he notices a village being attacked by the knights. To which Momonga-sama rushes to their aid, of course, not with the \u201ctrue\u201d intentions of saving them. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to call himself an evil overlord in front of his harem. Now Momonga-sama outclasses every knight, and chases them away and meets the Royal Head Warrior, Gazef Stronoff. Now the Slane Theocracy strikes back with a trump card at their hands, a 7th tier magic item. Which again is outclassed by the great Momonga-sama. After the visit to the Carne Village, Momonga-sama decides to change his name to Ainz-sama i.e. the guild name. To which the sole purpose was to spread this name, the name of the guild, and see if he meets anyone else in the new world. His objective was to explore this world and see if there were other players from Yggdrasil, and trying to figure out how he could return back to his own world. Which was the main premise of the season.\\n\\n\r\nNow Ainz-sama orders Sebas Tian and Solution to explore more about this world. And orders Shaltear to accompany him. While him visiting the E-Rantel Fortress City accompanied by Narberal Gamma, one of the maid pleiades, as wanting to be adventurers. To spread the name of Momon, the great adventurer, and again to gain knowledge about the new world. The potion given to one of the adventurers by Momon is taken to the best pharmacist. To which to her surprise is the potion that has the healing abilities of a God. Thus, leading to the meeting of Nphirea with the great Momon-san and Ainz-sama. Momon-san joins a guild for new adventures, since those adventures were of no match to him. Also, so that they could be witnesses to the power of Momon-san, the future\u2019s greatest adventurer. But now, even Ainz-sama or Momon-san isn\u2019t perfect, Clementine, a member of the Slane Theocracy, ruins the plan of the great Momon-san by killing all of the adventurers. To which Ainz-sama responds to by crushing her to death, and killing the rest of her comrades. Meanwhile, we see Shaltear, Sebas and Solution on their mission. And at the middle of their travel, a group of mercenaries halt the carriage and attempt to take them to their place. But they are massacred by them, and later they find out the nest of the humans that attacked them. Now Solution and Sebas part ways from Shaltear. And Shaltear heads towards the nest of the humans to test out the skills of Brain Unglaus, a man who knew martial arts and had fought Gazef on equal terms. To her surprise, is disappointed by the the abilities of Brain as he even fails to pass as a nail clipper. Now Shaltear absorbs all the blood, she had gathered by killing the humans and goes berserk. Massacring even the adventurers who arrived to explore the base of the soldiers turned mercenaries. Until she recovers by seeing the red potion, the potion which Ainz-sama had given to an adventurer. And discovers that the adventurers were actually split in two teams, and the second team was already headed to E-Rantel. Knowing that, she immediately chases them in her blood-frenzy mode. At the end someone amongst that group casted a mind-control spell on her, causing her to revolt against Ainz-sama. Accepting the quest as Momon, Ainz-sama heads towards Shaltear for battle. During this battle we see how great Ainz-sama is, completely surpassing Shaltear. And later revives her and plans to use Sebas and Solution as decoys. Sasuga Ainz-sama was secondarily the premise of the series.\\n\\n\r\nNow outraged by the brainwashing of the only loli in his harem, Ainz-sama immediately launches an attack on the lizardmen. And completely overwhelms them and kills the leaders of the tribe. And makes them accept him as their ruler. This arc was of no importance to the series. The whole event took four episodes of the season. Afterwards, we see the second season focusing on Sebas and on the kingdom. Which again was of no significance. Overlord sure knows how to waste its time on insignificant bullshit. The rest of the season focuses on the Eight fingers. Who are captured by Ainz-sama and are experimented on by his harem. While capturing them, Entoma, one of the insects in the harem, suffers a serious damage by the adamantite adventurers. Who\u2019s later saved by Jaldabaoth, the Demon Emperor. At the end, we see Momon emerges as the greatest adventurer of the world. Since he defeats the great Jaldabaoth. And adds another member to his harem i.e. Evil Eye. Perhaps, the only two lolis in his harem? In this season \u201cSasuga Ainz-sama\u201d had become more or less a primary premise of the series. The second season itself had so many plot holes, but since the review is about the third season, I\u2019ll only mention the least concerning one in my eyes. That is, no one ever questioned Momon-san about how was he able to beat Jaldabaoth, a magic caster whose power level was of 66+ according to Evil Eye, without casting away his humanity? There\u2019s no way a human could beat such monster. Yet no one bothered asking him anything. And if they had Ainz would\u2019ve had to reveal his identity. Of course, they wouldn\u2019t either, since the whole show is just \u201cSasuga Ainz-sama\u201d or \u201cSasuga Momon-sama.\u201d Ainz sure knows how to get praised in every single form. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\\n\r\nThis season begins with a filler episode; the only episode which was actually worth watching in the whole season. In the episode, it\u2019s revealed how massive the harem of Ainz-sama is; completely unparalleled, incomparable to any harem anime in existence. After the first episode, the story begins its focus on the objective of Nazarick. And thus, the words that Ainz-sama had uttered in the first season. Now Ainz-sama trying to outsmart his harem clearly fails, and then tries to play along their plans, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be an evil overlord. In simple words, being controlled by them since he\u2019s supposed to be \u201call-knowing\u201d and great, otherwise, you know, he really wouldn\u2019t be the Sasuga. And the whole premise is \u201cSasuga Ainz-sama.\u201d The show either forgets its main aim or just casts it away since \u201cSasuga Ainz-sama\u201d is a very important premise. \\n\\n\r\nIn this season, we see Ainz desperately trying to prove he\u2019s the only Sasuga in the world. He tries to stoop to the lowest level just to prove he\u2019s the Sasuga, instead of acting like all-knowing or all-whatever. This season shows that the whole plot of Overlord isn\u2019t as complex as it was meant or shown to be in the first season. From watching this show, it has become clearly evident that it\u2019s just Ainz-sama and his harem squashing ants. And the series gives off the vibes as if even an amatuer could come up with such a mediocre setting. \\n\\n\r\nSince the first season we\u2019ve been seeing Ainz desperately trying to appeal and please his harem. And now, he even goes further by killing and torturing innocent people and accusing them of being evil. Ainz still thinks about his image, despite getting such loyalty and devotion. They wouldn\u2019t dare say \u201cAinz-sama are you really an evil overlord\u201d? He\u2019s already a god for them. At this point he shouldn\u2019t care about what his harem thinks and just give them orders, yet he doesn\u2019t dare so. Ainz, despite being an evil overlord, still worries about meaningless things.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing on, this series has no plot. We\u2019re constantly introduced to new characters, we get entire episodes of how their lives are, their aim, who they love, etc. What has happened to this series? Why should I care about the ants which will indefinitely get squashed? Ainz will without a doubt rule the world, their fates are sealed from the very beginning. Everyone will either submit to his will or get killed/tortured by him and his harem. This show keeps on introducing more and more insignificant characters who are killed miserably usually with one hit from even the least powerful members of the great tomb of Nazarick. This is a waste of time, yet the show still gets dragged on pointlessly. Ainz can easily conquer the whole world without even using a fraction of his power, yet he and his harem play from the shadows. Plus, the whole series is very slow-paced.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a very terrible character development. For example take the four episodes in the second season, where we were introduced to lizardmen, their lifestyles, who they love, what they wish, etc. and then they get killed and become test subjects. The third season also does the same, this season has been nothing but a waste of time. Where time is spent on developing minor characters who have no future and will contribute nothing to the plot since no matter what Ainz will have his way and they\u2019ll either get killed, experimented, or becomes slaves; just like lizardmen contributed nothing and their struggle i.e. the drama was pointless and useless. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 2\\n\\n\r\nThe 3D animation looks very cheap and is of extremely low quality. For a third season, this is completely unforgivable. And as for the rest, it\u2019s nothing special. The overall quality has dropped immensely. And almost every character looks the same.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 2\\n\\n\r\nThe voices of the characters in the series was quite satisfactory. This series has been re-using the osts of the first season. It hasn\u2019t even introduced any of the new osts; neither this season nor the previous one. It keeps on playing the same osts which were played in the first season. A very very low effort indeed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\\n\r\nFrom the second season, this show had gone down abruptly. And this season is nothing but a disaster with a lot of useless development and unnecessary crap. But I do get the appeal of this show and why many would enjoy it. For example for the harem members. This show has quite a variety of members like vampire loli, a wolf, an insect, a lizard, etc. and there are many other reasons too...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "You know what? Sometimes it is fun to route for the bad guy. Sometimes you are drawn to the villains of a story by their overwhelming power, how cunning and intelligent they are, or their unquestionable charisma. A good villain always leaves a mark during and after the story is finished. So what happens when you take those villains and make them the protagonist of their own stories? Well you get shows like Overlord. A series that has had three seasons now when we thought it was a one and done series. But nope, Madhouse has stuck to this series with another season. And nowOverlord, in my opinion, is taking its stride. \\n\\n\r\nWhy do I say that? Well I'm about to tell you. Sit back, relax and make sure you demand SILENCE! while you are reading this review as I present to you the anime review for Overlord, Season 3. Let begin shall we. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSo Ains Ooal Gown (or Momonga, or Momon or Papa Bone Daddy, whatever you want to call him) has now established Nazerick in the world they they still have no idea how they got there. Now that he has established Nazerick, his next course of action is to take over the world as is power and presence must be known across all of the kingdoms and countries. Or at least that what Demiurge believes and Ains is just rolling with it. In order to maintain control of Nazerick and his subjects, he must essentially go along with it although he never planned it in the first place and confront the nearby kingdoms in order to rule the world. \\n\\n\r\nOnce again the show is separated into two story arcs where each arc follows different characters and how they are tied to Ains' plans and objectives. The first arc follows the village that Ains saved back in season one and how they are progressing. The second arc follows the actions of the Empire, a faction that was teased at the end of season two, and how they are tied to Ains progression of ruling the world. Now world building is once again, focused in Overlord and it is one of its biggest strengths. It doesn't just focus on the inhabitants of Nazerick but the people outside it. It helps give depth to this world and its characters. You get invested into these characters to the point where once they interact with Ains Ooal Gown, you hope that they make it out okay. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the polarity of who to route for in this show has taken full swing in this show. While season two also did this, season three is where I think it now has more weight. As the escalation grows in this show, you hope that some of the world's core characters make it out unscathed, especially when they confront Ains or his subordinates. You want to route for Ains because he his the main protagonist and the character we get invested into the most, but you still want to route for the \"good guys\" because they are developed enough to get invested into them. Sometimes that is the case. Sometimes it is not. This just shows you how defined the world is and how putting investment into it helps flesh it out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis season really does give us more insight into the mind of Ains Ooal Gown as it shows that he is just going along with the ride. Like I said earlier, Demiurge believes that Ains is now planning to take over the world whereas Ains didn't think on doing that. Now that the other floor guardians believe that, he essentially must do what they believe he will do in order to maintain control of Nazerick. He is portrayed as always being 3 or 4 steps ahead but in reality, he is just making it up as he goes along. He also has to practice his lines and poses in his spare time in order to maintain his image. It's a nice reminder that he isn't some all knowing, all seeing Overlord, but rather a simple, human businessman who was invested into an MMORPG pretending to be an evil Overlord. \\n\\n\r\nOf course that doesn't mean he doesn't do it well because when he requires to do some evil deeds, he will do them without remorse. This season just reminds you that Ains is indeed a straight up villain. The previous two seasons sort of portrays Ains as both being good and bad. While he did some evil things, he also did some good things as well (Mainly when he is under the disguise of Momon). BUT NOPE. This series pretty much gives you a solid reminder that Ains is indeed the main evil that puts all other evils to shame. This season is by far the darkest season we've had because the actions that Ains took in this series are just pure villainy. Word of advice, if you ever threaten Nazerick, dig a grave. Then immediately fill up that grave because your body isn't coming back. Then stick a bunch of red flags into your head as you skip ever so gracefully into Nazerick to never be seen again as you will be remembered as the idiot who went into Nazerick looking like a t**t. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters that were focused on in the arcs, we have two to talk about. First there is Enri Emmot, a member of the village that Ains saved personally and Jircniv Rune Farlord El Nix (we will just call him Jircniv), the ruler of the aforementioned Empire who is always at war with the kingdom from the second season. \\n\\n\r\nSo Enri is the main vessel from where we see how the village has progressed since season one. She is somewhat the figurehead of the village as she also the leader of a platoon of goblins that were summoned to protect the village. We see her over the course of the season take more responsibility as she it put into situations where she requires a level head and figure out the best course of action. She is essentially the kind and courageous person you would see take charge as the lead character, unaware that she is serving Papa Bone Daddy who is completely evil. But the problem I find with her is that I don't see nothing more than just a vessel used to show the progression of the village in the show's world building. I don't get invested into her as much than say Zaryusu Sasha from season two because his motives were defined enough for me to get invested into him. For Enri, everything develops around her, rather than she is the main person involved. However, there is good use of foreshadowing where she will have to take center stage and have situations that involve around her in the future. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Jircniv, he is a good case of how looks can be deceiving. First impressions might describe him as a pompous a***ole who doesn't give a s**t. But actually, he is not that. He is cunning as he needs to think what is best for his Empire and plans out what the best course of action is that will benefit him and his Empire and to make sure it does not crumble, mainly when confronting Nazerick and Ains Ooal Gown. While he gets less screen-time than Enri. He is the kind of character that you can get invested in because you know definitely, he is going to play a big part in the future. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say other characters in this show do not get defined enough. From the workers who raid Nazerick to the goblins who protect the village to more established characters like Gazef Stronoff and Nfirea Bareare. Each character is defined enough to get invested into and to look forward to see what happens next for them. Not all of them are hits but the majority of the cast is enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nI think that I should come to expect that the animation quality isn't going to change for the better. So the animation will always be stuck on good but not great. However, I have also noticed that this season has increased the use of CGI animation and yeah, it does not look good. It just lacks detail and polish as it loses some of the impact of some scenes in the anime. Anyone that has watched episode 12 will pretty much agree with that statement. Trust me, you will notice it when the quality of the CGI animation gets bad. What I don't get is that it uses both CGI and hand drawn animation on the same models and likes to switch between them. Why Madhouse won't stick to one type is beyond me. Probably for budget reasons but that just feels like a sorry excuse of not allocating resources properly. While it does make sense for some character models like the Death Knights since they are larger than the average human, it just looks bad for other character models like the goblin and human soldiers. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the same soundtrack returns to Overlord III with haunting instrumentals and bombastic choir vocals. It is the soundtrack that can only be associated with a bad-ass, freaking Overlord. But my problem is a lack of notable new soundtracks (if there were any). The ones that I remember are the ones that we are already established with, which is quite a shame. It is not bad as the OST overall is still good but lets get some new stuff in here shall we? Before we start looping in circles. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is something different and yet familiar at the same time. This time, MYTH&ROID swap with OxT to do the opening and my word, did MYTH&ROID and Tom-H@ck do a good job on the opening. The opening, \"Voracity,\" is much better choreographed than the previous two openings and is the most visually impressive out the three openings. The instrumentals as well are much better with them sounding much more heavy than the previous two but still sounding like an Overlord opening. This is also backed up with the lyrics being catchy as hell and able to stop and start without it feeling tedious. This all culminates to being the best Overlord opening out of the 3 IMO and one I have listened to countless times. \\n\\n\r\nI've never appreciated Overlord's ending sequences till now because this one was an enjoyable ending sequence. OxT did the ending sequence this time with a more slower piece of work than their openings but still using heavy, electrical instruments to match the instrumentals with the opening. But what really stole the show were the illustrations used in the ending as they looked gorgeous; somewhat reminiscing the art style of the Light Novel's. I'll have to make sure not to skip these from now on if they keep up this quality. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\\n\r\nSo what did I mean when I said Overlord is taking its stride? Well what I meant by that was where we are in the story and how established its world and characters are, Overlord is now going full steam ahead with its trajectory and it doesn't look like its planning to stop until it reaches its destination. While its animation quality has taken a dip and the OST is now starting to go in a loop. Its heart and soul will always be its world and characters because that is what it does best. We always look into the world and its inhabitants and get attached to them before Ains and co. swoop in and probably take over their lives. It is kind of funny how this show has gone from finding out where they are and if there are other players there as well to watching a powerful Overlord start to take over the world. \\n\\n\r\nIf you were not a fan on how Overlord II was structured and how the attention was always driven away from Ains, then this season won't change your mind as it is pretty much more of the same. If you were a fan like I was, then you should be happy. I would imagine Madhouse would want to see this anime through since it is popular enough to have three seasons already. And you know what Madhouse? I will still continue to watch Overlord and bow down to THE GREAT SORCERER KING, AINS OOAL GOWN!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Enjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 7.9/10 Recommendation: Watch it (If you haven't already.)",

            "content": "If you've watched and liked the other seasons, you're going to like this. Plain and simple\r\nOn a more serious note, Overlord III is really all of the same stuff that made the first two seasons great: good world building, a grand line of characters, a simple branching out story. The show has a sense of progression and the dynamic between Ainz and the floor guardians is enhanced even more in this season resulting (so far) in a really enjoyable experience. \r\nStory: 10/8\r\nI give it a biased 10 since, as a Light Novel reader, I know the significance of small details that might feel shoehorned inat the last second. But if I have to rate it off of what happens at the moment, I\u2019d have to give it an 8. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nCGI in all anime is a crime against humanity and Overlord is no exception. I totally understand how it makes a scene easier to animate and in the newer episode it\u2019s gotten EXPONENTIALLY better, however, CGI will always be CGI.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nOOOOOOH THAT SOUNDTRACK!! Overlord\u2019s soundtrack is amazing ACROSS THE BOARD. However, sometimes it kinda feels repetitive between tracks and it\u2019s a little disheartening. But, for the most part, it\u2019s great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nCharacters in Overlord are more or less a MASTERPIECE. Sometimes characters feel really fleshed out, just to get one shotted in like ten seconds.

It\u2019s also one of the best isekai of all time.

            "content": "There are four major aspects of Overlord that make it appealing.  \r\n1)\tProtagonists are villains.\r\n2)\tProtagonists are ridiculously overpowered.\r\n3)\tProtagonists are non-human.\r\n4)\tSolid world building. Works well as a hi-fantasy series.\r\nThese points summarize Overlord well, and if you find them appealing then this series is just for you. Tired of goody two- shoe protagonists who are holier-than-thou with no moral faults? Overlord\u2019s protagonists are nonhuman and villains.  Have you had enough of linear progression in storytelling, where the protagonist overcomes progressively stronger antagonists, almost conveniently? Overlord\u2019s protagonist and his minions and the minions of his minions are overpowered compared to the vast majority of everything else inthe world. This is not a tale about knights in shining armor who save the day. This is about the strong and the weak- with heavy emphasis on the strong. No \u201cfriendship triumphs over all\u201d speeches to be found here.\\n\\n\r\nThe last aspect, which does not apply nearly as much to the anime as it does to the light novels it\u2019s based on, is it\u2019s world building. The map is fairly large, with different countries and a large selection of recurring characters representing each country showing up periodically. They all have different traits and while I wouldn\u2019t call most of them \u201cdeep,\u201d the little things they do help give the world of Overlord meaning. They\u2019re not cookie-cutter background characters that do the most predictable and straight-ahead thing. It\u2019s showing the world is alive with many individual people pursuing their own goals. The story is basically a \u201cMMO isekai,\u201d but that it doesn\u2019t go as far as others in the same genre. The MMO feature is just used to explain easily the mechanics of the world and just how powerful Ainz and his minions are. You could almost ignore that fact and the plot works just as well. In essence, this series is almost like Lord of the Rings, with the protagonists being villains.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned in the above two paragraphs the appeal of Overlord's story and characters. To date the series biggest weakness for the light novels has been pacing. Books 4, 5, 7, and 8 are the weakest entries in the currently 13 volume series, and it was primarily because of that fact. A slew of characters for books 4 and 7 in particular were introduced. Many of them weren\u2019t interesting and most of them weren\u2019t important to the plot beyond their respective books.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does glaze over many details from the novels. This works both in its favor and to the vexation of hardcore fans. It skips over many of the details which help make the world feel so alive, while also \u201cfixing\u201d some of the pacing problems a few of the middle volumes in the series had. Season 2 was a good representation of this. This third season adapts volumes 7, 8, 9, so expect more of the same in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s biggest flaw. Although the CGI they use works out in it\u2019s favor at times, particularly with some battles, at other times it can be jarring. Some animation scenes are lazy, such as the one involving Leinas face in a frame. The goblin battle in episode 11 was borderline comical. It\u2019s unfortunate because So-bin, the illustrator for the novels, does a fantastic job. Sometimes it\u2019s good, but there is a lot of mediocrity here as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple of good soundtracks used here and some of the sound effects work well. The English dub is also respectable. Overall it\u2019s good, even if it\u2019s not outstanding. I still think the first season had the best OP and OST. Still good, however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of them, and like any series this can be both good and bad. With so many characters, it\u2019s hard to get significant development on individual characters. When you do get good development, afterwards they may have long absences from the story when the focus shifts to other characters. On the other hand, having so many characters helps make the world feel alive, and with the wide variety, it gives everyone at least a few characters to care about. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned, this series biggest allure is its ridiculously overpowered, nonhuman villain protagonists. Yet neither are they evil for the sake of being evil. They are wholly dedicated to themselves- and if that means killing a few hundred thousand people in the process, then so be it. There\u2019s just something so self-satisfying about seeing a protagonist like that. You don\u2019t get to see that often enough.\\n\\n\r\nI think an understated emotion for any series is that of admiration. When you admire someone, you tend to overlook their flaws. The relationship between Ainz and his subordinates is a tender one. Unsurprisingly, the light novel does a much better job than with developing it\u2019s characters. The anime is only the general story and cuts some details from the novels.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation drags it down, but the story is unique and the characters are engaging enough to keep you invested. Ultimately the most satisfying things in life are the things you didn\u2019t know you wanted until you got it. Overpowered, nonhuman, villain protagonists trying to conquer the world in a high-fantasy setting turned out to be just that. If you love Overlord and are still here for season 3, I highly recommend picking up the light novels ASAP.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n",

            "content": "Franchises like Overlord has a tendency to overrun its ideas with every season. The first season concentrated on Ainz and his goals along with exploring the world fiction while building into the base story. The second season expanded its world although it didn\u2019t exactly live up to its hype when it came to actual character building. Now, here we are. The third season that I crossed my fingers as it\u2019s time for Overlord to prove itself if it\u2019s capable of improving.\r\nRealistically, I came into the third season with moderate expectations. The first episode didn\u2019t exactly get me excited after seeing everyone getting a reintroduction. Ainzis still the same as ever while we see the daily lifestyles of his minions. He is trying to live up to his name even though some of his character behavior comes downright as extremely silly. (I mean, he takes a bath in his \u201cskeletal form\u201d. That\u2019s pretty much throws logic out window) No, what we have here is a season that tries to get fans to invested into the story.\\n\\n\r\nFrequently, I see Overlord\u2019s world as expansive. It explores places with fantasy details that you\u2019d expect from an anime like this and from this season, we visit the Carne Village. Here, we\u2019re introduced to a place where goblins exist. Goblins are a common trend in fantasy shows so seeing them exist this season wasn\u2019t much of an excitement. However, the real attention to pay attention to is a girl named Enri. Serving as a leader of the village, she commits to protect its people and ensure peace. Which is to say, she is a key supporting character this season. One of the more noticeable trends I noticed about Overlord is how it\u2019s able to develop its supporting cast. Enri is a character that I grew to admire for her selflessness and courage. This is especially true with the village facing exterior forces who threatens its peace. Similarly, there\u2019s Nfirea, a character with an inferiority complex yet isn\u2019t afraid to take action when the right time calls for it. \\n\\n\r\nBut meanwhile, there\u2019s also Ainz and his own goals. Supported by his servants and minions, there\u2019s no doubt that world domination is part of their agenda. Yet, Ainz is a calculating character. Despite being incredibly powerful, he isn\u2019t the type that directly goes on the frontlines often. From this season, he commands his servants like Lupisregina on important missions. His other servants such as Demiurge offer their own advice to him. In later episodes, he begins to show a more dominating personality to prove the testament of his powers.\\n\\n\r\nYou better get used to a diverse and growing character cast. In the latter half of the season, we are introduced to Worker Groups of adventurers that includes Foresight, Green Lead, Heavy Masher, and Tenmu. At this point, I feel like it\u2019s where Overlord takes a step back for its character cast. Because let\u2019s face it, some of these characters are going to be jobbed out and treated like fillers. This is proven when some of them fall to victim of the denizens at Nazerick. I can\u2019t even remember some of the names of these adventurers like the one that got tortured by Neuronist Painkill or those killed by monstrous cockroaches. Ainz himself also makes some of these adventurers look fools such as the ones from Foresight. In one particular episode, he shows the difference in their power while crushing all their hope for victory. And to be honest, none of this should come as a surprise. We know how powerful Ainz is and this season continues to prove that. There\u2019s no one who can truly stand a chance against him whether it\u2019s Emperor Jircniv (a character that appeared at end of Season 2) or army by numbers. Even an alliance between The Baharuth Empire and Kingdom\u2019s army feels more like a desperate struggle to survive. When it comes to war, Ainz is able to decimate forces with his powerful arsenal of spells such as summoning death knights and the Dark Young. It\u2019s the type of curb stomp battle that doesn\u2019t last very long. \\n\\n\r\nWith season 3\u2019s unorthodox story structure, I feel like it\u2019s important that they don\u2019t make us forget about its established cast. Remember Albedo or Shalltear from the previous seasons? While they get their moment of fame, it\u2019s definitely not on par when they were first introduced. Others like Sebas is pretty much forgotten despite their development from season 2. To me, that\u2019s a bit of shame since I grew attached to some of the main supporting characters. I do have to admit that Season 3 managed to commit to some of its other supporting cast such as Enri though. Hell, even the goblins became relevant with names given by her. I just wish more characters got treated in such a way.\\n\\n\r\nBy now, the meme of Madhouse not making sequels should be more long disregarded. Not only did Overlord receive a third season but the break is only 3 months. This implied that the second and third season may have been planned as a split cour from the start. Regardless, I feel like Madhouse should\u2019ve committed more time for at least a half year break to boost its production quality. Don\u2019t get me wrong though. The third season definitely had some great visual quality moments especially during some of the battle segments. World building in Overlord still stands out as a prominent feature that people shouldn\u2019t overlook. And those character designs really evoke emotions. Just looking at characters such as Neuronist Painkill or Shalltear\u2019s killing instincts should be enough to get a reaction. Unfortunately, not all reactions for this season will be positive such as the case with the Dark Young. Thanks to the atrocious CGI, their presence reminds me exactly how NOT to adapt character models for a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nThree seasons of light novel adaptations doesn\u2019t come by too easily these days. And often, they get treated poorly with the pacing or omission of content. Overlord doesn\u2019t fall under those pitfalls but still suffers from its character building at times. I\u2019m not going to lie. I enjoy the novels but this adaptations isn\u2019t really a great representation of value. The fact is, Overlord is a reputation by name but is far from perfection.",

This show has amazing potential in its very large cast and dedicates enough time to make you care about them. You WILL be pleased with this season. Bone daddy hasnot disappointed us before, and he isn't now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for everything else, the art, sound (especially the opening), and the feel of the show are great as usual, and its good to be back with this series.

            "content": "Basically Sword Art Online for people who are too embarrassed to admit they like Sword Art Online or think they're above it when they're not. Three seasons in, and Overlord III still manages to be as embarrassingly terrible as the series has ever been. Apparently Madhouse managed to split up the budget for one cour worth into three, and it really shows. How this series is still so popular despite Madhouse's awful adaptation and the original material's abysmal writing can be very easily described in two words: Power fantasy.\r\nBut what makes this particular power fantasy so profitable and appealing? \r\nIt's the fact that the protagonistis a spooky skeleton man with very stereotypical villainous role archetype assets. Ability to summon undead minions? Powers that generally involve darkness(tm) and death? Completely loyal evil minions that are comically cynical towards humans and also have similar abilities, all with their own gimmicks? He's got them all, and kids love him. There's a reason why something like \"Dark Flame Master\" is a running joke in shows like Chuunibyou, and it's because it's pretty common for kids to love the bad guys more than the good guys. They have cool abilities, look cool, and act cool! It's every kid's dream to be Dark Flame Master. But does that mean every Overlord fan is a kid or a manchild? Not necessarily. The series does have some merit, but it's certainly not the animation or the writing. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty abysmal- The OP animation is incredibly lazily made, and the ED animation is just a slideshow of still images, which goes to demonstrate how little budget went into the show. Add that up with constant stillshots of Ainz's completely unmoving skeleton face and just embarrassingly common usage of bad looking CGI in nearly every episode, and one could feasibly argue that Madhouse really did split the budget for one cour into three. Even the worst of the worst harem isekai shows tend to have fairly impressive, or at the very least, decent looking openings to pull people in, but it seems that Madhouse knew their fans will eat this shit up regardless of how little money they spend on it. There's quite literally nothing positive to say about the animation. The soundtrack is pretty mediocre, and doesn't really distinguish itself from other similar shows, which is also a disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is the writing of the show, which is easily the worst part of the series. \\n\\n\r\nConceptually, this should be interesting- It's supposed to be a story from the perspective of the villainous protagonist, which is genuinely rare. Sure, there are plenty of stories where the main character is some variation of demon lord or whatever, but at the end of the day, they still end up being no different from just any generic isekai harem protagonist. Did Ainz manage to separate himself from this common trend? Sure, if being a cardboard with a different coat of paint counts as a separation from the norm.\\n\\n\r\nThe issue with telling a story from a villain's perspective is that it's not very easy to make the protagonist likable for the audience to care about. Essentially, when a character becomes too villainous, they become harder to be relatable because they would have to be borderline sociopaths, and the focus shifts from the character to what the character does. One exception to this would be if the character's motives were interesting or empathetic, but Ainz's motives are boring as shit and he's more or less just going by what his minions tell him, so sadly he doesn't make the list. Ainz has never been interesting as a character, and the focus has always been on the spectacle of what he does with his power, rather than him as a character. Basically, he's barely a character, and the power he wields is more of a character than Ainz himself. If a main  protagonist is solely defined by their power, then the writing has already irredeemably failed. \\n\\n\r\nThe another issue with this is how this different perspective affects the antagonists of the series, who would naturally be heroes, and rarely other villains that belong to other factions nobody cares about. When the focus is mainly on the villainous protagonist, it becomes difficult to portray the would-be heroic antagonists as anything but generic \"good\" guys. Normally this wouldn't be too much of an issue by itself, but yet another major problem makes this a significant issue: Lack of an actual antagonist. Throughout all three seasons, there hasn't been a single character that was a credible threat to Ainz that also had consistent screentime to get proper development past their character page description. Not only does this make every encounter completely predictable, but it also kills any anticipation for what could happen next because the outcome is always preordained. And when there isn't an antagonist that fits this criteria, then every heroic antagonist ends up being just carbon copies of another with no distinguishable feature of their own beyond surface-level general characterization and motive. And if they're not going to be dynamic characters, it makes them harder to empathize with, which in turn, doesn't make them seem interesting to be distinguishable from every other character. They're essentially cardboards that just say some cliche'd throwaway lines that a typical protagonist would say, and that's all there is to them. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, villains generally don't need much screentime to begin with, because most of the time, their villainy is portrayed just through their villainous actions. Meanwhile, heroic characters need them, because heroism is a trait that requires empathy. Instead, Maruyama decided that it was a smarter idea to make more irrelevant fodders for Ainz to defeat and conquer, and devote way too much time into their vague, generic characterization that will stop mattering after their inevitable loss. If the writing is good, empathy for the characters should ideally come naturally through storytelling that actually adds to the plot, rather than attempting to force it through Overlord's patented method of wasting your goddamn time telling you about how Tom loves his kids and how he's the family man. \\n\\n\r\nWhen that isn't happening, it's devoted for long inner monologues about the antagonists to think about how strong Ainz and his minions must be, which Ainz and his minions do for themselves already, which just makes it incredibly repetitive and pointless. It's just shit writing at its finest. And the lack of credible, persisting threat makes every arc feel like a filler arc that serves very little to no purpose to whatever the overarching story is, which is why all three seasons of this series are nearly indistinguishable from each other. The common defense for this is \"But Ainz is the threat!\" but that completely misses the point. The heroes should ideally be a constant threat to the villains as much as the villains are a constant threat to the heroes. One sided victories are boring as shit when villains are the ones doing it just like how it's boring when shounen protagonists always win in the end. \\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that neither an overpowered protagonist nor a story told from a villainous perspective is inherently bad. It's the combination of the two being handled incompetently at the same time that puts the writing of this series into absolute trash territory. Sadly, Maruyama is a terrible writer, and Overlord as a series is like watching a grown man playing with his action figures alone in his room while indulging himself in the same old dance that he's done a million times with his self-insert Skeleton Stu that never loses, which really does reflect in Ainz as a character. Maybe this is some galaxy brain tier 4th wall poetry and all Maruyama wants is for his friends to play DnD with him again. \\n\\n\r\nBut just because the writing is complete garbage doesn't mean it doesn't have any merit- One of the most common misconceptions is that something bad can't be enjoyable, which is why a lot of people will really reach to defend the poor writing if they enjoyed the series. Most common method is to cite the original source and pretend it's better than the adaptation when it's pretty much just as bad. I mean, if they enjoyed it, clearly it must have been good! Somehow! You just didn't GET it. But that's just childish narcissism, and a lot of people fail to understand or just refuse to admit that trashy writing can still be fun. While Overlord may be just as poorly written as Sword Art Online, what it has over SAO is that the spectacle is sometimes genuinely fun to watch when the focus of the series isn't on the side characters, albeit repetitive and poorly animated. And that's basically what the appeal of power fantasy is- Watching smug protagonists stay smug while watching smug antagonists getting blown up.",

In this new season, they were driven through the ground and stepped on. The cool new \"rule the world\" idea that drove the anime is now gone. Now there is just a village full of weak, needy, annoying, and UNNECESSARY characters. From a little potion maker who is on his way to making a potion 1/100 as useful as those made by Ainz to a weak and pointless village chief who is therefor literally no reason other than Ainz gave her a damn flute full of weak goblins. This entire season so far has been pointless. Why are Ainz's extremely OP maids risking their lives just to save these little shits? I don't care about the village, I don't care about the goblins, and I absolutely don't care about this useless diplomacy with a government that Ainz could crumble with a snap of his fingers. I see no point in their complete reroute from \"take the world by force\" to \"lets just protect these humans that we have made it extremely clear that we despise.\" Isn't the whole point of the show that Ainz has no emotions and is now a skeleton bent on ruling the world? WHERE IS THAT? It's like it went from Game of Thrones OP version to a video of a really long and really boring NATO conference. What I'm trying to say is that they need to bring back the entertaining parts because they are making an entertaining series boring and stupid with all the comedy and the incorporation of useless and weak side characters who bring nothing to the table. Kill off the side characters and let Ainz rule the world, that's all I ask for.",

The drive behind every action in this show is not apparent to the viewer, so that in the end I was questioning the events happening on screen. Why was Ainz destroying Carne Village again? \r\nNext topic is the pacing. Boi does this season move S L O W. In addition, it is void of any substance, significant characterization or development. Noteworthy action \u2013 also nonexistent. \r\nCHARACTERS: Huh? \r\nWeget to see more reoccurring characters in this season, Overlord himself being one of them, since his presence in the 2nd season was minimal. Maybe it was this long absence from the viewer, but Mr Momonga turned into a sadistic psycopath. It was hinted, that due to his undead nature Ainz loses affection towards humans, however presented changes are sudden and harsh, some in between stages would make this development plausible. Oh, and he got another name tagged on to his greatness. What a conceptional disaster. \\n\r\nThe second most important character is the blond girl from the 1st season, whatever her name was. Well, she develops some useful skills, reasoning behind this development is yet unknown. \\n\r\nEveryone else is just there as a requisite. \\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION: Wouldn\u2019t look good 15 years ago. \\n\r\nCharacter models are inconsistent and backgrounds thrive in mediocrity. Animation did not strain the budget either. Just like horrific CGI. Mass produced soldiers, goblins, skeletons or ogres look unbelievably bad, nothing you would expect in 2018: especially those abominations in episode 12.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: They gave up. \\n\r\nIt feels like everyone on this project, be it voice actors or music composers, have enough of this IP. Music is more of the same, sound design got worse or even laughable. Voice act is boring. I was missing new impusles or joy from involved stuff. Then episode 12 happened and I wanted to stab my ears \u2013 well done.\\n\\n\r\nOne day before the final episode aired, I got a chance to see \u201cTensei shitara Slime Datta Ken\u201d. The amount of emotions or joy blue slime blob shows in 15 minutes surpasses 3 seasons of Overlord. If you are looking for \u201cIsekai\u201d anime with an overpowered non-human protagonist and noticeably better production quality, I suggest the story of the slime. \\n",

            "content": "If you fell in love with watching Ainz explore the world as the adventure Momonga trying to spread his name, doing quests, interacting with different characters and doing epic shit- basically everything that made Overlord season 1 enjoyable and garnered so much popularity in the first place, well you can kiss that goodbye. Warning, spoilers included.\r\nEverything that was enjoyable about the first season goes downhill in the second season. In this season, that\u2019s where it goes to shit. The story shifts it\u2019s focus once again onto the side characters, politics, how Ainz affects the world and world building. If you\u2019ve watched season 2, that seemsto be the premise of Overlord now. However, the writer can\u2019t even do that right and fails at every turn.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: (1/10):\\n\r\nAssuming you\u2019ve seen the previous seasons already, I\u2019ll keep this brief:\\n\r\nAinz is a neet, self-insert, overpowered Overlord to everyone in Nazarick. Here he\u2019s worshipped and adored by his guardians as they treat him like a god who can do no wrong, and Ainz assumes the role of being a supreme ruler. Ainz\u2019s motivation becomes doing what he believes best benefits Nazarick instead of focusing on I don\u2019t know... trying to find a way back home (because fuck that when you\u2019re a Overlord amirite?)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot this season? There\u2019s not much of a story. It just so happens that all of the events Ainz has committed and the fame he\u2019s spread across the world as Momonga was conveniently all setup for his master plan to rule the world or at least that\u2019s what Demiurge says and Ainz agrees. It\u2019s poor writing, I know.\\n\\n\r\nThe first step for Ainz to rule the world is to create his own country and to do that he needs a village to test on for reasons unclear. The first 7 episodes focuses on Carne Village. The next few episodes focuses on these workers who get staged by Ainz to try invade Nazarick so he can kill them for trespassing and use it as an excuse to start a war. The plan was so awful that I stopped caring. The rest of the season focuses on the Empire, the newly founded Sorcerer Kingdom led by Ainz, and the war where they demanded the Kingdom cede over the city of E-Rantel. \\n\\n\r\nThe arcs follow the same repetitive formula of introducing a bunch of new characters e.g. a new race/species, spend a couple of episodes giving them screentime and then have Ainz or his guardians either enslave or kill them. Rinse and repeat and you have Overlord. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1/10):  \\n\r\nWhat do you already know about Ainz and the guardians? Well, it\u2019s pretty much the same this season. They receive no meaningful character development or exploration, since it focuses on the uninteresting side characters that you\u2019ll end up forgetting once you\u2019ve watched this season. \\n\\n\r\nThe side stories are awful. Every time the POV shifts from Ainz it\u2019s infuriatingly boring because the side characters we spend several episodes with are bland, weak and uneccessary.\\n\\n\r\nEnri is a cliche, \u201cnice\u201d village girl who everyone loves and becomes the village chief because the plot required her to. Otherwise no sane person would put a village girl in charge. Enri is a clear case of writers pet, getting everything handed to her (becoming the village chief and now owning her own massive goblin army) because she\u2019s a plot device to show the progression of the village. Nphi is a beta potion boy who\u2019s a pussy and has a crush on Enri. If you thought the lizard men were bad, the goblins are another level of trash. The goblins are  so one dimensional, their only trait is arguing about who likes Enri more. At least a few of the lizard men had some depth to them, these goblins don\u2019t even have names ffs.\\n\\n\r\nThe workers are one dimensional forgettable fodder who\u2019s only role is to jobb against Ainz for trespassing, be killed for shock value, and to remind us how \u201cevil he is\u201d. Arche\u2019s the only one we learn a bit about with her being broke and wanting to take her sisters away from her parents, but that\u2019s about it. Oh yeah, there\u2019s a bootleg Gilgamesh too\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (1/10):\\n\r\nIt\u2019s as if Madhouse realised that Overlord goes to shit after s1 and stop putting effort in because the animation has declined as well. The art is worse this season than s2. The CGI is Berserk (2016) levels of trash e.g. look up Ainz massacre 70 000 soldiers instantly and you\u2019ll see how laughably bad it was. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I can overlook bad CGI as long as the writing is great. However, Overlord hasn\u2019t been delivering in that aspect either. LN readers kept overhyping \u201cSPLAT SPLAT SPLAT!\u201d for weeks, but I wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it if it had OPM tier animation. The \u201cslaughter fest\u201d of Ainz massacring 70k soldiers in a instant and ugly ass goats stomping generic, snobby nobles was shock value and another excuse for Ainz to flex how overwhelmingly overpowered he is compared to everyone. \u201cSasuga Ainz-Sama!!1!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSounds (3/10):\\n\r\nThe opening is one of the few saving graces of this season. S3\u2019s opening is one of my favourites so far. However, the OSTs are pretty much the same as the previous seasons, uninspired and forgettable.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1/10):\\n\r\nHonestly, I hated this season. The fact that there\u2019s no struggle whatsoever in Overlord and that all the strongest characters are serving under Ainz has made me come to despise this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhere are the guild players? Will there ever be a real threat?\\n\\n\r\nAinz and his guardians are so ridiculously overpowered that every fight/conflict is always the same repetitive, one-sided, curb stomp that it\u2019s not even fun to watch anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no semblance of stakes, tension or difficulty for anything they do. The weaker characters can\u2019t even outsmart Ainz because he\u2019s always 5 steps ahead and his plans always go off without a hitch. Idc about how great \u2018muh world building\u2019 is, or how Ainz affects the world because knowing that he\u2019ll always come out on top has made the story become boring and predictable. There\u2019s no plot twist to spice up the story. It\u2019s wish fulfilment, nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nAinz can just launch a full scale attack using all his guardians and be done with conquering the world in a month or two, find out the information about his friends and solve the mystery to go home. Yet we are dragging on to what would seem 100+ episodes, across multiple seasons on giving screentime and developing all these uneccesary side characters (e.g. lizardmen, goblins) who will always end up being fodder compared to the gods that are fighting (Ainz & the guardians). The writer tries to come up with some convenient, shitty reason of \u2018Ainz not wanting to rule by power/fear\u2019, but he\u2019s supposed to be a evil protagonist!\\n\\n\r\nOverall (1/10):\\n\r\nOverlord has devolved into a dragged out, pointless story with uninteresting side characters, uneccessary horny scenes with Albedo & Shaltear, and the guardians sucking off how great Ainz is all the damn time. We get it! \u201cSasuga Ainz-Sama!\u201d has gotten old and is just annoying at this point. Overlord is simply a emotionless, evil skeleton and his giant harem killing everyone who opposes them like they\u2019re squashing ants.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t fathom why fans praise Overlord so much, giving it such high reviews because \u201cmuh world building\u201d, despite it being a typical, power fantasy isekai about a overpowered, Gary Stu MC who\u2019s the magic user equivalent to Kirito.",

            "content": "Based on the reviews, you will either love or hate this show. I already gave a couple of chances with the show, but I failed to like any single detail about it. If I could describe this show, it would be like this: a knight plans a great adventure, yet he moves around insignificant villages to bully peasants with very slow pace. Peasants from other villages don't care about his power, so few of them gather and attack him no matter that he's got thick armor and a powerful sword. He beats them and other peasants. That's what Overlord is about, if you like anoverpowered protagonist who flexes to everyone around after a long drama, you may like this show.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the story is poor as usual. It's so prolonged that it's painful to watch, a simple event lasts episodes, full of insignificant events, characters and other stuff. The same formula from previous seasons, lots of long moments where everyone adores Ainz, the moments where something happens and Ainz goes there, long drama starts, new characters are introduced, a drama before action, Ainz snaps his finger and enemies are dead, the end. It's also little odd that Ainz spent time on adventures to spread his name and power, yet some kingdom hasn't heard of him and, of course, played ignorant role - \"hey, let's destroy this nobody!\", like every other enemy of Ainz in previous seasons. Also... All the events are done to show his power, no matter that they are recycled over and over, ignoring the logic and some characters lose their brain for a while to do something stupid which would just keep the image of Ainz being the most powerful being in the world.\\n\\n\r\nAfter giving rights on One Punch Man to focus on Overlord, I was stunned that Madhouse came up with this, a studio which has made some great shows and movies. The art is mediocre at its best, but CGI is horrendous. The sound is so-so, nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are flat like in previous seasons. The continuous problem with the show is that way too many characters are introduced, only simple premises are shown (whether they do stuff for money, fame or duty) and they don't last long at all, after some generic chit-chat they enter combat and die. The harem continues to adore Ainz all the time and make pathetic threats to humans who are trying to fight Ainz. Ainz doesn't seem much like a generic harem wimpy protagonist, but that's mostly because the focus is more on things outside Nazarick. We don't learn anything new about Ainz and the harem, all the new characters are on the spot and get thrown away after they made their purpose to make Ainz look powerful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? The show could have been fit in one episode. It's way too long, the conversations are dull and boring, the \"action\" is done in an instant. I don't even know what this show is supposed to be - a shounen, a harem, a comedy, a dark themed show, a fantasy world, a drama? The harem characters are shows as cute and innocent at one moment, the next moment they are horny and want to please Ainz, later they try to look scary and threaten some people. You cannot mix so many things without a bad outcome, I don't know whether LN is like that, even if it is, anime creators should have picked two themes, for example dark fantasy, that could work. Not so many elements to make everything last long and pathetic attempts of comedy or dark moments which confused me that I wondered what was I watching. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch or read something with fantasy theme, check out Warhammer, LOTR or Dungeons and Dragons, unless you want a pathetic story about an overpowered protagonist who beats nobodies to prove himself that he's the most powerful being in the world.",

I feel like that's what lacked in season 2, The first few episodes were about new ''characters'' that were lizard men. We didnt really get any interactins with the supreme being i feel like. \r\nIf your looking for an isekai anime i would reccomend overlord most of the time because it's way better then most isekai anime's i have seen. \r\nWhat i didnt really like about season 3 is that it's kind of getting repetitive. Ainz is trying to bullshit his way out of the questions of the supremebeing's. We see him trying to expand his territory. It's getting kind of boring honestly. \\n\\n\r\nOverlord needs to end with a bang like in the first season.",

The 24 minute episode force Madhouse to have to cut out a lot of stuff making this inconsistent story. People sometimes say to read the light novel but that is just silly. Why should you need to read a whole book to just understand a show. If all parts of the story were to be in the show it would go well beyond the 24 minute mark so they have to cut some content but that sometimes just breaks theimmersion. Not only that but the world building episodes are often long and boring. World building is necessary yes, but in this case the anime spent way too long on it and focused solely on it. It became more of a side story than anything making it feel like a filler episode. \\n\\n\r\n(For anime only watchers I recommend reading Djinn's Posts in the Reddit Discussion of Overlord III episodes Just Google Overlord 3 episode # discussion and scroll down till you find his post)\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nFor the most part, the art is great, everything looked nice and was quite beautiful, however, the CG was to say the least, unrealistic. Especially in episode 11, (Which at the time of this review, is the latest episode) the anime did a nice job of portraying the numbers of the army, but each of the models looked so bland and unrealistic, the movement was fine, but it just did not fit with the art style. Pulling me out of the immersion\\n\\n\r\nSound(10/10)\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are phenomenal and I do like the soundtrack quite a bit. I never felt like the sound was distracting, but enhancing the overall the experience. Although I can not recall a specific time, I got chills whenever a character is overwhelmed at a sight of a huge army or absolute power.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(9/10)\\n\r\nIf anything, the world building also helped shape the character building. We get a good sense of what the characters personalities are just from their design but when the show goes more in depth we see it more or see a hidden side (Such as lupus's sadistic nature).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10)\\n\r\nI did enjoy the show quite a bit, from Ainz's show of power, the ironic humor, and the not so humorous death of the workers. 24 minutes of content felt like only 5 and I was always eager to watch the newest episode. If anything the part I did not enjoy was a the slow pace of the world building but that is about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9/10)\\n\r\nThe combination of Characterization, Art, and sound help elevate the story and the only things holding it back is the CG and its own time constraint.",

This season of overlord has finally showed a lot of action and comedy compared to the others this is the best season so far showing \r\nSome nice action throughout the entire show, \r\nand much needed lore about the world of Yggdrasil \r\nHowever there are some scenes with CGI But they are relatively short and easy to watch  If you liked the first two seasons then Overlord IIIis a must watch, it reminds me heavily of One Punch Man but more MMO overall rating 10/10",

            "content": "Cheap isekai anime has ravaged the industry for a number of years now. Without a working vaccine, the disease continues to kill the brain cells of viewers everywhere. The Sasuga Skeletor Sama Series is just another symptom of this plague. \r\nThe story has been done thousands of times. It's the generic MC self insert type of story. I can literally predict the outcome of every episode after about two minutes since nothing will ever stump Skeletor Sama. He will always achieve victory no matter what. He would conquer the world in 7 days but apparently the author thinks resisting the urge of dicking around inhis harem should be the main obstacle Skeletor Sama needs to overcome throughout the series. After three seasons I still have no idea where this show is going. Then the realization dawned on me. The point of the show is not to actually tell a good story, but for the author to mentally masturbate onto a piece of paper so the target audience will lap up the discharge like a bunch of coco addicts trying to snort a bag of baking soda. \\n\\n\r\nSkeletor Sama is the character equivalent of play-doh. He will change and do whatever seems the edgiest and coolest in the moment. Side characters are irrelevant since the series is focusing on Skeletor Sama himself. They will either circlejerk how they want to bone him or get killed and have only one or two episodes of screen time. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I think studio Madhouse did brilliantly is saving a ton of money not animating Skeletor Sama. If not for the sound and subtitles changing on the bottom of the screen I would have thought that my internet went out whenever Skeletor Sama is on screen. I was wondering why this show looks Master of Ragnarok tier despite it being popular and lucrative enough to have three seasons until I realized that both shows takes place in Yggdrasil where things look cheap and lacking in pixels.\\n\\n\r\nI totally get it. We all occasionally want to just turn off our brain and watch a show like this when we are bored. Sometimes we do have no other choice but to pull over at that really dirty KFC on the side of the road at 3 in the morning. But why would I do that when Popeyes and Church's are just next door, are cheaper, and doesn't taste like diarrhea? There are 40-50 shows airing every single season and are you seriously telling me that you cannot find a single other show on that list that will be a better time spent than watching this?\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I would just like to say thank mr skeltal for the good bones and calcium to heal my head after slamming it on my desk thinking about the possibility of this getting a fourth season.",

            "content": "This is a very troubled, very flawed anime with many many many problems. It is also extremely frustrating to watch. \r\n*sighs*\r\nThe main issue is that it is In DIRE need of a better director. The pacing is shot, and too many times the anime starts building up for something important, then the important scene suddenly happens offscreen, is botched in some crazy way, or fail to deliver. Every time you think... but it'll get better! Just soon! Just around the corner! The one awesome episode is nearly there! And then it ends, and you realize that you watched 13 episodes of teasing and cliffhangers thatresulted in nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is that it utilizes really badly done CG visuals. There are titles that know how to use CG well (for example, Sidonia no Kishi, Ajin 1st season, Seikai Suru Kado)... but this is not one of them. CG monsters look like cel-shaded video game characters, and are not impressive. And there are a lot of CG monsters. I also suspect that they blew half their animation budget on certain creature, judging how horrible certain soldiers looked in comparison. \\n\\n\r\nThe most irritating thing is that through all that mess you see glimpses of genius now and then, but the glimpses never blossom into anything bigger. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose at this point I should jsut read the damn sourrce material in japanese. It looks like the writer was onto something, it is just anime isn't good in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nDetailed breakdown below:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nGood things about it is that we have villain protagonists, malevolent protagonist, monster protagonists... this is a breath of fresh air. Sometimes it results in pointlessly brutal sequences that don't see to have any real reason to be there, and characters being intorduced only to be killed off by protagonsits (in a horrible way), but.... it is possible to live with that.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad part of the whole thing is horrible slow pacing, and too much teasing, playing bait and switch and displaying important events offscreen. Remember how in 2nd season certain grand battle with sebastian happened offscreen? Same happens here too. Basically, the anime tries to build up, then slow things down, stretch story arc out, and when you think it is about to deliver something amazing, it fails to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to 1st and 2nd season there is significantly small number of \"awesome!!\" moments, to the point where I'm not sure if it was worth watching at all.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, it badly needs better director. There's something good in the source material, just the anime should've been better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nA lot more CG in this season, and CG is quite bad. I mean, it wasn't great in 2nd season either, but there wasn't a whole lot of it, but now it is in every frame to the point of being eyesore.\\n\\n\r\nCG Animation is bad, with awkward movement, and  certain models look extremely cheap. They definitely haven't gotten hang of this tech in this season. \\n\\n\r\nCertain special effects look like they were lifted straight from the nineties, to be honest. They definitely should take a look at Ajin (1st season), Sidonia no Kishi, and nother CG anime. To see how the technology can be used in better way. Hell, just Guilty Gear Xrd Sign would teach them a lot.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10: Nothing outstanding, although on occasion some themes are real nice. The anime doesn't let those tunes play for long, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10:\\n\r\nI spent most of the time being irritated by poor directing, so I don't remember much about them. Which means they're not very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10:\\n\r\nConstant bait and switch with teasing cliffhangers, promises of amazing events around the corner, which fail to materialize. All. The. Time. This results in extreme irritation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10;\\n\\n\r\nI didn't like it at all. The anime did spark my interest in source material, but it is too poorly done to recommend it. Might be worth a watch if you're bored out of your mind or something.",

            "content": "First of all, I have to mention that the original story is great. This anime adaptation however is an abomination and clear cash grab trying to profit from a dedicated fan base. I'm going to keep this review short because I can not be bothered.\r\nJust search \"Overlord goblin army cgi\" on YouTube and you can deduce my opinion. The show is filled with stuff like this. For a bit more of a rant and a more grounded opinion, read below:\r\nStory: This adaptation suffers from major pacing issues. While the original story is great, the anime can not do it justice. While we are shown thedark side of Ains' campaign to conquer the world, we also have to sit through several episodes of failed character building for the people of Carne Village. It's slow, it's boring but there was potential for these characters. Madhouse just squandered that potential.\\n\\n\r\nArt: What art? The story is plagued with bad CGI, to the point that is seems to want to compete with Berserk for worst CGI of the last decade. It might even win that competition as even Berserk knew that some stylisation was required, but here an army consisting of a single copy-pasted soldiers just bounces of a shield wall, like cartoon characters. The thing is, this is no cartoon. Like I said previously, just search  \"Overlord goblin army cgi\" on YouTube\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: awful story pacing and truly bad CGI squanders the potential of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: not bad, not great. As usual, both the OP and ED are good, though seasons 1 and 2 were better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  and overall score: I could not enjoy this show due to the disrespect of studio Madhouse in regards to this show and its fanbase. The only reason I watched this show to completion is because the underlying potential is great. But I now regret waiting for it and not reading the LN instead",

I try my best not to write any spoilers. \r\nStory / 10\r\nI absolutely love the concept of being left alone in a game and then being thrown into a quite unknown world. Overlord just did that in an extraordinary way. There are a lot of references to the past of the game which fit perfectly into context. Also the fact, that the MC is in fact THE \"Overlord\" is so interesting. I dont know if there is any other anime like that. \r\nArt / 8\r\nExcept the CGI it's really good.\r\nSound / 9\r\nLovethe openings and sound effects fit well most of the time (except some monsters).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter / 10\\n\r\nEvery guardian represents the personality of its creator. They interact in a very unique way with eachother and everyone has a different personality. They develop alot and dont just follow the orders of Ainz. The development of Ainz's mentality is also insane. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment / 10\\n\r\nSeason 1 and 2 were really great but it seems, that Season 3 just did the best job in pure enjoyment. BUT it's definently not an anime where you can just sit back and relax. Following the story and watching out for details is just great. Because there are a lot of details, which play an important role in the story. \\n\\n\r\nOver(all)lord uhm.. Overall / 10 (not funny?.. uhm.

However, for me, it managed to make an impression enough for me to begin buying the LN's.\r\nStarting off, the biggest issue of the season is the poor CGI. That's all I really want to say about it, because it's had this for three seasons. If you are still complaining about how you'll drop the show due to it after watching almost 40 episodes of it, then you really don't have much conviction. This is why I'm also not putting art at an 8 or 9, asI believe most of the character designs are distinct and interesting otherwise. Granted, they come from a light novel with established designs. The biggest problem with this CGI is it can take you out of otherwise enthralling scenes.\\n\\n\r\nMoving past that, the series really shines with two things: Ainz interacting with his subordinates, and Ainz interacting with lesser life forms (read humans). The more Ainz interacts with the NPC's, the more you understand what drives him and what originally drove the guild he and his friends made. What you're supposed to understand is that conversations with these NPC's are, by extension, conversations with his old friends. This is part of the reason I've put character so high. While interacting with humans however, you'll see him full of disdain unless they go to great heights to prove themselves to him. Some theorize this is just because he didn't like humans back in the real world, however the show plays it off as his stats as a Lich making him unable to feel empathy for them. Overall, some interesting conversations and dynamics are shown whenever Ainz talks to someone or explains his plans (Sasuga, Ainz sama).\\n\\n\r\nSound was phenomenal, almost exclusively for one of the sickest OP's I've seen in a couple years. Easily that has to be in my top 5. But the sounds for battles, fights, and for most voice actors all came off the way they are intended. There's not much else to point out regarding this.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the story progression is slow but usually pays off in 2 or 3 arcs coming to a conclusion. I won't really go into spoilers, but Carne Village is a major focus this season, as well as the kingdom of E-Rantel as a whole. Finally, we're seeing Ainz interact with and act out towards the surrounding kingdoms, which has really taken the last two seasons to build up to.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of it all, I think Overlord III brought a great show to bat. It really was the highlight of my summer season past Steins;Gate and and ecchi I watched. If you've seen the other two seasons it's really worth your time, and here's hoping for a season 4.",

I think this definitely is the best season overall.\r\nStory:  With anyone who knows anything about Overlord, you know that the story doesn't mainly focus around Ainz but other characters as well.  But I just want to talk about Ainz.  Basically this season, he finds out that he wants world domination and focuses on how he can accomplish this.  But he also has to worry about intruders, keeping a village safe and who he should alliance with.  This season I think hasmore Ainz than any other season!\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Art for this anime is always good.  CGI though could have been a little better but I'm not too much of a stickler on that shit. \\n\\n\r\nSound:  The opening theme and ending theme to this anime is always so catchy.  Especially this season.  I never had to skip like i usually do with most shows I'm watching.  All the voices of the characters sounded good as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  Like i said before, Ainz is a badass.  You really get to see how powerful he is and how actually evil he is to his enemies.  The floor guardians were fun to watch as always as well. If anything I wish there was more yandere Albedo moments.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Overall:  Overall i really enjoyed this season.  It felt like it went by so fast.  I wish they would make more episodes for a season but that just shows how much I like this anime.  Cant wait for season 4 if it does come!!",

            "content": "Skip to 5th paragraph for just story, art, sound, and character ratings\r\nWith the 3rd season finally coming to a close, I can now say that this anime wasn't good and will probably never going to be good. From recommendations to giant banners at public events, I was expecting at least a good show, but I was wrong, this was just a waste of time.\r\nBefore I talk about things that bothered me, I will name a couple things that I found enjoyable (only partially in some cases). First of all, the world is seems dense with a lot of classic mmorpg elements that I enjoy, theauthor either played mmorpgs before or did a lot of research on them. Second, ops and eds were lowkey bangers. And last, I do enjoy self-inserting myself into Ainz when I have a bad day, though this doesn't mean the show is good, Ainz being a blatant self-insert is no different than any other similar isekai shows.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is very similar to another show this season called The Master of Ragnarok & Blesser of Einherjar, comparing to that downright unbearable feces which I immediately dropped after about 4 minutes, overlord did a good job into tricking the viewers into thinking that the show isn't the same as ragnarok by having a \"darker tone\" and a harem that's bigger than all of the harem protags combined. Awfully similar to that one dude's show that has the entire cast of females playing around with his swords huh.\\n\\n\r\n-Story: 3, no coherent story from my viewing, it might be because I wasn't paying attention because the show bored me to death, but all I gathered from the story is that this dude gets transported to a video game and he's op af and he has a giant harem of slaves so he goes around and fuck with ants so that the other dudes that might've got transported as well will notice their kouhai. \\n\\n\r\n-Art: 2, this ain't it chief, this ain't how an edgy 12 yr old that's a little horny self-insert show supposed to look like, the show looks ugly as hell, with a gripping narrative it wouldn't have been a big deal, but this doesn't have that, the cgi are berserk level terrible, there's barely any animation, the characters just look like they have half the amount of pixels Asuna has, and the backgrounds look like a pre-rendered PUBG map.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 3, nothing stand out from the ost, the sound designs are terrible, episode 12 had like a league of legends queue popping noise. Nothing too special about voice acting, Ainz just has one tone, and the girls sound cute I guess.  \\n\\n\r\n-Character 3, Ainz has barely personality other than yea i miss my gamers and offu this girl kinda cute yo she on me what i gonna do, sometimes he just does things that're similar to pouring salt on snails. Nothing interesting about the pseudo-spurned women's (and men's) club either. One side character has more character traits than the entire cast and even they have barely any. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment is my overall, 3, insert your butt into Ainz for a quick delusion rush and that's it.",

The season so far has been very enjoyable and as someone who has not read the manga it's been easier to follow than season 2. \r\nAs always the case with overlord, each episode is well paced making them feel like that are only 5 minutes long rather than 20 (yes i'm enjoying them that much). The art style is the same as always, with 3D animated 'stuff' thrown in, which I really wish they didn't do. But the character development, story andsound track all make up for that. \\n\\n\r\nOne reason why I've always like overlord is that is very unique in the isekai genre, it doesn't feel like ideas are recycled and the goal of the main character is mediocre (Find a way to get home). This has stayed truth throughout the seasons and this one is no exception. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I looking forward to the rest of the season and wishing that it was 24 episodes rather than 13.",

            "content": "first and foremost, I apologize for some grammar error. I hope you still get what I wanted to say,\r\nOverlord continues to surprise me. When I first watched it, I had a really low expectation in this next Isekai. No, this show is definitely not a masterpiece. But it did really well to grab my attention in the first season. Now, in the first and second season, this show is kinda mediocre to me. But it was a hell of fun for me to have watched it. Because if you look for it, this show has little going for it: Animation-wise this show is good butnot outstanding, It's not full of action, the overpowered main character, yadda yadda yadda. If I had to choose for animation between overlord and SAO I'd definitely have chosen SAO. BUT WAIT, this anime is one of the example why anime still needs to adapt light novel:\\n\\n\r\nThe story. The one that surprises me in overlord is that they have that balance between you pity the side character and the point of Ainz Ooal Gown's character. Now what do I mean by that? For example, if they kill certain character that has good deeds and make the character gone forever from the story, a lot of people will get upset, because so much is wasted from the character development. BUT, if you don't kill the character that has encountered Ainz Ooal Gown just because they have good deeds, that would kill the point of Ainz Ooal Gown's character, because if they do that, that would be the next Kirito Art Online, the next \"Good Guy\", I wouldn't want to watch that kind of show, especially if the animation is definitely inferior to the Sword Art Online. So they master that balance of character and story and have keep that until now the third season. That is impressive. Yes there is a lot of trash light novel out there that get adapted to anime, but this show is not one of that. \\n\\n\r\nDefinitely enjoyable to watch!\\n",

Season 3 was a interesting one  i like the theme of the whole light novel and anime, even if its a MMORPG type anime still it captures reality in a way that most TV shows books, anime dare not go. I'm talking about the concept of Good and Evil which is a made up fantasy concept, and in reality people only are interested in their own personal gain, and self interest if it doesn't suitthem they change their tactics and alliances. My point is I like that there isn't a real concept of good and evil to drive the plot, and the characters are driven by pure interest.",

Significantly different from others in the same genre.\r\nFirstly, there is no harem as such, although at first glance it may seem that there is one.\r\nSecondly,Unlike the ordinary anime, The main character is imperturbable, self confident, calm and he makes quite rational decisions, there are no emotions inside him. Main hero is rather cruel, what is extremely unusual for protagonist heroes in anime. But even in spite of this, The Main hero have some humanity and steadfastness.\r\n\u00a0Thirdly, in this anime there is an impressive logical and fascinating plot, that does not force you to give up watching, as there are noepisodes that would not affect the main development of events. (Although half the episodes of the 2nd season were not very interesting)\\n\\n\r\nFourthly, the nature and the abundance of characters, the creation of conditions are helping complete immersion into the world of this anime. Such things as : the map of the world, the state, the hierarchy of society, the relationship of states and social classes, the hierarchy of magic, relationships and other things greatly done.\\n\\n\r\nFifth, the absence of a huge amount of garbage fan-service (I think there's no need to explain)\\n\\n\r\nSixth, again I repeat about the plot: it has a very unexpected outcome.\\n\\n\r\nWell, in general, the list of merits can be continued, but those that I have already described have particularly hooked me.\\n\\n\r\nWe turn to the disadvantages:\\n\r\n1. The presence of the series, which take a large amount of time, but do not have a significant impact on the main plot (especially important in the second season). 2. There are some not very interesting series, that are quite boring to watch (but there are few of them).\\n\r\n3. The intentional protractedness of some moments in the series.\\n\r\n\u00a04. Presence of predictability of some events.\\n\\n\r\nWell that's all. I hope my review will help you. I really recommend watching this anime, as well as for an avid otaku (who has not watched it), as well as for new anime artists, quite INCREDIBLE and ORIGINAL anime.",

            "content": "So many tens? But it contained so many \"fillers\"! \r\nWell allow me to explain to you why I felt the urge to write a review for this as well as my reasoning behind the given score. \r\nA lot people watching this or people that have completed season 3 will share a similar thought \"so many fillers!\", but first what actually is a filler? A filler is an episode that can be considered a spin-off where the episode/arc has literally no connection or impact on the actual story/plot. For example an episode dedicated to a beach event for a fan service, where the characters after theepisode have no memories about the events that occurred nor will they ever mention it. The MC not having (much) screen time doesn't mean that the story is on halt. The story develops and the others getting screen time is extremely important for the climax. \\n\\n\r\nThis season has not a single filler episode, neither did the previous seasons. We have to realize that Ainz his main objective is to figure out if other human beings like him were trapped in the slightly modified version of Yggdrasil. In order to achieve this goal he has established a small building and plans to make his name known throughout the world so that other players might be able to encounter him or to figure out that they aren't alone. And together they might figure out a solution to them being trapped in a game.\\n\\n\r\nRecaps aside. If you haven't watched the previous seasons then this review might be confusing. If you are into anime that are about MC being trapped in a game and absolutely dominating the game with strategic moves while not flexing then you are in for an amazing ride. This show is fairly unique. I do recommend to watch it, season 1 has great reviews. This review focuses on the audience that is already familiar with Overlord.\\n\\n\r\nThis season continued where season 2 left off; establishing a small village/city not only to spread his name (which his followers inclined on), but also to do research for the greater good. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIn this season Ainz will even increase the size of his territory more, significantly more. After all his goal has become world domination. Having his name spread through good or evil doesn't matter, as long as it reaches other players and not npc's. That's why we have seen 2 faces from him, the Sorcerer King and Momon of the Darkness. One being the evil lord, showing no mercy to puny beings, obliberating them as he pleases. And the other being the kind adamantite warrior that tries to see the good in everything while helping fellow adventurers. \\n\r\nBoth of these are very important in spreading his name, one will be known as an evil person and the other as a good person. At the final episode it will also be shown why Momon's presence is of essence. Even though... we can't actually say that he had planned this from the start. Because after all we know that Demiurge is an extremely clever strategist and planner. \\n\r\nThis season shows the potential of Ainz his power as both the \"hero\" and the \"evil\" person. It also finally shows how powerful he actually is... well at least it shows what he can do with a single spell, let alone when he tried. And this is something that many fans wished to see animated. \\n\r\nThe story progresses further in how those around Ainz help him realize his goal and partly focusses on the small village that once was protected by Ainz. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAs usual the art is very pleasing. It really suits the given theme and setting. The environments are beautiful and the gore where needed is very pleasing. When something gets intense the art shows the details of the scene, making me a very happy person.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound effects are superb. In combination with the art they really do know how to keep you excited throughout the whole episode, not to mention season. They even paid attention to small details such as ambient sounds and sfx of enemies when the camera was focused at a place where there was no combat, but hearing it in the background made it fairly realistic for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character development is very neat. We learn more and see a lot more about the villagers and their capabilities as well as trust and love towards each other. All these developments aren't fillers because they are necessary for the story. Each and every single character serves an important role in the universe of Overlord. One is a genius when it comes to herbs and potions, the other in terms of magic is extremely advanced, while others are used to simply show how mighty and powerful Ainz is compared to those npc's. Plenty of them had interesting background stories making me love more characters in this show than I anticipated I would. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI don't think I need to explain this with the previous points, but I absolutely loved it. Especially when Ainz made himself more known in terms of power. There were moments that I felt sad, but that adds up in the enjoyment factor, because sadness is an emotion, while not positive it was caused in a good way by a show. And that makes it more thrilling, because you can live with the characters and imagine how easy/hard things might just be for them. This makes the show immersive and that is something that not many shows nail. \\n\\n\r\nI do hope this review might've changed your opinion about season 3 of Overlord and perhaps might be just the reason to start with the series.",

            "content": "The third season of overlord is good and that's pushing it. (Please don't get triggered hear me out). Overlord does the overpowered protagonist right, which is very difficult to do. There are two ways to do overpowered protagonists right. First way is a one punch man approach where you use comedy. Overlord uses a different approach. Overlord mainly focuses on the support characters. Overlord uses support characters to world build and show power differences (while making the story interesting). Because lets face it if the story was just about Ains it would be extremely boring. The main problem I have with overlord in general isthe fact that in some events its impossible to know what the hell is going on or the deeper meaning behind events (this applies to all three seasons). Its also funny because Ains also doesn't even know what going on so I can relate haha. \\n\\n\r\nStory: To continue to elaborate on my problem of Overlord is there are a few episodes that feel pointless or I just never understood why they invested so much time into them. An example of this is in season two. In season two half of the season was spend on the lizard men. There was absolutely no reason to why they needed to spend so much time on characters that would only make a couple appearances in the future (so far). This season, the Giant of the east and demon snake of the west episode seemed like it was filler and pointless. Another \"pointless episodes\" were the tomb raider episodes. They invested a lot of time into these characters just to have them (spoiler alert please skip if you haven't watched I apologize) brutally slaughtered. The last couple episodes were rushed but still enjoyable. Highlights would be the Carne village episodes. All of the character there are amazing and seem real, it was nice seeing them this season. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Not much to say, the animation/art is usually done well by mad house. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The Opening was great this season (I've liked all the openings so far). Not to many noticeable OST though. The ending was also great again. Because of the lack of amazing OST i'll rate sound a seven. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I'll keep this one quick because this review is getting long. The best thing about overlord in my opinion to be honest would have to be the characters. The Characters of Nazarick are mostly great. Most have great personalities that are extremely unique. Its sad we didn't get to see to much of them this season. The side/ support characters from Carne village and E-Rantel are well written and are extremely likable (I was always rooting for them even in the battle against Ains). To Sum this up before I go on a rant about how each character is amazing, the support character's growth, likability, and a real feel to them make Overlords character great.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Even with its small flaws Overlord is a great series to get into and season three was my favorite season so far. If you love fantasy anime where there are multiple plots with overpowered done right then I highly recommend this show to you. Watching Overlord every Tuesday was a treat after a long day. Hopefully Mad house can work on another season soon (One punch man needs to come out first though).  \\n\\n\r\nThanks so much, this was my first review hopefully it didn't suck.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The main character is not afraid to commit evils for the greater good unlike the majority of isekai protagonists. The world building is also amazing. However, one problem people may have with overlord is the overwhelming amount of side characters. I think these people are watching the wrong anime, Overlord is not a typical shounen. It feels so satisfying to see a character that has been built up over the course of a few episodes get slaughtered by Ainz.There wouldn't be any impact if they were name less mooks.",

Now, the good thing about this season is that Ains already showed off to the entirely country, who's the badass, i know that the series have left some unresolved things since season 1, but this hasn't ended yet so maybe next season we can finally see another player that can face up Momonga orains or anyone from Nazarick(mind control doesn't count).\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10:\\n\r\nArt is pretty much the same, only CGI makes things a little weird and sometimes you get tired of it. but everything else is fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nHere i'm only focusing on the ending and the opening which are great, have no complains.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nThis season brought new characters which made things more interesting, but, i'm not getting into it, because they really only give a little bit more of context on the world and relationships between the kingdoms.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this season(specially since season 2 only showed a fucking lizard village and the guardians of nazarick doing other shit) becuase it delivered more development of the world that had something to do with ains, so i'm happy and hoping season 4 doesn't take the same time season 2 took.",

It feels like they used the \"I'm horribly overpowered\" cliche of the series too much this season.  It was present in the first few seasons, but this season has largely been Gown and crew basically mopping the floor with unfortunate humans with very little sense of suspense. \r\nPlus what made seasons 1 and 2 more interesting was the character building which it felt was a lot more lacking this season.  But even if we aretalking about the fighting aspect the best fight of the series so far was back in Season 1 with the final fight of the season (won't name who vs who for spoilers sake) and the fight against Clementine more so because she was someone you wanted to hate. \\n\\n\r\nPlus the CG has been much more egregious this season.  Like it's there in front of your face where you can clearly see the poor animation.  That quality of animation would be fine for background characters, but this was entire sequences where the CG model was the action item.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, 3 seasons in and we still have yet to answer the mysteries left by the first season of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's not a bad show, but it's just not as fun as the first two seasons were.",

            "content": "To be honest, i am quite a bit disapointed with the anime, I know there is a budget problem, but even so to use that cringy CGI in the episode 11 is just a hideous crime to me as a fan, i don't think they should have made it traditional for i know it is reaaaaly hard, but still what they made is just too lazy. Also i understand how much the industry is nearly like a slave labour at times which makes the japanese animation market so hard to florish again, so take my complaints with a bit of salt and as not takingmuch into account the hardships of the workplace, this is a criticism or rant solely as a fan. \\n\\n\r\nSo, here is some of my insight on the score i gave:\\n\\n\r\nStory 7(anime) 10(LN):\\n\r\nUNfortunate as it is, compacting 3 volumes in 13 episodes is bound to hurt the overall story, it is boudn to feel rushed and give space for more important information, i get that specially in a novel that gives so much focus to it's internal diallogues and small detais. But to give the first 5 episodes to volume 8 and only 3 for volume 7 is just a dumb mistake, it shows that they tried to play funny and make it more heartwarming even thought the focus of this novel is not that. \\n\r\nIt seems as if the studio believes we would prefer this way, even though volume 7 is one of the best in the whole series for it shows how cruel Ainz can be and the sad conseuquences of his choices, it was so good because it was tragic.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6:\\n\r\nThis is pretty obvious why i gave a 6, the CGI is getting out of control, it's \"horribleness\" peaks in episode 11, which could have been done much better.\\n\r\nI don't mind using CGI for battles as it is indeed hard to make so many soldiers in a war, but look at Maria The Virgin,as far as i remember they didn't used it or used very little yet the battles were well made for they gave focus to few soldiers when giving us so pretty combat, you can use CGI  when showing large formations moving rather than that awful rag doll bashing, jesus make a close up when they clash so to make the fight look better, we would see some good individual fights and be satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9: The sounds in the anime are awesome, the opening song is as iconic as the season 1, it fits the madness of the story and it's characters, most of it's sound effects are well timed and made altought it does suffer a bit for me sometimes, either because it changes too fast or the sound effects play when silence would have been better, to give a more misterious effect, but this is a minor detail.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8(anime) 10(LN): Of course, the characters fortunatelly continue the same crazy people from Nazaric we all know, and Ainz misunderstanding... Just priceless.\\n\r\nBut the anime does suffer a lot form the lack of detail in it's minor character and even some of it's main ones.\\n\r\nArche for example came out in the anime as just a bit likeble, (she barelly was the focus) they cut off the debt collector scenes, the detais of her inner thoughs her interactions with her group, the detais of their unity, and even the reason some of their reason for being who they were, which were pretty relateble. Instead they gave more wacth time for the villagers... sigh... Even though Arche is the best selling point of the whole Arc. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7(anime) : The fact they i kept seeing the small detais that were cut or the cringy CGI kept me from enjoying the anime fully, i could not enjoy it as i should because of these great let downs and the fact that i knew full well how important these details were, (i've read the 12 volumes about 6 times i am not kidding) .\\n\r\nThe bad decision to give the 8th volume, the most boring of the 3 adapted, a great focus on the start just made me really angry and sad, Mad House made a injustice to Overlord here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7: The anime wasn't bad per say, but it is far from 8.40. i was actually even thinking of giving it a 6 because of how sad i became after seing one of my favorite novels being butchered like this, but in the end i have to admit it wasn't that bad, but it could have been a master piece.\\n\r\nthis Season Covers 2 of the best volumes  yet they choose to elevate the most boring volume in the entire LN, this to me shows 2 things:\\n\r\n 1-the studio does not know one bit of what it's audience wants, 2- they were too afraid to place a bet in the 7th volume because of it's \"controvesy\", so they decided to give it less focus the minimize our attachment to the arc.\\n\r\nSo in the end they killed what could have been a masterpiece of a season.",

            "content": "This anime really butchered all the good parts about the novel. The first season was pretty good, the second season was so-so but still managed to include most of the important parts despite many flaws, but this season was horrible if you've read the novel because it's impossible to not compare them. \r\nThe first few episodes were decent enough and did a decent job of showing volume 8, albeit missing many parts and exchanging stuff that shouldn't have been exchanged. But things went south from there. It's very obvious, painfully so, that they wanted to force themselves to cram 3 volumes worth of material into13 episodes without actually being able to do so. This resulted in cuts everywhere. So many good parts were ruined. \\n\\n\r\nThe art were also average at best, the monsters here generally resembled kids anime ones, be it neuronist, the trolls or the naga who all looks severely lacking in so many ways. They have no details whatsoever, as if the animators just didn't care to give any effort on the matter and made them as plain as possible. Simple colors that might as well have been filled in with a paint bucket tool and without any real features to them. It really removes from entertainment when something that is supposed to be cool is reduced to a children's monster drawing. They also conveniently excluded things like the soul eater mounts for the last battle, not to mention that instead of summoning 500 monsters and entering in a cool way, he came with just a handful ones. It's so disappointing I don't even know where to start, everything is ridiculously underwhelming and there's no sense of immersion whatsoever because everything was dumbed down to oblivion.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the parts that were ruined other than the last battle, let's just mention a few things like how almost all the cool and interesting scenes were removed to save time and if they weren't, they were so toned down that they should've just removed them altogether if they weren't going to do it properly. Things gets worse after the first few episodes when they start to rush everything. Enri and company's dinner and events when visiting nazarick were completely glossed over, ainz suddenly finds himself in the capital of the empire without any prior notice and then he's just suddenly hired by the adventurer teams without a proper set-up, then we skip his mock battle with the worker and instantly teleport to nazarick and the entire journey inside was extremely boring as people just died pretty much instantly, chatting between characters are skipped and so are many events leading up to their deaths, we just quickly get teleported around to each individual as they meet their ends without explanation on the matter. Ainz first meeting with fluder, which was originally pretty cool, was summarized in hindsight in a few seconds of animation at the end of an episode without any of the dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nThey're essentially butchering the original content completely until we're left with only the absolute main parts of the story, the bare minimum required to make any sense whatsoever and move the story forward. This leaves us with a lackluster anime that lacks everything it should have. It lacks the character development, it lacks the interesting parts, it's void of everything and anything that made overlord a good story. At this point, it's just a dumbed down piece of garbage that isn't worth watching even if you loved the overlord novel. It's not immersive, it's not interesting, the art is skimped on, the story is rushed and even an average anime would do a better job at being interesting and entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nIf they can't do it properly with 3 volumes for a 13 episode season, they should cut it down to 2 volumes for a 13 episode season, that way they can include the things that actually makes this into a story instead of just a lackluster and subpar isekai story that barely has anything in common with the overlord novel except for the characters and the overarching plot developments. The plot points are there(like this or that happened), but everything that was supposed to flesh it out is missing. It's like a human without any organs or a pizza without any toppings, essentially just the framework, the dough. Everything that makes it good isn't here.\\n\\n\r\nIt's sad when adaptations screw things up to this extent. Not even someone who hasn't read the novel would feel like this is good enough to watch because it simply lacks anything compelling and unique about it, rather, it's subpar to the normal stuff you find everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nOh, I'll just quickly mention that the overall art is horrible in more ways than just being of shitty single colors, the choppy low-quality 3d crap is ruining WAY too much of the cool moments by looking like trash. This show truly failed in every way imaginable. Screams of cutting the budget in every way imaginable. Season 2 was horrible, but this took it to another level of bad. It defecates on the original story and everything it should be in order to grab some easy cash because people like the novel and the first season was a great success...",

            "content": "I've talked about Overlord twice before. The first series was average with some good ideas they weren't doing anything with. The second series moved up to good by giving some actual tension. Now we're looking at the third series. Which may or may not be improved. To recap the story thus far, Ainz Ooal Gown was a high level player in an online game. When the game shut down, he somehow found himself in a new world with all the high-powered NPCs he & his friends created. Now he's trying to navigate that world while also commanding more power than anyone else seems to. Variouspeople are being caught up in his schemes.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nContinuing from the last series, Nazarick has gained control of the Kingdom's underworld and taken a bunch of their populace for horrific experiments. In this series we open with the small village Ainz rescued in the first series, Carne, where two great beasts are about to invade. Meanwhile, the Empire has heard about the tomb of Nazarick and is about to send a bunch of mercenaries to explore it. Which will certainly end well for them.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe first big issue with this series is just that most of the plot threads that get some kind of resolution have really obvious resolutions. Take the Carne village part. There's no tension because we find out, even before any fighting begins, that the Nazarick maid, Lupisregina, is going to e watching out for every village character who's developed enough for you to potentially give a shit about. Then there are the mercenary workers. It's obvious when they describe their job that they're heading for Nazarick. It's equally obvious that things will not end well for any of them. So, when they try to give you reasons to care it doesn't work very well since you already see them as fodder.\\n\\n\r\nOn some more positive notes, the series does set up some pretty compelling things. Honestly, I get the sense that the fourth series will be more interesting when it builds off of this. I will also say that the whole final arc of this has a lot of strong moments. Which I shan't spoil until I review series IV and recap it. I will also say that the scenes with the Nazarick crew just taking quiet moments to relax and act like normal friends are pretty great.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much in terms of advancing the characters or in fleshing them out. Pretty much what we get is carried over from the prior series. The main new characters we get are some interchangeable goblins, the fodder & some Empire characters who are mainly notable for the political intrigue they represent rather than for what little they have you can call personalities.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe series tries to do what the second did by basing the tension off of the secondary characters who are actually at risk, but I've already been over why it doesn't work with this one.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about the Overlord artwork that I haven't already, to be honest. The series continues to have strong character designs, action sequences that are quite good in spite of generally being very one-sided & nice backgrounds. It's also worth noting that this is a series where the CG can stand out but it ends up contributing to make certain monsters look otherworldly. Which works fairly well.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, good on Madhouse for managing to have an episode where the characters go to a bath house without making it fan-servicey. That's not something I can usually credit the studio with.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound:\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe acting continues to be nicely done. Sakurai Takahiro has a somewhat major role in this one and he's very good at what he does. I look forward to the obligatory scene where his character cross dresses. Hirakawa Daisuke & Ichimichi Mao also do really well. Of course, the major characters continue to be well acted. Katou Masayuki, Hino Satoshi, Hara Yumi, Katou Emiri & the others are all good at what they do.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIn general, Katayama Shuji's soundtrack works nicely for the tone and atmosphere. I'm a bit more mixed on the theme tunes. I don't think they're bad but I also don't really want to listen to them and usually ended up skipping over them.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a little bit. Shalltear mentions that she's only slept with women. We also meet Nazarick's torturer who's basically the monster version of Fire Emblem from Tiger & Bunny. I guess whoever created him thought it would be funny if that character type was torturing people in more ways than just by existing.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAreas of Improvement:\\n\\n\r\nThe Mission to Nazarick should have been more obfuscated. A part of the problem with giving a shit about the workers as characters is that we immediately know, from the instant they're introduced, that they're fodder. So, maybe give us the time spent trying to builds them up before that particular bombshell drops rather than after.\u00a0\\n\r\nGive the goblins some distinct personalities. Pretty much all that distinguishes these guys is that they look slightly different. But they all basically act the same. Which means we don't really care when they're in danger.\u00a0\\n\r\nGive us a bit more of the Nazarick crew's interactions. Like I said, that segment may be short but it's great.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nOverally, Overlord III is not as strong as the second series. While it does have its moments, particularly the final arc & the whole Nazarick relaxation interlude, it also suffers a bit from the same issue that plagued the first series. There's a lack of any real tension. We know that the Carne village situation is going to end well for the characters we even slightly care about. We know what's going to happen with the workers and we don't care. I would still say this instalment is stronger than the first series. It's pretty decent. So, I'll give it a 6/10.\u00a0",

It still give us the high definition of watching anime, hope they keep their production until the end.\r\nSounds, Character and Enjoyment: I think those three is still the same for me. Quality of sounds is great. Character development in each specific characters are good, even tho their is a heck of characters in this anime. Overlord franchise still manage tocome up some idea of how they evolved  their personas and characteristic with Ains as their highest authority. I think it's deserved to be in top although the content of the whole season is not really appealing to me compare to the first two seasons. My advice is don't expect too much in this season three just enjoy this anime because the story so far is important for the next sequel.",

            "content": "TLDR; Overlord FINALLY starts getting somewhere.\r\nI enjoyed the first season of Overlord, despite the fact that it felt the plot meandered all over the place and took forever to get somewhere. Overlord II only got worse at this, with the first half of the season being about characters we had never met before, and trialling their struggles, with only minor appearances by the main cast (and fringe members of the main cast at that).\r\nOverlord III feels like at last the author has spent enough time world building and character building, and is finally getting down to brass tacks. No new major characters are introduced, insteadopting to spend more time on developing existing characters. \\n\\n\r\nIt does feel a little like the author is writing himself into a corner with Ains' power level though. Ains can easily beat the best warriors in the present world without even breaking a sweat and describes them as being infinitely worse than any top level player characters. Canonically, Nazarick was built by ~40 of his guild members pouring all their IRL money into a P2W computer game, and it was once besieged by 1500 PCs from top PvP guilds who were unable to take it. Ains is now in charge of not only Nazarick, not only the combined wealth and magical items of the entire guild, but also the entire dungeon worth of NPCs which are 100% loyal to him and now are able to think and act.\\n\r\nThe only two ways I can see Ains being threatened in future series are either at least 1000 players drop out of nowhere and make a concerted effort to fight him (which will never happen) or he will be threatened by clerical problems such as the difficulties of controlling a vast empire you cannot possibly oversee all at once. Aside from this, there is literally nothing to stop him from overthrowing the entire world in the first couple of episodes in S4.\\n\\n\r\nI do however feel I need to make special mention of the art style. The majority of the anime is done in the old-fashioned style most anime is done with. A few scenes are done with CGI though, and it is incredibly obvious and incredibly jarring and 4th wall breaking. Very very disappointing they couldn't spend a little extra money on animating the CGI instead and easily the worst part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and also at one point Ains has to pick a title for himself to distance himself from normal kings and rulers and show that he is greater than them, destined to rule over them, like an Overlord if you will.\\n\r\nAnd he picks Sorcerer King. What the hell.",

            "content": "This was hands down the best season of Overlord, and the second half makes this an anime of the year candidate for me.  FINALLY, Ains and the Nazarick crew are acting like TRUE villains.  No killing people and then bringing them back.  No pretending to be villainous just to do something noble, later. No killing people who are evil themselves and deserve it. No caveats to keep the Nazarick crew looking somewhat heroic or  like anti-heroes.  They are just full of straight up, epic, merciless, villainous behavior in the second half of this season.     \r\nI alreadyenjoyed Overlord because I love animes where OP characters flex on weaker characters and everyone is in awe of their power.  But, I was always disappointed with how they didn't really seem like true bad guys, but you come to expect that from animes as creators don't want their main cast to be unlikable to the masses.  I didn't expect more, but boy did this season surprise.  Very rarely do you get great anime that shows things from a pure villain's perspective and Overlord has finally become that.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I love especially is that it's Ains who has become truly ruthless, and as such, his subordinates follow suit.  Ains was already someone I liked as a character, but his callous ruthlessness in this season, makes him my favorite character in this anime, which has a lot of cool characters.  (I could do with some more Lupisregina and Cocytus in season 4, though.).  \\n\\n\r\nAlso, I have to point out the epic intro, as well.  That Voracious intro really hit well and fit the anime.  \\n\\n\r\nI really can't wait to see what season 4 has in store.  I imagine it's probably about time for whoever took over Shaltear Bloodfallen to come on the scene.  Someone has to emerge to become a true threat to Nazarick at this point. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n",

            "content": "Amazing series that shows the the perspective of an evil main character.  Their is no power of love and friendship going to save the world from the overlord.  Each new group of characters introduced is used as a stepping stone to build Nazarick and Ainz Ooal Gown up higher.\r\nIt is a lot more effective to stand on a pile of well developed characters then a bunch of throwaway characters with no development.  The series loves destroy you're hopes of a good outcome because you are actually following the main villian.  He will do anything to save money and better Nazarick andhimself.  \\n\\n\r\nOverlord could easily steamroll the world, but they use manipulation to shutdown the new world and calculated assaults via Demiurge's plan.  Ainz mostly lucks his way into maintaining his image as an overlord.  Yet he hasn't change much at all.\\n\\n\r\nonly problem with the series is they cram/cut 3 books into only 13 episodes per season.  They need 24 minimum for each season.  Their is a enough information in the books to make it as lengthy as one piece.\\n\\n\r\nFirst arc, the two leaders, shows how much Ainz has influenced Carne village since he saved them back in season 1 episode 3.  Enri's goblin general horn's, considered a trash drop in the game of Yggdrasil, have a hidden power that is unlocked by meeting the 3 requirements of the goblin general.  She builds a good relationship with the original 19 goblins.\\n\\n\r\nThis arc shows Enri improving the relations with the goblins while Ainz is controlling the village from the sidelines using Lupusregina Beta.  Lupus drops the ball and Ainz finds out about the Giant of the west and the demon snake of the east through the adventures guild.  He then hunts down  the giants and uses the demon snakes army to test the village in Lupus.  He only cares for Nfiera's potions, Enri, Nemu and Lizzie.  He decides to use their love iand loyalty, instead of forcing him to make potions.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc is the invaders of the tomb arc.  We are introduced to the worker group foresight.  Workers outside the adventure guild and only do it for money.  Ainz uses Fluder to set up an invasion of Nazarick.  He even bribes them but they charge in the tomb so Ainz sees no reason to eliminate them.  Most people actually care about the foresight group but they meet their end in terrible ways.\\n\\n\r\nBelieve me Arche got off easy.  She is not being eaten repeatedly by cockroaches, being used as a living home for a parasite, experimented on, or tortured.  What most people forget is its Arche's fault for pushing her to extreme greed and its their fault for the outcome of her sisters. \\n\\n\r\n1) test out the defenses of Nazarick using the lowest amount of expenses because they only have a finite amount of Yggdrasil gold.\\n\r\n2) Give nazarick justification to force the Empire to support them.\\n\r\n3) Introduces some of area guardians and terrors of Nazrick.  Death is a mercy.\\n\\n\r\nThe 3rd arc the caster of destruction arc.\\n\r\nStarts off with Emperor being forced to go to Nazarick or his country will be destroyed.  Ainz uses him to bring the reeztize kingdom out to fight.  So he can show a portion of the power of Nazrick to scare the world and to establish the sorcerer kingdom.\\n\\n\r\nPolitics behind the nobility/royal dispute in the kingdom and the Empire secretly trying to inspire an alliance against AInz.  The safest way he know how is to support Ainz to figure out his power.  Just Ainz is way stronger then anythiing he ever dreamed about.\\n\\n\r\nBrings carne village back when Prince Barbro plans to siege, kill and kidnap to force Ainz to stop his war.  The villagers loyalty is so extreme that they fight back.  Out of desperation to prevent the the women and children from being killed.  Enri uses the 2nd horn to summon a goblin troop again.  however instead of 19 goblins.  She summons a professional army of 5,000 experienced goblins.  Some of them being stronger than death knights.  She developed her skills as a commander, good relations with the goblins and in peril by a sizable force.\\n\\n\r\nThe arc ends with the kingdom and empire waiting for ainz to show up.  The kingdom is ready to retreat when Ainz uses a super tier spell to instantly kill 70,000 soldiers.  using their corpses to summon 5 dark young.  which are level 90.  Then he stomps the remaining 180,000 soldiers into a full route of the kingdoms forces.\\n\\n\r\nGazef challenges Ainz to a duel.  level 100 vs a level 30.  Ainz shows deep respect to Gazef by making his death instantaneous.  He wanted to have Gazef as a subordinate but Gazef planned his death to show the true power of Ainz.\\n\\n\r\nEnds with Ainz taking over Erantel fortress city and the surronding land establishing the sorcerer kingdom.  ready to manipulate the world to bend its knee in the future books/seasons.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*********************\\n\r\nOnly problems with the season was the rush budget with subpar CGI and lack of detail compared to the light novels.\\n\r\nThey really did cram 3 books into 13 episodes.  Books are a lot more dark.  Censorship and low budget caused problems for some new to the anime.\\n",

            "content": "Story: Good\r\nOverall best isekai story yet. Revolving NOT ONLY the protagonist and his henchmen (like EVERY other isekai ever that only focus on the stupid OP-ness of it's main character while still leveling up to infinite strength) BUT ALSO involving other characters in the world (although it's just like 2 countries).\r\nAs you all that read a lot of isekai manga/novel can agree with me, isekai is power fantasy story usually showing OP MC in quest of saving the world while leveling up with it's merry harem party facing a lot of trials along the way. But unlike most isekai manga/anime, Overlord took a little bitchange in the genre (if you can call isekai as it's own genre now) making it very unique and stand out compared to other isekai, which is:- making MC and the gang already OP as fuck since the beginning. This series shows only a glimpse of the power of Ainz and the gang, showing fractions of their ridiculous OP powers without any progress of leveling up. So what to do with all the powers that the MC and the gang possess? Instead of guarding the world for everlasting peace, how about conquering the world for themselves?\\n\\n\r\nWhat make this story good? The answer is it's different with any other isekai. While most isekai focus on good-natured MC-and-friends leveling up and travelling the world to fight demon king, Overlord show the progress and how this apathetic-of-anyone-useless Demon king itself taking over the world little by little through schemes and sheer power while the humans of the worlds also got their own hidden agenda. While this show lean more to the 'serious' side, it also got bits of funny scenes that genuinely nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Fair.\\n\r\nSame like any other anime production. So-so quality with generic bad CGI.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fair.\\n\r\nSame like any other anime production. Nothing stand out much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good.\\n\r\nEach characters in this anime are interesting. From the party of Ainz to the lowly humans, all got unique characteristic that shows how each of them suit in the scenario of each arc. From manipulating and deceiving characters to dumb-honest characters and stupid annoying characters, everyone has their own purpose.\\n\r\nThe only thing I don't like is the lack of character introduction and their exposure for some characters. You need to read the manga and the novel for that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good.\\n\r\nVery much enjoyable if you ever get sick of generic isekai with OP MC with harem of women that only revolve around ecchi things. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Good.\\n\r\nCan't wait for more of this anime story.\\n\\n\r\nSide note:\\n\r\nIf you are the kind that want to watch a generic isekai anime with leveling up things in term of strength and acquiring infinite new skills, new 'titles' that will never be useful for the story, with friendship power that overcome everything, fast pace, ecchi harem all episode go watch other anime. Overlord is not for you.",

            "content": "What started as a typical gamer isekai story has become one of the greatest shows I've ever seen. Even in season one, this show impressed me by how it implemented an internally consistent magic system, where there's none of the \"I surpassed my maximum power\" nonsense. The strategies used in battle and the negotiation tactics implemented create very realistic situations which are difficult to produce in fiction. With much of the story focusing on side characters who lived in the world before Ains Ooal Gown appeared, it crafts an image of what the world is like before, during, and after its encounters with Ains OoalGown. With each decision made by Ains Ooal Gown, we're introduced to questions. Are the people in this world NPC's or humans, deserving of rights? Is it wrong to subjugate people by force if the ruler will rule justly? How can you appear just while also appearing strong and uncompromising? And, with no ultimately defined goal, how would you act with near-infinite power? These questions arise naturally within the world, and this fact makes the story believable and immersive in a way that I've rarely seen. This rareness of depth is why I determined that the show deserves a full 10/10 score (a score I don't give lightly). Clearly a lot of time and care went into the creation of this world and story.",

            "content": "This season in particular has effectively cemented my continuing disappointment in the show. Don't get me wrong, its a decent time, but nowhere near the enjoyment and pacing I remember from the first season. The biggest issue I believe stems from a double edge knife; the character focus. The series does a great job maintaining relevance of the side character that I have come to appreciate when the deeper connections begin to unfold. That being said, it also results in a lot of waste and pretentious scenes. In the final scene, the dual could have been shortened tremendously with respect to the dialogue. It wasnot necessary to draw out the encounter as long as they did and I felt that a bulk of the episode in particularly was bloated and unremarkable. I feel like a lot of the episodes in the show can be described that way. For binge watching it is less noticeable since you can just move at your own pace and watch what happens next but when we are waiting for episodes I wish I could say I was satisfied with what I held my breath for.",

He shouldn't second guess, doubt, and otherwise feel sorry for himself. But around the point of reading book 11 I really started to like him as a character. Let's say Ainz is decisive, let's say Ainz is decisive and he wants to stay within Nazarick. \\n\\n\r\nEnd of series, Ainz stays is Nazarick forever.\\n\\n\r\nLets say Ainz is decisive and wants to crush humanity, and the world. \\n\\n\r\nEnd of series Ainz crushes humanity and the world.

While being generally disliked simply because he himself is an undead. Ainz has strokes of brilliance, especially towards 12-13 in the Light Novels.",

Overlord has completely changed the usual DMMO anime type (since antagonist is the main character) I truly believe that this innovative approach is what makes people feel different about Overlord, especially when compared to some other work like SAO II or III (the first one was great tho since again innovative, dramatic). Overlord is what  MMO gamers or even non gamer would totally love (author came up with loads of skill names, places with meanings, anda total background story of the game Yggdrasill was invented which shows how popular it is) I really advise anyone to first take a look at it and if you don't like it then most likely you should not watch MMO anime I guess, but then it will be still your choice. Anyway anyone should take a look at it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTbh, the grades are not really accurate and most likely, very biased. But at the same time 8,41/10 seems a bit underrated, so to kind of make up for it I decided to put a higher note than what I would have usually done which is objective notation.\\n\\n",

Compare it to the hyped Goblin Slayer, the characters didn't even had a name, they we're as generic as you can get, which it normal for MMORPG but they we're at least likable. \\n\\n\r\nYou won't see any interesting characters in Overlord, just accept it. It takes itself too seriously while not realizing what makes an anime series interesting, it's the Characters, not the Universe itself. \\n\\n\r\nSo what is Momonga exactly?

The title is not just a bunch of crap, 'cause the story indeed about Overlord that have absolut power and ruler (i think it's the same thing, idk, sry for my bad english). That's why i really like this series (And the gimmick RPG game).\r\n++The Character i can say is unique (Especially for the Guardian Floor), you can remember all of the guardian floor character so easily and for some supporting character though ('cause they're have background story , well i can't say is good or bad but it's fine).\\n\\n\r\n++ IDK why i really like the atmosphere when the AOG in wise mode at the moment of the throne room, i know he is pretend doing that.\\n\\n\r\n++ The Feel when AOG Battle is good AF, idk, when he's doing some duel PVP or something like that it's make my body feel like shaking.\\n\\n\r\nI think that's the good point for this series\\n\r\nNow the negative point.... :\\n\\n\r\n-- I know almost LN that have anime adaptation always get cut some of scene, character, or story so what you have to do is make a good execution for this, but in this series well... i can't say it's good enough. Just Fine but can't acceptable, you know there's character get cut and make the scene of some episode is bad, to be honest is really bad and makes some people confused (including me though).\\n\\n\r\n-- The graphic is good enough but it's bad when the battle scene, And when AOG walking it's really annoying (Especially for this season) idk why but when he's walking there's something lost. And the hair.... is really bad, yeah it's good 'cause the colour but their hair fused with the body when their head looking around (Especially if their have long hair).\\n\\n\r\n-- Too much character that appear but still mystery and didn't appear on the next season. And the character that didn't appear but it's been talked about by several character,\\n\r\nyou know what i talking about here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i give 9/10 'cause i enjoyed watching this series so is just my subjectivity opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review :)....!",

The fight scenes were great to watch, seeing Ains be his normal overpowered self was much more exciting than the daily lives of the residents of Carne village and the Great Tomb of Nazarick. The second half of this season really saved it for me as I first thought that it had drasticallybecame worse than its predecessors, but ended up not being as bad as I feared. I would have ranked this season much higher than the first two,  but considering half of it was lost to what was basically just a really long section of background building that could have been much shorter. Without it there would be a lot of questions later on in the season so I appreciate the background building so I wouldn't be staring at me screen like a dope.\\n\\n\r\nStill worth the watch, but if I were to watch it again, I would skip straight to episode 7.",

            "content": "When I first watched Overlord I, I never expected it to get a second season. It had been out for about 2 years when I first heard of it and I had never really thought much about it after I finished watching it. I enjoyed it, and was, admittedly, rather disappointed at the lack of any follow-up, especially considering that it didn't really feel like a show that was born to fail. The people who made this show wanted to make more and they had the source material to do it. But it just died, like so many others in the genre do. I eventuallyconceded that this series was doomed to join the pile, accompanied by shows like No Game No Life and Log Horizon.\\n\\n\r\nSo you can imagine my surprise when, all of a sudden, Overlord II is announced, added to the database, and scheduled to premiere in about a month. I don't think the word 'utter-shock' could be considered an exaggeration of my reaction.. and yet, I don't think the word disappointment can be considered a misrepresentation of my review. It was rather bad. Not super-bad. Just bad. And from there, I was sure that would be the death of overlord as a franchise...\\n\\n\r\nBut hold the phone, because before season 2's corpse even had a chance to go cold, season 3 blew down the door and declared it would be out in 3 months time. Pause for breath. Take in the silence...\\n\r\nFUCKING. WHAT?!?!\\n\r\nYou're telling me that this product, which was, in the end, not even that poorly received by the fans, is getting ANOTHER SEASON? NOW? Despite its arguable lack of originality, poor taste in humor, lazy animation, directionless storytelling and regardless of the fact that there are SO MANY OTHER TYPES of this very same concept that ARN'T getting another season?\\n\r\nREALLY?\\n\r\nMaybe my anger is unfounded. Maybe I'm going a bit too far by insinuating that this show is innately awful. Or that the quality difference between Season 1 and 2 was all that sizable. And again, If I have learned anything about anime it's that: first impressions almost never accurately represent the quality of the end product. But Jesus Christ man... Jesus fucking Christ...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverlord III has sealed the deal and officially labels its franchise as the fastest to diminish in quality on an episode by episode basis. There is nothing here that warrants any praise outside of *maybe* the ability to at least remember the last 2 seasons of story. Everything else is either done poorly or has been done better in a previous season. It's genuinely a shame that it's come to this point and if we EVER get Overlord IV, then I can only assume that some super-fan is funding this pitiful husk of a project.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is absolutely the prime example of this. In Season 1 and 2 there were a few bits of CGI that, while executed poorly, never really ruined the experience. They were almost always used exclusively on the undead monsters which, conveniently (and canonically), managed to fit their choppy and rigid style of movement. In season 3, its almost as if the 2D artists ran away and everyone else was left to make the show like it was some kind of 1990s south park episode except with the help of the guy who was training to be a CGI animator for yogurt adverts. Whenever something is made to look impressive it simply fails. But let's give credit where credit is due, the 2D art is still leaps and bounds ahead of the 3D mess (I hesitate to call it art). Unfortunately, to only make things worse, CGI is 5x more present than it was before (and in some cases even replaces parts where 2D art would ALWAYS look better). Its gut wrenching to look at and utterly ruined what should have been the most climactic episode in the entire trilogy.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the story is just tiresome at this point. We have now established that our MC is decked out, unbeatable and unfathomably powerful. So why, WHY, are we going around in circles by still trying to prove that? There are 3 arcs in this season. The first one is boring and we won't even mention it (because, if the lizards proved anything, we (all together now) \"\u266b Don't-give-a fuck-about-the-nor-mal-peo-ple \u266b\"). The second one is another \"build up a character(s) or scenario and let MC stomp it all in one fell swoop\", yeah, that one that we've done about 4 times now. Cool. The third arc actually has content, it follows on from the events of the second arc (except not in a way that excuses the wasted episodes of character development - even if you were just trying to highlight how evil everyone can be, it was pointless), From a story perspective, it's actually progressive and is a step in the right direction. However, more than any other arc in the trilogies history, it is totally ruined by the terrible CGI and pointless pride that apparently has to come from every sword wielder in a fantasy story - ever. It hurts me to think that removing any one thing would improve the show drastically, but it's all there anyway, amassing to be the shittiest stir-fry of bad practices and botched jobs I've ever written about (apart from THAT ONE SHOW we don't talk about).\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, where are all the good characters? Where's the fun butler dude or the demon or the big ant ~thing~. Why are we stuck with an endless onslaught of nameless maids and chipper blonde WANKERS that didn't even need to exist? Why is that what we're getting when all we really want is to see more of the characters that you've already spent time developing? This show has an awful issue of always starting from square one whenever it forgets what it was doing (which, apparently, seems to occur every 6 or so episodes) and if you couldn't tell from the previous words I went and wrote, It pisses me off.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI am really disappointed with the direction that Overlord has taken these past few months. I don't know if the studio is overworked, there was a disaster at the office, or even if the source material isn't up to scratch with the content that originally got the anime greenlit; but there is definitely a detrimental difference in quality. If I were asked, I would tell them to take a break. You CAN try Overlord IV (if you must), but don't push it out 3 months from now. Give it 9 months, give it a year. Clear your minds or clear your desk because the only reasons this has gone on for as long as it has is because, somehow, we don't have anything similar that is better.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading...",

I've enjoyed watching every season without ever needing to stop for a stupid reason! \r\nThe character development just slides through perfectly, and the story that goes along with it just makes it a masterpiece. Especially how they managed to line up the chronological order to be exact apart from being messed up. \r\nMy thoughts on all the seasons? \r\nAll the seasons are filled with interesting story developments that all lead into the finale of season 3 and hopefully the start ofseason 4! This is one of the few anime's that made me actually write a review about it. \\n\\n\r\nLord Ainz isn't too overpowered and shows that he can stand his own against his own floor guardians (Ainz vs Shalltear battle). \\n\\n\r\nIf anyone is ever interested in watching it, then you should! Give it the 3 episode rule to see if you like it but I know most people would like it if they gave it the 3 episode rule!",

            "content": "So before I start this review let me say I'm not a huge fan of character development animes. So yeah this review will be a little doo doo. Anyway to start off the first 6 episodes of the anime is utterly boring in my personal opinion. It is pure character development with irrelevant characters that I hope either die or play a big role later on. Because this is literally like the Naruto filler arcs only thing difference is that's what half this anime is about. Season 2 slither arc was even better than this.\r\nThe anime shouldn't be called \"overlord\", but rather \"Ainz and Friends\".If you enjoy character development with irrelevant people then you'll definitely enjoy this anime. The only time there's even action is rare, aka 2 episodes of actual fighting out of 12/13 per season. Yes, the fight is typically enjoyable but the whole premise is character building and what feels like a filler arc every damn season. Boy if this makes a season 4 it better be jam packed with irrelevant weak characters fighting when the main guy is \"OP\".\\n\\n\r\nThe music is ehhhh. Could be better. But the ehhhh definitely fits this anime so I'd say music is 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOnly problem I have is the how the creators pace the series. You have half the season with slow paced \"arcs\" when it could take a lesson from Tokyo Ghoul : Re and jampack 100 chapters into 1 episode. Then you have actual good content lasting less than me in bed. pls do better with pacing",

I've watched all the episodes of Overlord thus far and I have to say I have no clue as to why they've ruined the series in the last 2 seasons. First season was an absolute blast and a really good overall anime however 2nd season and 3rd season have just been side stories about some meaningless characters for about 80-90% of the season with no action. I don't know if I'm missing the point and when I went to check the rating of this season I was expecting to seean overall 6/10 just because well the first season was good (otherwise I'd be expecting a 4 or 5) but shockingly was greeted with an 8.36/10. If you want my honest opinion, stop at season 1.",

            "content": "Ok, this show is not meant to be a cerebral experience. It does not have a weighty philosophy or ethical dilemma or even a who-dun-it atmosphere. It is not a meticulous character study or a depiction of humanity. It is a liberating experience for all the MMORPG lovers that brings out their inner God complex vicariously. It does tug and scrape at your conscience (intentionally) to reveal the true nature of this God complex. The protagonist is a leader of bad guys. He is an average human gamer thrust into this role of this supreme overlord. Well, as most RPG gamers can relate, we allseek to achieve such a powerful status while killing all the minions and sacrificing NPCs to gain levels. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nAs Momonga, the protagonist starts adjusting to his new life as the Ovrelord, he feels himself losing his humanity gradually. The people in the new world are all just pawns for extending his power and understanding of the unfamiliar place nad its potential. His actions become more calculated and cautious like that of a Mob boss.\\n\\n\r\nWe don't really know much about the NPCs who get slain by our characters in the games and so we don't mind slaying them. But in here , the show gives us deep insights into their background and struggles they face in their life up until the point they get killed by the protagonists. This show illustrates how video games subtly desensitize us to violence. To Momonga, the people are pawns he needs to improve his power in a video game while we as viewers feel empathetic to their life and the situation which makes it harder for us to actually root for the protagonist. I like the fact that the story has these neat layers to it instad of devolving into a rambling tale of easy conquest of a supreme overlord.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Building: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis show has is a visual and visceral treat for all fantasy lovers. From the magic system to different races inhabiting the world it simply is breathtaking. It resembles a MMORPG game very much in this aspect and it is glorious. The scope for further development is infinite due to the same reason.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 10\\n\\n\r\nSplendid! Madhouse is as outstanding as ever in this department. I loved every frame and every design (well give or take a few). I couldn't help admiring how beautiful the art and animation was especailly during the battle scenes\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nIt's alright. Nothing that really stands out although it is composed to suit the atmosphere very well.  Occasionally, there are a few good scores which nicely complement the beautiful visuals\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say either you like em or you don't. The characters are, at a first glance, pretty simple and one dimensional ( save a few). HOWEVER they are damn interesting and enjoyable and subtly grow over the episodes. It is like observing NPC in the games starting to evolve gradually as they learn and adapt from theri experiences in the new world. I believe this is also one of the aspects of the story that the author aims to address as we see Momonga constantly making observations on how his subordinates change over time.\\n\\n\r\nMy one gripe is that most of the female characters were portrayed as evil, manipulative or bitchy. Some even looked a lot alike with blond hair. Almost all of them are smitten by Momonga. I wish the author had included some variety in his character design for the girls department instead of making the anime look like a cheap harem show.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this show from the first episode in Season 1 to the latest one. I could hardly stop binging on all the episodes. This might not be for people who are easily put off by overpowered protagonist with an evil side. The show does not dwell on the MC being morally conflicted by his actions or longing for his past life (which makes sense given he lost a part of his humanity) It does deliver fully on the entertainment scale with every developing event piquing our interest.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Hellsing Ultimate, Berserk or even One-Punch Man, do pick this one up without hesitation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Even I wouldn't fight this guys because it's not worth it. Let my servants fight these ants. You set up this arena that has no audience, all survivors killed (Dead men tell no tales) the servants are the only witness? So you want your servants to think your edgy?

            "content": "Well...this was a big disappointment. This is my first review (and last)  for the Overlord saga.  I will briefly explain why I think you should take your money and run by not watching this season. \r\nStory 6/10\r\nWe have an \"OP\" Character in a world that just can't produce an antagonist to match his power, basic plot so far. Usually this characters hold back their \"divine\" power because they know that their power is knowledge, so why does Ains really on the speculation of his servants to make a move? It completely differs from the other seasons in which the story progresses around othercharacters aside Ains. It makes no sense that the main goal is World Domination when we know the world is dominated because no one can survive a fight with Ains. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\r\nEver seen Star Wars Episode 3 iconic scene where Obi Wan tells Anakin \"You became the thing you swore to destroy\"? Well, this season is that phrase times 10. Same characters on Ains side and a few character developments on the human side. \\n\\n\r\nThe only \"major\" change comes from Ains (and not a self indulged change) when he gives a damn about the world by trying to seize it all. It gives the character an \" I have nothing better to do\" attitude. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 7/10\\n\r\nPretty basic for the series. It didn't set a new standard for the series, but giving it a seven for the giant goat like creatures that gave the anime a little sense of creativity. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\r\nI've seen worse but also have seen much better anime than this, both of the genre and not. \\n\\n\r\nI will definitely think twice next time a new season comes out.

After a lukewarm S2, S3 manages to live up the hype (The Hype is Real!).\r\nThe story is fun.  The overpowered Main Character is on a completely different scale than all the other characters.  There are not many good guys in the series, especially not Ainz.  The first episode is kind of a filler episode with funny moments.  The humor is on point, though it gets dark a lot time (gruesome deaths of innocents/good guys).  The characters may not be as deep assome other series, but the absolute freakish nature of the anime allows to overlook that.  While people complain about the CG especially if army units, I don't think that takes away much from the anime.  The opening track is really peppy and good.  Compared to the second season, this one is much better paced and leads to real story developments.",

The first season got me enthusiastic about the concept, the second season was pretty mediocre and even though this season was better it still wasn't great. Perhaps it is the manga (did not read it)?\r\nIf I would have to guess, I would blame the weak story/tension build up. I feel it is stopping every season at the point where you can see (the next peak) but without being on one.Moreover, the story feels slow, because they try to be thorough, but by the time I am getting captivated the season is over. I would propose a 52 episode course to get this really off the ground.",

Once again to have fallen in love with the story of the overpowered undead Ainz Ooal Gown and the beautiful intro of the third season of \r\n'Overlord'.\r\n****There might be spoilers****\r\nStory\r\nAs I said, this series is about that overpowered skeleton-like 'monster' called Lord Ainz. In this season, he is starting to take control over the world, which he surely can do with ease. \r\nBut another part of the story is taken by Enri, the leader of the small Carne Village,which is also under the control of the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nIt is really amazing to see a story from the view of the 'evil' side of it.\\n\r\nI always thought Ainz wouldn't hurt the humans, but boy, I was so wrong.\\n\r\nOnly one magical spell to whipe out an entire army - leaving almost no one surviving.\\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\\n\r\nNot much to say about it, it's a nicely animated anime with no flaws I can argue about.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nWell, the music in this was - how should I say - absolutely amazing!\\n\\n\r\nThe intro \"VORACITY\" by MYTH\uff06ROID was so good - it'd be a reason to keep watching even if the anime wasn't good at all. \\n\r\nI love it. That's all I can say about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's the same as it has been before, really, really evil beings trying to rule the world against the humans, who begin to fall into despair when they see their powers. But the protagonist also leaves those, who accept him, in peace. So he's not just a monster killing everyone it sees because I think, with his powers, that'd be really boring as he'd whipe out humanity within a few days.\\n\\n\r\nI loved this season and I am exited for the next one.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n",

The reason Overlord succeeds is because it's actually interesting. \r\nBuild up is an important factor in most story telling, generally the bigger the build up the more exciting it is when things actually happen. It took Overlord 3seasons of introducing characters, various locations and factions, differences in power levels of the characters and other important info, and it definitely paid off with that season finale. On the contrary, SAO only took 4 episodes to try and achieve the same effect. It didn't work out so well. \\n\r\nIn essence, Overlord is how the story telling of an overpowered cheat character should be done.",

The animation relies heavily on CGI.  Heavily.  Too heavily.\r\nWhile CGI can be acceptable, even fine or good in some series depending on implementation - look at Gundam Unicorn - here it's awful.  It's lazy.  It's not even trying to hide its laziness.  It's as if the animators are telling the audience \"eh, whatever, you get the point.\"  Previous seasons have obviously CGI skeletons.  This season is far, farworse.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is surprisingly good.  Pacing both within and between episodes felt good with only one or two hiccups.  Rarely did anything feel forced, rarely (though there is a particularly egregious example) did anything feel unnecessarily drawn out. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is probably my least favorite of Myth&Roid's work.  Sound within the anime itself is fine, serviceable, but nothing really noteworthy beyond \"the opening is significantly worse than previous work by the same artist.\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter interaction, worldbuilding, and plot are the strong points here, don't go looking for technical achievement.",

            "content": "So quite the amount of people are giving this a not so well review. But personally, this show only gets better and better each season.\r\nSo you might see that I have a 9 out of 10 on this, but that's because I ended up calculating my average up. It's amazing though, and I recommend you watch this season as well as the other ones!\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nSo the beginning of the show showed the comedic side of it, which was basically a \"Welcome Back\" for the returned audience. Really enjoyed that. But, then it started going into the plot of the season and..ehh..I .gotta admit that itwas a bit slow-pacing for me, I would say it was dragging it a bit too much. The way they introduced the new characters wasn't the best transition to the season, but I guess it's fine because most of them were in the show for a short amount of time, anyways. Otherwise, it's hella good. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nMost of the art is the typical amount for an \"average\" anime. Not too much detail, like the amount that Violet Evergarden had, but enough to see the outline of the characters. The animation's pretty typical, too. The CGI parts are a bit low quality and dated, but I mean, I guess it was easier making those skeletal creatures 3D than 2D for the artists. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter's voice actors fit with the personality and the mood that is brought together with the character themselves. Music is amazing. Matches with the tone of the show and the chaotic appeal to the show as well. All I can say is that the music just keeps on getting better and better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with the show for the longest time was the amount of appearances of characters in a season. So grateful that they took that into account for this series, and they're starting to show more of the Nazarick characters. Especially Aura, since she's been my favorite character from the beginning. They only showed small clips of her for the first two seasons, but then in one of the episodes they showed more of her and her abilities. Even showed a shyness of her that wasn't really shown into the show. The only character I had a problem with was that character Jircniv Nix. He reminded me of one of those annoying pretty boys. Like each time he would pop up, I would skip it. I think they purposely made him annoying, but still, probably the most annoying character in Overlord.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about this show, specifically this season, is that you're always surprised of the outcome. Each season, it's like you get everything you want: a bit of action, lots of fantasy, a bit of humor, and other things. There isn't usually a dull moment in the show, in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nSome minor things to fix in this season, otherwise its definitely worth watching. If you're at the end of this review, then thank you for reading my thoughts and what I had to say. I hope you consider this review effective or helpful in anyway. :)-",

But the thing which was a huge let down for me this season was the irredeemably bad CGI that they used in this season. Madhouse studio is absolutely MAD for using so bad CGI in this work. Overlords CGI has never been the best in the previous seasons but it has done itjob well enough. But these horrendous  plastic model CGI armies and those big thingys (if you have watched episode 12 you know what I mean) are almost just as bad as  bad as the CGI in the new Berserk franchise which I haven't even watched but the GIFs and clips from it are enough to tell me the quality of the CGI.\\n\r\nThe last episode has not yet aired and I hope it is going to good and this is mostly rant about the bad CGI and it is sad to see so great story crumble down because Madhouse does not put enough budget to CGI. The good thing is that there is not like tons of CGI scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other aspects of the show..\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 (little more gore than the previous seasons but still good in my opinion)\\n\\n\r\nArt: CGI: 1 or 2 but the rest animation and other art stuff is somewhere between 7 and 8 (really like the style of the show)\\n\\n\r\nSound: Between 7 and 8 (OP and ED are both really good but the rest of the sounds are pretty basic but still nothing to complain about)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 (Overlords strongest side is the characters, even the minor side characters are really well written)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 (If the CGI was any better it would be 8 or 9)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 \\n\r\nOtherwise a great anime and a visual novel adaptation but the CGI is really bad\\n\\n",

Ainz still uncontested and seems to be continuing to snow ball to world domination.

What's worse it's not like the bad guys(main cast) are winning because their smart, don't get me wrong their smart and it definitly helps but their ultimately winning because their powers are all super freaking OP, to the point were other Isekai protagonists seem under powered. \\n\\n\r\nMy question for this anime is, if these are the bad guys then were are the hero's to challenge them? Why should seeing them commit atrocities make me happy? If it's not meant to then why do you keep showing it? Were's their punishment? Am I supposed to root for them anyway? Aren't good villains meant too have strong motivations or at the very least, have motives?",

            "content": "I would give a 6/10 to the entire Overlord series, not just for Overlord III. Since I don't think an Overlord IV is coming out anytime soon, its safe to say that Overlord III is supposed to give the audience something exciting to watch while they wait for Overlord IV. On the contrary, Overlord III is about the same as the previous two seasons in the way that it introduces yet another set of characters as well as barely touching upon the plot. \r\nWhen I began to watch Overlord, I was expecting this villain character Ains to conquer the world. However, the first season didnot do this at all, he goes undercover to become Momonga the adventurer and that's basically it. So I thought \"hey, maybe they will do it in the second season\". Nope, We get introduced to some lizard people who don't matter later on and then we get introduced to a group of adventurers who also don't matter later on. To be fair, Ains does conquer the lizardmen, but it was no where near what I was expecting. So then I thought \"maybe the third season will show him finally conquering things\". Yea, I need to stop thinking things get better. (I'll put the problems I had about the story in the end because I think that's a spoiler and I like to put spoiler parts in the end.)\\n\\n\r\nSomething I had a problem with is the amount of dialogue this had. Whenever there was a major fight scene, fine, I can handle a little bit of trash talk where they say they will beat the other or something like that. But this made the fights drag on for far too long. It reminded me of Dragon ball where there's more dialogue than actual fighting. When the fighting did occur, the fight scenes weren't the best either. It was probably the dialogue every 10 seconds that really ruined it. But it was not action packed as other fights I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I had in general was the intro song. I usually don't care because I skip them anyway, but this song made me want to skip. In general I hate the sound of the music in the Overlord intro's.  I guess you can categorize this as electronic music, but I listen to electronic music and this sounds terrible, it sounds like a bunch of weird sounds put together.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the story. there will be spoilers.\\n\r\n**********SPOILERS AHEAD***********\\n\r\nSo in the beginning we go back to the village Ains had saved in the first season. It focuses on how the girl leads the village and how Nphirea likes her and stuff. I don't see why it was necessary to go back again. I didn't really care about them. Again, I wanted to see Ains do things, not focus on some villagers. Then it is revealed that there are two other monsters of the forest and Ains goes and takes care of them. this is really the first part of the season. And I disliked this part because I really couldn't see how this would importantly affect the plot in any way. I'll tell you right now, even by the end of the season, I don't see why it focused on the village so much. \\n\r\nThen we get introduced to some new adventurers that are hired to infiltrate a new ruin that was found. (It's Ain's decoy place I think). They go into it and then there are traps and stuff. I don't remember any of these people's names and they sure don't matter because they get killed off in like 3 episodes. So here's the thing: why introduce them in the first place? I think the writers wanted us to care about these characters because one of the adventurers has two sisters she wants to take care of on her own. But... three episodes is no where enough time to care about a character. It angers me because the adventurers could be cut out of the story entirely and nothing significant would change. They don't affect the plot. The infiltration of Ain's decoy base affected the plot because then Ains could talk to the empire who sent the tombraiders. They could easily have showed some people running into the base and then dying. They didn't need to introduce them and fill time.\\n\r\nNow the end of this season somewhat redeemed this to a score of 6 instead of a 4 or 5. Ains finally commands an army and he finally takes control of the city El-Rantel. I didn't think the army battle was anywhere as epic as it could have been because it just showed a bunch of cgi soldiers dying from giant black beasts. I didn't think the capture of the city was satisfying at all because the kingdom just gave it up to Ains. But honestly, after going through three seasons of this I'll take anything I can get. The sad thing is, the last two or three episodes of this advanced the plot further than the previous two seasons combined in my opinion. Seriously, You could watch the first episode of the first season and then the last episodes of this season and you wouldn't miss anything important.\\n\\n\r\n******End of Spoiler*****\\n\\n\r\nIf you read all the way to here. First of all, thank you for reading this, it is my first review of something. It is nice to share what I feel about something.",

            "content": "TLDR: If you liked Overlord and Overlord II, read the Light Novel. This anime will only tarnish the series for you.\r\nOverall\t 6\r\nStory\t         10\r\nAnimation\t 1\r\nSound\t 7\r\nCharacter\t 7\r\nEnjoyment\t 4\r\nDon't get me wrong, Overlord is a great story. I'd recommend the Light-Novel to anyone. Even the translated versions are great. After seeing the Anime on Crunchyroll, and watching the first season, I had to get more, so I read the Light-novel, and 1/2 way through book 5, Season II came out. I was so excited, and it was great! Even though the lizardmen arc was not the best part ofthe novel, the anime adaptation skipped over many of the more boring parts, and I actually thought the pacing was OK. I heard Season 3 was coming out this year and was super excited as well. \"Another season!?\" YES!!\\n\r\nOverlord III hit me with everything I didn't like from season two, plus obvious budget cuts destroyed the anime's art style to a point where halfway through the season it was more bad CGI than actual animation. I wish they had the budget to produce actual art, and hope that someone will make a fan recreation of the latter half of the season done right. The CGI, and the lack of care that went into making these episodes make it clear we will never get another season. They killed my favorite story.",
