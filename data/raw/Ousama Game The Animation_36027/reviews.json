            "content": "\u201cThis show is fucking awful.\u201d\r\n-Me\r\nThe rules of the King\u2019s Game are as follows:\r\n1. All female characters must be appallingly sexualized, this is a MATURE show for ADULTS after all.\r\n2. Every death has to be over-the-top and ridiculous, people like comedy relief, right?\r\n3. Characters must never exercise common sense, how else would there be a conflict?\r\n4. The plot must be as nonsensical as possible. We can just tell people it\u2019s a \u201cmystery.\u201d\r\nOusama Game is revolting. \r\nIt\u2019s not bad in a, \"Wow this show has so much mindless violence,\" sort of way. \r\nIt's more like \"Wow some perverted sicko was literally paid to animate their disgusting fetishes\u201d.\r\nI'mnot only repulsed by Ousama game because of the sexualization. I'm repulsed by it because of how confidently it uses the horror genre as an excuse to create appalling sexualization. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10\\n\r\nThe story goes in circles; introducing a few characters that you have no reason to care about, killing them violently for very stupid reasons, then repeating the cycle in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nA group of students of some random class receive text messages from a person who calls themselves \u201cking\u201d aka Ousama, they say the students are part of a game and if they don't obey the rules they are punished. Seems interesting enough, right? And it kind of is at first until you realize every episode has the same structure; a bunch of random students are introduced, they receive a nearly impossible order from the king via their phones, they obviously fail to survive it and die in a horrific way. At least the deaths are pretty absurd at first, not that they make any sense. So much blood, so little logic. There was even a character who gets punished by being burnt to death and she just stands around for a whole minute entirely engulfed in flames and out of all things that she can do, she chooses to strips down. Yep. She literally is being burnt alive and the writer thought that was the perfect time to sexualize her. Humanity is doomed and Ousama Game will be the catalyst for the apocalypse.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters often make the same frustrating choices over and over thanks to the poorly told story, the main character Nobuaki tells the story of the first Ousama Game he was in while being in a new game in present day. We constantly see the characters make the same mistakes thanks to this broken form of storytelling. It\u2019s obvious that studio Seven didn\u2019t have enough material from the first manga so to compensate they adapted the sequel story as well, but in the end, layering them on top of each other caused both to be incredibly underdeveloped. There is no consideration put into the pacing of the story, events are just contrived into existence and we\u2019re just supposed to believe it. The only thing that keeps the show semi-comprehensive is the formulaic story; there is a group of random students and per expectations of the death game genre they will all be killed until there\u2019s a winner. At least Ousama Game has a formula making it not entirely incompetent, but that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s original. It more than likely grabbed these concepts from better anime to cobble together it\u2019s story without caring how the final product would turn out. \\n\\n\r\nI like the story concept of everyday people trying to fight against a personified Deus Ex Machina antagonist, but this idea is used, abused, then thrown into a dumpster and lit on fire. The King is never explored as an antagonist, it's just an excuse for mindless violence. It throws so many ideas at the wall but nothing sticks; it takes the cell phone gimmick from Mirai Nikki, it takes the fear of the unknown from Another, and the abundance of gore from both, but it does nothing with them. For all the flaws those shows have, at least they know how to build up enough tension for gore to not be totally undeserved. Ousama Game just throws shit at you and screams at you in an attempt to be taken seriously. How ironic that the director of Mirai Nikki worked on the much better death game show this season, Juuni Taisen.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is so obsessed with its own edginess that it\u2019s almost laughable. We\u2019re constantly reminded how evil humans are when put into a complex situation like the king\u2019s game. For example, a character who has yet to be even been given a name might beat up another character by order of the king and say something stupid along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s kill or be killed!!\u201d Sure you could argue a scene like that would establish the tone and put forth a theme, but when the characters are so unbelievable it\u2019s impossible to seriously analyze the morally reprehensible decisions they make.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 0/10\\n\r\nYep, 0%. \\n\r\nThe characters make the show ridiculous and impossible to take seriously. If they just didn\u2019t exist the show would be 10 times better. Everything they do is stupid. They get themselves into terrible situations and endanger their lives and the lives of their classmates constantly, but as you start to realize there is no hope for any of their survival you will find that their stupidity makes the show a comedic. They yell at each other and get nothing done. Constantly they deny that the King's Game is real, even though many of their classmates have already been killed; they just remark \"it must be a coincidence!\" and I chuckle every time I see that line.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character Nobuaki is an asshole. He\u2019s built up to be some kind of hero; characters constantly talk about him like he\u2019s a saint who\u2019s helped them through the game, yet we only ever see him treat them like crap. He treats other characters, but mostly women, horribly. He smacks them, he lies to a blind girl after causing their blindness, he forces them to do degrading things, and yet after all of the awful things he does to them they still sing his praises. These glaring issues start to make sense once you look at the staff page for this show. You will see that the \u201cOriginal Creator\u201d is named Nobuaki Kanazawa. The same as the main character. Yeah... the creator of this shit-fire placed himself into Ousama Game because it is HIS fantasy. At least it explains why all of the characters lose all sense of logic to praise him, but it's still really fucking sad that someone like that exists.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t just broken character writing, it is harmful to the viewers who will no doubt take it literally and believe that it\u2019s ok to treat women as horribly as Nobuaki does. (Yes there are people whose minds are molded by what they watch on television. Believe me, I\u2019ve met them.) \\n\\n\r\nThe one character I could point out as the antagonist is Natsuko, even if the Ousama could be counted they never make an appearance if we're to assume they exist at all. What's so frustrating about her is that, she is very clearly insane, she kills, manipulates, and swaps into her psychotic persona on the drop of a hat, yet none of the students think to say \u201cOh, maybe we shouldn\u2019t trust that crazy girl because she probably wants to kill us so she can ensure her victory!\u201d Never is this issue resolved. Characters are constantly tricked throughout the show and it gets to a laughably predictable point. You know that the unsuspecting random student introduced just minutes ago with less than 2 lines of dialogue will be killed by the end of the episode without any development whatsoever, so why even care about them? It's clear that no one involved in Osama Game cared at all about creating characters, they just wanted to create big breasted anime ladies to sexualize, which isn\u2019t surprising considering the studio that produced it mainly makes hentai.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 1/10\\n\r\nFlat and ugly visuals plague the show all around. The only scenes that seem to have been made with serious effort are the sex scenes, which is unsurprising considering the studio that produced it makes primarily hentai. Misshapen character designs make the show even worse to look at because the majority of scenes are them standing around talking (or yelling). Backgrounds range from mostly the school, character's homes, hospitals sometimes, but none of them are even a little nice to look at. The art becomes incredibly bad in the later episodes. Characters look laughably off model constantly. Blood looks like thick globs of ketchup which only makes the show seem more like a comedy. All you people out there who watch crappy shows ironically will find something worth laughing at in this show\u2019s visuals.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t expect the edginess to make up for the show's issues because the atmosphere is crap too. Horror anime like Another, Shiki, and Higurashi showed us that it\u2019s possible to make a horror anime with a thick atmosphere to immerse the viewers. But on top of the terrible visuals, the idiotic characters, poor direction, and hilariously bad script make it impossible to get immersed in. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\r\nThe music and sound effects aren\u2019t good, but sometimes they work to comedic effect. Sound effects like the ringing of the phones when the characters receive a message from the king are timed to be jump scares or spook the viewer, but they add significant humor to scenes due to very predictable outcomes. The soundtrack is very mediocre and it reminds me of the type of music from old campy horror flicks, I like that style but it doesn\u2019t fit with the mature tone that they were aiming for. Extra camp is always a welcomed addition to a pile of crap like this. You can never have enough unintentional comedy when it comes to Ousama Game!\\n\\n\r\nAs if the show didn\u2019t have enough edge already, the OP is emo/metalcore. And it really is not the good type, just loud and obnoxious. You\u2019d do well to skip over the OP (and the whole show tbh). \\n\r\nThe ED song \"Lost Paradise\" is pretty edgy too but it\u2019s not harsh on the ears, it should have been used as the op in my opinion. It's no surprise the performer of the song Pile is mostly known for her work on the idol series Love Live because she's quite talented (talent that King's Game didn't deserve). There\u2019s a dub too. God bless the writers at Funimation for taking on this heap of garbage because the translated script is hilariously bad. The voice acting is expectedly amateurish. It\u2019s not much better than the sub.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t get a little bit of enjoyment from Ousama Game. Not once did I feel close to being afraid while watching it, but I laughed many of times. Actually, there was one time I technically was afraid of the show. At the very end of episode 12, there is the most fear-inspiring line in the entire show. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cTo Be Continued\u201d\\n\\n\r\nImagining there might be a sequel to this dumpster fire chills me to my core. \\n\\n\r\nOusama Game is only semi-watchable when it\u2019s showing off a slew of ridiculous deaths with really poor art quality because at least you can laugh at it. If that doesn\u2019t sound like something you could enjoy then you\u2019ll likely get nothing out of the show. Even if you intend to watch it for the overdone violence you\u2019ll probably be disappointed because by the final few episodes it becomes toned down and more execution styles are reused. It can\u2019t even do mindless violence right... Keep in mind though, the show never fully embraces the absurdity of its plot so the comedy doesn\u2019t reach its full potential.\\n\r\nThe repulsive sexualization also prevents the comedy from being consistent. Whenever I thought it might get funny I was bombarded with unsettling fanservice that made my skin crawl, defusing any potential comedy.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s almost always obvious when a character is about to die because they get a last minute line to characterize them and (attempt to) make you feel sad for them. Needless to say, this cheap trick never worked. Not once. The deaths are never impactful in any way. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 1/10\\n\r\nOusama game is broken, it is missing features that are necessary to tell a story. There\u2019s no pacing, the director cares more about shooting the female characters in risque ways than actually telling a story, the actual story makes no sense and falls apart as soon as you think about it. \\n\r\nFrustrating doesn't even begin to describe how I felt about the characters. They are stupid and will always be stupid, so don't go into it expecting a horror. I recommend only watching it as a comedy (if you really must watch it). I hate Ousama Game. If I could obliterate it from existence I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do so. Nobuaki too, he's up there with the worst protagonists I've ever seen in an anime.",

            "content": "Do you value your free time? Do you consider yourself of average intelligence?  If the answer is yes to both questions, then you should stay away from Ousama Game. I usually abstain from writing reviews, even more so for incomplete anime, but I thought I should warn any person who might be in false hopes that this anime could be good because it has Miyano Mamoru\u2019s name attached, just like my naive past self.\r\nThis anime is basically about a classroom that starts receiving orders from a self-proclaimed King via texts. If they don\u2019t obey these orders then the King punishes them, usually with death.If this sounds semi-interesting to you, then prepare yourself for disappointment because this horror premise is basically an excuse for the author to write copious amounts of nonsensical, perverted situations. The orders are basically Fuck or Die with a heavy dose of NTR. There is nothing the King would gain from sending these orders other than to masturbate at the students\u2019 desperation and consensual cuckoldry.\\n\\n\r\nWith this premise, I thought I would feel sorry for the characters. However even disregarding their incredibly bland and archetypal characterization, they always do unreasonable stuff that results in their deaths. If that's 50% of the case, then the other half is them being surprised at things that should be a given at any point. No sign of intelligence or reason here.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly I would give this 1 but it has made me chuckle a few times: it really tries to take itself seriously but it\u2019s so forcibly edgy that it's unintentionally hilarious.

            "content": "Okay, I had to make an account just to write a review for this. The other reviews I read seemed to miss the mark, and in my opinion come from pretty naive point of views. \r\nTo me the worst part of this show is the animation and the sound, but it certainly isn't as bad as what haoliners has given us. I find it to be pretty tolerable, and considering animators in Japan are known to be severely under paid, I can certainly forgive it and proceed forward into what other qualities the anime has to offer. But if this is critical to your enjoyment,I would keep this in mind before starting it.\\n\\n\r\nOkay so now that I've cleared the air of that, I want to get to what I think this anime offers that I haven't really seen mentioned. I believe in another review I read that this was some sort of sick display of a perverted mind, which made me believe that this is the type of anime that will heavily divide its audiences enjoyment based on your world views and if you prefer anime primarily for its escapism or if you enjoy it because you like to see real life elements integrated and practiced out in a fictional world. I am of the latter of the two which may be why I enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has so far absolutely thrown some heavy situations on you within a short amount of time. So far we've dealt with making self sacrificial decisions for the better of someone you love, betrayal, difficult decisions made out of self preservation, false persona's shattered under tension, terrible life tragedies, and getting to watch a relatable protaganist desperately try to keep things together as it all falls apart in his hands. \\n\\n\r\nObviously we don't have to deal with a mysterious omnipotent power commanding us to our deaths in reality, but we absolutely do have to deal with issues like sexual abuse, infidelity, loss, betrayal, true faces being shown under pressure, and other various situations this show has put on display for us. Personally, I enjoy watching the main character scramble as he tries to keep face in light of all these horrific challenges, because I find that to be absolutely relatable, and it makes me that much more interested in seeing what route they will take for the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThis show does an excellent job at keeping things on edge, as the viewer learns quickly that the characters lives can be quite short lived. This is both a strength and weakness this element of the story brings. On one hand it makes you value the characters lives when you become attached to certain ones, but in the same breath it doesn't really invest much into why you should be attached to them in the first place. But with that being said, I found myself getting strong feels when characters I hardly knew put on display of genuine relatable emotion, which i don't really see as a easy feat to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nIf your like me and you've been watching anime for 15+ years, you might find this to be a refreshing breath of air. It surely isn't the most original anime, but it definitely isn't the typical, overly done recurring themes we've seen in the industry lately.\\n\\n\r\nWhen recommending this to others I would give this anime a 7,  all though personally the number based off of my own enjoyment would be worthy of an 8. It's nothing profound or game changing, its just a good story to observe. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone without a backbone that isn't looking to have challenging feelings thrown at them, since this is certainly one for a more mature audience with a taste for darker themes.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point in time only 5 episodes of the series are out, so this series may very well crash and burn depending on the route they take, but i definitely recommend others to join this journey as of right now.\\n\\n\\n\r\n**UPDATE** Just finished the series. All hopes I had were crushed. This took an absolute turn for the worst. Smh I just can't even believe how bad it got towards the end.  It had potential, but it was completely wasted.",

            "content": "Survival anime are nothing new when looking back over the last few years. Shows such as Btooom!, Danganropa and Mirai Nikki are all based around a particular survival game and have all found moderate to massive popularity among anime fans. Even outside of anime, you just have to look at franchises like The Hunger Games and Maze Runner to see how successful the subgenre is. It\u2019s clear that stories based around a group of characters, their impending doom and how they try to survive such are intriguing to a lot of people. But why is that? Personally, I believe these kinds of premises can presenta darker look at morality; show a darker side to ourselves through characters put in a severe set of circumstances that test one\u2019s beliefs, values, friendships. It\u2019s surprising how a simple concept can turn into a thrilling experience hard to match anywhere else. But this is where I have a problem with most survival anime; they begin with a simplistic setup and never get deeper. Things like character development and thematic exploration are barely touched on in these shows, with more time used for cheap thrills, cringe-worthy horror and overall mindless entertainment. This is an anime that manages to fail at even these aspects.\\n\\n\r\nKing\u2019s Game: The Animation is an anime adaptation of a series of \u201ccell phone novels\u201d and is the most recent example of an anime to present us with a survival game that pits everyone against one another until there is one left standing. Considering what I could take from the poorly-designed cover art to the production studio behind it: Seven, who also made a couple Slice of Life comedies I\u2019ve barely heard of and a ton of hentai, I didn\u2019t have much in the way of expectations that this show would be anything good, but I was hopeful that it would at least be a fun watch. That was a mistake. King\u2019s Game follows Nobuaki Kanazawa, the winner of the previous \u201cKing\u2019s Game\u201d as he transfers to a new school in an attempt to escape his terrible past. Unfortunately, the game follows him and now his new class are all subjected to the survival game that Nobuaki is all too familiar with. The basic rules of the game are: obey any order sent by the King within 24 hours, failure to do so will result in punishment/death and everyone involved must play to the end. Now, with all the basic information out of the way, here is how King\u2019s Game: The Animation manages to turn a rather generic concept into one of the biggest fuckups of the entire year.\\n\\n\r\nThe first major problem with this anime is how it introduces the game, more specifically the \u201corders\u201d from the King that everyone must obey. The first order involves Nobuaki and classmate Natsuko Honda having to kiss, otherwise they\u2019ll be \u201cpunished\u201d. The first order is extremely childish considering this is supposed to be a game where people\u2019s lives are on the line. Show like this need to have some high stakes and consequences to match how serious the game is, also adding suspense and excitement to what characters will do, even if they\u2019re predictable. In the first episode, any sense of initial weight here is lost once you see how all of the orders feel like they were made by a 10-year-old. And if you thought ordering people to kiss was already a dumb move, prepare yourself, because most of the orders shown throughout the show are forcing students to have sex with each other. Let me ask, how is one supposed to take a death game seriously at all when a majority of it is about groping breasts and coerced sex? It\u2019s absurd and should not be taken seriously. Other dumb orders include not sleeping before you have obeyed an instruction and not doing anything unnecessary for 24 hours. If you didn\u2019t understand the last order, don\u2019t worry, the entire game isn\u2019t worth the time and even the minimal effort required to understand. This is clearly a case of a simple concept turned ridiculous due to how serious the show tries to take it. But what\u2019s even more ridiculous is the characters involved in the game.\\n\\n\r\nKing\u2019s Game deals with a class of 32 students, not including characters from Nobuaki\u2019s past and none of them are developed to where you are supposed to about them except for the protagonist, and even then he comes off so bland and uninteresting that I\u2019m sure a lot of people watching won\u2019t care about him or the show a couple weeks after finishing said show. In fact, it probably would\u2019ve been better to have killed Nobuaki off midway so it wouldn\u2019t have been so predictably boring. But I digress. Most of the characters are just expendable and are made as victims of the punishments in a poor attempt to justify the gravity of their predicament. Literally about a dozen characters with no prior screen time die on the first day because they were sleeping, and viewers are expected to care? You don\u2019t create sympathy from your audience by killing off characters in such a way with their only key feature being that they exist! That\u2019s one of the most obvious examples of lazy writing in anime. But the poor writing doesn\u2019t stop there, since most of the characters that do get screen time are completely one-dimensional, have no interesting traits and can be easily replaced with any of the nameless character that got killed off first. It\u2019s one thing to say in an anime like this you only know a little about 2-3 characters after the first episode, it\u2019s a whole other issue when half-way through watching, you still only now about a couple of characters when over half of the class is already dead. Not good King\u2019s Game, not good.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not all, because it just so happens that basically every single character in the show is a retard to the point where even if these characters were developed at all, it would still be difficult to feel anything when these characters die because of their own stupidity. The most blatant example of how autistic they can get is when Natsuko is ordered to have sex with a guy, asks to have sex with Nobuaki first, and then when denied does a whole 180 personality-wise, grabbing the initial dude and tries to do the act in front of all her other classmates. They try to play it off saying she was always psychotic and only acted nice, but considering how she was nice to everyone around her and even showed interest in Nobuaki before the game, I see this . But this is just small example compared to the dozens of time where characters show their complete ignorance to what is even happening around them. These characters are still kids, but the idea that most of them are unable to think for themselves what other players are doing in a game of life or death is bewildering to say the least. It\u2019s like they have selective memory loss where they all just forget what happened 2 minutes before when a character was acting like a lunatic. Even just thinking about how the show would work in our world brings forth a whole new set of questions that the show never ever acknowledges because it knows just how full of bullshit it really is. For example, if so many students in the same class have died in such a short amount of time, wouldn\u2019t there be police involved? Wouldn\u2019t any of the students try and tell someone who isn\u2019t a part of the game about what\u2019s happening? Oh wait, I forgot. This anime doesn\u2019t bother showing characters that are not part of the game. The way that King\u2019s Game avoids showing any sort of outside influence that would have an impact on the game is enough to tell me that this is nothing more that mindless entertainment at a very low standard.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big issue with King\u2019s Game is how it tells its story. The story overall is not difficult to tell but it tries to combine both the present game with flashbacks of the previous game Nobuaki was a part of before transferring and it ends up being detrimental to the show. The flashbacks shown usually take up most of the episode and makes it a lot more difficult for most present-day characters to get any proper focus or development before they are killed off. The characters in these flashbacks can also easily be confused with characters in the present due to how similar all of their designs are, making it harder to differentiate between the two timelines at times. The transitions between the two timelines does not help to distinguish when a time-jump has occurred. I understand that this anime is trying to adapt 2 different instalments to the franchise, but it ends up being so unnecessary as all that was needed to show was few scenes with Nobuaki and his former classmates rather than encompass more than 1 story in 12 episodes. The outcome of the past game is already given as Nobuaki says himself that he was the only survivor. And the saddest part, most of the characters in the flashback are more developed that characters in the current and try to find out what the King\u2019s Game really is, when it really should be the other way around as the flashbacks stop at episode 7, leaving us to deal with shit characters play out this shit storyline for the rest of this shit anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the punishments and actual deaths in this anime, I am once again disappointed. Not only because of how cheap so many of these deaths feel, but of how these death are nearly always shameless gore fests, yet not so over-the-top that they end up being hilarious. King\u2019s Game is actually very similar to Another, a 2012 horror anime that also featured a cast of school students and had most of them dying in some of the most exaggerated ways possible that it almost turned the show into a comedy. Seriously, watch a couple of the deaths in Another, on their own they are way better than the actual show. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the deaths shown here in King\u2019s Game were inspired by Another, but even then, King\u2019s Game fails to do that right. It has around the same amount of death and bloodshed as Another, but was never amusing, and while part of that is due to stupid actions by the characters, the execution of these deaths are also just anticlimactic. I never thought I would ever say that seeing a character literally explode in a pile of blood was boring, but alas here we are. Well done King\u2019s Game, you even fail at being an entertaining piece of garbage.\\n\\n\r\nNow all that\u2019s been said so far should tell you how awful this show is, but here I give you the biggest problem I have with this anime: The King. From the start of the anime the one in charge of ordering and killing off students is shrouded in mystery along with his method of action. The way he comes across as this seemingly omniscient and omnipotent villain had unique powers over victims similar to Light Yagami and the Death Note. But I was more concerned with the why. Why would someone or something so powerful and dangerous being dicking around with a class of teenagers, telling them to fuck each other or die a woeful death? What do they wish to gain from this and why do they not aim for something greater? But then King\u2019s Game makes the revelation of the force behind it all, it is perhaps the most idiotic reveal I have seen in an anime. Ever. Anyone else theorizing about what could be behind it all gets figuratively dick-slapped as it makes any work or effort into understanding what this power is and how the students can beat it absolutely worthless! I\u2019m not going to reveal the origins of the King\u2019s Game but trust me when I tell you that it is almost as disrespectful as getting blue-balled by your partner on Christmas Day (bitch). I mentioned before how all the orders felt like they were conceived by a 10-year-old, but after learning about who the King really is I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the original writer had the mental capacity of a 10-year-old. \\n\\n\r\nThe only part of King\u2019s Game that I can really commend it on is the production values, but even that has its fair share of problems. I\u2019m not much of a stickler on the animation of a show, but let\u2019s be real: this show was made in 2017, and it looks like it could have been made over a decade ago. Aside from some backgrounds, there is nothing visually impressive about this show and feels lacklustre for the most part. You just need to see how they animate broken fingers to understand how dull and low budget this project was. But it does have its merits: effective facial expressions convey a lot of emotion and a dark colour palette suited the theme of the show, and I can say that the animation was tolerable. The same goes for the sound, with nothing memorable with regards to OSTs yet nothing godawful. I know a lot of people will praise the show\u2019s opening as the best of the season, but I found it boring after a few episodes, with the main line \u201cTHIS IS THE END THIS IS THE END!!!!\u201d becoming a meme of the show. And honestly Inuyashiki came out the same season with an OP very similar, but about a dozen times better. The voice acting was below par all across the board, with the English dub being even worse. But if I had to choose, I would still pick the dub, because at least that way I won\u2019t have to think about the show as much, giving my head a well-deserved rest after pushing through this.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there you have it. That is King\u2019s Game: The Animation; a disordered, pathetic abomination of an anime I plan to never lay eyes on again. We\u2019re at the end of 2017 and yet shit like this is still being made, but this is nothing new. King\u2019s Game is literally Mayoiga: The Lost Village \u2013 One Year Later, and if you\u2019ve never heard of Mayoiga, just look at its mean score and that will tell you all one needs to know. They were both cringeworthy horror borefests that started off bad and only devolved into something so pathetic that even the biggest advocators of schlock entertainment would find masochistic. At this point, King\u2019s Game is worse than just edgy; it cuts deep and it hurts, before leaving a permanent scar; something to always remind you of how foolish you were to try and handle the King\u2019s Game. You weren\u2019t raped physically, but mentally and emotionally are left desecrated and missing a part of your soul that you\u2019ll never get back. This is the chance one takes when watching any intriguing seasonal anime. Was it worth it?",

            "content": "The King\u2019s Game Anime Review. Anime from the Rabbit Hole\r\nThe King's Game is the worst anime I have ever seen.\r\nAm not kidding. The King's Game is the most terrible piece of shit I ever had sat through\r\nI honestly shocked at the anime director\u2019s ability to blow all expectations of god-awful anime that are popping out from the rabbit hole.\r\nWhen I aware that was I say this is the worst anime I have seen that it comes with the expectations of this somehow being worse than the likes of Big Order, Handshakers, and Eromanga Sensei which before I saw this they were the worst animes Ihave ever seen.\\n\r\nI had no interest in watching this show because I thought it\u2019s one of those shitty novel adaptions that pop up in every anime season. The only reason why I ever decided to watch this show in the first place because a couple of my friends were watching it and they told it\u2019s an another Mayoiga which was one of the best B movie type anime I have ever seen.  It may be a garbage series overall but least it had the so bad its good charm which is the only reason I gave that series a 2/10 only because it had good comedy. However, I cannot say the same thing for King's Game this show is one of the most insulting, embarrassing, unfunny, lazy and inept anime I had ever had the displeasure of witnessing. Am going to end my intro here because this fucking piece of horse shit does not deserve my intro since this show clearly don't even give a fuck about anything so why should I?\\n\\n\r\nFuck my life...\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story of Kings Game follows Nobuaki Kanazawa who transferred to a high school. Due to the events of the last King Game his now afraid of getting intimate with his new classmates. Very soon he starts to open up to his classmates during the sports festival class relay. However, this doesn\u2019t last long as he and his classmates received an email from \"King and from there start to go down.\\n\r\nBefore I kick the show back it the anime rabbit hole. the King\u2019s Game is.\\n\r\nOusama Game or King\u2019s Game in English is a game where a class of 32 people takes part in the survival game. Each student will receive a message from phones about the King order that they have to follow or else they will be punished/killed. Why did I explain this because the King Game is the worst survival game I have seen in fiction. Not only it\u2019s contrived as hell as well being poorly constricted but the game keeps adding new rules that were not told from the first episode of the anime.\\n\r\nBesides the King\u2019s Game itself being a broken mess this show writing is abysmal as well having some of the worst shock value I have seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t help the fact that the show relays heavily on the fucking flashbacks. Flashbacks, in general, are fine as long they have a purpose but Kings Games really got carried away with this. This show likes to random flashback to the previous King\u2019s Game as well dealing with the current King\u2019s Game that is going on in this anime and because of that, the show\u2019s pacing is fucking broken!!! This show has the worst pacing I have ever seen in anime. \\n\r\nWhat\u2019s makes the pacing worse is the narrative. One of the best examples of the show\u2019s fucking horrendous narrative is in episode 5 where the entire episode was a flashback of the events of the last King Game and the episode never goes back to the current King\u2019s Game that is currently happening. It would have been better if the show did this episode 1 would have been dedicated to showing off the new King\u2019s Game was happening then have it where our main character Nobuaki actually tells his experience with the previous kings game to everyone in the class than you have the next 3 to 5 episodes showcase all the events of previous King' Game. I know it will be a flashback but do you know what it makes more sense in the narrative than you could have the last several episodes being dedicated to the actual true story that we are dealing with which is the current kings game instead of every episode in the show where it goes from the flashback of the last King's Game as well showing a little bit of the actual episode itself that isn't a flashback. In short, the narrative of this show is a fucking mess.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you though the pacing and narrative of this show are broken the show decides to butcher serious sensitive topics such as rape/forced sex to the point where it becomes a joke because almost all of the order has something to do with Sex/Rape. \\n\r\nI CANNOT FUCKING STAND IT WHEN ANIME INCLUDE SENSITIVE TOPIC SUCH SEX AND RAPE IN THEY NOVELS!!! I swear the director for this show must be a disgraceful human being who thinks rape and forced sex is normal. \\n\r\nOverall this story is a complete travesty has no redeeming quality whatsoever. \\n\r\n0/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters in The King\u2019s Game are just moving bodies with edgy and cringe-worthy personalities.  The characters have no character development in the slightest, and they are not even likable. Every single character except for 1 which I will get into a bit are idiots. \\n\r\nKanazawa Nobuaki is a horrendous mentally broken down protagonist. \\n\r\nNatsuko is a shitty nice girl type of a character who has a psychopathic side to her \\n\r\nNaoya is your cookie cutter best friend type character.\\n\r\nRia is the only character in this show that I can consider to be kinda decent. Unlike every other human being in this show, she\u2019s the only character that has a decently told back-story that we can relate too.\\n\r\nIt such a shame that she gets killed off after a certain episode in the series.\\n\r\nHowever, Ria alone cannot save this pathetic excuse of a character cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are all utter shit that you don\u2019t ever care for because they all have a brain size of Homer Simpson and they are all dumber than rocks. They are not even worth mention in the slightest.\\n\r\nIn short, the characters in this show are a fucking failure in every way possible.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals\\n\r\nBefore I tear apart the visuals am going to talk anime studio Seven. Before they did this show they have done shows such as I can\u2019t understand what is my husband is saying and Hentai. \\n\r\nWhy did I bring this up? BECAUSE THE VISUALS ARE A FUCKING DISGRACE!!!\\n\r\nBoring background designs, shitty characters designs mixed with pathetic animation, camera directing, still frames and lots of budget cuts that rival episode 4 of Tokyo Ghoul Root A.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s like this show was originally meant to be a Hentai but some dumbass from studio Seven decided to censor most the sexual acts visually and decided to add a plot that is contrived as hell.\\n\r\nAm just going to end the visuals selection here since this show clearly doesn't give fuck about anything. \\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is dull and just plain bad.\\n\r\nThe opening of the show FEED THE FIRE\" by coldrain is a great song and its easily the best thing about the anime then again if the best thing about your anime is an anime opening that can be downloaded to your phone as an mp3 file you know fucked up.\\n\r\nThe ending theme is generic and it not even worth mentioning at all.\\n\r\nAs for sub and dub, they are both mediocre overall and they are not even worth mentioning at all. I honestly feel bad for the Seyiuus and English voice actors who had to follow this garbage script.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts. \\n\r\nThis anime represents everything that is wrong with anime.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an anime that is so bad that it actually piss off the viewer intelligence as well making the shittest animes like Big Order and Eromanga Sensei look decent in comparison. It also fails as B movie type anime because unlike Mayoiga the show not only tries to take itself too seriously and fails but it takes serious/sensitive topics such as sex and rape and butchers them to the point where it all those topics becomes a joke for a narrative. \\n\r\nThe story was utter shit, the pacing was horrendous, the characters are hot garbage, the visuals are bad and the soundtrack was bland and boring.\\n\r\nThis is the worst thing I have ever seen from this anime medium and I don\u2019t think it will ever be topped. It\u2019s such an insult in every way and makes me want to watch things like Eromanga Sensei and Big Order again. As much I despise those shows for its offensive content and horrific characters. I rather take that than watch this broken show again\\n\r\nIs it worse than Skelter Heaven and Mars of Destruction? hell yeah because least those ovas were only 19 minutes long. This piece of contrived rabbit hole shit is 276 minutes long.\\n\r\nStay away from this garbage no matter how much curious you are because it will bring you nothing but misery.\\n\r\nFinal Score.  \\n\r\nAs much I want to this garbage a deserved 0/10 I can\u2019t because MAL doesn\u2019t have a 0/10 opinion. Until MAL has a 0/10 opinion I have sadly give this piece of shit that belongs in the rabbit hole a 1/10\\n",

            "content": "2017 has been an underwhelming year for fanatics of horror and survival based anime. Taking a close look at the lineups, there were barely any at all and the only ones we\u2019ve got were short series that were easily forgettable. Where does Ousama Game position itself on the board? Terrible doesn\u2019t even begin to describe what this anime turned out to be. Ousama Game is a primal example of how desperately an anime tries to get viewers to appreciate. It\u2019s a catastrophe that self-destructed from the very start that the meme of \u201cso bad, it\u2019s good\u201d doesn\u2019t even come to close to describe what itreally is.\\n\\n\r\nI can talk for hours about what went wrong with Ousama Game (King\u2019s Game) but to start, we have to understand what this anime is really about. On the surface, it\u2019s a survival horror show based on the manga of the franchise. The synopsis is very straightforward and highlights the rules of the King\u2019s Game. At the center of it, we have a young man named Nobuaki Kanazawa who gets involved in this death game scenario as his life changes forever. \\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, this anime seems to have some potential. The idea of a death game can be mildly entertaining despite how predictable these type of shows turns out to be. However, Ousama Game turns into a cheap social experiment of horror gimmicks that tried way too hard to look cool. Forget, cool. This show is asinine on so many levels that by the time you watch the first few episodes, you will label it as an unintentional comedy. Despite the show portraying it as a serious story, it\u2019s absurdly stupid in many ways. These are found through the examples of the characters\u2019 decisions, poorly executed plot twists, and over the top exposition that becomes a chore to watch. At first glance, you\u2019d think that exposition is important for a show like this. But overall, it degenerates into a cluster of boring info dump with cheap story selling. What does this show really want to accomplish? I had to ask myself many times throughout the show because every time I finish an episode, it makes me shake my head at how it fails to capitalize on anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast consists of students from Nobuaki\u2019s class. Because this show has a lot of characters, don\u2019t expect any of them to get memorable characterization. The main focus is how Nobuaki tries so desperately to save others but always comes up short that ends in sorrow. Unfortunately, it\u2019s very hard to ever sympathize with character loss in this show because there\u2019s just nothing to feel for them. They are dropped like jobbers in some wrestling drama not because it\u2019s predictable but because they are too blend to appreciate. Once in a while, there are shows that has a breakout character emerge from the blues. Ousama Game has none of them and its entire character cast is terribly written. For main male protagonist Nobuaki, he is far too generic to be any sort of hero. On the opposite side, there\u2019s Natsuko, a manipulate woman who cares about nothing but herself. The show portrays her as a psychopath that no one should trust and to be honest, there\u2019s not a single thing to like about her. It\u2019s as if the show itself is self-aware in making her the most hateful character. If that was its intention, then it got the point across with all the wrong reasons.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will say one thing. Ousama Game\u2019s creator and story seems to really try to bring out the best of what it can work with. It consists of 12 episodes and that\u2019s no easy task. However, the anime is a laughter stock with the genres it tries to capitalize. First, there\u2019s hardly any mystery. Sure, there\u2019s the \u201cKing\u201d and the game itself has some suspense. But at some point, do you really care? Most if not all the cast are going to die anyway so what\u2019s there to get thrilled about? Then, there\u2019s the horror. Does this show really feel scary? If we talk about the death scenes, then that would be unintentionally comical. I can\u2019t fandom how many times I laughed at character deaths. These ranges from jumping out from windows, hands being broken to pieces by overusing a computer mouse, or even heads twisted 180 degrees because why not. Some scenes are also censored (maybe fixed in BDs) that makes shows like Terra Formars look like a masterpiece. The supernatural elements of this anime is also very poorly executed such as the numerous times when the deaths happen. And drama? Oh, I already mentioned Natsuko since she\u2019s the guiltiest of this example. Still, the overall drama is so ill written that characters are locked in a conflict with no interest. Now that I think about it, this anime is really missing a comedy tag because of absurdly amusing it becomes as more and more the \u201cplot\u201d unravels.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Seven\u2019s effort in animating this show really makes me want to question if they even tried at all. This is technically one of their few full length show they\u2019ve produced and yet, it fails in a lot of ways. Character designs looks cheaply made like they are from some B-horror movie. While character expressions at times can deliver psychology, it ultimately falls apart due to its raw quality. The violence also comes off in the wrong way with how dumb it looks. Finally, the fan service is just unbearable. There are sometimes fan service in horror shows that can be a guilty pleasure to watch. However, Ousama\u2019s Game is just a pure disgrace with terribly timed segments and censorship.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, there\u2019s only one aspect of this anime I enjoyed and it\u2019s the music. \u201cFeed the Fire\u201d by coldrain is one of the noticeable theme songs from this year with its rock/metal hybrid style choreography. It\u2019s a shame their talent is wasted for a show like this. On the other hand, character voices are very annoying to listen to after a while. Nobuaki\u2019s desperate screaming when things go wrong is extremely unbearable. Natsuko\u2019s manipulative voice clearly gives a vile intention to make us hate her more. Other cast members are pretty much all forgettable except when you hear them scream to their deaths.\\n\\n\r\nTrying to get to the finish line for this show was a challenge for me. It\u2019s like I was thrown into bugged video game and trying to find a way out. Ousama Game is among one of the worst horror survival shows I\u2019ve seen in recent years. The unintentional humor fails to deliver itself in every way and a slap to the face for anyone that expected something good out of this show. The character cast are like puppets of a poorly made performance. And the story? Just burn it with a fire. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an infamous meme that \u201canime was a mistake\u201d in the community these days.  Just ask Ousama Game and you\u2019ll see why.\\n",

I recommend watching with friends for a good laugh! 8/10\r\nIf you don't get a laugh out of absurdly bad shows, leave now and never look back. Without ironic enjoyment, this show deserves a 4/10\r\nFULL REVIEW:\r\nSTORY: 6/10\r\nA high school class begins receiving text message commands, that if they disobey they die in a most gruesome manner. I'm talking screaming, exploding body parts, and projectile limbs. The story can be confusing at times, but for the most part its veryeasy to follow whats going on. \\n\r\nThe King's orders usually boil down to \"have sex with this person\" or  \"one person has to choose someone to die\". We end up with lots of similar situations but the show does a good job of switching up what reactions the characters have, and the ways in which they die.\\n\r\nThis story could have made a good show if it was executed better, but instead we get this lovely masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nART: 4/10\\n\r\nMediocre for the most part with peaks and valleys, and some truly baffling shots. It is much more ambition than it has the money for, leading to some genuinely hilarious moments. The poor art adds a lot to making this show as funny as it is. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 5/10\\n\r\nThe opening is edgy as hell and definitely sets the mood. Otherwise nothing to complain about or compliment.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5/10\\n\r\nAll of them are bland, with some having slightly more personality than others. But it doesn't bother me much as the fun part is watching them get trashed by the King's game. They serve their purpose but I certainly won't be remembering any of them once done with this show.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nAdding this to my collection of shows I ironically enjoy. I've been watching this show weekly for 6 weeks, and at the end of every episode I'm begging for more. I have laughed out loud for this show more than for some shows that are actually trying to be comedies. Roll with the stupidity and you will have a great time.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\r\nThis show is absolutely ridiculous, and thinks edgy=good. The characters are bland, and the art only serviceable. But by golly, is this show trying its best to be entertaining. Try your shot at it if you're interested, if your sense of humor matches with mine, you will have a great time with this show.",

If you enjoy watching people brutally killed, suffer, break their fingers, forced to have sex, extreme drama and female character with evil/sadistic personality, then this is the right anime for you. \r\nFor me this anime proves that you don't always need those \"well written anime\" to enjoy it.\r\nA lot of haters here are just judging anime based how well written the story and how much plot holes or because some character act stupidly in some situation. Those haters start analyzing the this anime as if it is Shakespeare story book or some kind of scientific journal. I don'ttake anime too seriously. Character in anime does not always have to act the same way that people expect in real life\\n\\n\r\nFor me this show is just a pure enjoyment. It entertaining (for me) to watch fictional people suffer and try hard to survive. It does not matter if the story is weak and poorly written when I'm enjoying it. I'm on episode 11 when I wrote this review, and last few episodes were the best in my opinion so far \\n\\n\r\nMany of those who gave it 1/10 or 2/10 watched it until the last episode which makes me suspect that many of these haters don't genuinely believe that anime deserve such a low score. I mean why watch something that you think deserve such low score until the end ?! If I rate something 1/10 then that thing has to be so boring that I could not watch it at all\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt is also worth to mention that this show is noting like Mayoiga. Mayoiga  is children version of Ousama Game. If you found Mayoiga  boring like me then does not mean Ousama Game is same. Ousama game is real dark/horror show with people slaughtered in every place unlike  Mayoiga",

            "content": "Ousama Game is undoubtedly among the worst pieces of Japanese media that has ever been produced and most definitely the worst anime I\u2019ve had the experience of consuming. I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of people saying that this anime has a good concept and is only hindered by poor directing but the slew of issues with this anime would lead me to believe that either what these people find interesting is the genre itself or they are just plain blind to the plethora of issues plaguing this production. Before you spend four and a half hours of your life watching this abomination for whatever reasonI want to make one thing clear to you, you\u2019re wasting your time.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is complete and utter nonsense. There is no direction at all and it\u2019s filled with more holes than Shia LaBeouf has seen in his entire lifetime. As one thing is explained, three more questions arise, and eventually you\u2019re left wondering if the guy writing this was on crack and a random stream of words just poured out from his brain, without any regard for keeping the thing coherent. To convolute things even more, the story switches from current day to past events without any sort of indication or distinction whatsoever in an attempt to create \u201cparallels\u201d between the current events and the main character's past experiences, and also explain why things are happening a certain way and what might happen in the future. This, of course, only succeeds in making the viewer more confused and have even more questions about what is happening as the scenes don\u2019t have any sort of direction or flow. Finally when an explanation that isn\u2019t a non-answer finally is given (praise the lord), it equates to deus ex machina and is a spit in the face to people who faithfully followed along, waiting for some sort of break or light at the end of the tunnel. Who woulda thunk it?\\n\\n\r\nThe \u201ccharacters\u201d act more as walking plot devices, as their actions make no sense and quite literally serve only to shoehorn the plot further. You won\u2019t encounter an \u201cimportant\u201d character until the plot needs to be advanced, even though they\u2019re all supposed to be classmates and you\u2019re supposed to have seen all of them in the first episode. Instead you are shown a bunch of generic background characters in the beginning and only a few key main ones while rest are thought up on the fly and designed in a way specifically fit to the scenario at hand. The consistency in their interactions are also non-existent. Alliances are formed out of nowhere, and attitudes toward each other change with the drop of a hat. I should also mention that the author self inserted himself into the story, as the protagonist was named after himself and was designed to be a walking pity party and savior, all in one package. Quite a piece of work isn\u2019t he?\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things unsurprisingly things aren\u2019t looking too hot either. Scenes look subpar at best and complete arse at worst. All the budget is spent on random character\u2019s death scenes instead of sequences actually important to the advancement of the already trainwreck plot. A few of the voice actors tried the best they could, but with the script they were given it\u2019s hard to give a good performance, while others were just quite simply not good at all. The music is unoriginal, uninspired, and ripped from an album released last year making the lack or mismanagement of budget glaringly obvious. So overall, not a good look whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nIf it hasn't become apparent by now, there is absolutely no reason to watch this anime. It fails in absolutely every aspect, and doesn\u2019t even make an attempt to fix itself. It actively cancels its own canon, lies to you, and spits in your face when everything's said and done. It\u2019s not self aware, it\u2019s not ironic, and you won\u2019t even get enjoyment from watching it as a meme. If you have any self respect, if you consider yourself to have even average human intelligence, you will stay away from this series.",

The story was executed so poorly, with so many plotholes appearing; it's just unbearable. All we see is just more boring content.\r\nThere are also way too many flashbacks. This anime is based off of the second manga, Ousama Game: Shuukyoku, however, literally splices half of the first manga into it. Theyshould've just made an adaptation of the first manga, and then made a second anime; though I don't think anybody would watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing about this series is the anime opening, which is really disappointing because the opening sets out the series as an amazing horror series, but the anime itself if just a massive disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend that all people avoid this anime.",

            "content": "I never write reviews, but this is the worst anime I have ever seen and I believe that I should warn people not to watch it.\r\nOne of the problems it has is the fact that all of its characters are completely forgettable. I am on the 6th episode and lots of people have died. However, I could only tell you something about 2 or 3 of them. \r\nAnother problem is the fact that a lot of the characters die in the same or the next episode in which they are introduced (or get a bit of focus). This does not only mean that it isvery predictable to tell who will die in this episode, you also do not care about them all that much because you do not know them. What is even worst, they are generally presented as selfish persons that only want to survive without caring about the other people that die. If this was done right, you could be rooting for one or the other character to survive, but the anime is clearly trying to make you root for the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nI could get over that if you did not know if the main characters are going to make it or not. However, most of the story is told in flashbacks, as the main protagonist explains to his new classmates his previous experience in the game. This means that, from the very first episode, you know that the main character is the only one who makes it alive.\\n\\n\r\nAnd those are not even the main problems I have with this anime. I honestly like the premise. However, this anime takes all the problems that could come out of this premise and decides that, as far as they do not show them on screen, they do not exist. For example, how is it possible that after half of their classmates have died the police still has not appeared? I could understand it if none of the players wanted to go and tell the police about the game if it was a rule (which it is not) but I would be really surprised if I was in high school, half of my classmates had died and the police still had not come to talk with me.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the anime does as much as it can to avoid showing other characters than the people playing the game, maybe assuming that we will not realise how stupid it is for the characters to not try and seek for help from other people. The worst case so far is in episode 6, where the main character literally explains (via flashback) to some new classmates how multiple of his old classmates died while sitting next to a taxi driver as he is driving them to the place they want to go. However, the taxi driver does not appear on screen and that is apparently enough for the show to justify why this person does not freak out.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there are many more problems with this anime, such as characters behaving irrationally or suddenly behaving completely opposite to what they did previously, but if I had to analyze them as much as I have for the previous ones this review would end up being an essay. So this is my conclusion: do not watch this anime.",

            "content": "This.. This animation is possibly one of the most horrendous things I've seen in a while. It surprises me to how it's even above a 5 on MAL, considering the disgusting amounts of tropes, and generic development, not to mention the completely mindless protagonist that just doesn't fit in the genre it's marketing. Watching the first couple episodes with friends, I've seen all I needed to decide that this is possibly one of the lowest of the low, during this season; hell, for the past 4-5 seasons. I'll summarize this piece at the bottom, and for those avid and mindful readers; I'll throw in abit more detail.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 4/10\\n\r\nOkay, fair enough; A game that revolves around those slice-of-life anime where the King somehow gets the heroine and protagonist to have an inspirational moment together. Only except; nobody knows who the King actually is, along with the fact that people must do every action. It's all fun and games until somebody dies, right? Only except.. The death's for not fulfilling the orders of the King feels so unjustified. Oh, that generic background character that doesn't listen to the pleads of the protagonist and beats kids up suddenly EXPLODES into a pile of blood. They don't believe any of the reasoning behind the game, but they decide to meet up, y'know, like an atheist suddenly heading to a church to xxxx on the bible or something. To an extent; it's entertaining watching characters obtain superiority over others, where a nobody suddenly becomes the King and tells some guy he hates to literally \"kys,\" but with the 1-episode 0 development deaths, the audience sits there thinking \"Oh, they died.\" Also, actions of each character slowly becomes more predictable after the realization of dying if the duty is not fulfilled, literally following every line of the order to survive. \"Go kiss this girl?\" Oh, I wonder what the person who received that will do? It's like watching a bunch of children trying throw their rocks higher than the other, in attempts to awe the watchers. \"Look at me, I'll go this far to save my life, haha.\" *** This also relates back a couple years to the old \"Blue Whale Game\" trend, where people follow orders from above; inevitably leading the player to kill themselves. Yes, this a real thing.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 6/10\\n\r\nWell, it's not like animation style can be put down simply cause the concept is poor. Most of the scenes are presented own up to what the animator or studio wishes to show off. However, when other categories intercept with this, the value of the art goes down, as its mood and tone it SHOULD display ends up in the gutter. Instead, you laugh as the protagonist desperately tries to stop his classmates from victimizing themselves. haHa, so funny\\n\\n\r\nSound : 3/10\\n\r\nRemember Asta from Black Clover? Screaming every couple seconds? Imagine that with the over-the-top worry and crying in every episode. For me, at least; it gets annoying and reduces the immersion into the story. Simply put; the sound becomes so vanilla that the emotions behind it become stale. Why in gods name does the protagonist cry over literally EVERY SINGLE DEATH (okay, that's exaggerated, but you get the point). Let this become a bridge over to the god-awful character development\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 1/10\\n\r\nAlright, MC is up to the base for batting again, because apparently he had already attended one of these games, which is why he's got that clean new edge to cut his classmates apart, but the details of the previous game don't get revealed until later, you know? NOT IMPORTANT. Somehow, the biggest puxxy from the last King's Game WON IT. You'd think it'd be someone intelligent, and able to manipulate the game to his liking; or maybe someone maniacal, and able to kill and do something completely insane without a heart, or tear. Believe it or not, we have the protagonist that suddenly loves his classmates over the course of like.. A couple weeks, enough to cry over their deaths. The development relies heavily on his past, such as the previous heroine that the MC liked --> Into the trillions of others that he suddenly meets in this new class. Other characters? Just the typical mysterious girl that has some ace up her sleeve, but doesn't care to show it, A bunch of jocks with ogre thinking of \"Me die If I No Follow Order,\" and a collection of pretty flowers that probably have a dirt personality hidden underneath. If this isn't enough to show off the lack of development throughout the first couple episodes; other than the details that should've already been provided from the experienced MC, then Nisekoi must have traveled like a bullet.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 2/10\\n\r\nYou get it; a simple knack of \"Wow, I can't believe he did this.\" and \"What can top that.\" Characters? God awful, I haven't seen any characters that had likable traits. It's simply a sit-and-watch the protagonist cry for another girl, every episode. Heart strings weren't pulled with the first victims, or the MC getting bullied when he tried to slice off relationships with his sharpened edge, they won't be pulled from the generic cast of people. Simply put; enjoyment comes from the event of happily watching students kill themselves off one by one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 1/10\\n\r\nNo.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion :\\n\r\nUnless you're an avid fan of killing games, and had already seen the standard \"Danganronpa\" or \"Mirai Nikki\" and every single other main-stream classroom killings shows, and REALLY don't want to get into reading other gory stuff, since reading is too comprehensive for your massive head, go ahead and watch this. Be sure to unplug your head before doing so, or else all the plot-holes and stupid choices make you regret living, like your parents telling you you're adopted, or a terrible hangover.\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\r\nStory - Interesting foundation, poor execution, wrong cast. 4/10\\n\r\nArt - As good any recent animations can offer. 6/10\\n\r\nSound - ruined by the repetitive screeches of protesters in the ele-- 3/10\\n\r\nCharacter - no development, lackluster subchars, and 0 iq mc -- 1/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - wow, whatever can they do next? 2/10\\n\r\nOverall - One stroke up, Diagonal stroke, another Stroke up, circle. 1/10\\n\r\nConclusion - watch other similar, and decently executed shows, or turn off your brain and enjoy.\\n\\n",

This character is created by creator of manga, to be honest this is the worst and most weird character i have seen on an fictional movie/TV show/anime/book.

There was 2 \"having sex\" orders till now. Naoto could cut off his dick and that tall guy can so. People do surgeries to change their bender, believe me i have people as much as i could do it to not hurt them. 22 years i had more fun than a young man could have. \u0130 can go gay rest of my life, sounds interesting. Also they havent contacted any police officer yet, again a stupid point.\\n\\n\r\nThird: \u0130f you tie a person and give him/her clean fresh air, healthy food that is sure not poisonous, biologicall and logically that person will live as long as you keep doing it, till you find sick king.\\n\\n\r\nArt sucks so bad i would pass this show even if it was a hentai, fyi i love hentais more than any media production.\\n\\n\r\n\u0130 give 4 to sound, JUST FOR COLDRA\u0130N.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, just show is like a try before Danganronpa or the manga that there was a guy who had a twin brother and he was prisoned in cyber world ( i cant remember that mangas name) but this is a tragedy for me i wont be watching anime for a while because it was sooooo bad, like i wanna rate it lower than 0, my apologies to Scum's Wish and other shows that i rated 1-2 or 3.",

However if you came here expecting to find some answers to this thing's \"story\", you're in tough luck. You aren't getting them.

In this anime if you fail to complete an order you die. This would work if the writing wasn't complete garbage. First, we have two games going on at one time. Well, a past game and the current one. So we have double dose of rape and betrayal. Once again this sounds like a good show although it isn't. They try to make us care about characters in a span of episode oftop of everyone being dumbasses that don't know what loopholes are or characters that are selfish for not even their own survival. There is also a bunch of pointless dialogue because people struggle to do even the simplest of orders. And etc and etc. \\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't amazing either but not bad. It isn't downright terrible animation I mean I've seen worse but it isn't something you would watch this show for. Some of the characters just look disgusting anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe music can be rather cliche and boring for this genre but the voice actors feel like their talents are being wasted here with these garbage characters and lines. It doesn't help or they try to make every scene as dramatic as possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are this show's real drawback. The main character has won this game before yet still struggles to figure things out in the current one. He forces people to do things he wouldn't do himself and makes empty promises but so does everyone in this show. No of the characters so far are redeeming anyway since no one has a centralized character. They all change to what the plot needs them to be in that moment. \\n\\n\r\nI had high hopes for this show going in because it had some hype to it. the source is supposed to be better popular in Japan but so was other shows this season but those are trash also. Going from episode to episode hurts do to the terrible writing and tone changes. I don't know why anyone would watch this unironically.",

            "content": "\u201cThis show is fucking awful.\u201d\r\n-Me\r\nThe rules of the King\u2019s Game are as follows:\r\n1. All female characters must be appallingly sexualized, this is a MATURE show for ADULTS after all.\r\n2. Every death has to be over-the-top and ridiculous, people like comedy relief, right?\r\n3. Characters must never exercise common sense, how else would there be a conflict?\r\n4. The plot must be as nonsensical as possible. We can just tell people it\u2019s a \u201cmystery.\u201d\r\nOusama Game is revolting. \r\nIt\u2019s not bad in a, \"Wow this show has so much mindless violence,\" sort of way. \r\nIt's more like \"Wow some perverted sicko was literally paid to animate their disgusting fetishes\u201d.\r\nI'mnot only repulsed by Ousama game because of the sexualization. I'm repulsed by it because of how confidently it uses the horror genre as an excuse to create appalling sexualization. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10\\n\r\nThe story goes in circles; introducing a few characters that you have no reason to care about, killing them violently for very stupid reasons, then repeating the cycle in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nA group of students of some random class receive text messages from a person who calls themselves \u201cking\u201d aka Ousama, they say the students are part of a game and if they don't obey the rules they are punished. Seems interesting enough, right? And it kind of is at first until you realize every episode has the same structure; a bunch of random students are introduced, they receive a nearly impossible order from the king via their phones, they obviously fail to survive it and die in a horrific way. At least the deaths are pretty absurd at first, not that they make any sense. So much blood, so little logic. There was even a character who gets punished by being burnt to death and she just stands around for a whole minute entirely engulfed in flames and out of all things that she can do, she chooses to strips down. Yep. She literally is being burnt alive and the writer thought that was the perfect time to sexualize her. Humanity is doomed and Ousama Game will be the catalyst for the apocalypse.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters often make the same frustrating choices over and over thanks to the poorly told story, the main character Nobuaki tells the story of the first Ousama Game he was in while being in a new game in present day. We constantly see the characters make the same mistakes thanks to this broken form of storytelling. It\u2019s obvious that studio Seven didn\u2019t have enough material from the first manga so to compensate they adapted the sequel story as well, but in the end, layering them on top of each other caused both to be incredibly underdeveloped. There is no consideration put into the pacing of the story, events are just contrived into existence and we\u2019re just supposed to believe it. The only thing that keeps the show semi-comprehensive is the formulaic story; there is a group of random students and per expectations of the death game genre they will all be killed until there\u2019s a winner. At least Ousama Game has a formula making it not entirely incompetent, but that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s original. It more than likely grabbed these concepts from better anime to cobble together it\u2019s story without caring how the final product would turn out. \\n\\n\r\nI like the story concept of everyday people trying to fight against a personified Deus Ex Machina antagonist, but this idea is used, abused, then thrown into a dumpster and lit on fire. The King is never explored as an antagonist, it's just an excuse for mindless violence. It throws so many ideas at the wall but nothing sticks; it takes the cell phone gimmick from Mirai Nikki, it takes the fear of the unknown from Another, and the abundance of gore from both, but it does nothing with them. For all the flaws those shows have, at least they know how to build up enough tension for gore to not be totally undeserved. Ousama Game just throws shit at you and screams at you in an attempt to be taken seriously. How ironic that the director of Mirai Nikki worked on the much better death game show this season, Juuni Taisen.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is so obsessed with its own edginess that it\u2019s almost laughable. We\u2019re constantly reminded how evil humans are when put into a complex situation like the king\u2019s game. For example, a character who has yet to be even been given a name might beat up another character by order of the king and say something stupid along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s kill or be killed!!\u201d Sure you could argue a scene like that would establish the tone and put forth a theme, but when the characters are so unbelievable it\u2019s impossible to seriously analyze the morally reprehensible decisions they make.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 0/10\\n\r\nYep, 0%. \\n\r\nThe characters make the show ridiculous and impossible to take seriously. If they just didn\u2019t exist the show would be 10 times better. Everything they do is stupid. They get themselves into terrible situations and endanger their lives and the lives of their classmates constantly, but as you start to realize there is no hope for any of their survival you will find that their stupidity makes the show a comedic. They yell at each other and get nothing done. Constantly they deny that the King's Game is real, even though many of their classmates have already been killed; they just remark \"it must be a coincidence!\" and I chuckle every time I see that line.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character Nobuaki is an asshole. He\u2019s built up to be some kind of hero; characters constantly talk about him like he\u2019s a saint who\u2019s helped them through the game, yet we only ever see him treat them like crap. He treats other characters, but mostly women, horribly. He smacks them, he lies to a blind girl after causing their blindness, he forces them to do degrading things, and yet after all of the awful things he does to them they still sing his praises. These glaring issues start to make sense once you look at the staff page for this show. You will see that the \u201cOriginal Creator\u201d is named Nobuaki Kanazawa. The same as the main character. Yeah... the creator of this shit-fire placed himself into Ousama Game because it is HIS fantasy. At least it explains why all of the characters lose all sense of logic to praise him, but it's still really fucking sad that someone like that exists.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t just broken character writing, it is harmful to the viewers who will no doubt take it literally and believe that it\u2019s ok to treat women as horribly as Nobuaki does. (Yes there are people whose minds are molded by what they watch on television. Believe me, I\u2019ve met them.) \\n\\n\r\nThe one character I could point out as the antagonist is Natsuko, even if the Ousama could be counted they never make an appearance if we're to assume they exist at all. What's so frustrating about her is that, she is very clearly insane, she kills, manipulates, and swaps into her psychotic persona on the drop of a hat, yet none of the students think to say \u201cOh, maybe we shouldn\u2019t trust that crazy girl because she probably wants to kill us so she can ensure her victory!\u201d Never is this issue resolved. Characters are constantly tricked throughout the show and it gets to a laughably predictable point. You know that the unsuspecting random student introduced just minutes ago with less than 2 lines of dialogue will be killed by the end of the episode without any development whatsoever, so why even care about them? It's clear that no one involved in Osama Game cared at all about creating characters, they just wanted to create big breasted anime ladies to sexualize, which isn\u2019t surprising considering the studio that produced it mainly makes hentai.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 1/10\\n\r\nFlat and ugly visuals plague the show all around. The only scenes that seem to have been made with serious effort are the sex scenes, which is unsurprising considering the studio that produced it makes primarily hentai. Misshapen character designs make the show even worse to look at because the majority of scenes are them standing around talking (or yelling). Backgrounds range from mostly the school, character's homes, hospitals sometimes, but none of them are even a little nice to look at. The art becomes incredibly bad in the later episodes. Characters look laughably off model constantly. Blood looks like thick globs of ketchup which only makes the show seem more like a comedy. All you people out there who watch crappy shows ironically will find something worth laughing at in this show\u2019s visuals.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t expect the edginess to make up for the show's issues because the atmosphere is crap too. Horror anime like Another, Shiki, and Higurashi showed us that it\u2019s possible to make a horror anime with a thick atmosphere to immerse the viewers. But on top of the terrible visuals, the idiotic characters, poor direction, and hilariously bad script make it impossible to get immersed in. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\r\nThe music and sound effects aren\u2019t good, but sometimes they work to comedic effect. Sound effects like the ringing of the phones when the characters receive a message from the king are timed to be jump scares or spook the viewer, but they add significant humor to scenes due to very predictable outcomes. The soundtrack is very mediocre and it reminds me of the type of music from old campy horror flicks, I like that style but it doesn\u2019t fit with the mature tone that they were aiming for. Extra camp is always a welcomed addition to a pile of crap like this. You can never have enough unintentional comedy when it comes to Ousama Game!\\n\\n\r\nAs if the show didn\u2019t have enough edge already, the OP is emo/metalcore. And it really is not the good type, just loud and obnoxious. You\u2019d do well to skip over the OP (and the whole show tbh). \\n\r\nThe ED song \"Lost Paradise\" is pretty edgy too but it\u2019s not harsh on the ears, it should have been used as the op in my opinion. It's no surprise the performer of the song Pile is mostly known for her work on the idol series Love Live because she's quite talented (talent that King's Game didn't deserve). There\u2019s a dub too. God bless the writers at Funimation for taking on this heap of garbage because the translated script is hilariously bad. The voice acting is expectedly amateurish. It\u2019s not much better than the sub.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t get a little bit of enjoyment from Ousama Game. Not once did I feel close to being afraid while watching it, but I laughed many of times. Actually, there was one time I technically was afraid of the show. At the very end of episode 12, there is the most fear-inspiring line in the entire show. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cTo Be Continued\u201d\\n\\n\r\nImagining there might be a sequel to this dumpster fire chills me to my core. \\n\\n\r\nOusama Game is only semi-watchable when it\u2019s showing off a slew of ridiculous deaths with really poor art quality because at least you can laugh at it. If that doesn\u2019t sound like something you could enjoy then you\u2019ll likely get nothing out of the show. Even if you intend to watch it for the overdone violence you\u2019ll probably be disappointed because by the final few episodes it becomes toned down and more execution styles are reused. It can\u2019t even do mindless violence right... Keep in mind though, the show never fully embraces the absurdity of its plot so the comedy doesn\u2019t reach its full potential.\\n\r\nThe repulsive sexualization also prevents the comedy from being consistent. Whenever I thought it might get funny I was bombarded with unsettling fanservice that made my skin crawl, defusing any potential comedy.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s almost always obvious when a character is about to die because they get a last minute line to characterize them and (attempt to) make you feel sad for them. Needless to say, this cheap trick never worked. Not once. The deaths are never impactful in any way. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 1/10\\n\r\nOusama game is broken, it is missing features that are necessary to tell a story. There\u2019s no pacing, the director cares more about shooting the female characters in risque ways than actually telling a story, the actual story makes no sense and falls apart as soon as you think about it. \\n\r\nFrustrating doesn't even begin to describe how I felt about the characters. They are stupid and will always be stupid, so don't go into it expecting a horror. I recommend only watching it as a comedy (if you really must watch it). I hate Ousama Game. If I could obliterate it from existence I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do so. Nobuaki too, he's up there with the worst protagonists I've ever seen in an anime.",

I usually abstain from writing reviews, even more so for incomplete anime, but I thought I should warn any person who might be in false hopes that this anime could be good because it has Miyano Mamoru\u2019s name attached, just like my naive past self.\r\nThis anime is basically about a classroom that starts receiving orders from a self-proclaimed King via texts. If they don\u2019t obey these orders then the King punishes them, usually with death.If this sounds semi-interesting to you, then prepare yourself for disappointment because this horror premise is basically an excuse for the author to write copious amounts of nonsensical, perverted situations. The orders are basically Fuck or Die with a heavy dose of NTR. There is nothing the King would gain from sending these orders other than to masturbate at the students\u2019 desperation and consensual cuckoldry.\\n\\n\r\nWith this premise, I thought I would feel sorry for the characters. However even disregarding their incredibly bland and archetypal characterization, they always do unreasonable stuff that results in their deaths. If that's 50% of the case, then the other half is them being surprised at things that should be a given at any point. No sign of intelligence or reason here.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly I would give this 1 but it has made me chuckle a few times: it really tries to take itself seriously but it\u2019s so forcibly edgy that it's unintentionally hilarious.

            "content": "Okay, I had to make an account just to write a review for this. The other reviews I read seemed to miss the mark, and in my opinion come from pretty naive point of views. \r\nTo me the worst part of this show is the animation and the sound, but it certainly isn't as bad as what haoliners has given us. I find it to be pretty tolerable, and considering animators in Japan are known to be severely under paid, I can certainly forgive it and proceed forward into what other qualities the anime has to offer. But if this is critical to your enjoyment,I would keep this in mind before starting it.\\n\\n\r\nOkay so now that I've cleared the air of that, I want to get to what I think this anime offers that I haven't really seen mentioned. I believe in another review I read that this was some sort of sick display of a perverted mind, which made me believe that this is the type of anime that will heavily divide its audiences enjoyment based on your world views and if you prefer anime primarily for its escapism or if you enjoy it because you like to see real life elements integrated and practiced out in a fictional world. I am of the latter of the two which may be why I enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has so far absolutely thrown some heavy situations on you within a short amount of time. So far we've dealt with making self sacrificial decisions for the better of someone you love, betrayal, difficult decisions made out of self preservation, false persona's shattered under tension, terrible life tragedies, and getting to watch a relatable protaganist desperately try to keep things together as it all falls apart in his hands. \\n\\n\r\nObviously we don't have to deal with a mysterious omnipotent power commanding us to our deaths in reality, but we absolutely do have to deal with issues like sexual abuse, infidelity, loss, betrayal, true faces being shown under pressure, and other various situations this show has put on display for us. Personally, I enjoy watching the main character scramble as he tries to keep face in light of all these horrific challenges, because I find that to be absolutely relatable, and it makes me that much more interested in seeing what route they will take for the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThis show does an excellent job at keeping things on edge, as the viewer learns quickly that the characters lives can be quite short lived. This is both a strength and weakness this element of the story brings. On one hand it makes you value the characters lives when you become attached to certain ones, but in the same breath it doesn't really invest much into why you should be attached to them in the first place. But with that being said, I found myself getting strong feels when characters I hardly knew put on display of genuine relatable emotion, which i don't really see as a easy feat to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nIf your like me and you've been watching anime for 15+ years, you might find this to be a refreshing breath of air. It surely isn't the most original anime, but it definitely isn't the typical, overly done recurring themes we've seen in the industry lately.\\n\\n\r\nWhen recommending this to others I would give this anime a 7,  all though personally the number based off of my own enjoyment would be worthy of an 8. It's nothing profound or game changing, its just a good story to observe. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone without a backbone that isn't looking to have challenging feelings thrown at them, since this is certainly one for a more mature audience with a taste for darker themes.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point in time only 5 episodes of the series are out, so this series may very well crash and burn depending on the route they take, but i definitely recommend others to join this journey as of right now.\\n\\n\\n\r\n**UPDATE** Just finished the series. All hopes I had were crushed. This took an absolute turn for the worst. Smh I just can't even believe how bad it got towards the end.  It had potential, but it was completely wasted.",

            "content": "Survival anime are nothing new when looking back over the last few years. Shows such as Btooom!, Danganropa and Mirai Nikki are all based around a particular survival game and have all found moderate to massive popularity among anime fans. Even outside of anime, you just have to look at franchises like The Hunger Games and Maze Runner to see how successful the subgenre is. It\u2019s clear that stories based around a group of characters, their impending doom and how they try to survive such are intriguing to a lot of people. But why is that? Personally, I believe these kinds of premises can presenta darker look at morality; show a darker side to ourselves through characters put in a severe set of circumstances that test one\u2019s beliefs, values, friendships. It\u2019s surprising how a simple concept can turn into a thrilling experience hard to match anywhere else. But this is where I have a problem with most survival anime; they begin with a simplistic setup and never get deeper. Things like character development and thematic exploration are barely touched on in these shows, with more time used for cheap thrills, cringe-worthy horror and overall mindless entertainment. This is an anime that manages to fail at even these aspects.\\n\\n\r\nKing\u2019s Game: The Animation is an anime adaptation of a series of \u201ccell phone novels\u201d and is the most recent example of an anime to present us with a survival game that pits everyone against one another until there is one left standing. Considering what I could take from the poorly-designed cover art to the production studio behind it: Seven, who also made a couple Slice of Life comedies I\u2019ve barely heard of and a ton of hentai, I didn\u2019t have much in the way of expectations that this show would be anything good, but I was hopeful that it would at least be a fun watch. That was a mistake. King\u2019s Game follows Nobuaki Kanazawa, the winner of the previous \u201cKing\u2019s Game\u201d as he transfers to a new school in an attempt to escape his terrible past. Unfortunately, the game follows him and now his new class are all subjected to the survival game that Nobuaki is all too familiar with. The basic rules of the game are: obey any order sent by the King within 24 hours, failure to do so will result in punishment/death and everyone involved must play to the end. Now, with all the basic information out of the way, here is how King\u2019s Game: The Animation manages to turn a rather generic concept into one of the biggest fuckups of the entire year.\\n\\n\r\nThe first major problem with this anime is how it introduces the game, more specifically the \u201corders\u201d from the King that everyone must obey. The first order involves Nobuaki and classmate Natsuko Honda having to kiss, otherwise they\u2019ll be \u201cpunished\u201d. The first order is extremely childish considering this is supposed to be a game where people\u2019s lives are on the line. Show like this need to have some high stakes and consequences to match how serious the game is, also adding suspense and excitement to what characters will do, even if they\u2019re predictable. In the first episode, any sense of initial weight here is lost once you see how all of the orders feel like they were made by a 10-year-old. And if you thought ordering people to kiss was already a dumb move, prepare yourself, because most of the orders shown throughout the show are forcing students to have sex with each other. Let me ask, how is one supposed to take a death game seriously at all when a majority of it is about groping breasts and coerced sex? It\u2019s absurd and should not be taken seriously. Other dumb orders include not sleeping before you have obeyed an instruction and not doing anything unnecessary for 24 hours. If you didn\u2019t understand the last order, don\u2019t worry, the entire game isn\u2019t worth the time and even the minimal effort required to understand. This is clearly a case of a simple concept turned ridiculous due to how serious the show tries to take it. But what\u2019s even more ridiculous is the characters involved in the game.\\n\\n\r\nKing\u2019s Game deals with a class of 32 students, not including characters from Nobuaki\u2019s past and none of them are developed to where you are supposed to about them except for the protagonist, and even then he comes off so bland and uninteresting that I\u2019m sure a lot of people watching won\u2019t care about him or the show a couple weeks after finishing said show. In fact, it probably would\u2019ve been better to have killed Nobuaki off midway so it wouldn\u2019t have been so predictably boring. But I digress. Most of the characters are just expendable and are made as victims of the punishments in a poor attempt to justify the gravity of their predicament. Literally about a dozen characters with no prior screen time die on the first day because they were sleeping, and viewers are expected to care? You don\u2019t create sympathy from your audience by killing off characters in such a way with their only key feature being that they exist! That\u2019s one of the most obvious examples of lazy writing in anime. But the poor writing doesn\u2019t stop there, since most of the characters that do get screen time are completely one-dimensional, have no interesting traits and can be easily replaced with any of the nameless character that got killed off first. It\u2019s one thing to say in an anime like this you only know a little about 2-3 characters after the first episode, it\u2019s a whole other issue when half-way through watching, you still only now about a couple of characters when over half of the class is already dead. Not good King\u2019s Game, not good.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not all, because it just so happens that basically every single character in the show is a retard to the point where even if these characters were developed at all, it would still be difficult to feel anything when these characters die because of their own stupidity. The most blatant example of how autistic they can get is when Natsuko is ordered to have sex with a guy, asks to have sex with Nobuaki first, and then when denied does a whole 180 personality-wise, grabbing the initial dude and tries to do the act in front of all her other classmates. They try to play it off saying she was always psychotic and only acted nice, but considering how she was nice to everyone around her and even showed interest in Nobuaki before the game, I see this . But this is just small example compared to the dozens of time where characters show their complete ignorance to what is even happening around them. These characters are still kids, but the idea that most of them are unable to think for themselves what other players are doing in a game of life or death is bewildering to say the least. It\u2019s like they have selective memory loss where they all just forget what happened 2 minutes before when a character was acting like a lunatic. Even just thinking about how the show would work in our world brings forth a whole new set of questions that the show never ever acknowledges because it knows just how full of bullshit it really is. For example, if so many students in the same class have died in such a short amount of time, wouldn\u2019t there be police involved? Wouldn\u2019t any of the students try and tell someone who isn\u2019t a part of the game about what\u2019s happening? Oh wait, I forgot. This anime doesn\u2019t bother showing characters that are not part of the game. The way that King\u2019s Game avoids showing any sort of outside influence that would have an impact on the game is enough to tell me that this is nothing more that mindless entertainment at a very low standard.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big issue with King\u2019s Game is how it tells its story. The story overall is not difficult to tell but it tries to combine both the present game with flashbacks of the previous game Nobuaki was a part of before transferring and it ends up being detrimental to the show. The flashbacks shown usually take up most of the episode and makes it a lot more difficult for most present-day characters to get any proper focus or development before they are killed off. The characters in these flashbacks can also easily be confused with characters in the present due to how similar all of their designs are, making it harder to differentiate between the two timelines at times. The transitions between the two timelines does not help to distinguish when a time-jump has occurred. I understand that this anime is trying to adapt 2 different instalments to the franchise, but it ends up being so unnecessary as all that was needed to show was few scenes with Nobuaki and his former classmates rather than encompass more than 1 story in 12 episodes. The outcome of the past game is already given as Nobuaki says himself that he was the only survivor. And the saddest part, most of the characters in the flashback are more developed that characters in the current and try to find out what the King\u2019s Game really is, when it really should be the other way around as the flashbacks stop at episode 7, leaving us to deal with shit characters play out this shit storyline for the rest of this shit anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the punishments and actual deaths in this anime, I am once again disappointed. Not only because of how cheap so many of these deaths feel, but of how these death are nearly always shameless gore fests, yet not so over-the-top that they end up being hilarious. King\u2019s Game is actually very similar to Another, a 2012 horror anime that also featured a cast of school students and had most of them dying in some of the most exaggerated ways possible that it almost turned the show into a comedy. Seriously, watch a couple of the deaths in Another, on their own they are way better than the actual show. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the deaths shown here in King\u2019s Game were inspired by Another, but even then, King\u2019s Game fails to do that right. It has around the same amount of death and bloodshed as Another, but was never amusing, and while part of that is due to stupid actions by the characters, the execution of these deaths are also just anticlimactic. I never thought I would ever say that seeing a character literally explode in a pile of blood was boring, but alas here we are. Well done King\u2019s Game, you even fail at being an entertaining piece of garbage.\\n\\n\r\nNow all that\u2019s been said so far should tell you how awful this show is, but here I give you the biggest problem I have with this anime: The King. From the start of the anime the one in charge of ordering and killing off students is shrouded in mystery along with his method of action. The way he comes across as this seemingly omniscient and omnipotent villain had unique powers over victims similar to Light Yagami and the Death Note. But I was more concerned with the why. Why would someone or something so powerful and dangerous being dicking around with a class of teenagers, telling them to fuck each other or die a woeful death? What do they wish to gain from this and why do they not aim for something greater? But then King\u2019s Game makes the revelation of the force behind it all, it is perhaps the most idiotic reveal I have seen in an anime. Ever. Anyone else theorizing about what could be behind it all gets figuratively dick-slapped as it makes any work or effort into understanding what this power is and how the students can beat it absolutely worthless! I\u2019m not going to reveal the origins of the King\u2019s Game but trust me when I tell you that it is almost as disrespectful as getting blue-balled by your partner on Christmas Day (bitch). I mentioned before how all the orders felt like they were conceived by a 10-year-old, but after learning about who the King really is I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the original writer had the mental capacity of a 10-year-old. \\n\\n\r\nThe only part of King\u2019s Game that I can really commend it on is the production values, but even that has its fair share of problems. I\u2019m not much of a stickler on the animation of a show, but let\u2019s be real: this show was made in 2017, and it looks like it could have been made over a decade ago. Aside from some backgrounds, there is nothing visually impressive about this show and feels lacklustre for the most part. You just need to see how they animate broken fingers to understand how dull and low budget this project was. But it does have its merits: effective facial expressions convey a lot of emotion and a dark colour palette suited the theme of the show, and I can say that the animation was tolerable. The same goes for the sound, with nothing memorable with regards to OSTs yet nothing godawful. I know a lot of people will praise the show\u2019s opening as the best of the season, but I found it boring after a few episodes, with the main line \u201cTHIS IS THE END THIS IS THE END!!!!\u201d becoming a meme of the show. And honestly Inuyashiki came out the same season with an OP very similar, but about a dozen times better. The voice acting was below par all across the board, with the English dub being even worse. But if I had to choose, I would still pick the dub, because at least that way I won\u2019t have to think about the show as much, giving my head a well-deserved rest after pushing through this.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there you have it. That is King\u2019s Game: The Animation; a disordered, pathetic abomination of an anime I plan to never lay eyes on again. We\u2019re at the end of 2017 and yet shit like this is still being made, but this is nothing new. King\u2019s Game is literally Mayoiga: The Lost Village \u2013 One Year Later, and if you\u2019ve never heard of Mayoiga, just look at its mean score and that will tell you all one needs to know. They were both cringeworthy horror borefests that started off bad and only devolved into something so pathetic that even the biggest advocators of schlock entertainment would find masochistic. At this point, King\u2019s Game is worse than just edgy; it cuts deep and it hurts, before leaving a permanent scar; something to always remind you of how foolish you were to try and handle the King\u2019s Game. You weren\u2019t raped physically, but mentally and emotionally are left desecrated and missing a part of your soul that you\u2019ll never get back. This is the chance one takes when watching any intriguing seasonal anime. Was it worth it?",

            "content": "The King\u2019s Game Anime Review. Anime from the Rabbit Hole\r\nThe King's Game is the worst anime I have ever seen.\r\nAm not kidding. The King's Game is the most terrible piece of shit I ever had sat through\r\nI honestly shocked at the anime director\u2019s ability to blow all expectations of god-awful anime that are popping out from the rabbit hole.\r\nWhen I aware that was I say this is the worst anime I have seen that it comes with the expectations of this somehow being worse than the likes of Big Order, Handshakers, and Eromanga Sensei which before I saw this they were the worst animes Ihave ever seen.\\n\r\nI had no interest in watching this show because I thought it\u2019s one of those shitty novel adaptions that pop up in every anime season. The only reason why I ever decided to watch this show in the first place because a couple of my friends were watching it and they told it\u2019s an another Mayoiga which was one of the best B movie type anime I have ever seen.  It may be a garbage series overall but least it had the so bad its good charm which is the only reason I gave that series a 2/10 only because it had good comedy. However, I cannot say the same thing for King's Game this show is one of the most insulting, embarrassing, unfunny, lazy and inept anime I had ever had the displeasure of witnessing. Am going to end my intro here because this fucking piece of horse shit does not deserve my intro since this show clearly don't even give a fuck about anything so why should I?\\n\\n\r\nFuck my life...\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story of Kings Game follows Nobuaki Kanazawa who transferred to a high school. Due to the events of the last King Game his now afraid of getting intimate with his new classmates. Very soon he starts to open up to his classmates during the sports festival class relay. However, this doesn\u2019t last long as he and his classmates received an email from \"King and from there start to go down.\\n\r\nBefore I kick the show back it the anime rabbit hole. the King\u2019s Game is.\\n\r\nOusama Game or King\u2019s Game in English is a game where a class of 32 people takes part in the survival game. Each student will receive a message from phones about the King order that they have to follow or else they will be punished/killed. Why did I explain this because the King Game is the worst survival game I have seen in fiction. Not only it\u2019s contrived as hell as well being poorly constricted but the game keeps adding new rules that were not told from the first episode of the anime.\\n\r\nBesides the King\u2019s Game itself being a broken mess this show writing is abysmal as well having some of the worst shock value I have seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t help the fact that the show relays heavily on the fucking flashbacks. Flashbacks, in general, are fine as long they have a purpose but Kings Games really got carried away with this. This show likes to random flashback to the previous King\u2019s Game as well dealing with the current King\u2019s Game that is going on in this anime and because of that, the show\u2019s pacing is fucking broken!!! This show has the worst pacing I have ever seen in anime. \\n\r\nWhat\u2019s makes the pacing worse is the narrative. One of the best examples of the show\u2019s fucking horrendous narrative is in episode 5 where the entire episode was a flashback of the events of the last King Game and the episode never goes back to the current King\u2019s Game that is currently happening. It would have been better if the show did this episode 1 would have been dedicated to showing off the new King\u2019s Game was happening then have it where our main character Nobuaki actually tells his experience with the previous kings game to everyone in the class than you have the next 3 to 5 episodes showcase all the events of previous King' Game. I know it will be a flashback but do you know what it makes more sense in the narrative than you could have the last several episodes being dedicated to the actual true story that we are dealing with which is the current kings game instead of every episode in the show where it goes from the flashback of the last King's Game as well showing a little bit of the actual episode itself that isn't a flashback. In short, the narrative of this show is a fucking mess.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you though the pacing and narrative of this show are broken the show decides to butcher serious sensitive topics such as rape/forced sex to the point where it becomes a joke because almost all of the order has something to do with Sex/Rape. \\n\r\nI CANNOT FUCKING STAND IT WHEN ANIME INCLUDE SENSITIVE TOPIC SUCH SEX AND RAPE IN THEY NOVELS!!! I swear the director for this show must be a disgraceful human being who thinks rape and forced sex is normal. \\n\r\nOverall this story is a complete travesty has no redeeming quality whatsoever. \\n\r\n0/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters in The King\u2019s Game are just moving bodies with edgy and cringe-worthy personalities.  The characters have no character development in the slightest, and they are not even likable. Every single character except for 1 which I will get into a bit are idiots. \\n\r\nKanazawa Nobuaki is a horrendous mentally broken down protagonist. \\n\r\nNatsuko is a shitty nice girl type of a character who has a psychopathic side to her \\n\r\nNaoya is your cookie cutter best friend type character.\\n\r\nRia is the only character in this show that I can consider to be kinda decent. Unlike every other human being in this show, she\u2019s the only character that has a decently told back-story that we can relate too.\\n\r\nIt such a shame that she gets killed off after a certain episode in the series.\\n\r\nHowever, Ria alone cannot save this pathetic excuse of a character cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are all utter shit that you don\u2019t ever care for because they all have a brain size of Homer Simpson and they are all dumber than rocks. They are not even worth mention in the slightest.\\n\r\nIn short, the characters in this show are a fucking failure in every way possible.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals\\n\r\nBefore I tear apart the visuals am going to talk anime studio Seven. Before they did this show they have done shows such as I can\u2019t understand what is my husband is saying and Hentai. \\n\r\nWhy did I bring this up? BECAUSE THE VISUALS ARE A FUCKING DISGRACE!!!\\n\r\nBoring background designs, shitty characters designs mixed with pathetic animation, camera directing, still frames and lots of budget cuts that rival episode 4 of Tokyo Ghoul Root A.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s like this show was originally meant to be a Hentai but some dumbass from studio Seven decided to censor most the sexual acts visually and decided to add a plot that is contrived as hell.\\n\r\nAm just going to end the visuals selection here since this show clearly doesn't give fuck about anything. \\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is dull and just plain bad.\\n\r\nThe opening of the show FEED THE FIRE\" by coldrain is a great song and its easily the best thing about the anime then again if the best thing about your anime is an anime opening that can be downloaded to your phone as an mp3 file you know fucked up.\\n\r\nThe ending theme is generic and it not even worth mentioning at all.\\n\r\nAs for sub and dub, they are both mediocre overall and they are not even worth mentioning at all. I honestly feel bad for the Seyiuus and English voice actors who had to follow this garbage script.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts. \\n\r\nThis anime represents everything that is wrong with anime.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an anime that is so bad that it actually piss off the viewer intelligence as well making the shittest animes like Big Order and Eromanga Sensei look decent in comparison. It also fails as B movie type anime because unlike Mayoiga the show not only tries to take itself too seriously and fails but it takes serious/sensitive topics such as sex and rape and butchers them to the point where it all those topics becomes a joke for a narrative. \\n\r\nThe story was utter shit, the pacing was horrendous, the characters are hot garbage, the visuals are bad and the soundtrack was bland and boring.\\n\r\nThis is the worst thing I have ever seen from this anime medium and I don\u2019t think it will ever be topped. It\u2019s such an insult in every way and makes me want to watch things like Eromanga Sensei and Big Order again. As much I despise those shows for its offensive content and horrific characters. I rather take that than watch this broken show again\\n\r\nIs it worse than Skelter Heaven and Mars of Destruction? hell yeah because least those ovas were only 19 minutes long. This piece of contrived rabbit hole shit is 276 minutes long.\\n\r\nStay away from this garbage no matter how much curious you are because it will bring you nothing but misery.\\n\r\nFinal Score.  \\n\r\nAs much I want to this garbage a deserved 0/10 I can\u2019t because MAL doesn\u2019t have a 0/10 opinion. Until MAL has a 0/10 opinion I have sadly give this piece of shit that belongs in the rabbit hole a 1/10\\n",

            "content": "2017 has been an underwhelming year for fanatics of horror and survival based anime. Taking a close look at the lineups, there were barely any at all and the only ones we\u2019ve got were short series that were easily forgettable. Where does Ousama Game position itself on the board? Terrible doesn\u2019t even begin to describe what this anime turned out to be. Ousama Game is a primal example of how desperately an anime tries to get viewers to appreciate. It\u2019s a catastrophe that self-destructed from the very start that the meme of \u201cso bad, it\u2019s good\u201d doesn\u2019t even come to close to describe what itreally is.\\n\\n\r\nI can talk for hours about what went wrong with Ousama Game (King\u2019s Game) but to start, we have to understand what this anime is really about. On the surface, it\u2019s a survival horror show based on the manga of the franchise. The synopsis is very straightforward and highlights the rules of the King\u2019s Game. At the center of it, we have a young man named Nobuaki Kanazawa who gets involved in this death game scenario as his life changes forever. \\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, this anime seems to have some potential. The idea of a death game can be mildly entertaining despite how predictable these type of shows turns out to be. However, Ousama Game turns into a cheap social experiment of horror gimmicks that tried way too hard to look cool. Forget, cool. This show is asinine on so many levels that by the time you watch the first few episodes, you will label it as an unintentional comedy. Despite the show portraying it as a serious story, it\u2019s absurdly stupid in many ways. These are found through the examples of the characters\u2019 decisions, poorly executed plot twists, and over the top exposition that becomes a chore to watch. At first glance, you\u2019d think that exposition is important for a show like this. But overall, it degenerates into a cluster of boring info dump with cheap story selling. What does this show really want to accomplish? I had to ask myself many times throughout the show because every time I finish an episode, it makes me shake my head at how it fails to capitalize on anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast consists of students from Nobuaki\u2019s class. Because this show has a lot of characters, don\u2019t expect any of them to get memorable characterization. The main focus is how Nobuaki tries so desperately to save others but always comes up short that ends in sorrow. Unfortunately, it\u2019s very hard to ever sympathize with character loss in this show because there\u2019s just nothing to feel for them. They are dropped like jobbers in some wrestling drama not because it\u2019s predictable but because they are too blend to appreciate. Once in a while, there are shows that has a breakout character emerge from the blues. Ousama Game has none of them and its entire character cast is terribly written. For main male protagonist Nobuaki, he is far too generic to be any sort of hero. On the opposite side, there\u2019s Natsuko, a manipulate woman who cares about nothing but herself. The show portrays her as a psychopath that no one should trust and to be honest, there\u2019s not a single thing to like about her. It\u2019s as if the show itself is self-aware in making her the most hateful character. If that was its intention, then it got the point across with all the wrong reasons.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will say one thing. Ousama Game\u2019s creator and story seems to really try to bring out the best of what it can work with. It consists of 12 episodes and that\u2019s no easy task. However, the anime is a laughter stock with the genres it tries to capitalize. First, there\u2019s hardly any mystery. Sure, there\u2019s the \u201cKing\u201d and the game itself has some suspense. But at some point, do you really care? Most if not all the cast are going to die anyway so what\u2019s there to get thrilled about? Then, there\u2019s the horror. Does this show really feel scary? If we talk about the death scenes, then that would be unintentionally comical. I can\u2019t fandom how many times I laughed at character deaths. These ranges from jumping out from windows, hands being broken to pieces by overusing a computer mouse, or even heads twisted 180 degrees because why not. Some scenes are also censored (maybe fixed in BDs) that makes shows like Terra Formars look like a masterpiece. The supernatural elements of this anime is also very poorly executed such as the numerous times when the deaths happen. And drama? Oh, I already mentioned Natsuko since she\u2019s the guiltiest of this example. Still, the overall drama is so ill written that characters are locked in a conflict with no interest. Now that I think about it, this anime is really missing a comedy tag because of absurdly amusing it becomes as more and more the \u201cplot\u201d unravels.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Seven\u2019s effort in animating this show really makes me want to question if they even tried at all. This is technically one of their few full length show they\u2019ve produced and yet, it fails in a lot of ways. Character designs looks cheaply made like they are from some B-horror movie. While character expressions at times can deliver psychology, it ultimately falls apart due to its raw quality. The violence also comes off in the wrong way with how dumb it looks. Finally, the fan service is just unbearable. There are sometimes fan service in horror shows that can be a guilty pleasure to watch. However, Ousama\u2019s Game is just a pure disgrace with terribly timed segments and censorship.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, there\u2019s only one aspect of this anime I enjoyed and it\u2019s the music. \u201cFeed the Fire\u201d by coldrain is one of the noticeable theme songs from this year with its rock/metal hybrid style choreography. It\u2019s a shame their talent is wasted for a show like this. On the other hand, character voices are very annoying to listen to after a while. Nobuaki\u2019s desperate screaming when things go wrong is extremely unbearable. Natsuko\u2019s manipulative voice clearly gives a vile intention to make us hate her more. Other cast members are pretty much all forgettable except when you hear them scream to their deaths.\\n\\n\r\nTrying to get to the finish line for this show was a challenge for me. It\u2019s like I was thrown into bugged video game and trying to find a way out. Ousama Game is among one of the worst horror survival shows I\u2019ve seen in recent years. The unintentional humor fails to deliver itself in every way and a slap to the face for anyone that expected something good out of this show. The character cast are like puppets of a poorly made performance. And the story? Just burn it with a fire. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an infamous meme that \u201canime was a mistake\u201d in the community these days.  Just ask Ousama Game and you\u2019ll see why.\\n",

            "content": "TLDR:\r\nThis anime is the most tasty garbage.\r\nIf you like to watch things like The Room, Birdemic, or Mayoiga you will have a great time watching this show! I recommend watching with friends for a good laugh! 8/10\r\nIf you don't get a laugh out of absurdly bad shows, leave now and never look back. Without ironic enjoyment, this show deserves a 4/10\r\nFULL REVIEW:\r\nSTORY: 6/10\r\nA high school class begins receiving text message commands, that if they disobey they die in a most gruesome manner. I'm talking screaming, exploding body parts, and projectile limbs. The story can be confusing at times, but for the most part its veryeasy to follow whats going on. \\n\r\nThe King's orders usually boil down to \"have sex with this person\" or  \"one person has to choose someone to die\". We end up with lots of similar situations but the show does a good job of switching up what reactions the characters have, and the ways in which they die.\\n\r\nThis story could have made a good show if it was executed better, but instead we get this lovely masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nART: 4/10\\n\r\nMediocre for the most part with peaks and valleys, and some truly baffling shots. It is much more ambition than it has the money for, leading to some genuinely hilarious moments. The poor art adds a lot to making this show as funny as it is. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 5/10\\n\r\nThe opening is edgy as hell and definitely sets the mood. Otherwise nothing to complain about or compliment.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5/10\\n\r\nAll of them are bland, with some having slightly more personality than others. But it doesn't bother me much as the fun part is watching them get trashed by the King's game. They serve their purpose but I certainly won't be remembering any of them once done with this show.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nAdding this to my collection of shows I ironically enjoy. I've been watching this show weekly for 6 weeks, and at the end of every episode I'm begging for more. I have laughed out loud for this show more than for some shows that are actually trying to be comedies. Roll with the stupidity and you will have a great time.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\r\nThis show is absolutely ridiculous, and thinks edgy=good. The characters are bland, and the art only serviceable. But by golly, is this show trying its best to be entertaining. Try your shot at it if you're interested, if your sense of humor matches with mine, you will have a great time with this show.",

If you enjoy watching people brutally killed, suffer, break their fingers, forced to have sex, extreme drama and female character with evil/sadistic personality, then this is the right anime for you. \r\nFor me this anime proves that you don't always need those \"well written anime\" to enjoy it.\r\nA lot of haters here are just judging anime based how well written the story and how much plot holes or because some character act stupidly in some situation. Those haters start analyzing the this anime as if it is Shakespeare story book or some kind of scientific journal. I don'ttake anime too seriously. Character in anime does not always have to act the same way that people expect in real life\\n\\n\r\nFor me this show is just a pure enjoyment. It entertaining (for me) to watch fictional people suffer and try hard to survive. It does not matter if the story is weak and poorly written when I'm enjoying it. I'm on episode 11 when I wrote this review, and last few episodes were the best in my opinion so far \\n\\n\r\nMany of those who gave it 1/10 or 2/10 watched it until the last episode which makes me suspect that many of these haters don't genuinely believe that anime deserve such a low score. I mean why watch something that you think deserve such low score until the end ?! If I rate something 1/10 then that thing has to be so boring that I could not watch it at all\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt is also worth to mention that this show is noting like Mayoiga. Mayoiga  is children version of Ousama Game. If you found Mayoiga  boring like me then does not mean Ousama Game is same. Ousama game is real dark/horror show with people slaughtered in every place unlike  Mayoiga",

            "content": "Ousama Game is undoubtedly among the worst pieces of Japanese media that has ever been produced and most definitely the worst anime I\u2019ve had the experience of consuming. I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of people saying that this anime has a good concept and is only hindered by poor directing but the slew of issues with this anime would lead me to believe that either what these people find interesting is the genre itself or they are just plain blind to the plethora of issues plaguing this production. Before you spend four and a half hours of your life watching this abomination for whatever reasonI want to make one thing clear to you, you\u2019re wasting your time.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is complete and utter nonsense. There is no direction at all and it\u2019s filled with more holes than Shia LaBeouf has seen in his entire lifetime. As one thing is explained, three more questions arise, and eventually you\u2019re left wondering if the guy writing this was on crack and a random stream of words just poured out from his brain, without any regard for keeping the thing coherent. To convolute things even more, the story switches from current day to past events without any sort of indication or distinction whatsoever in an attempt to create \u201cparallels\u201d between the current events and the main character's past experiences, and also explain why things are happening a certain way and what might happen in the future. This, of course, only succeeds in making the viewer more confused and have even more questions about what is happening as the scenes don\u2019t have any sort of direction or flow. Finally when an explanation that isn\u2019t a non-answer finally is given (praise the lord), it equates to deus ex machina and is a spit in the face to people who faithfully followed along, waiting for some sort of break or light at the end of the tunnel. Who woulda thunk it?\\n\\n\r\nThe \u201ccharacters\u201d act more as walking plot devices, as their actions make no sense and quite literally serve only to shoehorn the plot further. You won\u2019t encounter an \u201cimportant\u201d character until the plot needs to be advanced, even though they\u2019re all supposed to be classmates and you\u2019re supposed to have seen all of them in the first episode. Instead you are shown a bunch of generic background characters in the beginning and only a few key main ones while rest are thought up on the fly and designed in a way specifically fit to the scenario at hand. The consistency in their interactions are also non-existent. Alliances are formed out of nowhere, and attitudes toward each other change with the drop of a hat. I should also mention that the author self inserted himself into the story, as the protagonist was named after himself and was designed to be a walking pity party and savior, all in one package. Quite a piece of work isn\u2019t he?\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things unsurprisingly things aren\u2019t looking too hot either. Scenes look subpar at best and complete arse at worst. All the budget is spent on random character\u2019s death scenes instead of sequences actually important to the advancement of the already trainwreck plot. A few of the voice actors tried the best they could, but with the script they were given it\u2019s hard to give a good performance, while others were just quite simply not good at all. The music is unoriginal, uninspired, and ripped from an album released last year making the lack or mismanagement of budget glaringly obvious. So overall, not a good look whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nIf it hasn't become apparent by now, there is absolutely no reason to watch this anime. It fails in absolutely every aspect, and doesn\u2019t even make an attempt to fix itself. It actively cancels its own canon, lies to you, and spits in your face when everything's said and done. It\u2019s not self aware, it\u2019s not ironic, and you won\u2019t even get enjoyment from watching it as a meme. If you have any self respect, if you consider yourself to have even average human intelligence, you will stay away from this series.",

The concept of the story, a \"king\" assigning tasks or else face death sounds really good in theory, but in practice, is not the case. The story was executed so poorly, with so many plotholes appearing; it's just unbearable. All we see is just more boring content.\r\nThere are also way too many flashbacks. This anime is based off of the second manga, Ousama Game: Shuukyoku, however, literally splices half of the first manga into it. Theyshould've just made an adaptation of the first manga, and then made a second anime; though I don't think anybody would watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing about this series is the anime opening, which is really disappointing because the opening sets out the series as an amazing horror series, but the anime itself if just a massive disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend that all people avoid this anime.",

            "content": "I never write reviews, but this is the worst anime I have ever seen and I believe that I should warn people not to watch it.\r\nOne of the problems it has is the fact that all of its characters are completely forgettable. I am on the 6th episode and lots of people have died. However, I could only tell you something about 2 or 3 of them. \r\nAnother problem is the fact that a lot of the characters die in the same or the next episode in which they are introduced (or get a bit of focus). This does not only mean that it isvery predictable to tell who will die in this episode, you also do not care about them all that much because you do not know them. What is even worst, they are generally presented as selfish persons that only want to survive without caring about the other people that die. If this was done right, you could be rooting for one or the other character to survive, but the anime is clearly trying to make you root for the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nI could get over that if you did not know if the main characters are going to make it or not. However, most of the story is told in flashbacks, as the main protagonist explains to his new classmates his previous experience in the game. This means that, from the very first episode, you know that the main character is the only one who makes it alive.\\n\\n\r\nAnd those are not even the main problems I have with this anime. I honestly like the premise. However, this anime takes all the problems that could come out of this premise and decides that, as far as they do not show them on screen, they do not exist. For example, how is it possible that after half of their classmates have died the police still has not appeared? I could understand it if none of the players wanted to go and tell the police about the game if it was a rule (which it is not) but I would be really surprised if I was in high school, half of my classmates had died and the police still had not come to talk with me.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the anime does as much as it can to avoid showing other characters than the people playing the game, maybe assuming that we will not realise how stupid it is for the characters to not try and seek for help from other people. The worst case so far is in episode 6, where the main character literally explains (via flashback) to some new classmates how multiple of his old classmates died while sitting next to a taxi driver as he is driving them to the place they want to go. However, the taxi driver does not appear on screen and that is apparently enough for the show to justify why this person does not freak out.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there are many more problems with this anime, such as characters behaving irrationally or suddenly behaving completely opposite to what they did previously, but if I had to analyze them as much as I have for the previous ones this review would end up being an essay. So this is my conclusion: do not watch this anime.",

            "content": "This.. This animation is possibly one of the most horrendous things I've seen in a while. It surprises me to how it's even above a 5 on MAL, considering the disgusting amounts of tropes, and generic development, not to mention the completely mindless protagonist that just doesn't fit in the genre it's marketing. Watching the first couple episodes with friends, I've seen all I needed to decide that this is possibly one of the lowest of the low, during this season; hell, for the past 4-5 seasons. I'll summarize this piece at the bottom, and for those avid and mindful readers; I'll throw in abit more detail.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 4/10\\n\r\nOkay, fair enough; A game that revolves around those slice-of-life anime where the King somehow gets the heroine and protagonist to have an inspirational moment together. Only except; nobody knows who the King actually is, along with the fact that people must do every action. It's all fun and games until somebody dies, right? Only except.. The death's for not fulfilling the orders of the King feels so unjustified. Oh, that generic background character that doesn't listen to the pleads of the protagonist and beats kids up suddenly EXPLODES into a pile of blood. They don't believe any of the reasoning behind the game, but they decide to meet up, y'know, like an atheist suddenly heading to a church to xxxx on the bible or something. To an extent; it's entertaining watching characters obtain superiority over others, where a nobody suddenly becomes the King and tells some guy he hates to literally \"kys,\" but with the 1-episode 0 development deaths, the audience sits there thinking \"Oh, they died.\" Also, actions of each character slowly becomes more predictable after the realization of dying if the duty is not fulfilled, literally following every line of the order to survive. \"Go kiss this girl?\" Oh, I wonder what the person who received that will do? It's like watching a bunch of children trying throw their rocks higher than the other, in attempts to awe the watchers. \"Look at me, I'll go this far to save my life, haha.\" *** This also relates back a couple years to the old \"Blue Whale Game\" trend, where people follow orders from above; inevitably leading the player to kill themselves. Yes, this a real thing.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 6/10\\n\r\nWell, it's not like animation style can be put down simply cause the concept is poor. Most of the scenes are presented own up to what the animator or studio wishes to show off. However, when other categories intercept with this, the value of the art goes down, as its mood and tone it SHOULD display ends up in the gutter. Instead, you laugh as the protagonist desperately tries to stop his classmates from victimizing themselves. haHa, so funny\\n\\n\r\nSound : 3/10\\n\r\nRemember Asta from Black Clover? Screaming every couple seconds? Imagine that with the over-the-top worry and crying in every episode. For me, at least; it gets annoying and reduces the immersion into the story. Simply put; the sound becomes so vanilla that the emotions behind it become stale. Why in gods name does the protagonist cry over literally EVERY SINGLE DEATH (okay, that's exaggerated, but you get the point). Let this become a bridge over to the god-awful character development\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 1/10\\n\r\nAlright, MC is up to the base for batting again, because apparently he had already attended one of these games, which is why he's got that clean new edge to cut his classmates apart, but the details of the previous game don't get revealed until later, you know? NOT IMPORTANT. Somehow, the biggest puxxy from the last King's Game WON IT. You'd think it'd be someone intelligent, and able to manipulate the game to his liking; or maybe someone maniacal, and able to kill and do something completely insane without a heart, or tear. Believe it or not, we have the protagonist that suddenly loves his classmates over the course of like.. A couple weeks, enough to cry over their deaths. The development relies heavily on his past, such as the previous heroine that the MC liked --> Into the trillions of others that he suddenly meets in this new class. Other characters? Just the typical mysterious girl that has some ace up her sleeve, but doesn't care to show it, A bunch of jocks with ogre thinking of \"Me die If I No Follow Order,\" and a collection of pretty flowers that probably have a dirt personality hidden underneath. If this isn't enough to show off the lack of development throughout the first couple episodes; other than the details that should've already been provided from the experienced MC, then Nisekoi must have traveled like a bullet.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 2/10\\n\r\nYou get it; a simple knack of \"Wow, I can't believe he did this.\" and \"What can top that.\" Characters? God awful, I haven't seen any characters that had likable traits. It's simply a sit-and-watch the protagonist cry for another girl, every episode. Heart strings weren't pulled with the first victims, or the MC getting bullied when he tried to slice off relationships with his sharpened edge, they won't be pulled from the generic cast of people. Simply put; enjoyment comes from the event of happily watching students kill themselves off one by one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 1/10\\n\r\nNo.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion :\\n\r\nUnless you're an avid fan of killing games, and had already seen the standard \"Danganronpa\" or \"Mirai Nikki\" and every single other main-stream classroom killings shows, and REALLY don't want to get into reading other gory stuff, since reading is too comprehensive for your massive head, go ahead and watch this. Be sure to unplug your head before doing so, or else all the plot-holes and stupid choices make you regret living, like your parents telling you you're adopted, or a terrible hangover.\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\r\nStory - Interesting foundation, poor execution, wrong cast. 4/10\\n\r\nArt - As good any recent animations can offer. 6/10\\n\r\nSound - ruined by the repetitive screeches of protesters in the ele-- 3/10\\n\r\nCharacter - no development, lackluster subchars, and 0 iq mc -- 1/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - wow, whatever can they do next? 2/10\\n\r\nOverall - One stroke up, Diagonal stroke, another Stroke up, circle. 1/10\\n\r\nConclusion - watch other similar, and decently executed shows, or turn off your brain and enjoy.\\n\\n",

You might say \" Duh dis is just an anime, why are you writing about a character so much and judging that character so hard?\". This character is created by creator of manga, to be honest this is the worst and most weird character i have seen on an fictional movie/TV show/anime/book. Thisi one has 0 good pointsand full bad things about its personality, so dont even compare this character, i have tried to find a rival to this one already.\\n\\n\r\nWell you see this is the first mistake author made, first character i just thrashed.\\n\\n\r\nStory is in Japan, where almost every town, every city has a hospital and police station near as much as you can just make it in 10 minutes. There was 2 \"having sex\" orders till now. Naoto could cut off his dick and that tall guy can so. People do surgeries to change their bender, believe me i have people as much as i could do it to not hurt them. 22 years i had more fun than a young man could have. \u0130 can go gay rest of my life, sounds interesting. Also they havent contacted any police officer yet, again a stupid point.\\n\\n\r\nThird: \u0130f you tie a person and give him/her clean fresh air, healthy food that is sure not poisonous, biologicall and logically that person will live as long as you keep doing it, till you find sick king.\\n\\n\r\nArt sucks so bad i would pass this show even if it was a hentai, fyi i love hentais more than any media production.\\n\\n\r\n\u0130 give 4 to sound, JUST FOR COLDRA\u0130N.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, just show is like a try before Danganronpa or the manga that there was a guy who had a twin brother and he was prisoned in cyber world ( i cant remember that mangas name) but this is a tragedy for me i wont be watching anime for a while because it was sooooo bad, like i wanna rate it lower than 0, my apologies to Scum's Wish and other shows that i rated 1-2 or 3.",

No need to write a detailed review.\r\nThe only SOMEWHAT mediocre part of this anime is the \"story\" and they managed to make it incredibly unappealing the longer it went on. However if you came here expecting to find some answers to this thing's \"story\", you're in tough luck. You aren't getting them. Because they were never given...\r\nThe animation was so poor that sometimes you could actually count frames. Horrendous art style that sorely lacked detail. Some sound effects were okay-ish but I can't remember ANY tune from the OST. They're thatunmemorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters.....oh boy. I don't think I've ever found characters more stupid than the ones in this show. It amuses me that as the episodes passed, the characters managed to get even MORE stupid. There was literally a scene where someone's classmate died next to him, he went in denial and did the exact sequence of moves that would kill him as well even though he knew it. Development is totally absent.\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\r\nArt 2/10\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\r\nOverall 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI only gave enjoyment a 3 because this anime actually managed to make me laugh at how pathetic its characters were.

            "content": "The king's game is a game played with people pick numbers at random and a king calls upon whatever number you get. the number called has to do what they are told. In this anime if you fail to complete an order you die. This would work if the writing wasn't complete garbage. First, we have two games going on at one time. Well, a past game and the current one. So we have double dose of rape and betrayal. Once again this sounds like a good show although it isn't. They try to make us care about characters in a span of episode oftop of everyone being dumbasses that don't know what loopholes are or characters that are selfish for not even their own survival. There is also a bunch of pointless dialogue because people struggle to do even the simplest of orders. And etc and etc. \\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't amazing either but not bad. It isn't downright terrible animation I mean I've seen worse but it isn't something you would watch this show for. Some of the characters just look disgusting anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe music can be rather cliche and boring for this genre but the voice actors feel like their talents are being wasted here with these garbage characters and lines. It doesn't help or they try to make every scene as dramatic as possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are this show's real drawback. The main character has won this game before yet still struggles to figure things out in the current one. He forces people to do things he wouldn't do himself and makes empty promises but so does everyone in this show. No of the characters so far are redeeming anyway since no one has a centralized character. They all change to what the plot needs them to be in that moment. \\n\\n\r\nI had high hopes for this show going in because it had some hype to it. the source is supposed to be better popular in Japan but so was other shows this season but those are trash also. Going from episode to episode hurts do to the terrible writing and tone changes. I don't know why anyone would watch this unironically.",

            "content": "Okay so I'm only giving this a 1 because that's the lowest score available. This is the first time ever I'm writing a review and I thought I just HAD to after miraculously finishing this pile of shit. I hope my review can save people from wasting their time on watching this.\r\nbefore this came out, the summary seemed promising, I was pretty excited, but the more I watched the more disappointed I got, by the 4th episode I completely lost hope that they will make anything good out of this, and it just kept getting worse afterwards. they just gathered up a bunch of characterswhom they didn't even introduce properly and then killed in \"brutal\" ways, though I gotta say the art and the sound and the pseudo dramatic actions of the characters made the death scenes laughably ridiculous, you can't be sad nor afraid and you can't even sympathize with them.\\n\\n\r\nthe way they made two stories intertwined took a huge toll on the story and character development, it got everything mixed up for the viewers and sometimes I couldn't even tell which setting they were talking about at the moment, nor who belongs where.\\n\\n\r\nI don't even want to get started about the main character. Whether it was in his old class or his new class, he was made out to be a hero and was liked and supported by everyone and had a half assed cheesy harem around him. But in reality he's the worst of them all, he only managed to survive all this time because people around him always saved his ass, either by being too crazy or by sacrificing themselves. He was only a huge coward who never took the initiative to do anything and was always shouting \"I won't let anyone die\" yet everyone around him just kept dying, and he kept weeping the entire show, it was disgusting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nWhat was even more sickening is the explanation they gave for the executions. It would have been much better if they had just used something supernatural instead, even aliens would have worked better than some virus who just spread on the internet onto people's bodies ? like seriously ??\\n\\n\r\nIn the end we never knew who is the king, nor why and how does he do this. I think the story could have went much better if the punishment wasn't death, because the over-the-top death scenes and the edginess were too cringy to be taken seriously. maybe the author just thought that if they used various and gruesome ways of death it might have contributed to give some horror aspect to the anime but it only made everything worse because the deaths most of the time were unreasonable and unexplained and the scenes were badly drawn and badly animated. Maybe if the punishments were doing stuff that were somehow leading to a bigger scheme that would help the king one way or another, maybe we could have seen something better and all of this would actually make sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I liked about this show was the voice actors' performance and the ending song, I'll give it that. Also I hope the studio won't waste their budget on another season because nor me nor anyone is probably looking forward to it.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this was helpful !",

            "content": "It is truly sad, the amount of time, effort and money complied into creating this work of anime. That could of been so much better used on something more coherent and thought out. \r\nNot knowing anything about the Manga or Live action film, but just based on the trailer I was  hoping for something that would really make me think twice, and although it definitely achieved that, it was not in the way I was intending. \r\nOusama Game had a good enough story concept to be something worth while, the premise being students from a average everyday classroom getting a text message from asender known as \"King\" to complete a extreme task in order to stay alive to take part in the next round. There could be a lot of fascinating and cool little twists the studio could of taken with this idea. But it seemed with each episode, whenever I would try to come up with a theory, it was immediately  thrown  out the window for something that lacked creativity, made little to no \\n\r\ncommon sense, or was just way to straight forward.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character Kanazawa, Nobuaki (Also the same name as the original creator I shit you not.) is hard not to hate from the very beginning. Showing no interest to create new friendships with his new class, even when everyone takes time to make him feel welcome. He outright pushes everyone away, only to soon after the game begins to try to earn everyone's trust. As the game progresses this character gets literally 0 character development from start to finish, he does however learn how to preform underwater CPR. Not learning from the incident with his first class, he repeatedly shouts out about how he wants to save a certain classmate, watches the classmate that may have uttered a single word die horribly. Cry about his loss then move on to the next classmate in danger, failing time and time again to save anyone or learn anything.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile you quickly find out Honda, Natsuko, the main antagonist will stop at nothing to survive the game. Even willing to out right explain this to all the class, basically several times exclaiming how she'll kill if she has to. All the while the other students continue to put good faith into her and basically allow her to Rape, beat or even kill other classmates without so much of a fight back, as if she's some kind of magical wizard. All for the convenience of allowing the plot to continue with conflict. \\n\\n\r\nBy the 3rd episode you'll feel sick to your stomach at the challenges the \"King\" makes these students go through,  You'd think some of these characters either had boundaries or try to consider another course of action. But it doesn't matter in the end because it is all about the shock value. Shock for the sake of shock, no matter how tasteless. Only to later make things worse when a character makes it through something tragic to die the very next challenge.  \\n\\n\r\nI honestly have no idea if this anime was expecting you to feel anything for anyone that died throughout the series. They crammed 2 classrooms of students into 12 episodes giving no time to establish a connection with anyone. All the characters where basically throw aways to the mess of the plot. Most of the male characters either became good buddies with Nobauki or where out to win the game. While the females, looking ridiculously sexualized,  joined his fan girl harem that was building up out of a few days of knowing this man.     \\n\\n\r\nJust, don't waste your time with this one people. The characters are mostly unlikable, one dimensional, stupid and sometimes even detestable. And no other people seem to even exist outside the school kids.  If you want to watch something that'll make you think twice and actually wow and intrigue you go see the classic Death Note, and if you have just rewatch it, rather than waste your time with this.",

            "content": "This is a prime example of one of the worst written stories ever, even after watching lots of horror movies, reasonably everything about this show shreds me to tears about how jokingly bad this is.\r\nStory:\r\nBased on the manga of the same name, the King's Game (or Ousama Game you wanna call it) is a survival-horror show, where the King's Game, a virus that has descended from generations past has come to haunt those who are involved in the game, and the end result is that no one survives to save the future of mankind from the King's Game.\r\nThe anime adaptation however, takes a lot ofliberties with the source material. Apparently there is a storyline of how the King's Game started with a long line of manga series, so check that out in the forums. This anime adaptation dabbles with the original manga as the backstory and another storyline as the present countenance. I personally don't like the horror genre, but this exception just makes me believe that from start to end, there's no substance all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNobuaki Kanazawa is honestly not BS-ing around with the King's Game (as he is a survivor from the previous game), but his actions question myself that why hasn't he made his decisions through and through. Even with the flashback of his former lover Chiemi, his idea of saving humanity is justified, but his actions prove otherwise, and the hindering does not help even when the class gets involved with everyone being topsy-turvy about this. The main protagonist, potential wasted.\\n\\n\r\nNatsuko Honda is clearly the antagonist here, but for her character, the evilness within her really is overpowering to the point it becomes overwhelming that what she does, if it was another villain, his/her execution would be so much inhumane in the proper manner he/she is. Even the sister Chiemi helps clear things out but not by much.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the preceding and present classmates? Jerks and BSes in their own right, fighting to survive this travesty is what I can say to wrap up the abomination that is the characters. All fillers, no substance.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nEverything here is TRASH PERIOD...well, honestly, it's not bad, but for portraying the horror genre, this barely touches the iceberg as compared to many shows out there that portray a better experience overall. At times it looks consistent, and others not.\\n\\n\r\nKnowing that animation studio Seven did it (famous for their hentai anime), I wasn't expecting a lot out of it, and coming out of the show, it felt indifferent as compared to other shows out there. So all in all, art and animation gets a fail overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nCan you believe it? A trash-worthy series with decent OST? Finally a good area...wasted to last its potential. Most notably the OP, only engaging the horror vibe of the show, and probably not the last we've seen of it. The others are fortunately not very noteworthy either.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, do I like this series? Not by a long shot, because this is abomination at its greatest. No fair countenance towards the mangaka(s) who worked on the series, not even a redeemable fact can be said about this show...I just don't know what to say.\\n\\n\r\nTo everyone, just skip this show and don't start because it will grow on you like a virus...that's to be continued.",

I can say that it was quite disturbing but if you not that serious about anything like me you will problaby enjoy it too.

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nSlight spoilers.\r\nI'll be honest, it's not every day that enough cringe worthy, misleading, incendiary and toxic comments gets me worked up enough not just log in but actually invest time and rebuke with a review from the other side.\r\nThe plethora of negativity and hate for this anime tends to home in on the fact that the plot is trite, characters are shallow, its conflicts and resolutions overwrought with edginess and the fact that it's pretty much a joke, but not enough to be a joke to be ~meme~ status like Ghost Stories. Some even going as far as to insinuate that theenjoyment of this albeit less polished piece of work implies one's lack of noodle points. There's no point to outright dismissing those valid fact based opinions that will help you decide if you'd watch this anime, but-\\n\\n\r\nOne thing had always puzzled me, how could any being of intelligence and compassion allow themselves to be overtaken with sin and dismiss the merits of another? Does the disconnect between keyboard, screen and the world wide web allow us to forego the softer side of our ego just as corporations like EA coldheartedly and gladly release more and more microtransactional, exploitative(pending investigation) contents in spite of the protest against it? Do we, as jaded, cynical overprideful and undergrammared overindulgers of eastern animation really understand the effort put into the creation of pieces of work such as Ousama Game? Will we delude ourselves like Hollywood critics with their barely qualified education and similarly affiliated status to name-brand sites that just qualifies them to review on rotten tomatoes? There's a reason why Transformers earn money, there's also a reason why people laud their own disdain as well. There must also be a reason why it feels so wrong but so right to enjoy Ousama Game the Animation, so take a moment to make your own opinion and at least waste 30 minutes for the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nWith the advent of 4k and the prevalence of HD, even one fraught with extreme myopia would be able to see the discernible drop in quality for its animation and artwork as the episodes went on, its overwhelmingly telegraphed foreshadowing and silly scenes that tests even those inundated with immunity against the breaking of immersion during what is supposed to bring one to tears from sadness, not laughter.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing this anime does right, at least for me, is the premise. Written in the vein of mystery and horror, it fails to compare to the quality of Another, uniqueness of Mirai Nikki, plot of Higurashi, heart of Elfen Lied and the accessibility of Ghost Hunt. Nevertheless, it contains a little of what make all of the aforementioned anime good, even if you'd decide that it's an inferior mishmash of imitations. It's simple enough, anyone entered into the King's Game must comply with its new rules every 24 hours, and those that fails will be punished. There's definitely room for development, but somehow it got too friendly with the tried and true tropes of today's teen toons. Yet, that is its own charm. I find myself rooting for the hero despite the plot giving away who is next to be on the chopping blocks, cursing against the plot armor for being so sure and definite of who to protect. I suppose one must change and adapt to be able to enjoy a story, after all, instead of seeing the characters as dead the moment they actually perish, is it really that different from when said characters started getting serious screen time? What's so bad about indulging in a bit of nostalgia and MST3K Mantra? Fortunately, the horror genre isn't as tapped out and overplayed like some others, but it seems to attract a slightly more quirky, therefore prideful audience. Enjoy this new entry into the comparably shorter list of the horror genre without being misguided by your desire to be cool, stay in school and enjoy sitting next to the cutest girl in class.\\n\\n\r\nOne questionable entry won't poison the well right?\\n",

            "content": "This anime screws itself over from almost the very get go, but I'll try my best to state the problems.\r\nStory:\r\nIt doesn't help to have a good chunk of this series to be consisting of flashbacks to the previous Ousama Game. The leeway into the new Ousame Game plot is also not very well done. Honestly, it's the garbage version of Akame Ga Kill where all they do is just kill off characters like no tomorrow. At least Akame Ga Kill made me feel for and have an affinity for the characters that got killed off. At this point, it doesn't matter if it stays trueto the manga version or not. Even the ending itself did not do this series any sort of justice: everyone dies, but the game continues...smh\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI will say that the opening theme is pretty lit, and that I feel bad that it's wasted on such a trainwreck of a series. There's nothing much else I can say about it. The soundtracks within the actual episodes are decent but due to how poorly the series plays out, they become just a \"benchwarmer\".\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNot much to say about the art, it's kinda decent, but I've seen plenty similar or better. At least they do well with showing the characters' expressions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI do not get how you turn someone who seemed like the nicest girl in the class to a complete douchebag within two episodes, with absolutely no leeway or any logical catalyst. Sure, maybe it's out of complete terror that you turn into someone you're not, but it's honestly offputting, even if you're a fan of sudden changes in personalties. Additionally, the series doesn't handle the characters well enough to where you can actually feel for them. Like I didn't even blink when someone gets brutally killed in an episode, I'm more like \"umm, okay, another one bites the dust?\"\\n\r\nIt's honestly a whole lot worse than the Danganropa adaptation with these situations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf you read my previous statements, you can already guess my enjoyment level. If not, I'll just say it: if there was an option of 0, I'd pick that, cause that series is honestly one of the worst things I've ever seen. I mean, to carry over from my thoughts about people saying Yugioh Arc V being controversial and trash....nah nah nah, that ain't nothing, cause Arc V is actually pretty good despite the butchered final arc, cause to be fair, even many great series have had butchered conclusions....this series known as Ousama Game, though, is appalling beyond reason, even if not the absolute worst.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nTWO WORDS: DON'T WATCH\\n\r\nHonestly, you're better off with even the cliche harem and isekai series than this abomination.\\n\r\nTrust me, it'll save whole hours of your life.\\n\r\nAnd you're also better off reading the manga, instead, ofc\\n\r\nAnd with that, my rambling and review is done.",

            "content": "So this is my first anime review here on MAL and bo-hoi do I have things to say about this abomination. I really, really wanted my first review to be somewhat professional and objective without any bias but I just HAD to review this just to let people know how dreadfully painful it is to watch this abortion of an anime every week just to feel the acomplishment of enduring the whole thing. SERIOUSLY!!!\r\nEver seen those \"torture\" scenes from bad sci-fi movies where a secret organization tortures a victim by forces them watch some psychological BS program to break them and ultimately, take control oftheir mind?\\n\r\nSort of like the infamous MK-Ultra.\\n\\n\r\nI felt this was that for me.\\n\\n\r\nBut I just couldn't stop watching the train wreck. It's like watching watching an airplane's engine die and take a dive from the skies. You know the end result is gonna be ugly but you can't look away for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nJust to let people know. I was a manga reader before going into this so I knew what kind of thing was specting. It wasn't much but hell, I was at least hoping to be mildly entertained, which I am, but not in the way that I wanted. I even own the freaking manga! This ''thing\" was just painful to watch through and through. And I say thing because this seriously CANNOT be called an anime. It should be ILLEGAL to do so.\\n\\n\r\nNow, with my rant out of the way I want to rate each section of this thing accordingly the best I can without getting triggered just by the thought of me wasting time on this.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 1/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, I am a manga reader. At least for the \"first\" King's Game part of the story. You see, this thing is divided into two diferent stories of two diferent King's Games that our MC, Nobuaki, goes through. The first King's Game, in which everyone except him died is told by flashbacks to his current classmates. The second King's Game involves Nobuaki's second class. At the moment of this review I've seen 6 episodes. This almost concludes the first game but the second one is just getting started so I dont know how it will play out.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the story is that it tries to tie two completely diferent, although related, stories into one and fails to do so so badly. First, I'll adress the elephant in the room: The Flashbacks. Making the first game be told by flashbacks completly ruins the point of the game in the first play since we know Nobuaki survived and everyone else from the first class didn't. This also cuts into the second game's story way to often to the point where progress in the story is almost non-existant. Imagine a bit more than a single day has passed in the current story in the span of 6 episodes... Yeah, it's that bad.\\n\r\nThe original story wasn't a modern masterpiece but It could have been adapted in a way that wasn't a sore to the eye to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 2/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say about the art other than... meh. The thing I can probably talk about the most is the gore scenes. Honestly it feels they're just there for visual impact but its actually more cringe inducing than anything. The animation just looks stiff most of the time. Body movements don't feel or look like they're supposed to.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain. Just... meh. I can't even remember a single soundtrack. No, not a soundtrack that I enjoyed, just a soundtrack. If the OST is that unmemorable then you know its bad.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is just bad all around. The characters don't convey emotion like a real person should. Friends are dying in front of their eyes and they freak out and scream. Yet they can't express their emotions like a human should even if their life depended on it. Oh wait, it DID depend on that once, lmfao.\\n\r\nThe saving grace in this category is the OP song, which is pretty good. That alone bumped up this score to a 4 and the overall score to a 2.\\n\\n\r\nJust be reminded that this is the category that I rated the highest. And it's a FOUUURRR.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 1/10\\n\\n\r\nAll of these characters are so badly written it makes me cringe. First of all, Noubuaki wasn't such a coward in the manga, but here they make him look extremely weak-willed. The rest of the cast just feels like they're mentally retarded and can't think straight for more than 10 seconds. Sure, you could argue that they're being thrown into a situation no one knows how to handle but they don't even try to do anything to stop it. They just wait it out until they die at best and try to sabotage each other at worst. They lack any logic behind their reasoning.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThis category is the most subjective one of all of them. It all comes down to personal preference and since it comes to that I'll state my personal opinion:\\n\\n\r\nIT'S FUCKING SHIT!!!\\n\\n\r\nIf you watch this knowing it will be bad only to make fun of it maybe you'll enjoy it more, idunno. Maybe you'll watch it as a comedy anime or something and maybe, just maybe, you'll find a way to actually enjoy it. Although that seems like a far cry.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't even know what to say at this point. I've let out all my rage just writing this review only so I can show how much I hate it to random people I will never know. Seems like that qualifies me as a professional anime critic now... hurrah.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you'll excuse me, I have to make a joke about bleaching my eyes to get the point through to my friends.",

The characters are so funny how they died (the girl that falls from the windows, why is so much blood when she falls?? that's not making any sense) all the side characters are plot device, for example: first episodes when some boys are beating the MC for reasons and the girl suddenly becomes pyscho in the second episode (and we don't talk about how they believe her when she accuses the MC of rape but that bitch wants sex early with another guy). Other intelligent character is the girl that wants to know who is theking (how amazing order) and she becomes blind (and she can write like a normal person in the sand and walk without problems for so long!!)  Also why they adapt first adapt the second game and then we have to much flashbacks of the first game when THE MC SAYS THAT EVERYBODY DIES why i should care about characters of the first game that have to die anyway?

The voice acting, music production, even the screen lighting is some of the most top notch work I've seen in a very long time. A few weeks back, I mentioned in an article that I had started Ousama Game over a decade ago and dropped it because it bored me. To anime fans, this is about the same as saying, \u201cI really love the Bible but I am not keen on this whole God character.\u201d  Boywas I wrong.  Putting off the masterpiece of Ousama game was the single greatest mistake of my life.  A lot of people tell me that Ousama game is what got them into anime. And it's easy to see why: It's nothing like the vast majority of American cartoons of its time.  Ousama game is the primary stepping stone into the highly coveted elitist realm of anime.  \\n\\n\r\nI cannot recommended this show enough 10/10",

            "content": "This anime was nothing more than a mess from the very get go, but I'll try my best to state the problems. Coming from a light novel and I've heared how poor writen it was.\r\nStory 1/10\r\nThe story goes in circles; introducing a few characters that you have no reason to care about, killing them violently for very stupid reasons, then repeating the cycle in the next episode. This is a totally stupid, and is infuriating. Most of the times it's just student after student getting killed. The students of some random class receive text messages from a person who calls themselves \u201cking\u201d aka Ousama, theysay the students are part of a game and if they don't obey the rules they are punished. The problem is no one in the class knows who this king is or what he looks like. The show is so obsessed with its own edginess that it\u2019s almost laughable. Even how writen is too boring and makes you fell sleepy. It' all about mystery :/\\n\\n\r\n''The rules of the King's Game are as follows:\\n\r\n1. All class members must participate.\\n\r\n2. The order sent by King through email must be followed within 24 hours.\\n\r\n3. A punishment will be given to those who don't follow the order.\\n\r\n4. Quitting the King's Game halfway is forbidden.''\\n\\n\r\nMore liek kinda broke and not well put togeter\\n\r\n1. All class members are hardly seen.\\n\r\n2. Most of the messeages are sent by text.\\n\r\n3. A punishment will occur if they don't follow it, but most of them are asleep and don't know what's going on and probably will die either way.\\n\r\n4. Quitting the King's Game is actually the only way to make it seemed edgy most of the times. However, they still die regarless of what happens.\\n\\n\r\nRules are exactly the same to Danganronpa series (they however are better with it in some retropects\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 0/10\\n\r\nHardly anything about the characters are to like sinse most of the times they act 1-0 dimensional and barely leave an impact.\\n\r\nThe characters make the show ridiculous and impossible to take seriously if they just didn\u2019t exist the show would be 10 times better. Everything they do is stupid. The things they do are frustrating at first, but as you realize there is no hope for any of their survival you will find that their stupidity makes the show a comedic.\\n\r\nThey yell at each other and get nothing done. They constantly deny that the King's Game is real, even though many of their classmates have been killed; they just remark \"it must be a coincidence!\" and I chuckle every time I see that line.\\n\r\nThe main character Nobuaki is an asshole. The main female character Natsuko is an douchebag. Most of the class are pretty much died and get no developtment and try thier best to be ''important'', but they don't. First 4 episode just seem repetive and formula for this follows the same patterns as Danganronpa (but only worse). Sexist moments, cringe scenes that wanna make you turn off video, bad writing and King looks like a DEUS EX MACHINA, I haven't got any favorite characters at all. It's clear that no one involved in Osama Game cared at all about creating characters, they just wanted to create big breasted anime ladies to sexualize, which isn\u2019t surprising considering the studio that produced it mainly makes hentai. Even the creators of High School DX did a better job with hentai than this abomanation. Half of the charcters die offscreen and we never see what motiv drove them to death.\\n\\n\r\nArt 1/10\\n\r\nFlat and ugly visuals plague the show all around. The light Noval was pretty poor with character arts.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\r\nThe music and sound effects are pretty good, but have to put in this trainwreck of a series, imo\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Ousama Game is only semi-watchable when it\u2019s showing off a slew of ridiculous deaths with really poor art quality because at least you can laugh at it. If that doesn\u2019t sound like something you could enjoy then you\u2019ll likely get nothing out of the show. Even if you intend to watch it for the overdone violence you\u2019ll probably be disappointed because by the final few episodes it becomes toned down and more execution styles are reused. Most of the times i fell asleep watching this garbage and had to switch on HunterxHunter so i can get rid of this taste from my mouth permently. Hell, I've seen worse animes than this, but this takes the cake.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\r\nTwo words. DON'T WATCH IT. You be off watching anything that's bad, but good, however anime get's the award for worst anime ever. Even it's ending felt stupid and just started another season (who god knows if i can afford to watch another messy show).However made this trash was probably on drugs.\\n\r\nAnd with that, my rambling and review is done. \\n",

Let's talk about the fanbase, I have seen SO ANY GOD DAMN SHIPING POSTS AND COMMENTS THAT IT MAKES SICK DOWN TO MY STOMACH \"I want Riona-chan and Nobu-kun to survive because they are sugoi kawaii dream relationship and I want my fanfic to become true\" AND THATS MOST OFTHE FANBASE IN A FUCKING NUTSHELL. And that horrible, cancerous, disgusting, shit ending is just the god damn top on the shit Sundae. This garbage makes SAO look good, FUCKING SAO. And let not forget the BIG LARGE ELEPHANTS in the room, the are so many fucking problems with the pacing, the characters motivations changes without any reason and with the flick of a god damn switch, and THE GOD DAMN FUCKING FACT THAT RIONA MADE OUT WITH A FUCKING CORPSE. And I almost forgot about Nobuaki, FUCK NOBUAKI, HE GOT TO BE ONE OF THE WORST MC EVER WRITTEN. He starts out \"okay\", THEN LIKE A GUNSHOT TO THE DICK, he becomes the worst part of an already terrible show. (Rage rant mode) HE GOES BETWEEN I want to die because I survived a death game, There is no hope left, I&apos;m gonna sacrifice myself to save idiots who deserve to die, Chiemi I am sorry AND THE NEXT FUCKING SECOND I'm gonna help them survive, Their is always hope, I am gonna live to honor all my friends. HE IS LIKE A FUCKING 10 YEAR OLD WITH ADHD WHO CAN'T DECIDE WHAT GODDAMN CANDY HE WANTS. Also am I the only one is still wondering what the fuck those creepy doll things are? The only positive about this shitshow is it's opening and ending, nothing more, nothing less.",

            "content": "I wouldn't say I was \"disappointed\" with Ousama Game. I had no expectations for it to begin with... Okay, I had expectations, but they weren't positive ones. I figured it was going to be edgy; something along the lines of Danganronpa or Mirai Nikki. That's okay, maybe it will still be somewhat enjoyable right? But noooooooo.  Ousama was able to surpass all levels of the shit-tier and earn its spot as my #1 worst anime (excluding memes). I'm not even joking when I say this abomination is worse than Akame ga Kill and Mayoiga.\r\n***Light spoilers ahead, not like any of it matters***\r\nLet's start withthe animation studio, \"Seven.\" ... Their profile: Ousama Game, I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying, aaaaand literally 100% of everything else they made is hentai. Soooo yeahhhh the production is already fucked.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is awful to say the least. There is never anything technically difficult to animate in this show; all of the characters' actions are pretty basic. Yet they still somehow managed to screw up basic character animations. In a moment when one girl is terrified, she throws her phone on the ground >> this is done in approximately 3 key frames, and the action looks completely pathetic given the situation. In another scene, some dude gets pissed at another guy pushes him down on the ground >> the animation looks like nothing more than a playful shove, but still manages to throw him to the ground; the camera moves a bit to make up for the lack of impact animation, but no, sorry, it didn't work well. Scene with characters running >> looks janky as hell.\\n\\n\r\nThe #1 problem I have with this show is the method of story telling. The main premise for the MC is the fact that he has already survived the ousama game once, and this is his second time playing, so he knows more than everyone else. Okay, that's fine, that's an acceptable cliche to have in an anime. But then the MC starts telling stories of what happened in the \"previous\" ousama game. Okay, flashbacks are kinda okay too. But the \"flashback\" to the previous game takes up the entire episode. There is more video footage screen time of the previous game than of the current ousama game. It would've been somewhat better if the story was told in order in separate arcs, or at least have the story on one timeline.\\n\\n\r\nAnother fatal flaw of this series is the lack of weight to the characters. The viewer is given zero reasons to care or have any interest in the characters. Mayoiga had this exact same problem, so I won't go into too much detail. The only characters that have any viewer investment whatsoever are the MC's two friends, who are from the \"previous game.\" And there are zero characters in the \"current game\" that anyone cares about.\\n\\n\r\n***More spoilers below***\\n\\n\r\nOusama Game-- a game where you are required to follow an anonymous King's orders, or else be punished/killed-- at least the premise of the story sounds marginally entertaining, right? No. Not even the Game part of this show was interesting. Day 1 - 10 of 30 students are killed the instant the game starts simply because they were asleep when the King sent the texts. Day 2 - another 10 students are killed for similarly meaningless reasons. At least in the flashbacks of the \"previous game\" they show how the students attempted to carry out the King's orders, and are only punished when they fail or are killed by another student. In the \"current game\" -- nooope, everyone just dies for no reason, because fuck you plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just who is this mysterious omnipotent King who is moderating this game? It's A. FUCKING. VIRUS. THAT CAUSES HYPNOSIS. AND IS TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE FUCKING INTERNET.\\n\r\nN-no. Just.... no. I'm done. I can't even. I'm done typing now. Fuck this. Goodbye.",

While the kid's are dropping off like flies, they show it in such a way that I should feel something. Instead I was left with, \"Oh.. who were you again?\" The new group of kids don't even matter cause we focus on the MC's old school who is already dead and gone. \r\nHalf the time I thought the writing was anabsolute joke. It felt like a preteen who just discovered the drama genre writing their first fanfic. Half the crap on fan-fiction.net is better than this talentless pile of garbage. It astounds me that better anime out there don't even get at least 12 episodes. Yet they got 12 episodes for this?! And GUESS WHAT!

If you have ever watched Mirai Nikki, Mayoiga, Another, Danganronpa, Corpse Party or anything similar to these, you know how Ousama Game is.\r\nSTORY 1/10\r\nThe story is just a space of time when the mindless gore and edgy pseudo-philosophy take place. The flashbacks shows the first King's Game of the main character, following his classroom and give to us more stupidness than the second and main part of the anime. In particular, the explanation of the origin and mecanism of the death game is simplory and boring.\r\nART 3/10\r\nThe art is quite regular. Not good or bad, itjust exists.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 3/10\\n\r\nSame as the art: it's there.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 1/10\\n\r\nThis part is awful. Really, really awful. Over 64 characters (two classrooms) and NONE of them have the appropriate development or is memorable someway. The main character, Nobuaki, is the typical \"WILL SAVE ALL MY FRIENDS AND SACRIFICE MYSELF TO ACHIEVE IT\" character. His girlfriend is the \"I'll help my boyfriend to save all our friends and sacrifice myself to achieve it too\" character. He has a sidekick with the same vibe, but more coward, but I already forgot everything about him. We have a hacker Rei Ayanami character, a redhead Yuno Gasai character, a readhead Yuno Gasai's friend without an own personality character and a Taiga Aisaka character too. Everyone is a giant unbearable shit.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 1/10\\n\r\nI have to be some kind of masochist to watch this until the end. Don't do it. Seriously. It was painful.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 1/10\\n\r\nOusama Game The Animation is one of the worst anime ever. Just watch it if you have no love for your life.\\n\r\nIn resume: just watch it if you are a edgy teenager and your brain hurts when you think.",

With a classroom full of students you expect there to be at least a few you care about. at least a few you recognize right? our main character transfers to another school and after about a week he decides he loves all of them. great people. cringe. but after each and every death he cries for them like he knew them since he was a kid. even more unbelievable and cringy. you expect the main character, the person who won the last king's game to be a smart, conniving guy that will do anything he has to do to stay alive. no, he's the generic, \"we need to work together and be friends\" type of guy. should have been a character driven story but it ended up being the worst part about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\r\nnaw boy. skip it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\r\ndespite how bad it is i want to see what happens. it has this sort of thing that makes you wanna keep watching and see if the cringe lords die. boo. bad.",

            "content": "I can't believe I'm wasting my first review on this show...\r\nOusama Game The Animation (King's Game in English) is a perfect example of how you can have good ideas and still write a terrible story. Honestly, that's the only way I can even recommend this show: if you want a case study in how to ruin a story, I can't think of a better example than this. I can't in good conscience advise watching King's Game for any other reason. It is a train-wreck from beginning to end, and only two things kept me watching until the end: it was admittedly really fun to joinin on the episode discussions every week and talk about why this show is so bad, and I felt a morbid curiosity to see just how bad it could get and where the flaming wreckage would land. There were times when this show made me seriously question if I was suffering from some uncharacteristic streak of masochism...\\n\\n\r\nLet me start with the good things:\\n\r\nThe OP and ED songs are actually pretty good, it's a shame they had to be attached to this show. And there are some times when the show can actually be funny. It's not supposed to be funny at all, but the straight-faced absurdity of some parts is just too much to take remotely serious. Finally, there are times when you can see the spark of what could have been a really good idea, but...\\n\\n\r\nAnd now the bad:\\n\r\n...That spark is, without fail, snuffed out, stomped into the dirt, and urinated on for good measure. And most of the time, it's because every single character in the show is either killed off without even being properly introduced, or so painfully devoid of any logical thought or consistency of character that it is impossible to care about them at all. The characters are easily the worst part of the show, and they consistently drag every other aspect of storytelling into the dirt with them. Personalities do a 180 turn at the drop of a hat, everyone is either unreasonably cruel or hopelessly pathetic, and characters constantly make choices so poor you have to wonder how they've managed to even survive long enough to be part of the game at all. But fear not, poor writing ensures that even in the rare instances that characters aren't being insufferably idiotic, the story still continues to fail at being any sort of horror or thriller and at best an uncompelling mystery with no payoff for the solution (so bad, in-fact, that even after the King's identity is explicitly revealed, some viewers still don't realize that there's nothing more to it, we really do have the complete, albeit absurd, answer; and I can't blame them for not getting it, because it doesn't actually make any sense or explain anything).\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize: King's Game is terrible, the characters are quite possibly the worst characters I've ever seen, and it completely fails at everything it has attempted to be and is instead closer to an unintentional comedy. And it's not even worth watching for that, because it's really not that funny very often. It only gets a 2 instead of a 1 because there were at least some good ideas underlying the show, which unfortunately could not reach even a fraction of their potential because of everything that was wrong with the show. I could bash the show for hours, but honestly it's wasted too much of my time already. Don't be like me, don't waste your time on King's Game.",

            "content": "I'm going to get straight to the point, this anime is a dumpster fire. At the best of times it's hilariously nonsensical and at the worst of times, it genuinely hurts to watch.\r\nStory 1/10:\r\nThe basic premise of King's Game is... sketchy at best. It just screams edge the more you read it. Honestly, after watching all 12 episodes, I can safely say that an edgy cringe fest would be 1000x better than what we got. There are plot and logic holes so large I am convinced it took actual effort to come up with them. I can't give specific examples because spoilers but let's justsay that this anime actively spits in the face of science on multiple occasions and burns the book on a coherent plot within the first episode. The problem here is it goes so far into the supernatural while still trying to give some scientific and technological explanation. This isn't inherently awful but when you don't have a clue what you're talking about it definitely shows. Besides that, there's just so much that happens that doesn't make sense and the plot takes so many ridiculous twists that it loses itself. It also doesn't help that the first half of the show is just flashback to a different instance of the King's Game which doesn't sound all too bad until you remember that they literally tell you the outcome of each event before it happens. No joke, the first half of this anime is them telling you a thing happened and then showing you said thing. Except any and all enjoyment that could come out of these flashbacks is the tension of not knowing what's going to happen. Take that away and what do you get? A boring mess is what.\\n\\n\r\nArt 3/10:\\n\r\nThis had a very cheap look to it like you could feel the lack of a budget. There were times where I could count the number of frames in a scene. On top of that, I didn't really like the general art style but that's just personal preference. The absolute worst is the awful censoring. I'm a big fan of mosaics because I feel like they leave enough to the imagination where an injury might actually seem worse due to the little you can see. The creators of this apparently don't agree as they decided to just slap a black shadow on it and call it a day. In the later stages when people are getting ripped apart and loses their heads every 5 seconds, it gets really distracting and takes you out of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10:\\n\r\nI skipped the OP and ED every episode because they were bland and uninteresting. In terms of the music used throughout the show, it was OK but didn't really add anything other than a nice distraction. The real failure here is the sound effects and voice acting. There were a lot of cheap sounding sounds and a few that wouldn't look out of place on a free sound site from 2006. A lot of the voice acting felt very cartoonish and fake and at times was just hilariously awful, particularly when our MC screams or cries. What's even worse is that those parts are supposed to be some of the most serious, emotional parts of the show but makes you react in the complete opposite way which really detracts from the moment. Nothing like watching one character weep over the death of another while you're laughing at the stupidity of it all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10:\\n\r\nBy far the worst part about this entire show. Characters range from being unintelligent yet mildly endearing one-dimensional husks to unbearable, borderline mentally disabled one-dimensional husks. To start with our MC, he's everything I hate in a character. He's whiny, delusional, bland, generic, you name it. He runs around trying to do the cliche thing of \"I must protect everyone\" then proceeds to protect no one. His motivation for this is pretty weak too. The rest of the cast in both timelines are not as bad but by no means good. There are a few somewhat bearable characters, as mentioned before, but they're really just fodder as they're all good friends with the MC and he has to watch them die or have a mental breakdown and then cry about it for half an episode. I did mention this before but the most frustrating part is that EVERYONE is stupid. No exceptions. Pick any character throughout the show and they are guaranteed to do something incomprehensibly stupid at least once throughout their screen time. It starts off annoying and descends into genuinely painful and it's not a slow transition either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10:\\n\r\nThis anime was not enjoyable at all. By the end, I couldn't even derive pleasure out of complaining about it. There were times were I felt like I should laugh at how awful this show is but didn't have the strength to do it. As far as I'm concerned, this show is devoid of enjoyment past maybe episode 6 (very generous estimate).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 1/10:\\n\r\nThe only reason I didn't drop this show like a sack of bricks down an elevator shaft is to write this review and warm people. Unless you are a masochist, and a big one at that, or hate yourself or don't mind an endless barrage of plot holes, annoying characters, and edge or maybe some combination of the three, stay far far away from this anime. I barely scratched the surface of the problems this train wreck has but I think I put together enough of a list to put at least someone off watching this abomination. You've been warned, stay away.",

            "content": "Alright. Ousama Game: The Animation, or King's Game.\r\nA survival game genre show adapted from a manga of the same name, Ousama game revolves around the main character, Nobuaki Kanazawa, and his classmates as they're thrust into a confusing and terrifying game. The basic premise goes as such: the students receive a text from the \"King,\" where they are given 24 hours to follow an order, and failure to do so results in punishment. End of premise. With this knowledge, I think it's reasonable to expect some interesting psychological play as the students try to figure out how to conquer the game, and an eagerness fromthe viewer to understand the nature and origin of the game itself. Sadly, the show falls flat in basically every way.\\n\\n\r\nJust as a disclaimer, this show is an adaptation, meaning there is source material for it. I have not read the source material, nor plan to, and the rest of this will be conducted solely on the show's merits.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story:\\n\r\nTo go into this without as few spoilers as possible for anyone who feels the need to watch this show for whatever reason, the story is boring. Linear. Uninteresting. Beyond the premise of the show, there's nothing about the story that is interesting. It's also confusing and jumbled. In 12 episodes, the viewer is taken through the story of not only one, but two classes involved with the King's Game: the main character's current class, and his class at the school he went to previously (unlucky guy, right?). The story of his old class is told through flashbacks, which unfortunately are not very distinguishable from the scenes in current time. This can be confusing and incoherent until the viewer figures out who is who, and in which story line they belong.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I'll try to keep everything else further away from spoiler territory, but the punishments are just ridiculous. It's all just death. Death everywhere. And it's all senseless. There's no reason for it, just like there's no reason for anything in this show, and is probably my biggest gripe. Every punishment is death, except for two times. But those just ended up with death anyway. More about this in the Art section below.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, there is absolutely no payoff anywhere. There's generally one pretty good assumption that can be made with survival game genres: the game is won when there's only one person left. Of course this gets tossed to the wayside often, but with this understanding, you can basically watch this knowing that our main character is the only survivor of his first King's Game. Unfortunately it seems that he's learned nothing, as he continues to meet with failure, and any \"clues\" he picked up in his first Game don't really pan out to be worth anything. There is no usefulness that came from the first Game, and the trend continues with the current Game. By the end of it, nothing is accomplished and the viewer is left looking for any form of accomplishment, of which there is none.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\r\nThis should sound familiar: boring, linear, uninteresting. Unfortunately, none of the characters are likable. Even our main character, the hero of the class, is just...uninteresting. These characters go through no development, and in some cases even devolve. Which, I guess, might be a reasonable thing to expect when people are dying for no reason everywhere. But even this is just faked, because early on in the show you get to see how all of the characters react to the situation. Some will randomly change their tune for a time to fit whatever you can call the narrative, but these are often abrupt and don't make sense at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art:\\n\r\nBoring, flat (new word), and uninteresting. Everything is dull and there's little depth to any of the art. Except, of course, when someone dies. It's like someone wrote down a bunch of needlessly violent and grotesque ways to die on a piece of paper, made copies, put them in a hat, and pulled them out one by one every time they killed someone, which is always. The animation on the deaths of the characters are sadly the most impressive moments on the show. But it's just so needlessly violent. Oh, and magic, by the way. Other than that, when they wanted to give a brief respite from the gruesomeness, they were able to create some decent backgrounds and set pieces, but I don't particularly find that difficult to do when the rest of the show is steeped in dullness and death.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound:\\n\r\nAverage. Of course, when someone dies they went all out. But other than that, nothing of note. The soundtrack is not memorable, nor are the opening or ending songs and sequences of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe Conclusion:\\n\r\nYou can absolutely skip this show. Much like the characters, plot, deaths, etc., it's useless. There's nothing to be gained from this show unless you want to do a case study on how to graphically animate uselessly magic deaths. The character sufferings amount to nothing in a story that amounts to nothing. No payoff or any form of satisfaction at all. Really disappointing because the premise of the show actually sounded like it might harbor an interesting psychological survival game.\\n\\n\r\nIt didn't.",

            "content": "So this is what Z Grade Horror anime schlock looks like...\r\nOusama Game: The Animation RIGHT FROM THE GET GO utterly fails in trying to be edgy by going to the extreme with it's horror gore and rapey situations this anime that it one, can't be taken seriously and to is that because it's trying to soo hard to be edgy...it just fails at it.\r\nOusama Game: The Animation brings us some of the most stupid characters as well as some of the poorly executed backstories all meshed together into this pile of crap. \r\nOur main protagonist Nobuaki Kanazawa voiced by Mamoru Miyano is the white knightsaviour of the class who participated in a previous Ousama Game and in this current Ousama Game, he gave off mixed signals that made him out to be the villain, we also have Natsuko Honda voiced by Yui Horie who is the TRUE villain of this anime in a ways as the first episode shows her as one of those kind and caring characters who might have feelings for Nobuaki, then she switches on a dime and becomes a psychotic nihilist survivalist only caring about herself. SHE for LA from the first episode...LA knew this was going to turn into a trainwreck. The rest of the characters be it from the previous Ousama Game or the current one, just doesn't matter but LA will talk about that later.\\n\\n\r\nPlot format-wise, Ousama Game takes a weird turn for some reason giving us IN DETAIL Nobuaki's previous Ousama Game and how that went down for almost half of the anime, there's several problems with this, one is that the current Ousama Game Nobuaki faces slims down and stupidly enough becomes into competition with the previous Ousama Game's backstory and the stupid thing is the backstory we essentially found out is one piece of information about the Ousama Game itself and since this is a backstory of a SURVIVAL game where only one can survive, we kinda know what's gonna happen anyways, it's a GIVEN.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Seven is probably one of the glimmer of hope in this dreg of an anime and even THEN it's not saying much, from the animation dipping CONSTANTLY (by that LA means the character designs keep shifting from detailed to shit quality on a dime) and the gore being censored but we obviously knows how the deaths occurs and it's still gives us black censors, if there was anything to schadenfreude and the censors ruined even that!. The animation is pathetic but it's Ousama Game's only saving grace, well that and...\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is probably when every character hams it up considering how stupid and EXTREME they take it, so expect lots of Mamoru Miyano overacting contending with Yui Horie's psychotic overacting. The voice acting is hammy as hell so if you like that sort of thing...you'll get some sense of schadenfreude there.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, LA is sadistic in this review, it's only because LA JUST DOESN'T CARE about any of the characters and their fates, their either all unlikable as fuck or their stupid as hell and yes this includes the main protagonist!!!. Do you know what the worst thing is about Ousama Game?, that would be the fact that watching this entire anime is utterly POINTLESS because of what the ending gave us, caring about any of these characters even Nobuaki and Natsuko becomes meaningless be it whatever beliefs of survival, they gave off the ending just doesn't fucking care. MEANINGLESS and POINTLESS. \\n\\n\r\nLA will say this as honestly as possible, Ousama Game is stupid and not even the soo good it's bad situation, Ousama Game is genuinely for LA at least, is one of the most poor botched executed, idiotic plot and character, edgelord anime from Fall 2017 and is LA's WORST ANIME FOR FALL 2017 and heck is a contender for the worst anime of 2017!\\n\\n\r\nOusama Game: The Animation is MEANINGLESS AND POINTLESS.",

This is an anime where you watch the body count go up, and you really don't care about anyone in it. You just watch it because you want to see how much worse it could get.\r\nStory (2): Pretty non-existent. People receive texts, and if they don't do things in the texts, they die. If they do things in the texts, they die.\r\nArt (2): It's really bad. I think only Inuyashiki has worse art this season, cause at least thisis 2D animation and there was a minute amount of effort put into it.\\n\\n\r\nSound (4): Bland and forgettable. Why is it a four then? Because the opening theme is REALLY good. Great opener, a good example of not judging a book by its cover.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2): There's almost no development and most of the characters are really unlikeable. You don't care if they die. Sometimes the anime tries to make certain ones sympathetic a minute or two before they die, but that's just really skeazy writing. Won't work for most people.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7): The enjoyment of this anime is just for those who like 'so good it's bad' anime. People who just can't tear their eyes away from a trainwreck. It's for those kind of people.",

Most animes just feed you and do all the work for you meanwhile in this one you have to work for it. *This review will have spoilers of both the anime and the manga*\r\nThere are probably many reasons why people dislike it but I think that one of the main reasons are that they have no idea what happened before the new ousama game. In the anime they have flashbacks of what happened in the \"old\" ousama game. The flashbacks are scenes from the manga so that people who haven't read the manga couldunderstand the anime. \\n\\n\r\n----spoilers----\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end of the manga you get to know who the ousama is and what it does. So I'll explain what the ousama is. The ousama is practically a \"virus\" looking for a master. It looks for it's master by making a game on whoever finds out the truth about ousama will be able to control ousama and use it as a weapon to conquer the world. That's just a brief explanation of what the ousama is so I'd suggest you to read the manga to understand. But when Nobuaki won the game, the ousama messaged him \"what's your order, master\" and then the manga ends.\\n\r\nAnd that's why I'm so confused of why there's a new ousama game. Nobuaki not only won the game. He became the master of the game. So why would the game continue? The manga also explains how the ousama game started and works and knowing that the anime makes a lot more sense.",

            "content": "King's Game, an anime about High School Kid's stuck in a \"survival\" game with no cohesive rules whatsoever and seemingly pointless actions that can lead to death.\r\nIf you, the reader, want to play an actual King's Game I highly recommend watching all 12 episodes in one day so you can suffer just as much if not worse than every individual character on screen does.\r\nThe story follows Kanazawa Nobuaki, the sole survivor of a previous King's Game who's personality goes no further than his haircut scene in Episode 9. He can never decide whether he wants to live or die, but continues to feel the needto act righteous as if he has any real answers when he never does.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finding out who/what the King was in Episode 6 I felt like jumping out a window like Kana due to how absurdly stupid the explanation was. I've never been taken out of show that quickly since the days when I watched School Day's and Gantz.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as I'm sure we're all well aware whenever watching Animes like this we need to have some kind of suspension of disbelief. However, when writing an anime like this you can't just assume that you can write whatever you want and the viewers will nod their heads and say \"Yes, I agree,\" but that's exactly what Kanazawa Nobuaki did. Also, yes, the Author of King's Game did indeed write himself into his own story. Shows how highly he thinks of himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest offender in my opinion outside of the explanation of who/what the King is was the ending. Now I'm not going to spoil it for anyone in event that you choose to watch this god awful shit show, but essential what it boils down to is the final survivors figuring something out and it meaning essentially nothing despite the huge implications it has. So the author of the story didn't even wanna follow his own rules. That should tell you how much he actually cared when writing the story, which if you haven't figured it out by now is zero percent.\\n\\n\r\nAvoid this anime at all cost. It is not worth a single person's time. I don't even care if you're a huge fan of dumpster fires like The Room, this is worse and isn't even worth a passing glance.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately a second season was greenlit and will be airing in the near future which is a shame since it'll be taking up the slot of something that could have been much better. Boycott the second season and avoid it at all cost I don't even want to consider a possible third season.",

It is like something out of Final Destination but more annoying and less interesting if that's possible. The premise isn't completely farfetched to begin with, later on is a different story that I can't discuss without giving spoilers, suffice it to say it isn't good (trust me). The Characters are all incomprehensibly stupid with no real emotional depth which doesn't leave you feeling anything when they are eventually killed. It spends more time trying to sexualize the characters rather than evoke any kind of feeling other than anger. \r\nLet'sstart with our protagonist Kanazawa Nobuaki, he is broken from the start, a pathetic loser (despite his good looks) who takes every opportunity to blame himself for everything bad that is happening. Sure he might be right however, he constantly beats himself repeatedly even to the point were it looks like he has finally forgiven himself somewhat, only to blame himself all over again. Anime has plenty of weak hero protagonist who end up overcoming their faults and become a likeable person, but Nobuaki never does such things. Even when knowing about his past as the story progresses you don't really feel anything for Nobuaki.\\n\\n\r\nHis counterpart, Natsuko Honda for her credit is a deplorable antagonist. Thorough the anime she does and says things that make you hate her and really plays up the part as the villain even to the point where she is self aware about it. She has faults of her own like a bs excuse to why she is the way she is but in a way I liked her more than Nobuaki just for the fact that she never whined like him 50 times an episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are all just cancer.... They are not memorable at all, especially when the story switches back and forth between the present and past members of the King's game. Other than Nobuaki's inner circle of friends (past and present game), you don't really care at all what happens to them.\\n\\n\r\nI could probably go on forever and nitpick every single thing that I hated about this anime but I don't have the time and if you would like to save your time just pass on this anime...",

            "content": "Okay, this anime has been getting tons of flack from all sides, and I get it. This is a thoroughly unpleasant, dreadfully grim anime. I get it. But that is the point.\r\nKing's Game is like if you combined Death Note and Saw, two pieces of media I love, so I can appreciate this show. If you don't like horror, stay far away from this show, as it has some of the gnarliest gore and horror I've ever seen in an anime. Even so, the core idea is a good one that is executed properly.\r\nLike Saw, the game in King's Game is one that tests justhow badly a person wants to live, or whether they would ever put themselves on the line to save somebody else, and, just like with Saw, it creates some powerful drama. It shows people pushed to the absolute limits. However, this idea has been botched when it doesn't have a clear set of rules. One of the best things about Death Note is that it laid out the rules and never broke them, and it's the same with King's Game.\\n\\n\r\nI would say that King's Game is a perfectly executed anime, minus the fact that there is absolutely no element of enjoyment to it. However, it kept me interested. When every episode ended, I just wanted to see the next one. Even so, I can't say I loved it, wouldn't want to see it again, and wouldn't really recommend it to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: King's Game does exactly what it wants to do, but isn't meant to be enjoyable. If that doesn't sound good to you, don't even try to watch it.",

It's rare to see such a dubious mix of bad characters and character development, art, and plot. The only reason I stuck around to see this show out is to read other viewers' funny comments.\r\nI couldn't care less about any of the characters. In fact, none of them seemed to be...human. Literally, nothing about any of these characters made sense. Their reactions to events are dreadful. The dialogue isterrible, nothing good about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is just as dreadful. The pacing is weird, there's not a lot of good explanation for what the \"King's Game\" actually is, there's a lot happening too fast, and there's a lot of worthless fan service scenes.\\n\\n\r\nBut wait, there's more! On top of all of that, the art is just as bad! Yes, the animation is like plastic, the character designs are bad. Not totally surprising, coming from this studio.\\n\\n\r\nAvoid this series like the plague if you know what's good for you. Or, if you're a masochist, dive right in!

            "content": "If Death Note's notebook became sentient and had an harlequin offspring made using in-vitro by 14 year old fanfiction writer with Battle Royale it would be this show.\r\nArt and sound are okay, the rest could be described very well by Mira in dreamfall - as a sub-shit, a shit taken by a shit.\r\nStory - pretty garbage survival game horror with major plot holes (per example if there is full surveillance on students why they are not being punished just for researching the game?). The issue I had was the way it is directed - it's confusing. I sometimes had really hard time saying if givenscene was a retospective or not and it was for many reasons - bland characters(we will get to that), no visual distinction, the info screens (ripped of BR ofcourse) seemed to show both former and latter game which was confusing me to extreme. The punishment showcase also is introduced in shitty way as it should not happen after Mitsuko, I'm sorry, meant Natsuko's kiss as it is to prove that the game is real and life of contestants is meaningless, friggen retrospective has that right, why they didn't swap the introduction with the retrospective's introduction at least?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - this is a nether of non developed characters. I don't even remember main protagonists name and I barely got through this. Let's call him Nanahara. No character, besides Natsuko has proper introduction, everyone is just friendly-nosey. What happens when truth about game is out? Still no development, instead whole class turns 180 into ruthless bullies while they should be terrified. Natsuko's 'change', which is one of main points of the story is terribly paced aswell, she looks more like she was possesed rather than she snapped. The episodes pass, we get to know more and more people, but most of them are either bland or sociopaths, I don't know why and I don't care. \\n\r\nI only cared about two characters, Kenta, which reminds me a lot of Sugimura from BR, and Natsuko which is a obvious Mitsuko ripoff (hence the name joke before).\\n\\n\r\nThere is violence and rape for the sake of them being there, the deaths which should be terrifying are ridiculous, even more so considering that everyone is so bland it's hard to care about anyone (besides Kenta maybe).\\n\r\nThere is likely no magic or shinigamis in this universe, the digital virus can't control the body without there being no chip or cpu in the body and I can't see sci-fi tag anywhere around the genres. There is a diffcence between leaving mystery and killing the suspension of disbelief by not giving viewer not a single clue about how to logically explain the existence of the game.\\n\\n\r\nI highly reccomend the writer watches Black Mirror in order to educate oneself about how to introduce technology to supernatural/horror stories, stops ripping of scenes and characters from classic Japanese movies, thinks a bit more about sequencing and showing what's at stake in the show and finally gives me back the 6hrs of my life which I had wasted on this 'masterpiece and are unlikely to get back.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I highly NOT reccomend this show to anyone. Unless you want to study how not to write a story, then go ahead, you could write a book off this show alone.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So I have never felt the need to really write a review but seeing all the people who have put it down I thought I would write something, Ill keep things short and do my best not to spoil the show.\r\nFirstly my thoughts are its ok don't expect it to be the next Mirai Nikki (The Future Diary) because it's not, that said tho it isn't a bad watch.\r\nNow let me break it down a little bit though I won't explain why because it would spoil the watchers experience the first 6 episodes with the exception of the 1st and 2nd give you a backgroundof the main characters experience with the kings game, for me i just wanted to know what will happen in the present day that feeling made these harder to watch because of my anticipation so the 3 episode rule if your like me might not work so well here! However from there onwards we see the present day onward and how that then plays out and the events that take place which in all is an ok watch. \\n\\n\r\nOK so i guess ill split into the categories. \\n\\n\r\nSo my rating system hmm, I follow MAL's so smaller than 5 is basically bad, anything above 5 means that i won't drop it as its middle ground. I do give 10s if I really enjoyed it but my personal list rating on my profile are just how i feel at the time and not a realistic analyst of the anime and what its actually worth after breaking down the elements.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/5.8\\n\\n\r\nOk so here ill talk about the story again ill be as spoiler free as possible no big reveals, so ok the King Game just like the sticks the king is absolute, tho without the sticks and in the form of text messages to your mobile oh and the king never changes :/ and if you don't do it you don't just get a load of mouthing off from your mates about you being fridget and you leave, instead u get punished, and u can't leave. so what you gonna do? Play? Well ok yer the king is like any other dares at times like a nice kiss or getting friendly with someone but this king is also messed up because the only other game iv seen with these extremes is the movie SAW (if you seen it you can relate, hey and if you watched them you may enjoy this!).\\n\\n\r\nSo what about the story? Well can I reference SAW again? Do you want to play a game? no? well too bad your playing. You watch as our main protagonists will struggle to get through these challenges and win the game or lose, and to be honest throughout the anime you don't really get a clear idea what the outcome will be. Though if i go into much more detail here id literally spoil it for anyone who wanted to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 (Its no Kimi no Na wa.)\\n\\n\r\nOk people this category is great its nearly 2018 and we are talking about artwork when its made by a company, if this was a small teams project or something made by people in a garage like windows was then yer i might be able to critique this however thats not the case its good it looks clean enough and detailed if it didn't in this day and age well it wouldn't be worth making as only die hard manga fans would watch it and the studio would not make any return.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nAgain 2017 nearly 2018 good actors suit the voice of the characters, intro and out are both suitable for the type of anime watched.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\\n\r\nHmmmmm! So there are a lot of characters throughout the anime and they all play their part well. However if what you want is information on the characters backgrounds well the main protagonist has his explained well however the other characters who are mains have little to no background one of them maybe should have had a bit more detail tho to be honest it isn't really necessary for the others and the fact its not there doesn't really effect the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nI liked it and gave it an 8 tho realistically i feel high 6 to 7 would be correct. I can see that it wouldn't appeal to a lot of people and has to follow in Mirai Nikki shadow not an easy path. However if your like me like i said before the beginning will be the hardest bit but you will enjoy it after and be happy you did what the episodes before so your not hella confused afterwards. Tho its a good watch its not episodic each episode follows on from the last ended, and you could even marathon it as it isn't boring to watch consecutively.\\n\\n\r\nEnding Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought about watching it well why not? Don't let all these other reviews get in your way its your decision you may like it or not. \\n\\n\r\nI hope if you made it to the end of this you found something that was helpful or encouraged you to watch this and the best of enjoyment as you go forward. I have done my best to be spoiler free for this reason and as this is very easy to spoil plot iv had to be very vague in areas.\\n\\n\r\nP.S Have a Happy New Year!\\n\\n",

            "content": "(Free of Major Spoilers)\r\nKing's Game has an interesting premise. As a person who's really into the \"killing game/play or die\" type anime, I honestly loved it. \r\nOk, first, I get that it isn't the most unique anime. The art isn't unique and we've seen similar anime before. But, the fact that the story isn't new doesn't make it a bad anime. It has its flaws but it's definitely not the worst thing I've watched.\r\nThe story was pretty good. After transferring schools, Nobuaki lives a relatively peaceful life...but soon gets involved in a second game of death. This anime makes it possible to have not readthe manga and still understand it. As a person who's read the manga, I wondered how they were going to explain the events of the first King's Game Nobuaki was involved in. The anime's use of flashbacks really helped show what happened in the manga. It wasn't complicated or tedious and it didn't feel like bad pacing at all. Also, in my opinion, they made an already good scene in the manga even better in the anime. And the anime's ending was better than the one given in the manga...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the art's not bad but I do admit that the characters make somewhat weird faces when they're terrified. Then again, that may have been intentional since they're, you know, terrified. The animation is this anime's biggest problem. It's a bit weird at times, especially when they show a character's face from afar. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters don't have the most complex personalities. You understand them most of the time but, if you get really into the anime, you just get mad at the ones who end up doing unreasonable or bad things. Nobuaki's a character you feel bad for and pity but you root for him because you want him to win after everything he's been through. Natsuko might have the most character development in this anime. She's nice to everyone and then...boom! Her personality does a total 180. But, trust me, there's a reason for her change in personality. As for the other characters, their personalities either correspond to a trope but add on to it or they just kinda lack in that area. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I absolutely love the music. The opening is one of the best ones for this anime season. The ending song is also really good. The dramatic music is timed well so there's no problems with the sounds at all.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nKing's Game the Animation obviously isn't the best anime in the world and it lacks in some areas. Despite this, it does good enough for it to be enjoyable in some way. Overall, it gets an 8. Hopefully, they make a season 2 because I really look forward to it.",

            "content": "Ousama Game The Animation is what happens when an idiot ball knocks down every character like bowling pins and scores a strike on the audience's intelligence.\r\nThe story is very poor. There are two primary stories, a story set in the past and one set in the present. The outcome of the past story is already apparent, so it's impossible to get into and the present day story isn't much better. Both follow the orders of the Ousama game, these orders usually ranging from remarkable simple only to be fumbled by character stupidity or so vague they're merely an excuse to butcher some more characters. There'svery little attempt to immerse you in the world of the show as there seems to be nothing outside of the cast going on and it makes everything feel particularly empty and uninteresting. There are also vast leaps in logic that are incredibly difficult to suspend disbelief for, even for a killing game. You simply have to put more effort into world building for these kinds of scenarios. Most of the actual horror comes in the show's theme of pointless cruelty, which would be an alright set up were it not for the characters themselves. Speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not good. In an anime where anyone could die at any time, you really need developed and interesting characters so it can hurt all the more when the show kills them off or they're put in peril. There are flashes of this, but usually only in characters who are about to be killed off or don't last very long. There's usually 3 primary characters the show builds on and develops at all and the rest of the cast tends to be fodder for the orders. Most characters also seem to have a remarkably flexible morality, as in one scene they can be scared teenagers trying to survive and in the next they are turning on one another and becoming psychopathic murdering rapists. And that's not hyperbole, there's multiple examples in the show of characters doing a 180. The protagonist is a particular point of contention, he seems more fitting for a shonen protagonist as despite his experiences, he is insistent upon hope and that everyone can survive when he knows for a fact that is impossible. There's no real attempt to explore this either, a shonen protagonist trapped in an unwinnable situation has more potential than this show gave it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is... alright. Nothing particularly great or bad. The music was good for raising suspense and suited the atmosphere, the voice acting was generally decent but nothing standout. It's so unremarkable it's not worth watching the show for.\\n\\n\r\nThe art ranges from decent to bad. A lot of the gore and the actual horrific moments tend to be blurred out or are so horrific they're hard to take seriously and come across as something more out of the Evil Dead than a horror show wanting to be taken seriously. Most of the character designs are very forgettable, it has the 'main character design' syndrome where the only characters that matter get slightly effort driven designs whilst everyone else is stuck with your usual classroom fodder look. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment for this show is rock bottom. I didn't enjoy it as a horror anime, as a story or as a piece of animated media. Honestly the only enjoyment you can get out of Ousama game is watching it for the 'so bad it's good' quality. But that's only present in a couple of episodes and you'll probably find yourself shouting at the screen rather than laughing at the ridiculous scenarios. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not a good show. This is not a good horror anime. Do not watch it unless you simply desire to see a train wreck in motion. This Ousama Game was over before it even started.",

            "content": "Enjoyment: How can I describe this experience? Imagine if Mirai Nikki and Guilty Crown had an attractive baby, but they didn't parent him well so he turned into an edgy little s*** like his parents.\r\nPlot: The plot to me can easily be compared to click-bait or a disappointing Amazon purchase. If you were given a general synopsis of the plot, it would come off as an intriguing survival anime. However, the plot doesn\u2019t follow the logical constructions it made for itself. SO A BUNCH OF KIDS FROM JUST ONE CLASS ARE DYING OUT AND NO POLICE FORCE NOTICES OR CARES? PARENTS AREN\u2019T WONDERING WHY THEIRKIDS AND KID\u2019S FRIENDS ARE DYING GREUSOMLY? I stamp BS on that. The next issue was that it tried to fit in 2 King's Games in 12 episodes. There was no balance in between flashback and present-day so for a while, you\u2019re asking \"Where are we now?\" \"Why was this brought up again?\" Also, because they tried to fit in two stories in that short airing time, it left a lot of plot holes that some try to answer with \u201cIt\u2019s fiction; it doesn\u2019t need logic.\u201d or \u201cWait till you find out who the King is\u2026\u201d And when the \u201cKing\u201d was finally revealed, a bunch of plot holes and impossibilities followed. A lot of the drama was coerced and either should've never happened at all, or easily could\u2019ve been avoided if a little logic was added into the mix.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is decent; if it wasn't, I wouldn't watch it (sorry, I'm picky that way). But, nothing's too special about it and I feel like the gory design does more harm to the show than good. The art is one of the main things that form the show's dark tone, and it comes off as a try-hard attempt for an edgy tone.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound doesn't stand out, and I don't exactly hate those kinds of soundtracks. I'd rather it be unnoticeable (hence BACKGROUND music) then it being distinctly terrible (If it's distinctly good, then kudos!!). The main issue I had; the opening. I don't hate the song, and Coldrain\u2019s cool...when used appropriately. Here, it just strengthened the try-hard attempt to get a certain tone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: It goes without saying that a 12-episode anime filled with 2 classrooms worth of teenagers was going to have s****y characters. A majority of the cast acts as fodder; the anime literally waits until they\u2019re about to die to give them a backstory or personality and expect us to care about someone we just met 5 minutes ago. Sadly, I like the fodder better. You have your average bland-looking main protagonist that all the main girls will still fall for simply cuz \u201che\u2019s kind\u201d. In this show, the men do most of the investigating and are usually the ones who\u2019re given king orders (usually sexual or violent orders). Other relevant men include the average high schoolers who pointlessly turn homicidal to increase the action. Most of the women were blubbering victims who look to the men (and sometimes other girls) to protect them. The ones who tried (and failed) to progress the plot were also inspired by male crushes or past sexual trauma. The most memorable girl, Natsuko, was branded a villain, she was hypocritical and was never all that menacing, she just flung used condoms and acted like your average high school b****.",

This should be thrilling, makes you want to connect the dots and make theories. No, this is... hit and miss... straight into trash can.\\n\\n\r\nMC is clearly struggling with PTSD.

I get that it's the perspective of the main character and the class but it would be way more interesting if realistic elements were included. I can't help but wonder these things every time I watch it. I feel like more mystery should be added around theKing's Game and how it works instead of wallowing in pity, despair and hopelessness. I'm just not as hyped up as I want to be. 5/10 for keeping me watching thus far. It's only going to get worse from here.",

Every character seems to lack all common sense, and seem incapable of changing there own way of thinking beliefs. They sometimes seem to cause more problems by trying to do good.

            "content": "By now, many people have likely heard of the show that went down as the greatest Trainwreck of 2017. It was a glorious failure that was simultaneously annoying and hilarious. The concept of a survival game is simple enough that a average writer could make a entertaining work from it but only a truly horrible writer could mess it. getting  flashbacks to my handshakers review Ousama game is what happens when you adapt the manga of a novel written by an author without a single shred of talent or slef awareness. He even named the mc after himself!\r\nOusama game is weird in that itadapts two manga at the same time. The sequel manga is the majority of the anime while the original manga is adapted in the form of long flashbacks. Trying to adapt two manga in only 12 episodes was bound to lead to jumbled narrative that feels like it has ADHD.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a survival game the story is naturally full of suspense to attact viewers. Seeing how the students will react to their given challenge is always fun and the stakes were always high. Getting orders from an anonymous person via phone with the promise of death is a solid premise.This would've been a fun show had it not been for the dogs shit characters \\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the characters cause dear God these are the worst written characters to Grace the face of the earth. Since this is character driven, these assholes are the plot. Everyone here is a utter dumbass who go out of their way to antagonize one another. From the original ousama game, there's this mysterious bitch who knows the secret behind the game but refuses to tell anyone. She just waits while the others die off while she acts like the smug piece of shit she is . There was also the asshole bully who ordered some guy to kill himself as a king's order and gets suprised when the boy actually dies. A girl kills herself when she loses a game, not knowing that the punishment was harmless. To top it all off, Some truly dumbass bitch gets to decide her own king's order and she orders herself to touch the king .\\n\\n\r\nThis was based off the extremely weak assumption that the king was definitely in her class. Unsurprisingly she dies like the fool she is. It takes a special breed of stupid to make characters like these. Aki Honda takes the Cake by perhaps being my most hated character in all of fiction. Even outranking bakugou from that melodramatic show mha. She introduced herself as being a kind hearted and upbeat girl who immediatly likes nobuwaki but goes from 0 to 100 as soon as ousama game starts. She immediately morphs into a cartoonishly evil alpha bitch who watches in delight as her classmates die. The students see her act like the vessel of Satan multiple times but some still trust her for some reason. Like her friend who saved her cause Aki was nice to her once. The heartless witch could've been dead but no. Some dumb bitch had to save  her.\\n\\n\r\nThen it's revealed the entire reason she acts like a bitch is so the other won't be hurt when she's dies. This is the dumbest fucking ass backwards logic I ever heard. She tortured everyone without remorse and caused them far more grief than her death would've caused. And the whole evil transformation happened at the snap of a finger without any build up. A+ acting skills for Aki but her performance ruined everything for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe reveal behind ousama game is what cementee this show as a train wreck. The whole thing was set up by a intelligent virus that forces the body to kill itself! Sound like the type of crap m night shamaylon would write. How on Earth a virus could force the human body to combust, send out text messages and other bs is beyond me. The plot twist is just too mind boggling stupid to take seriously. It wouldve been better off as a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nOusama game's only saving grace is the opening song, feed the fire by coldrain. Dear God was that song amazing!! An all English hardrock song that easily surpassed the entire show \\n\\n\r\n \" This is the end \\n\r\n    This is the end\\n\r\n    You're not along in this my friend.\"\\n\\n\r\nDespite everything, this is still a incredibly enjoyable anime due to how bad it is. Really hoping for a season 2.",

            "content": "I should start by saying that I decided to watch this anime due to its rating. I wanted to get a glimpse of what \"bad\" anime is like and... this was truly bad.\r\n>> SPOILERS BELOWout the window haha!\\n\\n\r\nThere were only two tasks that I enjoyed, namely the popularity contest and the finger sacrifice where they actually had to use their brains and the rules were set nicely. I think the show should have used a lot more of this type of games and less... foot fetish/rape? Anyway, the pacing is also terrible as the show goes between 1-B class and 2-1(?) class incidents whenever it pleases and leaves one story hanging for too long at times. Oh and need I mention how the show tries to get all scientific with network viruses invading human bodies? Here is another brilliant part:\\n\\n\r\nRia: \"move along, my father is a genius programmer\"\\n\\n\r\n*furiously taps keyboard as the screen goes from %100 to %0*\\n\r\n*it was a trap*\\n\\n\r\nRia: \"oh hey im burning alive so let me take off my clothes while calmly giving you my backstory\"\\n\\n\r\n*jumps off*\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3\\n\r\nThe backgrounds and the gore scenes were fine but the characters hardly felt human at times. Their eyes wouldn't move while walking, their mouths would stay wide open while listening to someone, it just felt like the animators didn't have enough time so they ignored the character's faces sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was meh but the voice acting is definitely the strongest part of Ousama Game. The voices didn't get the animation they deserved. (Mamoru Miyano did MC's voice!)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1\\n\r\nTerrible. They decided it would be a good idea to only build a side character 5 minutes before his/her death. This way, the viewer will always know a death is coming whenever a character is introduced. Genius! I think the show may have suffered because of its 12-episode length and could be told in more detail if it took its time. But given the terrible MC that showed 0 growth throughout the show, I doubt it. Nobuaki is supposed to be this *smart*, selfless guy that wants to save everyone but he just can't decide whether he is an asshole or a saint every second episode. Since the MC is completely unlikable and the side characters are killed off like flies, it's impossible to be invested in anyone in this show. I don't think it can get much worse than this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ousama Game was just terrible. Watch it if you want to appreciate the good stuff more.",

The \"commands\" and the deaths were just plain illogical and plain out stupid.\r\nThe animation went to crap just like the plot.\r\nInstead of a two coherent stories in order they try to force the \"first season\" as a flashback. Again terrible execution. So you get 2 casts of characters with little development and a rushed plotthat makes no sense. The only good thing was the opening was a pretty good song.

But I did enjoy it so I'll give enjoyment a (8)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:(6.5)\\n\r\nThe cliched crap gave this anime a bad name and also the fact that most of the characters just fucking died in like 3 episodes but none the less I enjoyed this series a bit as a savior was definitely the amazing op and ending and Natsuko's crazy ass...\\n\r\nI hope you will give this anime a chance even with the low rating and bashing on it as each person has their own opinion on this series and can be pretty judgemental but at least try the first 3 episodes that's what got me...",

            "content": "I normally avoid writing reviews but after seeing so many negative reviews i could not help myself, i think a lot of didnt get the deep meaning of this anime or didnt even finished it. (also this is my opinion its logical for many to disagree). \r\nThis anime is familiar to Danganronpa ,the main protagonist represents Hope and the main antagonist represents Despair. More than the first half episodes may get you bored , cause most otakus are already familiar with this kind of survival anime , i too wasnt really excited and thought that was just a normal boring survival anime. But , inthe last episodes ,especially in the LAST episode where the female antagonist started to say why she did all of that 'bad ' things , in that moment the whole anime became one of the best i've ever seen . The protagonist that gave Hope to everyone and was good as hell had all of his class in a delusion that together if they had Hope they could get out alive from this game , even though that was impossible. Some of them indeed agreed to work together and after some challenges more and more friends and classmates died , as a result more pain for all of them , some of them couldnt take it and they got mad , and the rest had to see them , their classmates and friends go nuts and do unbelievable things , they were trying to survive through all the pain even thought they couldnt .On the other hand the antagonist , that was represented as crazy as hell, and the bad guy, at the end revealed that she acted that way in order for the rest to not have to get through of this hell , sure she wasnt the best , but she didnt gave her classmates that Hope that Lie that they could all survive together, she wanted them out so they would not suffer as much , she took that role that heavy burden that most people can , so afterall she wasnt that 'bad'. (and yes i am taking into consideration that selfishness that she had to survive above all , i am not saying she is saint but she was misunderstood too) . Generally both sides werent a good choice , but that gets the viewer to think if Hope is always good. (And plus we all can see how people can turn after a pressure like that, like in every survivor anime)\\n\r\nThats why ,in my opinion, a lot misunderstood this anime.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nThe survival game genre in anime has created some nice gems over time, like Death Parade and Future Diary. However now I have arrived at Kings Game, which has no idea how a goddamn survival game works.\r\nStory (5/10)\r\nThe story concentrates on a group of classmates, who have each been given an order by the King. If they don't complete the order within 24 hours they will be punished.\r\nThat's pretty much the gist of the story, however this anime has no idea how to tell a story properly. Our MC Nobuaki Kanazawa is a new transfer student and tries to warn his current classabout the Kings game, but their having none of that and have a big dispute in the middle of a park at night. This lasts for almost 3 goddamn episodes, putting that aside though most of the first half concentrates on what happened at the previous school Nobu was at. \\n\r\nThis irritated me, because it cut time from the present events that were happening just so the anime can explain what happened in the previous Kings Game, this felt really unnecessary, because we already had a line up of characters ready to go and now the anime wants us to feel bad for some other characters who had already been killed by the game. What makes it even more annoying is that these characters were more appealing and interesting compared to the present group, who had only one or two somewhat tolerable characters (if you discount Nobu).\\n\r\nSo after the flashback episodes, the second half finally concentrates on the current group that we began with and I will admit the story did pick up a little as the final episodes approached and the numbers of classmates continued to dwindle.\\n\r\nBut after fighting against the impossible, the remaining characters at the end figure out that the only way to finish the game is to actually kill yourself and guess what, everybody actually dies. Although it was done in a pretty surprising way, which is then completely killed by the after credit scene trying to fool us into thinking a sequel could be possible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe most annoying and boring part of this show was it's characters, I'm only gonna mention the interesting ones because practically everyone were either assholes or cannon fodder for the king to kill.\\n\\n\r\nNobu is the MC and the only character you really feel for. Being the only survivor of the previous Kings Game he desperately tries during both games to save everyone and since everyone keeps dying from every angle, you feel sorry for the amount of effort this guy puts in to try and save his friends, hell even the new class treated him like sh*t at first and he still tried to save them. It's even more sad what happens to him in the end.\\n\r\nNatsuko Honda is the sister of Nobu's previous girlfriend Chiemi. At first she seems like that cute girl, whose always helpful and everyone likes her which really annoyed me from the get go. However she is also like Nobu, a previous survivor of a Kings Game and is actually a complete and total Bit*h, this made her character 100x more interesting. Her levels of evil were so high that no matter how much you hate her, you have to respect the evilness within her. Luckily she gets what she deserves in the end.\\n\r\nRia Iwamura is a character from Nobu's first game. Compared to everyone else playing the game, she was actually trying to figure a way out of it and despite her cold, isolated nature she was actually pretty badass and was the only other person aside from Nobu that you wanted to stick up for. Hell even the way she died was badass compared to everyone else.\\n\r\nRiona Matsumoto is sorta like Ria when it came to playing the game, she tried to figure out a way to end the game, but she felt like a bit of a hindrance and never really made things easy for Nobu, plus she and Nobu do develop feelings for each other which also felt kinda forced. Although I do feel pretty sorry for the girl as she ends up seeing her new love die right in front of her and ends up killing herself to stop the game ever happening again.\\n\r\nAll the other characters were like I said either assholes or just cannon fodder for the King to kill, so don't bother forming attachments to any of the other characters, except the ones I said.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow these types of anime tend to have pretty gory stuff and this anime is no different, however when it came to the artstyle of the deaths themselves they felt bland and pretty overexaggerated really. The looks on the characters faces whenever they were or were about to die looked really goofy, almost to the point where it was  as hilarious as Kakegurui's facial expressions and they were something else.\\n\r\nThe designs of the characters also looked bland as hell, I mean they looked like they were stolen from a bunch of different anime's and slightly changed. \\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nI will give credit to the OP, the music was alright and didn't make me skip it everytime I saw it, although the OP's animation sequence was pretty poor and looked like the bare minimal was put into it. The same can be said for ED, which wasn't as enjoyable to watch or listen too.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn't really memorable at all and seemed like the kinda stuff you'd usually experience in these kind of anime's.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nNow as a Horror this sucked pretty much, the deaths seemed bland and didn't have a lot of variety, it was mainly people being hung or being dismembered which is the usual way people are killed in these types of horrors. Although I will admit there are a couple of deaths that were pretty gruesome like some of the characters were killed with a Chainsaw which did make the current scene a lot more intense. I also liked the episode where the remaining characters had to form a circle and had to choose whether to break their fingers or not, this scene was pretty tense and the way it turned out was a lot more brutal than I was expecting.\\n\r\nUsually there is always an element of mystery in survival games, which is usually the key to surviving it. However this anime completely butchers it's mystery element and really pissed me off, at first the characters suspect it's actually one of them pulling a prank until it got way out of hand with most of them dead. Then they try to go to the location of where it all started, turns out the King is actually a parasitic virus within the internet that only affects certain people. This was ridiculous and completely stupid, making it look like it had copied When They Cry's plot twist and just made it more technical, which was absolutely bullsh*t.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime annoyed me, but also entertained me at the same time. Some parts had their ups while others had their downs. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a pretty mixed bag of annoyance and thrill, it starts off pretty damn annoying, but if you stick it out till the end you might some enjoyable moments. Until you watch the ending where literally everything was for nothing.",

            "content": "I think the reviews here that are mostly 1-2/10 are certainly on to something. This pathetic piece of work is disappointing and I be surprised to find someone who thinks its at least good from an objective point of view; the concept of a survival game will always demand high expectations from viewers. \r\nTo be honest, I'm not one to judge harshly on an anime, but at the very least there is a story line I can follow, characters whose actions I can judge logically, sound that isn't disturbing enough for me to want to turn it off, and visuals that are still properly animatedalbeit not the best. So I think its fair to say that each of those factors in Ousama Game deserve approximately a 4 for decency. \\n\\n\r\nEven with such mediocre scores, I managed to enjoy Ousama Game to the end by simply changing my thinking. While I don't think its a must-watch, its still possible to enjoy for some who are willing to change their mindset and try not to over-analyse too much. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story follows the MC (whose name I forgot, I'm writing this review weeks after finishing it actually), who won a previous King's Game and lost all of his former classmates and inevitably enters a new game with his new classmates. All while referring back to the former game when necessary and revealing all the important aspects of the previous games which will benefit the current one: which, to be honest, I thought they structured quite well. \\n\\n\r\nThe King's Game has rules, like all survival games and breaking such rules leads to death. Warning: The King's Game isn't designed to be won, which is obvious right at the start. People are forced to undertake almost or directly impossible and unfair orders. Most of which are sexual or gory which is what drops most of the plot. Oh, not to mention that the rules are ambiguous to confuse the characters on purpose.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, its pretty much a fun way to see how the characters react in such a situation. Obviously there is some progress, but with the pace it goes to quickly kill off everyone there's hardly any room for detective stuff. So yeah, the focus is mainly based on this mild horror and tragedy of these characters that they execute. \\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing to say about the art and sound because its not really important. (And also I don't remember, but the fact that its not bad enough for me to remember means something right?) So I'm gonna head straight to...\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nOK So I'm gonna say straight off the bat that the current classmates were not the right cast for the situation at hand. While they manage to make logical attempts to discover the true antagonist, but fail to change the direction of the plot.\\n\r\nWhile there is a fair share of psychotic and insane characters driven by fear of death, there are very few characters with actual common sense within these group of idiots that I actually like, believe it or not. \\n\\n\r\nBasically they either go insane, go along with the game and hope for the best, and there are a select few that don't mind dying and would rather do so than kill.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI managed to finish all 12 episodes without dropping it for a reason. Its not scary, thrilling, hardly a mystery and barely makes it as a comedy series (because of how bad it is); though I can somewhat indulge into the pity and helplessness of the characters current conditions. I honestly don't think its meant to be a good show at all and I can't believe the people who made this would think that either. However, I can see what kind of person the author who made this series is (besides a bad and unambitious writer). He probably meant to portray different views of certain types of people when met with adversity, and some manage to somewhat got to me emotionally. Would they throw their heart away and kill? Try their best to get everyone through the situation? Maybe he wanted to bring the sexual, gory, close friends and tragically heroic scenarios that he thought in his head to life? \\n\\n\r\nI mean I have some scenarios in my head too so I feel like I can relate with the author. If that person was my best friend then I wouldn't have to compare it to the best anime out there and enjoy it as it is (which I did). Not to say that this anime doesn't have the potential to be top 10 on MAL, but if the author stuck with his concept and gave depth/twists and importance to his characters so I can empathise, I would have managed to ignore the story completely and highly enjoy this - which is kinda more important than whether everyone else will. \\n\\n\r\nSome last words, I wouldn't say its worth watching at all, but its not impossible to enjoy either. You don't even have to force yourself into thinking its a comedic series... most of the time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I kept procrastinating my review of it hoping that FlashBack The Animation would be over with and we'd actually start watching the actual plot but that alone took half of the season.\r\nDon't get me wrong, Yes, these flashbacks are extremely annoying. However, the concept of the anime isn't actually bad. The manga must be much better than what this anime is all just because of the bad execution. \r\nThe MC is annoying (in the bad way), the execution of the events in the plot is so amateurish and the story and character development are very unbalanced. Honestly,the only thing that was done right was the gory deaths.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis review is as of episode 7, it's just because I don't think this anime will improve at any way and it's kind of already too late with half of the season wasted on flashbacks. I'll still continue watching this anime and If the season gets any better I'll update this review. If not, then don't waste your time and read the manga is you're interested about the plot.\\n\r\nJust finished the anime and it didn't get any better. The ending is somewhat good, but that doesn't change the fact that in overall it provided almost nothing.",

At the end of the day is an enjoyable anime, but I do not think it's that great. Thank you for reading.\\n",

            "content": "To begin, I just want to say that I am SO THANKFUL that I didn't read the reviews first before I started watching this anime...\r\nI've spent a few weeks now searching and searching for an anime that I could binge watch without getting bored. After discovering this anime, I can finally buy a new calendar and start marking off the days I spend looking for a good anime all over again. \r\nLot's of people down here in the review section think this anime is hot garbage, and I really cannot understand why. I mean I understand the points they are making, but this anime shoulddefinitely NOT be rated below an anime like \"Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku\"\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a king's game played by a bunch students of the same class. At first look, it's easy to say that this plot has a lot of potentials. this anime is a bit gory but only parts of it can be considered horror. The main character must be a hell of a chick magnet cuz honestly this guy gets girls to fall in love with him after a simple conversation. Some people might think thats poor writing but I personally am glad that it felt almost like a harem [but it's not so don't worry]. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nNothing really to say here. The art is standard and up to par, nothing really incredible or outstanding about it. It definitely is enjoyable and pleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI personally disliked the OP, however the Ending theme was decent. Nothing really went above or beyond in this area in terms of music or sounds join the duration of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was actually really well done. The backstory was very detailed and allowed viewers to put two and two together. There were definitely some parts left unknown and provided a sense of mystery, however, with a 12 episode anime, there really isn't room or time to be developing the backstory extremely well. Most if not all of the character had a little bit of development, and it's always nice to see what each character is like.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyed it a lot. Always liked watching this type of anime with a very interesting plot and a little bit of romance/hatred along the way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would definetly recommend this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI don't go into a anime trying to find all it's bad qualities or points, so this review might not be the best to trust if you are one of those people would enjoy taking apart animes and looking for it's good/bad points. However, as a casual watcher, there really wasn't much that jumped out at me as being badly done. So definetly go watch this anime and enjoy it. Cuz i told you to",

            "content": "Introducing: Flashback; The Animation!\r\nWell I just finished watching \"Ousama Game, The Animation\". I don't really know how I feel now that it's over, Just when you think the show can't get any more stupid, it somehow manages to do just that. \r\nThere are so many unanswered questions, What exactly is the King's game? Who is the king? Why was this show made? Why am I watching it? And why is there a second season coming out??\r\nThe show was structured very poorly. As I previously touched on, Flashbacks are a big part of this show, and i'm talking about 60% of the first half of theseries takes place in a flashback. They obviously had a lot of things that they wanted to cover, so why they didn't focus on the MC's first King's game only is beyond me, especially as there's going to be a season 2. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual plot itself isn't awful, I like the idea of it, however I feel it was poorly done in practice. It really did feel like an edgy Mirai Nikki clone more times than it should have.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very dull to look at and overall looked about 10 years older than it is, there were some truly awful looking effects and some glaring inaccuracies. For example. a character trips on a tree root as she is running forward, then suddenly there is a cliff edge and she falls down it, facing backwards...\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was nothing special either. The only thing of note is the Opening theme, which I did enjoy. Everything else was just forgettable, not terrible, but nothing to write home about either. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now for my biggest problem with this show; the characters. Never have I watched a show where I've thought that most, if not all the characters were complete morons. but Ousama game changed that. \\n\\n\r\nWe have our male lead, Nobuaki, he's about as cookie cutter as you can get, and he only seems to have two characteristics, he's either trying to save everybody, or he's crying, because he can't save everybody. The only character I really liked was the main female Antagonist, but I even began to find her insufferable as the episodes went on. \\n\\n\r\nThis next paragraph contains some minor spoilers, so skip if you want to stay unspoiled: \\n\\n\r\nMy issue with the characters, and by extension, the writing, is never more evident than in one particular scene. A friend of Nobuaki has been sentenced to death via suicide by midnight. so Nobuaki and a friend decide to stay with him all night to make sure he doesn't kill himself. The scene was actually quite good at first, with them playing music together and having a good time, It gets to midnight, and they're all relieved that he's still alive. He then basically goes \"right i'm off to get a drink\" and the others are perfectly fine with this, which already had me questioning the writing. and sure enough, Nobuaki's phone was 5 minutes off, it's not midnight yet! sure enough, the character in question was shortly found hanging. \\n\\n\r\nIt's scenes like this which make the show laughable. things seem to happen only because they're necessary to the plot, with no rhyme or reason. \\n\\n\r\nI have so many questions about the show that weren't answered in the first season of this show. and I have to ask myself, do I care enough to watch season 2 whenever that may start airing? \\n\\n\r\nThe answer is yes, surprisingly, I by no means thought that the show was good, but for some reason I couldn't bring myself to drop it, even after 6 episodes of flashbacks and stupidity. I often found myself laughing at the show for the wrong reasons, and I was genuinely curious to see if it could get any more ridiculous as the show progressed. And for that, I have to give it a couple of points.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI give Ousama game; the Animation a 3/10. Watch this show if you're looking for something to laugh at, or if you really, really like survival anime and haven't seen this yet. \\n\\n\r\nAlternatively, you can do what I'm about to go and do, and watch Mirai Nikki Instead.\\n\\n\\n",

Filled with a massive amount of plotholes, confusing logic and characters with the personality of a FUCKING rock. \r\nThe so-called \"plot\" of this anime is basically this: \r\nA new student enters your average Japanese high school and suddenly everyone gets a text, that they now have to enter the \"King's Game\" \r\nThe rules of the King's Game are as follows:\r\n1. All class members must participate.\r\n2. The order sent by King through email mustbe followed within 24 hours.\\n\r\n3. A punishment will be given to those who don't follow the order.\\n\r\n4. Quitting the King's Game halfway is forbidden.\\n\\n\r\nPretty straightforward, but for some reason, they decided that starting with part one of the manga was too hard, so it's shown as the flashback and part two in the present. \\n\r\nBut you know what, I'm fine with that... if it just weren't for the fucking brick characters.\\n\r\nKing's Game's characters are some of the most generic, stupid people ever, from the overused Tsundere trope to the same main character from every other harem shows.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has something though if you're into watching slow trainwrecks then watch something else that's actually good...\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 3\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Reading reviews all over, seems like I'm one of the only people who seemed to like this to a degree. However, that was also because it was quite comedic and because I believed that the story had a lot of potential early on with the mystery and it was interesting to watch each episode to see what the next task is, who will die and how etc...\r\nOne of the biggest problems this anime had is that they failed hardcore at being somewhat realistic. The logic for most episodes in this anime was completely lost on most of the characters who became hysterical, went overboard andcouldn't think for themselves at the site of trauma. This part becomes clear as early as several episodes into the anime. You get some mob mentality that makes little sense until eventually some of the characters start to think for themselves. Better late than never?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime tried to stuff 2 different Kings' games into a mere 12 episodes. As a result, most of the characters didn't undergo much development and you're left caring about a few of them at best. The switching between the 2 stories also make things confusing and makes you care even less about the current game. If the anime was 2 cour, they could've fleshed out the characters while discussing the previous game and given a lot of information as to their background and motivations. That would've went a long way into making this a more reasonable anime imo.\\n\\n\r\nThe story would've also improved massively, because as it stands, the pacing felt extremely fast past the first couple of episodes, especially when you have a huge cast and you've barely had a chance to introduce them all and make us actually care! The art and animation are nothing to write home about, pretty much average overall as well as the sound. There are a lot of bloody scenes, though there's a lot of censoring as well so anyone who hates blood, avoid this anime like the plague. The MC for the anime is ok overall, but seems to have issues explaining himself and doesn't have a backbone at times. He's one of those \"noble\" MCs if you get my drift.\\n\\n\r\nThe secret to enjoying this anime is simple: \\n\r\n1) Don't try to make sense of how some characters are acting (no logic)\\n\r\n2) Be prepared to get confused at everything\\n\r\n3) Be prepared for some pervy scenes (this King...)\\n\r\n4) Realize that everyone has a fair chance of being killed\\n\r\n5) Take interest in how things progress despite points 1-3\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention there is a potential second season as well? Yep.",

The show is about a class of kids who are sent text messages telling them what to do. If they don't do this then they get punished, this can include something menial, to a gruesome death of the person who didn't follow the rules. So the characters in the show is some of the worst I've ever seen. They all had basically the same mental progress, getting the text, not believing it, punishment happening, realize that its real, not want to die, do something hasty. Its very formulaic andthe characters are very very stupid in what they should do. The art is bad in this show as is it's animation. I'm upset at this show because of its interesting concept. The abysmal writing and characters ruin that completely. I give this show a 2 out of 10. I can't recommend this to anyone. This has been your spoiler free but not really review on Osama Game.",

Basically half of the show is the MC remembering crap that happened to him the previous time he was involved with the King's Game. The other half was some random people dying because they were being stupid or something along those lines. The show also tried to make you feel bad about the deaths for some reason? Like, it didn't give any reason to be upset, just that the people dying were nice to or were friendsof the MC. All of the deaths were way over the top, too. I guess people who are into that kind of stuff might like this show, but only for that because there was literally zero plot. Trust me, as someone who sat through this show, you'd just be wasting your time watching this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS FURTHER DOWN, LIKE, THE BIG KIND.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI warned you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBasically at the end you find out the whole first season was there for no reason, all of the characters died thinking that it would stop the game but oh boy, after-credits scene begs to differ.

            "content": "*Contains light spoilers*\r\nEDIT after 12th ep: Rating reduced from 5 to 1\r\nNow the anime sounded good from the synopsis and I had a lot of time on my hands so I gave it a go.\r\nI wish I hadn't.\r\nI have two major problems with this anime. And I mean it when I say MAJOR. First, the characters. Aside from the MC, who himself has one of the worst developments I have ever seen in an anime, there are no major characters. The anime desperately demands one or two sidekicks and the only ones we hope will be able to fulfill the job, after hearing about theMC's story and sympathizing with him, die in two episodes. All other characters are dumb, stupid, and their actions make no sense at all like why would they start beating the MC in the first few eps? Doesn't make any sense. This was all from the \"present-day\". The characters of the past are somewhat better. Out of the about 30 students from each class, only about 3-4 get a considerable screentime. The whole anime I kept wondering,\"WHERE THE HECK ARE THEIR PARENTS?!\" or why the heck is not police involved in this? as if the government thinks \"Oh students of an entire class have started to drop like flies and this incident has happened many times in the past, its no big deal, just a game\". The response from the government and the police should've been more like in The Parasyte. But the anime makes it feels like the students are stranded on a different planet or something. Its not like this a really complex problem to solve and no one knows the reason behind the text messages, hell a mere 15 year old girl was able to give a theory behind the mysterious deaths that remains to be the only theory closest to the truth so far.\\n\r\nMy second major problem was execution and composition. The anime seemed like jumbled thoughts with no rhythm or anything, jumping from the past to the present and vice versa too often that I wasn't able to enjoy either of them. Moreover, the past that we see is actually the MC telling his story to his present friends, like what the heck? They are constantly getting orders and are standing on the edge of death and you are telling them how your previous classmates died? The past should've been in flashbacks or dreams. That would've been a lot better.\\n\r\nNow the colossal problem with the anime is its explanation. Do you know how silly the magician shows sound when you know the tricks behind them? Well when they give us an explanation for the deaths, that is as absurd as it is outrageously stupid. Its like the writers themselves didn't know how to explain the deaths and asked a 10-year old for help. The explanation was so bad that I can't even brush it under the carpet as \"Anime Logic\". \\n\r\nAnother problem with it was that it was way predictable. I could call the deaths of people episodes before they happened. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNote: This was my first review. Sorry if I couldn't get my thoughts through.",

In the series it was explained that Ousama somehow is a VIRUS which can hypnotize human's cell.\\n\\n\r\nI will explain to you some reason to keep myself still following the show.\\n\r\n1.Something like this is a new stuff in anime, i never seen any anime which have similarity with ousama. I mean for its \"Order from a KING\" and thats why you must try to watch it\\n\\n\r\n2.The Puzzles. Oh man i really like an anime with puzzle like this one. the main puzzle is how to end ousama game. and some sideline's puzzle likes who is ousama? why ousama's game happen? what is the piece words they got after someone died? if its a virus, whos making those stupid thing? and how this show will be ended.\\n\\n\r\nTBH i dont like the art. its not good enough. but i love the story so much!\\n\\n\r\nHmmm for some reason i think the studios should give this show for 2 season or maybe gives 25 episodes for just 1 season. For first 10 episodes maybe they can give a story for every character so when it times a character come to die, we can feel something like... yeah im sure you know it\\n\\n\r\nLast thing i want to say : \"Dont judge a book by its cover and dont judge anime by its rating\"",

            "content": "This show is bad but not completely awful. At the very least it provides some laughs, but most of the time it's just boring. There is pretty much no reason to watch this other than to judge for yourself how bad it is.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nHalf of the story is told in flashbacks, during the last King's Game the MC experienced, and the other half is told in the present, during the current King's Game. The show tells you pretty early on what happened in the past so there's practically no tension during the flashback segments since you know what's going to happen. Figuring out what theKing's Game is is not satisfying because the answer is pretty stupid. The rest of the story is just an exercise in debauchery and gore, building up to an unsatisfying climax.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art has two things going for it: attractive anime girls that would've been waifus in a better show, and gory deaths that make you cringe. There is definitely some entertainment value in watching these people die gruesome deaths, but not enough to make the show worth watching. It'd be more worth it to watch a compilation video on YouTube or something, if there is one.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here, nothing particularly excellent or terrible about the soundtrack or the voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show likes to throw in new characters you're supposed to care about each episode, only to watch them die by the end of the same episode. Each character is somehow the MC's best friend/love interest by default, so they all have some kind of crazy loyalty to him for no reason at all. Suffice it to say that the relationships are extremely underdeveloped and the characters are uninteresting. They might as well skip straight to the death scenes of everyone to get it over with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI was expecting something truly terrible, something to hate with all my guts.

            "content": "After binging the series at 12am, I'm genuinely speechless about this anime in the sense that its hard to say how it made me feel. The animation itself is much like an over-the-top Higurashi, along with the same sort of sound. The actual events, however are more like Akame ga Kill. Characters randomly die because they have to, saving the most important for last because plot. The most realistic characters are the sides, the entire main cast feels too exaggerated to the point where it got mildly tedious.\r\nPutting the bad parts aside though, it was very immersive and even thought the main character is obviouslyright, I could always associate with the others. I never really knew what I'd do if put into the scenario and that scares me. I feel hungry but can't eat, and need to talk to someone but I want to be alone. This series has honestly made me so confused with the questions that it asks and I couldn't recommend it more for those who are dissapointed with most horror anime, like myself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nA lot of other reviews critique the anime on so many things that are very realistic for the scenario they're in. One review says this is more for the fans of realism than escapism and I completely agree. This isn't supposed to be a story to take you away from your world, it is a story that asks where you stand in it. In this way, it is like Mirai Nikki; an anime that tells a great tale but you wouldn't know what to do if it was real. Mirai Nikki did it better though, so don't have your hopes too high watching this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, don't expect too much. It had me shaking silent for hours just from thoughts but that's just me. This is definitely the type of anime I'd recommend watching all at once but I doubt it makes much difference story-wise. Go watch it yourself.\\n",

            "content": "Hey you all! As you guys may tell this is my first time writing a review on this website but hey I'm gonna keep it short and easy for you all.\r\nAlthough this anime called the King's Game is not a usual type of anime where things just go the way they're supposed to, and due to that it makes it so much special than others although the story does seem a bit mediocre at its finest but it has that theme that you can relate you know. Unlike other anime where you know that things won't always be okay, things wont always end the wayyou want it to! This anime kinda opened my eyes to reality that I've kinda left alone due to things like College and etc. Life is rough, and of course unpredictable anything can happen at any moment without you realizing you've lost it all and when it seems you've lost all hope you have to know that there's responsibility you have to live for the people that died that meant something to you. This anime did show how betrayal will be done if your life is on the line and how your past defines your present and how your future depends on your today. Simply put it that way you all know how New York is like... people rushing, running for something well let me tell you for what. NOTHING  but simple repetition of everyday but the thing we're doing special things its just we don't give in the recognition it deserves. BUT HEYYYY if you're into those happy every after and non realistic but overused plots you shouldn't watch this but if you're okay with cruel reality its for sure recommended I'll give this a 8/10  have a good day/night y'all stay awesome.",

(First saw this almost a year back, so some things not all accurate.)\r\nThe main character already played this game, we get some of his flashback story and the anime try's\r\nto flesh it together with the present story. (let me talk about his backstory first) In the backstory he let his bro (not actual brother) f**k his girl (was it his girlfriend I think so, or crush?) well he did that because if you don't complete the task you were givenyou would die by some being...... virus ( it is speculated it some virus from a computer). Well his whole class got killed and then were going to present. In present time his class got the messages and all went to a park, survivor is trying to avoid and stop the game at start. Well when one person is killed and everyone bats**t freaks out.\\n\r\nOne person changes personality to get the anime better. There is some romance I guess and a lot of killing and then some game to a mountain (as a race, last place dead btw) where they have to go to for reasons I don't remember stop the game or save point? Some girl cuts body parts and at the end don't really care or remember who survived or if all dead. One more fact the game has been going since I think hundreds of years or longer. Also at the end of the anime the game will always continue.\\n\\n\r\nStory-5  (all over the place)\\n\r\nArt-5  (Could be higher than what I put?)\\n\r\nSound-5  (don't remember)\\n\r\nCharacter-5  (meh)\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8  ( just like these sorta type animes....guilty pleasure)\\n\r\nOverall-5 (could be higher......had it as 8.....)\\n",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER-THIS REVIEW IS KINDA LONG SO...\r\nOusama Game(King's Game) THE ANIMATION\r\nis about people who act stupid and die,In a remarkably bad way.Here is what grinds my gears about this show's execution, it is not really engaging at all if everyone is going to die if there is not any goal at all. There is a goal in this show. The main character, Nobuaki and his classmates wants to figure out who the \"king\" is(spoilers if you actually give a crap-THEY DON'T.) \r\nBut the characters really don't anything at all to live up to it. At least in the Final Destination franchise, they actually did things andhad somewhat relief even if the twists for every movie turned out that they didn't do jack squat. but this is a murderer we are talking about, a natural being, this is some sadistic person who kills high school kids for the hell of it.Speaking of which, the actual way these kids die makes no sense. It turns out that when someone doesn't follows orders, there is a bacteria that can send messages to the brain and cause it to do some bullshit. Either it be spontaneously explode or hang themselves? It is just so stupid that it is insulting to the human mind. Adults don't exist in this world because they don't report this to the police or the detective agency or anything to get to the bottom of it.The main character, Nobuaki, despite being a part of this game before, acts like a RETARD. The show also had the bright idea of implementing  Nobuaki's previous experiences with a whole different class in the middle of the present events going on right now and it is so damn sloppy It switches back and forth with his past and present experiences,sometimes it happens mid episode and don't even know what I'm watching.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is violent but has no heart to it. There is one episode that got to me where the kids start breaking each other's bones because lol and that kinda got to me because I am not a fan breaking bones, but this one kid decides to give him a haircut,to shoehorn his character development in at the wrong time.Also, why not get my hands on some morphine or ask for it to be removed by a doctor or something. These people, man.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is even sloppier. I feel like Studio Deen's office  power-point slide animation would still look better than this crap. The character designs are so freaking ugly OMFG. Either if the characters are regular or making goofy faces.They all have the same faces, there is a boy who dresses like a girl, and i'm all for equality ,but it is so jarring.The blood in this show didn't even look real which is the case for a live action b-movie, but this is animated so what the hell?There is a lot of blood and is splashes everywhere,but the blood color is so muted that it looks like barbecue sauce.One girl jumps out the window and instead of hitting the ground, she exploded  like she was a bottle of barbecue sauce.It's kinda impressive how they make an anime have the same transgressions that live action b horror movies.Oh and don't you worry about the background design because it makes less sense.For example, Everytime Nobuaki is talking on the phone, it's on his homepage and not the caller ID for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is forgettable but one thing that as interesting  is the opening, because of how stupid (in a fun way it is) It was made by the same band who made that earrape of an opening to \u201cRainbow\u201d and it is just as loud. I don't wanna say it's bad because there is a killer guitar and the singer says \u201cthis is the end\u201d like twelve times.The ending is actually really good though.the singer had a nice voice and the music was sick,but unfortunately it gets way less attention than it deserves because of the crap it's stuck with.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to break my head on a shelf getting used to these people, the show always tries to have these moments of character but always minutes or seconds before they die Which sucks because it really does shoot itself in the foot when it comes to intriguing character death.Long story short. The actual development of these people feel so synthetic and rushed that it feels like everyone is an freaking idiot. Some of the characters scream every five seconds,Nobuaki included, while others just act too stupid to do anything smart.In the end, the deaths was the main reason I was still in it, but the deaths are soooo over the top that this becomes ironically funny.Also, I really hate using this word,but that one girl with all that EDGE was just the icing on the cake because of how comical she is. She makes the rapeist faces ever and just loves to get it on with anything in her vicinity. When the show actually gives her development, it makes her worse off since the actual character change gave me whiplash harder than the Coney Island Cyclone.Its just straight up bad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAt least in bad shows like Eiken and Hand Shakers, there were some redeeming qualities like the music or the animation, but in this show,the only thing good about it was the opening and ending, and it is so not worth watching what's between them. There are some gruesome moments but there is no investment and that makes this show a literal hair off from stupid \"gore\"nos. It even has the super fake blood that is soooo dark it looks like barbecue sauce and it doesn't help for it to splash literally everywhere. The deaths make no sense either, these people just explode or fall apart like broken robots.HOW AM I NOT SUPPOSED TO FIND THAT FUNNY?\\n\\n\r\nOverall-4\\n\r\nKillme....\\n",

In this one, they decided to make all the characters unbelievably stupid. They threw in more evil people than there should be on average as well. I don't know if they had not enough of a budget like other anime projects, but for the most part pedestrians and minor characters were nonexistent. Where were the police? Did the main character have no family? If you want even just a little satisfaction from a character's romance, think again. That won't happen. Also, it's better for ashow to be relatable. You don't want it too be too unrealistic, but that's what this show did. It's more unrealistic than a guy with a monster girl harem imo. They should have only made the death game the unrealistic part, but no they decided to have so many nutjobs and one girl seemed to remain calm and talk while her entire body in engulfed in flames for a minute. That's too unbelievable for me. In conclusion, this anime is about as satisfying as just watching some nobody kill around 30 nobodies and done. That's it. Story: 1. Art: 7. Sound: 7. I like coldrain's song. Character: 1. Enjoyment: 2. Overall: 3 I guess.",

            "content": "\"If you don't know how to swim, stay at the shallow end of the pool.\"\r\n-Me\r\nMan, I had to recover my account just to write this review, because I can't believe the collective hate this anime is getting.  I can only imagine the primary people writing reviews for this anime must be the same personality types that grew up on Disney fairy tales and cotton candy dreams where, \"The hero rides off into the sunset with the princess,\" or \"You will always triumph in the end as long as you believe in the power of love and justice,\" and \"Tears are phoenix downs,\" or someother bullcrap like that.  I truly find it unbelievable people can suspend their disbelief for a man who exercises like a regular human yet can destroy planet-busting aliens in a single punch, yet trash talk anime like this and School Days because they do something other than their Walgreens-perfect expectations predict.\\n\\n\r\nLet Uncle Mist87 teach you a lesson, kiddies, and welcome you to the world of horror, where nightmares and phantasms rule, the hero doesn't ride off into the sunset, things go downhill quicker than a rock shot from a rocket launcher down a mountain, and your cotton candy is nothing but an additive to soothe your junkie craving so the sugar industry can keep making mountains of dough.  For I wasn't a kid who grew up on Disney dreams, but Goosebumps nightmares, and for that I can appreciate this murder-fest in all its horrific glory.  Those with weak stomachs need not read further or apply.  Your bag of gummy snacks and your link into the Matrix are in another castle.  \\n\\n\r\nStory:  8\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself isn't that original:  A transfer who wants nothing to do with anyone arrives at another school, then he gets a text from \"the King\" telling him he has to do something with another student or get punished.  Other students also soon get texted, and soon learn not following the King's orders within 24 hours or breaking his rules equals death.  The concept seems simple enough, but what happens when an order requires you to betray someone you care about, or to choose which of your classmates will die?  This added great psychological depth to the story, especially when seeing the cast's sanity degrade based on the choices they have to make.  \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of King's Game is probably the greatest thing I appreciated about the story.  In a sense, this 12 episode anime fit two stories in one, for as the new class is discovering what to do during their first King's Game, the story flashbacks into the events of another King's Game, making the action never let up even when things in the current game are slowly progressing.  This presented an interesting answer to pacing I've never seen before (We can't all be perfectly paced like Code Geass or break everything into small \"What Ifs\" like Higurashi, now can we?), and something that would solve pacing issues in other anime also.  It's the reverse of what you usually see, where flashbacks are used to slow down the action to give the audience a breather.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 7:\\n\\n\r\nI'm no art aficionado, so all I can say is the art looked decent to me.  It wasn't as smooth as it should have been most times, but it failed to diminish my enjoyment of the series.  If I was to give a reason why I didn't rank the art higher, it would be the lack of intricate details in the blood and gore when the characters die their horrible, horrible deaths when losing in the King's Game.  For so many characters dying such miserable deaths, you'd think they'd put more detail in the gore.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 9:\\n\\n\r\nI had no issue with sound quality.  The music got creepy when needed, and could play to the emotion of character deaths when necessary (when a character you cared about died).  I'm also a huge rock fan, so the opening soundtrack along with the visuals got me amped, and is something rare in this era of classical, operatic music and rap beats.  I seriously would play the opening two to three times before I watched each episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6:\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, when you have an anime with such a large cast yet only 12 episodes to tell their tale, characterization is going to be the most lacking element.  Most of the cast are nothing more than fodder for the King's Game, while we're given peeks into the backstories of the more interesting characters, but not much else.  And, of course, as a once top-charting rapper once said, \"Where are de parents at?!\"  I mean, is it implied the cast lives in a boarding school, or do the parents not care everyone in their son/daughter's class is dropping like flies after a Raid bombing? 24 episodes would have fit the large cast better, and I'm hoping other anime will learn this lesson in the future:  If you have a lot of frickin characters, go big or go home.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9... Overall 7\\n\\n\r\nAs a big fan of horror anime (of anything horror really), I look out for new entries in the genre like a hungry dog waiting for its next meal.  The two-stories-in-one, never-relaxing-pace of this anime was a breath of fresh air between the Shonen I've been peaking at.  Ousama Game is Corpse Party with a heart, a bloody, pulsating, gashed heart that still has plenty of life left in it, and I'm hoping the next season provides more answers than this season provided... which is why, even though I was thoroughly pleased watching King's Game, I can only give it an Overall of 7.  Limited world building, so many characters left to waste, and the mystery behind the game left in the dark, Ousama Game tried to have more soul than Corpse Party, laid the crumbs to reach Higurashi, but couldn't make it with what we were given this season.  If the next season doesn't focus more of the mystery behind the game and give us a greater focus on characterization (A little mental snippet of each character, not hinting to their death as to become predictable, would help), this series will have a very thin bridge to support itself.  Until then, for any true horror anime fans looking for good shout-out to the genre, I give this anime a solid recommendation.  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "SPOILERS. \r\nA proper title for this anime is \"King's game the Animation: What would happen if Corpse Party have 12 episodes?\" Because that's how I truly felt about this anime after thinking about it. This is the kind of anime that I hate the most since I gave it the benefit of the doubt that it will be an ok anime that has a balance of good and bad merits to it. But in the end I realize how awful this anime is and asked myself why I didn't drop it. In the end, the bad outweighs the good by a landslide.\r\nThe good: I sortof like the ending (not really) because I kinda like the status of the winner of the kings game that being the one you'd least expect to win. Everything else is bad.\\n\\n\r\nStory 2: It's bad. The thing is the story is so unengaging that I can only remember some bits of it. My main issue with the story however is the way they \"tried\" to tell 2 different stories AT THE SAME TIME (I wish I was making this shit up but look at the adaptation part of this anime) so it's no surprise I can't enjoy this anime because I constantly have to remind myself that they are telling two (2) stories at the same time and I have to figure out if they are telling the story of part 1 or 2. Having 20 to 30 characters to keep up is already difficult, multiplying that twice is just insane. The sad part is the story could've work since it's a basic follow the order or die type of story.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound 3: although I'm not good at giving critism at this area I will say that the style looks older than the one's that aired in 2017 and since this is a \"horror\" anime it's usually dark most of the time. The soundtrack as whole is forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3: out of 60+ characters I only kinda like one of them. And oddly enough it's Rionna mainly because she's a side character and it took me by surprise that SPOILERS she wins at the end. Idk she just reminded me of a different anime character. The other characters however: the main guy is the typical \"I survived a death game and I have to enter again and try and warn others while being unconvincing and creepy.\" Then their's the yandere wannabe bitch voice by yui horie. The blue haired girl that decided to fuck her lover's bestfriend. The 2 annoying best friend of the lead character that believes in everything the protagonists says that dies. And a LOT more that I forgot and are pointless to search for.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3: the only enjoyment I had was the corpse party like death that's way over the top that it becomes funny rather than being scary. Character decisions that's so stupid you can make a drinking game out of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2: I had my hopes for this anime since the description seems decent however my hopes took a huge dive as the series goes on. You have to keep your attention up just to get a gasp of what's happening on screen, however because I dislike the main characters so much keeping my attention on screen was a task on it's own and I hate it when watching anime feels like becoming a task just keep up with the story.\\n\\n\r\nWill I recommend it? It's your time, knock yourself out. But there are far more better anime with the same genre done 100 times better.",

The only likable person is the main character and even that's a stretch , characters make dumb decisions throughout this entire show it's almost as if this game is taking place with an elementary school class, The deaths were alright at best and the source ofthe king was so confusing by the end of the show that I just completely ignored where he came from or what he even is. Then they throw in these love plots that kinda work and kinda don't because there's little to no build up in them. On top of all this the main antagonist gave us very little backstory on them and just didn't really fit the part they were going for. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTHIS SHOW IS BETTER OFF NOT WATCHED",

At least its not afraid to go to that place and go over the top with it. There are just so few good horror and dark newer animes that we have to take what we can get and this is one of those shows so don't let the haters take away your enjoyment for what it is: mindless edgy fun that's so bad its good.\\n",

The only thing that kept me watching it was a desire to know what the king's game was and if they ever figured out a way to beat it. The explanation ends up being ridiculous and the secret of how to end the game gets revealed very poorly. They could have made the ending one of noble sacrifice but instead its just wanton killing and death. Actually pretty much all of the twists in this series are poorly delivered and sometimes not even fully explained. I'm honestly sorry i watchedit instead of watching 12 episodes of something else.\\n\r\nCharacters are also very important to me in anime and there is only about 1 likeable character in this whole series and even he gets ridiculous in his self sacrifice BS. This is another series where pretty much everyone ends up dying but your never given long enough to get to know anyone to really care that they died.\\n\r\nOverall I think the story had a lot of potential but was very poorly delivered both in content and in poor dialogue between characters.",

            "content": "Quickly, think about some good horror anime! The first ones that come to your mind are probably Corpse Party, Another or Higurashi. This anime had clearly the opportunity to be on the same level as the above ones. Did Ousama Game manage to do it?  \r\nNo, it definitely didn't. Was it at least a decent watch? No, not even that. But let's give it a closer look what made this anime fail so miserably. \r\nStory: An entire high school class of 32 people receive a message on their cellphones from a person known only as the \"King.\" The messages contain orders that the studentsmust obey, or they get the punishment of death. With their lives on the line, the students soon find out that the orders are getting more and more extreme as time goes on. But one student, Nobuaki Kanazawa, is determined to put a stop to the murderous King's Game, once and for all. That's the setup for this show, but beyond that, there is almost no story, and for sure none that makes sense. Unrealistic and stupid decisions are the only thing the characters are capable of doing. Really predictable and simple, the story isn't able to surprise the viewer in any good manner.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This series has basically two important characters throughout it's run. Everybody else gets built up for 2-3 episodes and then blindly thrown away. The rest of the cast are there just for gruesome kills and a high body count. Nobuaki is the MC who can just cry and say he will change anything. Nevertheless, he is the hope of a lot of the students. Natsuko Honda is the main antagonist and pretty much the other side of Nobuaki, reflecting his hope as a symbol of despair. Those two have a common secret that is obviously the only reason exactly those two are important and to keep focus on, and no one else. We still have some (already dead) side characters that only play a role in the uninteresting mind of Nobuaki.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound: The animation and art was atrocious. This is the era of digital anime. Everything is created by computers nowadays. Pen and paper have been replaced with  Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop and yet\u2026 they still made a show that could have passed as an extremely low budget show in the 90s. Some of the scenes were animated so poorly, you could easily harken back to the days where you could tell that a single animation cell was being dragged across the lens of a camera. Some scenes even looked like they were missing a few key frames as everything was even more jittery than normal.The sound is in no way good either, more like an action anime than horror. It felt like the studio just wanted to go with the \"mainstream\", which clearly was the wrong step here. At least, some of the soundtracks are by themself good enough to be entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Here, I really have to give it at least some credit. Story and characters don't do it, we're rather \"entertained\" by this shows weaknesses. Sometimes, you even laugh about how bad the anime is, but then you realise they tried to make it good. The games are creative and entertaining too, which is at least a bit diversified. The deaths are gruesome, over the top and clearly stupid. And that's what makes you love those scenes soooo much. At one point, a guys head is exploded. At another point, a girl talks over 2 minutes calmly while being burned to death by flames. It is unrealistic, yes, but that's made clear from the very beginning. And that's again even funny. Still, bad story and even worse characters drag the enjoyment down, but sometimes being entertained by how bad this anime is is entertaining as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Don't watch it. That is my final statement. I could've talked a lot more about the bad things in this anime, but have said pretty much everything good. If you aren't a hardcore horror fan or just want to watch laughable stupid episodes, skip this anime. And if you want to watch a good horror anime, get the examples I mentioned at the beginning of this text.\\n",

I actually almost threw up from watching this show; not because of the poorly done gore but because of how jarring the story pacing was and how dumb the characters were. The only reason I gave it a 2 is because the idea behind the story isn't that bad. I actually read the manga to give it some saving grace and if you truly want to watch this anime, read the manga which is bad but not nearly as bad as the anime. The anime tries to put in the manga story through poorly executed flashbacks and cutscenesplus an original sequel story that's the creators kinda gave up on mid-way through making it. The only reason I had any idea of what was going on was because I could distinguish the sequel story from the manga story. I wouldn't even bother watching the story just for shits and giggles. If that's your reason for watching the show, watch the first episode (which is the somewhat okay episode in the whole show), and then skip to the very last episode (which is the only episode that was so bad I was laughing my ass off over). You can thank me later. If you want decent horror, go watch Another and if you've already watched Another go watch it again because that's a better use of your time than watching this show. I think that this was the biggest waste of my time and I am ashamed I spend 4 hours of my life (plus 2 hours reading the manga) on this god-awful show.",

And the answer is yes.\r\nWell, if I should compare the manga and the anime, I would say the adaptation perfectly follows the story. However, this anime is an adaptation of the first two arcs, which might be a bit confusing for those who have not read the manga. Personnaly, I liked how theyincluded the first arc in the second by Nobuaki's memories and tellings. It makes the show more lively. The main drawback though, is that it loses in intensity.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I found this show quite funny. The characters reactions when they realize they are helpless is often funny. The deaths also made me smile.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the opening and the ending are both great.\\n\\n\r\nOusama Game may not be the show of the year but it deserves a better grid.",

            "content": "If you liked Michael Grant\u2019s Gone series, or thought, \u2018hmm, I really like the premise of a bunch of kids being trapped in an inevitably hopeless situation where they end up dying gruesome deaths for utterly terrible reasons\u2019, then King\u2019s Game is for you. \r\nI think I picked it up for the same reason I picked up School Days, or the same reason people click on a spoiler when they know they shouldn\u2019t: curiosity. I wanted to know why this series was so infamous, especially when the synopsis sounded interesting. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about.\r\nI don\u2019t know why I foundthis anime entertaining \u2013 maybe it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t take it seriously from the get go and so just enjoyed it as a mindless despair/gorefest. Similar to how people \u2018enjoy\u2019 something like Higurashi or Another. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were so-so, some of them could have done with more development but when they were developed they were done so decently enough. The art was fine most of the time, although there were points where the animation quality dropped greatly. Music was good. And as for the seiyuus \u2013 I think they were great. They actually managed to sound like they were in pain when they were meant to be in pain (at least the majority of them did). There was some fanservice, but not nearly as bad as I expected based on a couple of the reviews I\u2019d read. Apart from the very first scene and another scene about halfway through the series, there was really nothing worth mentioning. And even those scenes weren\u2019t that terrible.\\n\\n\r\nThe torture was another story. Like I said, it\u2019s a gorefest. But gory in an immature way. Worse than Elfen Lied or Akame ga Kill!, but not by much. Besides most of the scenes were done in such a ridiculous way it was hard to take them seriously. \\n\\n\r\nLet me be clear, the only (or at least the main) reason that I\u2019m giving it a bad score (in my rating system, anything under 6 is bad) is because the plot holes were so gaping huge they were impossible to ignore. This was objectively a terrible anime in terms of plot \u2013 it literally makes no sense if you think about it for more than a second or two. I had absolutely no idea what was going on at the end. But I still found it okay on the whole.\\n\\n\r\nIt was actually very thought-provoking, in a way \u2013 it made me wonder what I would do if I was in a similar position. One where I was completely at the mercy of a situation I couldn\u2019t understand, having no idea what would happen next except that it would be inescapable, and painful no matter the outcome. Not to mention that the longer I survived, the more despairing I would be when I inevitably came to die. \\n\\n\r\nI ended up thinking the characters behaved quite realistically. I mean, in their situation, there were really only 3 choices:\\n\r\n\u2022\tSuffer a total mental breakdown and either commit suicide or lose all sense of reality. Maybe try to take everyone else with you for good measure.\\n\r\n\u2022\tTry to keep yourself from going over the brink by desperately clinging onto some form of hope - reassuring everyone else helps too. \\n\r\n\u2022\tCompletely lock off your emotions and become a robot \u2013 regard the entire situation dispassionately and logically try to find a way out. It doesn\u2019t matter if no one but you survives.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m actually not sure which one of these I would be\u2026interesting to think about, if a little gloomy.\\n\\n\r\nSo, those are my impressions. The abysmal plotline prevented me from giving it anything higher than a 5, but there were interesting parts, and, overall, I didn\u2019t dislike it. So, if you like gore, a big cast of characters, and don\u2019t mind a terrible storyline, you can try giving it a go. You\u2019ll be able to tell what it\u2019s like after the first 3 episodes anyway; it doesn\u2019t progress much. XD \\n",

This adaptation in my opnion is just to fast paced. its just impossible to get any connection with any of the characters. I do think that the ideia o following a diferent path than the original was good but it was just poorly executed. In a more general way its just disapointing, there are parts that the animation was just bad, like really bad! The charachters all seem hollow, they cry a lot but they still seem hollow, you just dont feel empaty for them!Cool part is that are a lot of blood and killing! The ending is just as bad as in the original! just dosent make sense! the hole story dosent make much sense!\\n\r\nIf you like seinen storys with some gore there are better things out there! But still not the worst ive ever seen! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Review based on Ousama Game manga! It's only my personal opinion.\r\nThe explanation\r\nOusama Game The Animation is made out of 1st and 3rd manga. I believe it is due to the fact, that it follows the main character, Nobuaki.\r\nThe 2nd manga is the first King's Game story. Chronologically it is the first one to be. However they decided to focus on further than that story.\r\nThe story\r\nI believe the whole story's main focus is the game itself, not the characters. Even though you can't really say from only watching the first season of anime.\r\nThe story is in fact focused on Nobuaki's new class at first. Unfortunately producersstarted putting 1st manga's throwbacks in the whole anime. It is really hard at times to tell which are memories of Nobuaki's previous class and which are present actions.\\n\r\nEven for me, who read 1st manga it was confusing. Due to that it was more of reminding myself the 1st manga, not feeling and enjoying the whole anime.\\n\r\nFor people, that did not read the manga, it's a hot mess, not a story. It is because there are 2 classes Nobuaki attended. From how short the anime is and how randomly the memories of his are put in it, there is no way to understand which is the previous class and which is the present one, without paying much of attention and focusing.\\n\\n\r\nIt can be said to be a rip off of Mirai Nikki, but I believe Ousama game is more about survival, not the reward at the end of the game.\\n\r\nI also get a feeling that most of Ousama Game characters are threatened, which gives me different points of view.\\n\\n\r\nThe art\\n\r\nIt is not so bad, but what is disgusting me are gore scenes. Not themselves, but how badly and cheaply done they seem.\\n\r\nAt each death I wanted to laugh. Blood spills through all the anime and usually characters are left with only a 'cut/scar'. A bleeding that causes death is not a cut of the finger length and width.\\n\r\nI feel like the producers were disgusted to do more of a bloody scenes, full of guts etc. They also make it super quick (compared to how well drawn they are in manga), which shows even less suffering and pain of characters. It looks extremely unrealistic even as for anime. There are deaths in anime, that does not look as bad as these.\\n\r\nIf you are here for gore, leave.\\n\r\nThe brutal, painful scenes feel like nothing here.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound\\n\r\nThere is nothing to it. Opening and ending are not this bad, but I think this anime is missing a lot of emotional music, that would catch my attention. There's not a song that would remind me of a certain scene, like love confession or death. It feels like the music is almost absent.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\\n\r\nThere's an overwhelming number of characters in only 12 episodes. We could categories them as previous and present class of Nobuaki, but due to how messy the stories are, even that is hard to say. Each class counts over 30 characters. Together it leaves us with over 60 characters in total. You can remember about 5-15 max, after watching the whole anime. You might even forget about the cover characters. The number of them in so little episodes leaves you without getting attached to any of them. \\n\r\nThere's only a few of ones that get stuck in your mind. The rest is there just to play the game, play the mini roles and literally die. You can not get any of their feelings. There's just too little about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment\\n\r\nNone. Whether you are here to see the story for the first time or were waiting waiting for the realese after reading manga. It only leaves u disappointed and confused. It's way too messy. Even 12 episodes make you regret watching it after not a while from starting. It feels too short. Too disorganized. Bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall of anime\\n\r\nIt's a waste of time. Totally unworthy going through. There's nothing to it. It's just another anime you will barely remember after adding it to your list. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall of anime and manga\\n\r\nManga is so far better. Manga is clearer. It's nowhere confusing unlike anime. It looks more emotional. The story of each class is separately put in each manga. It does get you more into it.\\n\r\nThe anime destroys all the potential of manga. It makes you feel like there was literally nothing. It makes you disappointed and even frustrated. \\n\r\nMeanwhile I cried rivers to 2nd manga, not involved in the anime. \\n\r\nI think it's just wasted by the limit of 12 episodes, that could make over 24. The mixed together stories. Manga felt nowhere this bad.\\n\\n\r\nI know my review is long, but I wanted to point out some things, even if it meant repeating them. \\n\\n\r\nPlease respect my opinion and thank you for your time!",

Tell me how a blind girl can walk 4 miles (give or take a few) to a beach by herself. TELL ME. There were many holes and unanswered questions throughout the anime, but hey its only 12 episodes. I would recommend it to a friend just for laughs andI finished it in 6 hours maybe less.",

            "content": "A perfect example of an attempt at horror gone wrong. Ousama Game: The Animation is in short, a train wreck and easily the worst anime to premiere this season. \r\nIn all 12 of its episodes, there is very little to be said about what the show accomplishes. If anything, the more you watch, the more you will hate every passing moment. \r\nThe anime starts out somewhat promising and quite typical with regards to most horror anime. There is a lot of disbelief and confusion at the beginning, typical of anyone that receives random text messages from an unknown sender. This quickly turns into madness andchaos ensues as people begin to die suddenly. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime does a bad job of making an interesting, cohesive story that can capture your attention for 12 episodes. The anime relies heavily on flashbacks, and we only ever get them from the main Nobuaki Kanazawa, who happened to survive the last game that he played. This the only character they give so much attention to during the run of the show and yet in attempts to frame him as the potential hero, albeit heavily damaged, and yet while he may have redeeming qualities, these flashbacks just take up space rather than helping propel the current story forward. There is a lot more that could have been done with the present story and depth that could have been built that was lost in trying to ground the story in events that have already come to pass. \\n\\n\r\nMy other gripe with the story is that it just feels weak in general. There is an attempt to put an end to it, as the characters try to find the origins of the game and \u201csolve the puzzle\u201d so they no longer have to play, but like the show, their efforts are pointless in that there is no bigger picture to solve. We never get an understanding of where the game really comes from, who is running this game, or if there is a way of winning that is truly satisfying. Whether the point was to illustrate a winning game of a game you are meant to lose is not the issue, the issue arises from the fact that neither matters and it seeks to show us pointless and ridiculous deaths while the characters act just as ridiculously. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of the show is without a doubt all of the characters we are presented with. This has to be the shallowest, most naive, unconvincing characters I have seen in a while. They see the events unrolling around them and yet are still unwilling to accept that this \u201cgame\u201d they are a part of is real. They run around like chickens without heads and their motivations and actions are all meaningless and nonsensical beyond the simple desire to survive. We get around 30 or so characters throughout the 12 episodes, many of which die, but many also who the show focuses on and yet is unable to develop them beyond the worst typical traits present in a high school drama or horror film. \\n\\n\r\nOusama Game The Animation was underwhelming all around. From the undercooked characters to the nonsensical deaths that fell upon them. This anime just felt like it was thrown together with little care for detail or desire to be enjoyed for any of its 12 episodes. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone and am surprised I watched for all 12 episodes. I was hoping it would somehow flip the script and become enjoyable, but week after week Ousama Game simply dug its grave deeper and deeper. \\n",

            "content": "So I reviewed this before but mods deleted it because of having done so at 3 episodes. Since it's complete now I'll take my time to do so again since I liked this show that much *sarcasm*\r\nSo I called this the greatest accidental comedy ever in my last review and I'll stick by it even more so now.\r\nOusama game is quite literally follow the king's order or get punished. Problem is that the punishment games all end up with kill yourself for not kissing girl 24 or fucking guy 03. Yeah, not even joking, most of these orders are sexual or at the very leastembarrasing love related. Quite the perverted king we have here. Good news for people who are into NTR though because the MC sure seems to be into it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is supposed to be the horrific thing in this anime, but to me ends up being comedy of the year is of course the dying kids for breaking their order given by the king. Without spoiling each episode has a graphic scene of a classmember dying, sometimes several even but i's just so over the top that you end up laughing at it instead of feeling omg, that was horrible, that poor kid. To make it even worse the anime decided to combine both manga's into one show, so you constantly go back and forth between MC's previous class and the new one in the first quarter of the anime making it even harder to remember who the fuck this guy or that girl is/was and of course gives you zero time to even emotionally bond with these characters so you feel nothing but humor when they die.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS IS A SPOILER!!!\\n\r\nWhat got me the most though is the reason behind the kings game.... it's a virus, yep just a plain old mutated virus that, get this, like are you ready? you're going to love this! IT MUTATED TO BECOME DIGITAL???? The fuck are you on writer? that's not even freaking possible at all! All these deaths are literally some virus that brainwashes your body into doing the silly deaths in some form of mindcontrol, what the everlasting fuck???\\n\\n\r\n I rated this a 5 at the start of the show, note that I always start an anime with a 7 and only rate a show after 3 episodes but this got an instant 5 after one. I hoped, really hoped it would get better and for a while it seemed to be going that route but then we got to the thing that infuriated me even more, namelly Nobuaki, our loveable MC. This is the typical good guy MC, but my god I started to hate this guy. There is a limit to how nice you can be, and when someone has shown to kill people left and right, trying to murder you and admits to doing so and then you STILL try to defend her and try to help her out, you deserve to die.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I gave it a 4, the OST saved it greatly, I did enjoy the music a lot and will be getting it but that's honestly the only redeeming part, besides of course the corny deaths",

            "content": "------------SPOLERS!!!! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!------------\r\nThis is totally a fair review. Let me start by saying this anime needs a review to give credit for its illogical and awful storyline but it's so good killings. I recommend this anime if you like gore, no storyline just stupidity and annoyance, out of place genre and fanservice. The genre is kinda misleading, remove the horror and add comedy, drama and romance. I think that's better.\r\nNow for my review, the storyline is not new. Sure killings, blood and gore we have all seen it in past animes. The reason why this anime is different is because of itslogic. The storyline makes no sense especially SPOILER: How the real life virus is transferred to a computer and mobile phones. That's totally out of place in the origin of the Ousama Game (read the Osama Game: Kirei manga, in which the manga has better execution and storyline than this anime, at least in my opinion). We don't know how the King sees what they are doing if they completed the tasks or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is big plus for me. The art is eye candy ONLY for the background art not the bloody gore especially the sea scene. Awesome. Enjoyment for me is kinda OK but as I said earlier not new. The characters are confusing and too many to notice them in the whole series. The MC is kinda annoying at first but he is a good person. He just wants to save his classmates (nothing wrong with that) and strong willed. I mean this is my kind of MC to die at the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Still I recommend it. One of the must see anime today. Good for laughs and it is not horror and not scary. I only recommend if you like fanservice and bloody story. The female villain is the reason why I got hooked in the first episode. I always wait for her screentime. Can't wait for the second season.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Natsuko is hot. Wanna f*ck her. LOL.",

There first mistake was how there was zero character development and insteaddecided to focus on the MC first time playing the game. Honestly, even though the had even less screen time, I found myself wishing we were watching the first kings game then what appears to be the MC second time playing because how I felt like those characters where just seemingly way more interesting, like with relationships and rivalries etc.\\n\\n\r\nAlso what's up the main heroine just suddenly turning all bitch like and trying to sabotage the main characters life, even though she was totally head over heels for him like 5 mins ago?\\n\\n\r\nIn short this anime was just lame and definitely not worth your time",

            "content": "SOME SPOILERS ARE MENTIONED\r\nIf you love gory scenes, an annoying female character, and a crap version of the DEATH NOTE, then this anime would be a suggestion. Characters react how other people would, but more dramatic. A guy is frustrated that no one believes him and desperately tries to save them. Of course, there are people who are in denial and tries to brush him off as crazy. Then all hell goes down; gory scenes, screaming, crying. So the first FEW episodes were fine in my opinion. \r\nMy only complaint is the character Natsuko Honda. The anime has a main villain - The King's Game,but the anime adds on another villain Natsuko, which is completely unnecessary. Her personality in the beginning was bright, and naturally, she should have been scared. But then she becomes one of the main villains, which is one of the reasons why this anime has problems. For a 12 episode anime, the story should be simple, one villain - The King's Game and one protagonist - Nnobuaki kanazawa - where the protagonist is focused on defeating one villain. \\n\\n\r\nRather than wanting her to die out of justice, I want her removed from the anime. I wouldn't mind another villain if he/she died when she should have. But the anime for some reason keeps her alive cause of some discovery, which makes it to be the cause of the Game and it doesn't make sense. Although there are some problems with the anime, the main problem with the anime is keeping that girl. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, in my opinion, this anime focuses too much on trying to create emotion between some of the characters. This anime should focus on gore and violence if it wants to make it a horror anime, but it adds in some sympathetic scenes which disrupts the whole feel of the anime. Instead of shifting the moods, the anime should have just went along with its gory rampage while giving more scenes where the main character actually tried to find a way to defeat the King's Game. I'm confused what this anime wants its viewers to view the anime as - is it a combination of horror and triller, or is it a mixture of romance, thriller, horror, psychological, supernatural? There are shifts in focus and I personally believe that it would be a better anime if it focused on the horror aspect or have it as it is and extend the episodes to give some background scenes to actually put some feel into the deaths of the characters. \\n\\n\r\n Honestly the only character I enjoyed was Iwamura Rie cause she stayed cool and didn't wimp out and actually tried beat the King's Game through her skill. I enjoy characters that aren't wusses and do something cool. Sadly, her potential was replaced by this guy that keeps crying and crying. Now, there's nothing wrong with that, but the scenes are a bit redundant. Because I don't really like having an emotional character in a horror anime, I'd rather just look at the anime from the viewpoint of the Iwamura Rie. \\n\\n\\n",

As much as I loved the first ep. and thought it will be the best anime of the season, that much I had to be disappointed in the following ones. Let me tell you the best part of the anime: the opening and ending is pretty decent. Ok, that was all the positives I could say. Now let see the problems. Storytelling is not great at all. The anime tries to compress 3 mangas into 12 eps and the way itdoes is mixing these. It gets a bit confusing in the initial episodes, but gets cleared out later, so that's fine. Still, there are many unnecessary parts. The art style is not outstanding, but not bad either. The most irritaiting thing has to be the characters. Not only are most of them annoying (with a lot of artificial drama), but also stupid. They don't learn from their former mistakes and imo a 5 year old child is smarter than these high school students. So is it enjoyable at all? Well, a bit, yes. Especially if you are new to animes or just simply have low expectations. I give it a 4/10 but at the same time I highly recommend everyone to avoid the series, mostly for that it's not worth your free time. On the other hand, if the story is appealing to you then go and watch Another, it's way better and has similar topics.",

My only real problem with this show is the execution of the plot which is not very good unfortunately.\r\nThe music and animation in this show are great especially the music.\r\nSIDE NOTE - The character art in this show is very nice especially the lighting effectsof their hair.\\n\\n",

One of the bad qualities I find very ugly in human nature, and something I always see everyday is - Selfishness and in this show, there is also some greed to some extent. Everyone wants to be first, everyone wants everything I don't care what happens to you, I have to win, I have to survive. I know the very nature of human selfishness, I think that this show really depicts how Selfish humans can be. However I am  giving thisa 5/10 because simply this was not something I enjoy, I  give credits for showing humanity's ugliness, but it is still not the sight I desire.",

But after watch episode 4, I definitly will give another chance for Ousama, and probably, keep watching until finale. Is this....\r\nbut I have to write more than this for submit. So, Isse if the grade 7 if I taken for this is one point than average, if its 6. Between 6-7 grades, its fair, but at this moment, less than 4pts seems exaggeration for me. However, every grade and consistent opinions and arguments are valid.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, for end this, no one deserves the Nobuaki lifes, because he's seems a good person, but suffers a lot.",

This anime is basicly a show about the king killing everyone at the end, and how they suffered to try and survive but no matter how hard they tried to stop / figur out how to end the kings game the anser they got was you can never end it. Basicly the show is about a whole class of people dieing from diffrent ways trying their best to NOT to die. There is also some parts that dose't make sense and how people start to betray each other because of the game its prettydepressing tbh. I would say if you get emotinal pretty easily this might not be the show for you just throwing that out their. will you guys have a nice one and Merry christmas!",

            "content": "Nobuaki Kanazawa has just transferred school but he tries desperately to keep his distance from everyone despite how friendly they were. He was the only survivor of something known as the \"King's Game\" where if someone didn't follow orders, they would die a horrible death instantly. Naturally when all his new classmates started receiving these orders on their phones they didn't believe him... That is until, chaos broke out and a large number of them died the first night. Now it's a game of seeing how far each of them will go for survival.\r\nSo the story is loosely based around the \"ou-sama\" game in Japanwhich is usually pulling straws to see who has the longest one. Then they can tell someone in the game to do whatever they must. Kind of like the truth or dare game. Show itself is based on a mix of the Manga's first series and the first title in the second series subtitled \"\u7d42\u6975 [The Finale]\".\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of this show is mostly flashbacks of Nobuaki's past experience of the King's Game and it's mostly filled with non-stop gorey, gruesome deaths and little plot or character development. It's kind of like watching everyone getting filled with angst as they learn of each other dying and a lot of times, you'll be thinking, \"Wha...?\" The dares are gruesome and a lot of them is forcing the female students to have sex or some other exploitive situation. It's nothing explicit visually and I guess they at least show a condom being used.\\n\\n\r\nAfter most of the class has disappeared, that the show kind of gets better as the story focuses more on the remaining few survivors of the present class so you start to sympathise with the characters a bit more. Some people have compared this horror show to Another but, I think Another was better because its mystery side was kept throughout the show instead of focusing on slaughtering or making characters suffer episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into sadistic shows and enjoy watching gorey, gruesome deaths or people suffering then you might enjoy this. Otherwise, I'd suggest watching Another instead if you want a better horror mystery show.",

            "content": "First Review-So don't crucify me if I do bad.\r\nThis anime is (in my opinion) good for those that are *somewhat* into the Horror genre. I don't watch many horror animes, but if you want to enjoy this anime more than the others, make sure you aren't deeply dived into scary stuff (some interest is fine).\r\nStory 6/10: Looking back, the story is pretty much used in circles (Rinse and repeat). If you do finish the anime, you will have questions and that's understandable considering how i guess, how the studio just dove into it. They never fully explain the background or origin of the game (There'sa manga/summary for it online) or why Natsuko acted the way she did. (Eh, not really a spoiler. You'll notice her behavior change by the end of the first episode). I think honestly the one thing that kept me awake till 3 (yeah i actually stood up til 3 to watch this) was how they handled the rinsing and repeating. They had to handle each situation during the anime differently and it kept me on edge.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: It looks pretty to me. It all comes down to personal preference.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: I can't fully judge sound since I haven't watched many horrors. I'll give it a 7 simply because I think the sounds were pretty realistic but some effects were wayyyyy too exaggerated (You'll know what I mean if you watch it).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10: I never once disliked any character in the anime. However, character development creates character, and there really wasn't any of it. I guess Riona was probably the only one that developed (If there was any) and it was done in a short amount of time. The only time this anime talks about a character's history was Nobu's (basically 1/3 of the anime) and it had some glimpses of Natsuko's past (Literally a few seconds, but they somewhat give you an idea of why she's like that). I couldn't really get attached to any character and sometimes the side ones were pretty frustrating with the way they thought illogically.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall 9/10: I overall enjoyed it. It was probably my naivety that was the reason why I kept watching until I had to stop because I had school the next day. I'm not much of a harsh grader on anime in general so my credibility might not be so good. But if you're (very) relatively new to anime, I think this is a pretty good anime to enjoy. Because once you dive way deep into anime, you're not going to have the same enjoyment of watching this as you would being an infant to anime.\\n",

            "content": "The reviews and ratings for this anime are exceptionally bad, so I was very close to deciding not to watch it.\r\nBut to be honest, I really liked the opening theme (yes, I'll own up to my emo self) and... that was my only reason to give the anime a try.\r\nTo be honest, I do see a wide varietes of flaws in this anime; but it surprisingly did a good job at keeping me invested.\r\nHere's a good ol' list of flaws/things that bothered me:\r\n- MC is too generic, a typical mix of an edgelord and a Gary Sue;\r\n- MC gets all the focus at the detrimentof other characters';\\n\r\n- anime has a strong harem feel to it (despite MC being faithful to his ex);\\n\r\n- most of the girls are damsels in distress literally tripping on rocks;\\n\r\n- unnecessary sexual scenes;\\n\r\n- the gore is ridiculous;\\n\r\n- I'm probably forgetting a lot.\\n\\n\r\nI think one of the main issue is that the plot is trying its hardest at turning the main protagonist into a martyr. I rolled my eyes at the scenes more than once, really, but I did grow to feel sympathy for him, surprisingly.\\n\r\nI usually hate harem-types of anime, but at least it made sense to me why the girls would fall for him. At least he wasn't a useless slug of a protagonist. He was useful without being \"overpowered\".\\n\\n\r\nI'm also grateful that he did have an official relationship with a girl and kept to it; there was no awkward blushing with other girls, he never went after someone else, so it doesn't exactly feel as if the romance played a huge part in the story. It was as much of a background thing as most of the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, I'll never claim that this anime is an amazing one. It has way too many flaws to get any proper recognition and I can completely understand how a lot of people wouldn't be able to take it seriously.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I do think this anime handled annoyingly popular tropes better than a lot of other anime. Nothing outstanding, but it was definitely a surprise for me, having thought multiple times \"oh I didn't expect that\" when I thought the entire anime was predictable.\\n\r\nThus, I don't think the anime deserves such harsh judgment. I think it does deserve a rate anywhere between 5 and 6.",

(expect a bad review)\r\nOusama Game The Animation\r\nStory (5/10)\r\nIts a story that has violence, gore and nudity(a little).\r\nFor me, the plot or story of the anime had a alot of potential, but the studio didnt\r\nknow how to make the story better so it was honestly bad but i still gave it a 5 because i quite enjoyed watching the anime and its one of the animes this fall that i watched weekly without stopping.\r\nArt (3/10)\r\nThe animation of Ousama Game was honestly poor but its not enough for me to \r\ndrop the anime, Stuff like the deaths was pretty badlooking and the movements of the characters was pretty bad. The backround and character design was enough for me to give this anime a 3/10 on the art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10)\\n\r\nThe sound in the anime wasnt that bad, i gave it an average score because\\n\r\nsome sound effects didnt quite fit the deaths of an character. The opening and ed\\n\r\nwas good, and some musics was fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4/10)\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are really bad. Its really bad because the writer doesnt know how to properly develop a character in the anime. The characters were stupid and doesnt know how to handle problems and i gave it a 4\\n\r\nbecause its i think what will happen in real life if this kinda game happens.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10)\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Ousama Game! The suprising scenes was honestly good \\n\r\nbut sometimes it made me cringe because of how bad the animation and the sound is, but atleast they tried.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\r\nOverall the anime isnt bad, it just doesnt know how to use the potential of the anime, If MadHouse , Shaft or Bones made this, i think it will be 2x better than\\n\r\nthis. Im looking forward for the improvments in the future because there will be a\\n\r\n2nd season of this anime and im really looking forward to it. \\n\r\n(I just hope they dont screw it up again like this one.)\\n",

            "content": "Generally speaking I thoroughly enjoyed this entire segment. I mean yeah, I got a bit emotional after a few episodes, namely from 6 onwards. There's a substantial amount of \"could have\"probably done this better, or \"should have\" probably done this better etc. But, for the most part, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed seeing how dark certain characters get when their life is on the line. I loved every second of it. \r\nI'd probably rewatch it another 3 times, from start to finish, but that's mainly because I'm somewhat of a sadist. I enjoy watching people suffer. Unless they are my precious bby, in which caseI will protect them to the death.",

            "content": "When i started seeing OG, I didn't think it was be the amazing series it ended being. It doesn't stand out for animation, neither characters. It stands out for the reflexions you make seeing the series. OG show us that we're always near complete madness, that everyone can do literally anything to survive and that despite being completely lost of hope people can change. All characters can teach you something, even the \" villain \". At the end of the anime you see that the villain isn't that villain, the hero isn't that hero and as nobuaki said: I don't understand anymore what is rightand what is wrong. This series is really profound despite not being that well developed. It doesn't have a happy ending. And that's not bad. It doesn't have boobs, butts and fanservice, and that's not bad. The series is all about thoughts. \\n\r\nAnd that's why a lot of people disliked it. For that reason ( But not only ), Ousama game deserves a 9. Because it made people hate it. A lot of them. People like a lot of trash, being it real or digital. And hate what doesn't harm them at all. Anyway, the reviews tell more about who wrote them than the anime itself. If you're afraid it won't be good, relax. If you're not a fan of happy people doing happy things because everyone must be happy in the world of animation, you must the Ousama Game.",

But that's what makes it so good.  It reminded me of The Lost Village.  I actually did research to see if these were made by the same people, but they weren't; still, I do believe that they were both made with the same mindset, creating garbage, or perhaps you could say parodies of horror, suspense, thriller anime.  I only recommend it if you want to see anintentionally, hilariously horrible anime.  Even then, it's not amazing, I think The Lost Village is better in that regard, but this one's still good.  I give it a 7/10.",
