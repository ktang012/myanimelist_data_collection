            "content": "Before starting this review, I would just like to say that you CAN watch the other 2 movies after or before watching this. That is because they occur at the same timeline. The only difference being that each focuses on different couples.\r\nHere's the titles of the 2 movies\r\nZutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai\r\nSuki ni Naru Sono Shunkan wo.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai\r\n10 cm. Such as short distance. And yet it is too much to close this gap between these 2 people. No matter what you try, distance in love is not something easily explained. Although the person you love may be right next toyou, you somehow feel that he/she is out of reach, almost impossible to ever meet to get closer. And when that person is on the other side of the world, you feel like you could reach him/her no matter what, holding on to your feelings. This is what 'Itsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta.' explores, the distance between people both literally and metaphorically. It is probably the best part about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is pretty good in my opinion, unless you don't want something a bit cliched. But even if it is, there are some anime series which do better on other things than just uniqueness. This is one of them, I think.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I wouldn't say the story is the best part about this work. I think it was a bit too simplistic. A boy and girl seem to have a good relationship together. A few obstacles appear and this affects their friendship. They try their best to fix things up. That's it. Nothing new about the story, this kind of story has already been explored in many other shows. If I was to pick something unique out of this, it's probably the male lead's hobby, which is film-making. Therefore I gave a 7.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, this series focuses on 1 main couple. They're a very cute couple, whom I strongly wished to get more screen-time when I watched the other 2 movies. Other than the main couple there are other 2 pairs and we see some of their development too (and of course you would see them as well in the other 2 movies).\\n\\n\r\nMiou is a good character, she is very honest and kind (too kind at times). The scenes when she's shy were the ones that made me really like her, it's a cute part of her personality. However her lack of confidence has been a slight problem. Miou was a bit too sensitive to the news about Haruki's brother, blaming herself for the problem. Going a bit overboard there. It felt as if her weakness in perceiving certain things was deliberately made to be an obstacle in her relationship with Haruki, So I lowered the character score to 7.\\n\\n\r\nHaruki is a very likeable character who is presented as someone who enjoys film making a lot, and is friendly to everyone in his club. I really liked the part where he doubted himself, people can always have a time when they're not at their best and start to question their decisions. Maybe he's a bit too good at film-making...\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good, way above average I'd say. Very bright colors are used to create a joyful atmosphere throughout. 10/10. However I was a bit disappointed by the movements, sometimes it really looked forced and repetitive. Of course the sound is good thanks to Honeyworks, both the OP and ED are great. 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe merry atmosphere in the anime is something I must go over on. It's the best aspect of this anime, and I've always seen ever since I watched the other movies. Whenever one or two of the characters are down, there is always someone who cheers them up or helps them out. It's a simple yet essential part of the anime, forming a good development and only strengthening their friendship.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a 9 would be suitable. I'm the type who gives higher scores than most people so... \\n",

            "content": "Riding the wave of the recent popularity of melodramatic teen-dramas with a mixture of coming-of-age and troubles of expressing one\u2019s feeling in fear of them not being mutual proved to be successful in the latest times, not judging the quality of each individual work related to these traits per se. However, one might as well be blind to not see that this particular instalment, harbouring the gloriously long LN-esque title \u201cItsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta\u201d (which I\u2019ll just call \u201cIBnKw10cmD\u201d from now on, because why not?), is just riding off the recent hype concerning these titles in a completely uninspired and passionlessway, not being more than your flavour of the month anxious teen-melodrama. Seriously, go to any middle-schoolyard and you\u2019d find more interesting and above else, qualitative writing than what we\u2019re being presented here could even have a title like SSNT14YO (\u201cStop sending nudes to 14 year-olds\") to compete with the high straightedge the title set itself up in that regard.\\n\r\nOkay, jokes aside. However, funnily enough, as I did my research this Anime series was based off a novel about some Vocaloid songs, which has already been adapted into two movies back in 2016. Whoever thought it would be a good idea to re-adapt IBnKw10cmD into a 6 episode long TV-series is beyond me. And whoever came up with the idea to adapt frickin\u2019 Vocaloid songs deserves an award all for himself.\\n\\n\r\nLast year of high-school arrives and aspiring filmmaker-kun Haruki falls in love or rather grows interested in shy-Japanese girl #45 Miou on first sight, while she\u2019s starring at a cherry blossom on the school-yard, detailing the colours of the blooms in much detail. Sparks of first love arise but is overshadowed by their inability to show each other\u2019s feelings and unsureness in what kind of future they want to see themselves in plus their hilariously dramatic connection to their recent pasts, of what they are still left in the unknown at the start of the series and unironically gets revealed by their teacher of classic Japanese literature by accident, friendly related to Haruki since long ago.\\n\\n\r\nJudging by how I decided to describe our two mains beforehand, it\u2019s a given that I think that they are far from good characters themselves. The ingredients (in terms of characteristics) of both have been thrown into the pot from a recipe so uncreative and generic, that you can predict the features of their character, how they relate to each other and what development they might undergo when conflict happens before you even start watching more than about 10 minutes.\\n\r\nHaruki, dedicated film-maker and aspiring big director in the film-biz falls in love with Miou, but doesn\u2019t seem to be able to close the final gap, leaving his club-work at a stand-still in quality later on, especially when her significant repel towards him happens to strike towards the middle, something I will get to later. While the conflict and essentially the love-story between him and her could\u2019ve been interesting, if it has been dealt with maturely and not in a checkbox-fashion of watered-down \u201cmust-have\u201d events, moments succeeding each other as it was from some kind of robotic formula was apparently the plan to go. The staff of IBnKw10cmD decided to not take any risks and play down the drama in some of the most uninspired ways I have seen to this day and with blandness-kuns on both sides of the romance-spectrum, them keeping me intrigued was out of the possibility as well. And with Haruki, he seems to be just there and wants to make films in the future, falling depressed in the middle for only semi-understandable reasons and makes his final attempt at a confession (which might\u2019ve or might not have worked) in \u201crainy anime confession scene #108\u201d at last. All his interactions, be it with his love-interest or with virtually any other character radically define him as a character with basically nothing of \"character\" in him, just a tool to bring the story forward. #Howtowritegoodprotagonists\\n\\n\r\nThe female counter-part, Miou Aida, is probably as shy as she can humanly get, has a voice that sounds so high-pitched it might as well go above humanly-audible frequencies sooner or later and would represent a non-survivable lifeform in today\u2019s day and age, as the trend of overly-shy anime love interests seem to go on forever. She\u2019s part of the art club, very talented at the art herself, but struggles to find both right words for Haruki or get her feeling on the canvas. The latter characteristic of her is very much undermined through the very forced subplot-line the art club has undergone in middle episodes. Couldn\u2019t they have been even more obvious and/or shiftless in how to depict the emotional conflict of hers across? I mean it\u2019s pretty ironic, that Haruki himself is the sole defender of some sort of subtlety in the final scene of his film project, he would even understand that storytelling like that will turn the show into a boring, chewy experience, at least I\u2019d hope so from someone aspiring to go to film school. But as I have been repeatedly speaking of the conflict which arises between the two main characters, ruining their incredibly \u201cpassionate\u201d moment during episode 2 in hindsight, which ended with a cockblock at a Japanese folklore festival, wearing kimonos and only slightly being cucked before the finishing line (where have I seen this before?), I will have to share the pretty ridiculous plotline initiating that:\\n\\n\r\n***Spoilers***\\n\\n\r\nThe relation between Saku (literature-teacher), the deceased brother of Haruki and Haruki himself has been revealed by complete coincidence, as Miou pays the grave of her saviour back then a visit, where she almost drowned in a nearby river, she meets Saku right before his graveyard. Because of the awkward situation, he reveals his connection to Haruki\u2019s brother, with who he was incredibly good friends with and still visits his grave yearly, to pay respect by laying\u2026a lolly on his grave. It\u2019s been revealed that he chills in his lab coat (classical style for a classical Japanese literature teacher, no question) licking on a lolly 24/7 because school is non-smoking, but laying it down on the grave of a good ol\u2019 bud adds even more bits of hilariousness. However, ignoring that little silly aspect of it is definitely possible, but ignoring the obnoxious feeling of forced drama added to it because of that, going on for three whole episodes, is definitely not doable.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and his brother seems to die because of a cold as he jumped into the water, or at least it\u2019s the only plausible disease which can be deduced by the way he chills at the bed with an IV connected to his body, nigga seems to have gotten it real rough. The other option would be that he drowned during his heroic action, but by the way the show presents it, it could be both.\\n\r\nBut I\u2019ll take it. A grown-ass man dying because of a cold. Great.\\n\\n\r\n***Spoilers-End***\\n\\n\r\nIBnKw10cmD has a small cast of minor characters as well, but their importance to the story (besides those I\u2019ve mentioned in the spoiler section) is utterly negligible and it speaks volumes, that I can neither tell you one name of them (especially the art club) or one single scene of relevance they had in the story. As with most of the show, it\u2019s just there for the sake of being there and never tries to do anything more with them than the bare minimum, basically marking them as extras, gotta love these kinds of series.\\n\\n\r\nAudiovisuals:\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is as average as it can get, regarding the Animation there\u2019s almost nothing notable to say besides that is okay, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s much room for usage of it in a story like this. Gotta add, that two or three scenes were directed decently (lead up to rainy anime confession scene #108), so I won\u2019t be labeled a mindless hater. Otherwise, the directing is as bland as it gets as well, doesn't really give me an opportunity to comment on any aspect specifically.\\n\r\nVA is fine in general, but with the soundtrack, they struck another nerve of mine, as it has been basically varying only two things the entire series:\\n\\n\r\n- Slow piano music on constant repeat, as engaging, eclectic, or beautiful as elevator music.\\n\\n\r\n- \u266b\u266b\u266b Bokura koi suru nan jyu nen nan byaku nen demo,\\n\r\nHikare aun dayo marude mahou no yoni,\\n\r\nAno ne konya yume no naka de wa,\\n\r\nKimi wa boku to koi ni ochiteru,\\n\r\nKiite mirai egaku ehon de,\\n\r\nKimi wo boku to ai wo mitsukeru,\\n\r\nItazura wo suru koi no kamisama,\\n\r\nKimi wo kidzutsuke nakaseta no nara,\\n\r\nBoku wa akuma ni nachauyo,\\n\r\nBokura koi suru nan jyu nen nan byaku nen demo,\\n\r\nHikare aun dayo marude mahou no yoni,\\n\r\nDeau mae kara sagashite ita yo kimi wo,\\n\r\nHiki sakareta ate ai de tsunagateru,\\n\r\nHatsukoi zutto nan jyu nen nan byaku nen demo,\\n\r\nSoshite kasanari aun da boku no monogatari to. \u266b\u266b\u266b\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, over the past years of watching Anime I\u2019ve grown weak. Weak in a sense, that I am way less resilient to series that are not even trying to derive from the fool-proof formula of genericism, offer a pot of \u201cmeh\u201d in virtually every single category and don\u2019t feel like anything but an attempt to strike some quick $ $ $, basically a product with no heart or value in it, just commerce. And with this show, we have basically found our prime suspect, a summation of underwhelming aspects, which makes a borderline terrible show as a whole. Fast Food at its finest.\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a much better coming-of-age story including the incredibly similar set-up of the search for passion for a single, unique subject (like Haruki and his film-making), try out \u201cWhisper of the Heart\u201d by Studio Ghibli. You can thank me later.\\n\\n\r\nStory (4/10)\\n\r\nArt (5/10), Animation (6/10)\\n\r\nSound (4/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10)",

Since i'm not used to write any. \r\nI'm also quite indecisive about if i should write a \"review\" about one episode i watched or just ignore this monstrosity altogether. But since this anime has apparently only 6 episodes. I'd give myself the freedom to do so. Let's do this :\r\nArt : The art in this anime is quite decent.Although the characters look bland and typical. Scenery-wise the art looks fine, but the character design is appalling. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound quality is mediocre. The voice actors sound a bit flat. But they seem to be doing a fair job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : Dull, bland, uninspired and utterly average... Every tedious clich\u00e9 you could find in the book was assembled to form those banal 1D characters. Their interactions are quite boring as well. None of the introduced characters seemed interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : There wasn't any enjoyment. I couldn't think of anything redeemable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : This eyesore of an anime is not only below mediocre and arid. It's also a typical case of a cornball romcom gone bad. It's distasteful and trite.  \\n\r\nI dare say it's worst than those god awful and deplorable ecchi-harems/otome game adaptations.\\n",

            "content": "No matter what people might say, I personally like the HoneyWorks anime franchise. As of now, the story from their original music videos was adapted into two, hour-lenght movies, and this six episode series. The first movie focused on all of our three main couples, and I enjoyed it quite a lot. The second one was worse in comparison, the characters were especially weaker, but it still remained on the positive side of things. And now we have this. A short six episode series resolving around one of the main couples. Did it live up to the potential? For me, certainly yes.\r\nFirst question that comesto mind is, do you have to watch the movies to understand this series? Not really, it stays pretty independent from each other. But if you like romantic stories, there is no reason not to do so. It's a good watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, let's get to the bussines. The story is centered around one of the couples from the first movie: Miou Aida and Haruki Serizawa. I called them a couple, which technically shouldn't be the case because they're not dating or anything yet, but that doesn't really matter. This is a straightforward romance. No love-triangle, just pure one on one. Which is a really good thing. Being a short anime, the decision to focus only on one couple is welcome and we get to see the story around them develop a lot during the time. \\n\\n\r\nMiou is a shy and a self-confidence lacking girl, that enjoys painting more than anything. It's her own way of forgetting her problems, and she is both more lively and cheerful when she's in an artist environment. While being shy when talking to other people, it's not done over the top. It is always hard to balance out the personality traits of characters, especially when they are so over-used as the confidence lacking characters are. Miou however, is a case of a well made one. She's more quiet, but has her own sweet and happy moments. She can do something you wouldn't expect from her. And despite her falling into depression at a certain point, her motives to do so are understandable and her recovery is a well-fought battle.\\n\\n\r\nHaruki seems, unlike Miou, as an outgoing and forward type of guy. He holds a passion for movie-making, around which the whole plot of the show evolves. Despite his first given impression, whenever he's alone with Miou, he tends to get nervous aswell, not having the guts to even hold her hand. The good thing on Haruki is that he's extremely realistic as far as his personality goes. I can see myself in him. And I think it's that touch of reality that makes him a good character, because if we were talking about the other things he does or doesn't, he's as straight-forward as it goes. Ya know, he's good-looking, outgoing, friendly and a \"leader of the gang\". Despite all that, I still like him. Because the show did a really good job at showing both good and bad personality traits of both of our characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing of the show in itself is something, I would like to talk about for a bit. You see, incase you don't know yet, this is a romance drama. And the word drama can also mean trouble, as the modern animes seem to find it harder and harder to do a proper, not over the top drama that fits the atmosphere well. Which is not the case this time around. It could be actually called the carrying point of this show. Starts of slow and nicely, then suddenly picks up the pace at both ends, and although the peak could be called maybe a little too dramatic, I think I would just be nitpicking at that moment. The setup is decent, the turn-around respectable and the resolution nearly fabulous. I do find the two main characters written well too. They are lacking a bit at certain times, but that just adds to the fact that this show does it's best at making them beliavable.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're familiar with this franchise, you also know that there are three main couples overall. That's true in the grand scheme of things, but the other two just play the supporting role in this one. Akari + Souta and Natsuki + Yuu. Considering how things went in the first movie, I think and I hope that they will both get their own short animes, like Miou and Haruki did. They deserve it. Atleast Akari with Souta do, I find the two to be destined for each other. Anyways, these four are written in about the same way as the two. Different personalities, but every one of them feels realistic with their behaving, especially in the romantic moments. And despite their romance being cut off this time, they still work well as a supportive cast acting like High School friends do.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Itsudatte Boku- whatever 10 cm, is a quality show. And it's hell of a fun to watch. Despite not impressing me that much at the start, the show made me appreciate it's strong points and I wanted to see more and more every week. It's not as rememberable as I would like to, but to be honest, which school romance anime is? For me it's important that the show besides it's own selling points also had a big entertainment value. While it was seeing Miou and Haruki together or alone, I never started doubting their purpose in the show and I never got bored of them. Which can be said about their story aswell. Just a cherry on top of all things I've said is a very well made ending, that warms your heart to the core.\\n\\n\r\nThe general looks of this are really good. I always liked the desings of all the characters, which haven't changed since the movies. That stays the same and I still find it pleasant to look at. The animation feels on-point most of the time, despite not showing that many hard-effort scenes or moments.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the music of the movies. Both the vocal and ambient OST played a big role in them and I still find them very nice to listen to. That being said, no vocal songs aside from opening and ending were used in this one. Which is a shame in my opinion, as exactly these types of animes are the ones that would deserve it. The ambient OST stays almost the same, but felt a little less impactful than was before. Overall, despite the music taking a step back, it still be considered a huge plus when not comparing to the prequel movies. \\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\\n\r\nItsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta is a great example of a show that focused on the things an anime of this genre should have. It presents a well made dramatic story with a respectable cast around it. And with the fair producion value qualities, I just can't do anything else but say: This anime was a pleasure to watch.",

The most unique aspects of the show is its being short and the eye catching art it has , I bet no one would get bored of it if it is this long which I think is a positive thing for an anime like this , the overall sounding is done pretty good too it won't tire you throughout the show and the OP and ED are both above average.\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something cute and casual that won't take much of your time and help you relax , this is the anime for you.",

Granted, the episodes add up to one long a** movie, but I feel this method of focusing solely on Miou and Haruki did some good. Of course the movie was a good definition of a cheesy teenage romance, yet it wasn't distasteful cheese. It was like an \"I'm in the mood for this cheese\" cheesy. Andeven for a tantalizing romance, the ending had its mature parts. Although the conflict was a bit too weak for my liking, I don't think there's anything bad the viewers can't grasp from the trailer or name of the show\\n\\n\r\nArt:The art is once again beautiful and perfect for the setting and tone.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound weren't bad. Nothing extraordinary about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I feel like the highlight of the show are the two protagonists and the fact that all of the other characters were finally in their rightful roles: barely-relevant supporting characters!!! There are many romance anime (and shows in general) that either only focus on one character or don't delve into the love birds' personal stories at all. Both sides of the romance had backstories, goals, and hobbies, and the actual love story wasn't the sole focus. I got to know more about the characters which I felt made the love story more sell-able. I've already said it on multiple accounts that I find some of the other characters rather cliche and/or annoying, but at least they weren't main characters and were shoved into a more secondary role.",

The characters are well designed and believable, but the true worth is in their interactions. They feel like genuine people trying to navigate high school relationships, that being said its not super in depth with the other characters besides the two main ones but it still holds up. The real reason I started this review was just so I can have it on record how much I absolutely ADORE the ED for this anime. Don't get me wrong the OP is ok, but the ending themeis my favorite ED of all time, I literally cannot watch it without wanting to tear up.

            "content": "Before I start I want to say that I haven't seen the two prequel movies that preceded this series, which have a more general focus on characters that appear in this anime. This series in particular focuses mainly on one of the couples that appear in the two films, and it isn't necessary to watch them before proceeding with this series. With that, I'd like to come out and say that I think this anime has been slept on considerably; it's a cute little romance story that would definitely be appreciated by a lot of people who need their romance fix when they've run outof things to watch. It's a very straightforward shoujo-like plot that doesn't do much new, but goes through the usual conventions in a very beautiful and enjoyable way.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons why I like this show is because it does exactly what people want to see out of a drama-romance anime; with it's short length (only 6 episodes), it forces the story forward without much in the way of pointless filler or storylines that don't correlate with the main narrative. This gives it great pacing in my opinion with the constraints given. However this was also a negative for me; the main story they chose to focus on was one about a character who was connected to both protagonists and impacted them personally in some way. This left it feeling like the anime wasn't about the main couple but rather about this character and how they deal with revelations about them that leave them wrapped up in doubt and frustration. And with the short amount of episodes, the anime couldn't further explore the couple's story beyond that. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the anime does have a conclusive ending that was the one everyone was waiting to see, and it felt very gratifying. It also has superb animation and attractive character designs that are incredibly pleasing to look at, as well as a top-tier soundtrack. For a show that felt more like an OVA than a full series, it was a pleasant surprise. The two main characters, Haruki and Miou, were both likeable and had unique traits about them which made them stand out from usual romance protagonists as well as being very cute with each other. The anime also focuses on two side couples which are also likeable and enjoyable to see develop and eventually receive a conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nItsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta is a short and sweet little romance series that I think a lot of people have missed, and I think it's exactly what lovers of romance/shoujo anime are looking for. It does all the usual conventions of a love drama in a visually appealing and entertaining fashion but doesn't have much in the way of content, as it remains only 6 episodes long. While it is a cute love story that I overall recommend, in the end it did leave a little more to be desired.\\n\\n",

This is a compact yet sweet story highlighting the emerging love and dreams of two artistic teenagers.\r\nThe story itself is quite heartwarming, even though it does have its own clich\u00e9ness or genericness. While it's a short anime, the amount of plot included in each episode felt perfect. You can think of the timeline as a division of thirds. Starting with the connection, then the breakdown, and lastly the resolution. The other characters didn't had that much screentime compared to the main pair but as supportive characters, they were handled well.This did gave more focus to the MCs, and overall, the progression for their development flowed nicely from the start towards the end. A bit of melodramatic hiccups around the middle part is the only thing that I found to be forceful to their personality. As for their passion in films and drawings respectively, this theme was a welcomed addition to create more layers to the story. Passion is definitely a strong emotion, something akin to a double-edged sword. Stemming from their love of their own aspirations, in certain situations, can lead to depression but the latter more positive side to it is a stronger romantic love. This part was the aspect that engaged me to what would otherwise be a bland narrative.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the art style is the definition of eye-catching. It kept that floating feeling in the air, an atmosphere that warmed my heart at a lot of their interactions. The animation was smooth though in a way, it does get a bit repetitive for their dynamic movement. It's a minor letdown anyways because the blushes and reactions from the characters were still adorable to see. An aspect that I found to be the strongest was the auditory section. Firstly, the OP and ED was catchy and very fun to listen to, especially with the ending song. The harmonious singing-in-tune and overall beat of the song conveyed the pleasant side of this anime. All of the background music that were used also sounded sweet to my ears. Piano is one of my favorite instrument so hearing this familiar sound from a few scenes had a complementing effect on me.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's not a special romantic anime but it had this joyful atmosphere that made me want to see the love development all the way through the end. Certainly was a momentary but enjoyable heartwarmer.",

            "content": "When going into 10 centimeters I expected an anime that was going to be cliched just from the mere title: *Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart*. Having being raised with a Shoujo manga and anime beginning this isn't all that bad to me. Sometimes the most entertaining stories can be those that don't try to stray away from the norm.\r\nItsudatekoi does a pretty good job at realizing what its strengths are and how to best hide its weaknesses. It's a short anime (6 episodes) that explores many of the existential crises that High School seniors go through before graduation. While this show's maintheme is romance, I would say it has a heavier focus on drama because by halfway through we can see the crises that start fostering within the minds of MCs Aida Miou and Haruki Serizawa.\\n\\n\r\nI want this to be spoiler free, so I won't talk about that plot point because each of those characters individual crises are showcased in episode 3 (Aida) and episode 4 (Haruki).\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to the small amount of episodes, these dramatic elements lacked a sense of development. It hits the viewers like a truck and we can understand, at least relate, to their ongoing struggles. But, with the short-time frame, it hits hard and, almost, instantly settles itself. It was like the screenwriters only knew how to build tension, but not transfer that tension into various plot-points within the next couple of episodes. I am not blaming the screenwriters on this because I doubt even great directors like Hosoda or Takahata could have figured out how to properly funnel out all the the dramatic elements into 18 minutes without it feeling rushed or improperly finished. 1 or 2 more episodes would have been massively beneficial for this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters, all of them are easily relatable and fairly realistic. However, they are boring to watch. While I am normally for the trade-off between realism and enjoyment. I just found all the conversations and interactions between the characters to be mundane and lack any sort of progression. And no, a singular scene doesn't save the fact the characters were dry as licking paper.\\n\\n\r\nDo I believe Itsudattekoi is a bad anime? No. I think it's a fine anime with a lot of flaws stemming from its pacing issues, most likely due to its short run-time.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime to someone? That is also very unlikely. There are better romance anime out there that explore these same concepts whether they are or are not in school. However, if you have the time and this is somewhat interesting to you, then you won't be disappointed because its not a bad anime. Just don't expect a top-tier experience.",

            "content": "SPOILER FREE\r\n\"The best moment, one scene, one cut. A movie a compilation of them\"\r\nThis series wasn't one good moment, it was a series of meaningful moments strung together from start to end, like a compilation.\r\nItsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta; well that was mouthful. As it's English name is Our love has always been 10 centimetres apart, so I'm gonna call it \"Our love\" from now on.\r\nWanted to start by saying that I have NOT seen the other two movies, so my review is as a fresh pair of eyes to the franchise.\r\nFor those of you wondering the movies are:\r\nZutto Mae kara Sukideshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai\\n\r\nSuki ni Naru Sono Shunkan wo.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was a cute 6 episode series which told a romance story I really enjoyed. It is not a spectacular or an innovative breakthrough to the romance genre, but is a story worth watching and enjoying.\\n\\n\r\nBreakdown;\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this story progress, for both the main characters and those around them. It was something slightly different to other things I've seen and the ending was well presented in my opinion.\\n\r\nAlso worth saying that 6 episodes is around 144 minutes, which is much longer than the films. For that I'm glad because it didn't feel rushed.\\n\r\nWith a good first episode and good ending, this story was one that I appreciate for sure.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\\n\r\nNice and easy on the eyes. At times colours felt a bit grey, but still looks sharp.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\\n\r\nSome great songs.. but not so great timing. I thought the opening and ending were strong though, especially with how the song complimented the video to reflect the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:8\\n\\n\r\nA fun group of main and side characters. I think the amount of screen time given to all characters were well balanced, so it is easy to see your favourite character. However, none of the characters were unique or inventive. They were fun for the time of watching, but forgettable afterwards. Also I felt like two characters looked way too similar (sure they were related, but it was unrealistic). This may have been for affect but it became distracting at times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\\n\r\nEasy to watch and the drama sure built tension that got me excited. All moments had meaning so there was never a reason not to enjoy. That said \"Our love\" doesn't have the \"it\" factor that to make it a 10/10 enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nAll this said, my review is only from this series. I assume that after watching the films, my thoughts may differ. For now though, \"Our Love\" has been a cute romance, with sweet moments to make me smile.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've got some spare moments I recommend watching.\\n",

            "content": "\"The Colour of Love is that of Fireworks\"\r\n*Spoiler Free*\r\nThe adaption of games is hard, and it'g going to be harder if adapted from a vocaloid. The show introduces itself as a shoujo-like story, following two who are \"destined\" to meet, whilst this might seem a bit cliche, the foundation of the show is actually built consistently on and what you get in the end is a well constructed piece of work\r\nStory 7/10\r\nWhilst taking into consideration it's limited 6 episode, this show really epitomises how to create a good story in the space of a short time. Looking at only one couple from the Honeyworks confessioncommittee serie, it dives straight into the romantic aspect of how the couple feels, the simplicity of the show is it's strength and hence it drew out the potential of the show. This in my opinion is critical especially since the show is only half of that of an average series. For the better or worse the show will be extremely direct in terms of plot driving, but it helps drive the romance within the story.\\n\r\nHowever I felt towards the last few episodes that the story was being held back, preventing the plot from moving on, hence proving to be an unsatisfactory point. Whats more is that although having the hardships of adapting a song, the characters did feel a bit cliche, something I will elaborate on in the character section. Another point is the predictable story, something that is prone to this kind of anime, in that the eventual said ending would be pretty easy to guess if one has been paying attention the whole way. But I digress, what I found more fascinating was the execution of the plot, it was very fluid and I felt that I could always understand what was going on, hence proving to be a strength in the story. Romance wise in terms of plot, made me feel more lonelier than I already am...\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nLay-Duce did a pretty good job in terms of animation and art, nothing felt clunky and at times it looked as though the scenes were drawn by bigger companies like J.C or Kyoani. The landscape of the story was done very beautifully\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nYou can't really complain about the sound and music since this was adapted from a vocaloid and the music was arranged by Honeyworks, I am 100% biased here but the music was perfect, the tone fit every aspect of the plot as it was an essential ingredient to the mood in every scene, a detail that cannot be looked over.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nThe show focuses on a single couple, while trying to show that there are other characters from the cast of 6 in the story, however from the perspective of someone who has never read the original series, listened to the character songs or watched the 2 movies prior to the TV show, they would probably be lost wondering what the characters relations or motives may be. Despite not being a slice-of-life, I felt that it did not explore the school aspect of the said high school students enough, there and there it revealed how each student behaved in class and during break, but there was potential to elaborate on the other features of the school life. Furthermore as mentioned in the story section, I added that the characters seemed a bit cliche, with a shy heroine and a strong yet harbours a secret that weakens the character male lead, with this you can really predict what will eventually happen in the series especially with our said heroine. Nonetheless the character interactions within the plot is well done, and it is shown in the influential decisions that effectively result in character's reactions and emotions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nAs a fan of Honeyworks I was hyped from the moment the series was announced, and while this review may be unreliable, with 6 episodes it was a nice experience to enjoy a short series with not too much to think about\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nItsudatte Bokura no koi wa 10cm datta is a high 8, Whilst music and Story was a high point for the show, I felt that it could've been perfect if they nailed the characters for a better score, and also with a romantic school drama, it is expected that nothing mind blowing would be explored as the genre has already quite reached its limits. Nevertheless the show did very well for 6 episodes whilst competing with other shows in the middle of the Fall season of 2017",

            "content": "Soft spoilers ahead as in just the way I believe this anime will tend to go and did so in the last two movies. Putting this in front just because I tend to be very sensitive when it comes to any type of spoilers, so some of you might not want to read this just yet until they have seen this for yourself.\r\nIt might be standard, cliche or whatever you wanna call it, but at the end of the day it was still pretty good in my honest opinion. I'm not gonna deny the fact that overtime watching the same stuff over and over againhas influenced me in a way so I don't \"enjoy\" these cliche romance animes as much as I used to, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are bad. (I still enjoy them, just not as much as before) Many people tend to believe that because something has already happened in some other anime it's suddenly not as good anymore, which is a rather stupid way of thinking, or atleast that's how I see it.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime so far resembles many romance/shoujo anime and if you have watched a ton, I'm pretty sure you already know what I mean (and If you haven't you shouldn't be quick to judge). What this anime/movies (this whole HoneyWorks thing in general) tries to do is capitalize on these so called cliches and present them as well as they can, and I think they are doing a fairly good job on this.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack was decent, art is my favourite part as usual and characters even though they are completely generic have some sides which I tend to adore a lot. Also I've always wanted this type of a setting where there are a bunch of stories told and they intertwine with each other in a fascinating way, All in all, you shouldn't expect much groundbreaking plot twists from this anime but enjoy it just as it is: a completely generic but well done high-school love story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love these types of anime I guarantee that you will enjoy this quite a bit and if you haven't watched the rest of the story so far go ahead and catch up (there are 2 movies) and if you don't, oh well just go ahead and watch something else :)",

The more dull rather than colorful ensemble of characters ranges from the meek/weak-willed main heroine, the cynical sensei, and the happy-go-lucky blond-haired bishounen. I will say that I did like the secondary characters more than the leads as they were actually really supportive to the main character's struggles.\r\nAnd as frustrating as the characters were, the story, which started as your typical tale of young love, ended up being even more irritating. The story ended up to be a melodramatic, nonsequitur narrative caused by the unreasonable guilt and thinking of the main heroine. Without going into detail, the main character becomes extremely annoying and thinks so poorly of herself it made me lose all pity for her. Additionally the main guy has this strange mental breakdown that makes him question his future and made me question if this anime was under a different genre completely. I would've been happy if they cut out two episodes of the two characters contemplating and walking in circles around each other. \\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, I still admit that each cliche continuously fed my guilty pleasures and I watched the six episodes not completely offended. It was overall sweet and romantic which is what it promised and although I had a lot of problems with the characters and the story I will say that the emotion had me back on board by the end. \\n\\n\r\nWatch this anime if you're bored (and you're really craving some romance), fully expecting the problems that will arise, and just taking it for what it is--a cliched, romantic comedy for teenage girls.",

            "content": "Ok, so here's my opinion:\r\nLet's be honest, we need an opinion of someone who has seen HoneyWorks ever since they started making this saga or, at least, started watching it and comprehended it.\r\nFirst of all, story:\r\nI'm really pleased at all of this, Haruki is a guy who loves making movies as his passion and thanks to the influence of his brother, Chiaki. Miou is a girl who's not only shy, but brave when the moment catch her, she loves painting as a passion even though she categorizes it as a \"hobby\". Both of them had already appeard in a lot of HoneyWorks PVs (including Hatsukoino Ehon, their story's PV) as well as in the past 2 movies: \"Zutto mae Kara suki Deshita\" and \"Suki ni naru sono Shunkan wo\", so people may already had a hint they both liked each other, however, it is not necessary to lean on the movies to know their stories, but otherwise, compliment. Haruki and Miou have a really good relationship but never get to cross their own 10cm distance, that's where the title comes in action \"Our love has always been 10cm apart\" (clever, since the lyrics of Hatsukoi no Ehon touch the same words and topics)\\n\r\nThis series, not only cover and adapts cleverly the songs and manga we've already seen, but also develops the story in its own with some thing we hadn't seen in anyways (like when Haruki got his own self-problem), however, a lot of songs were not covered and were a vital part of the story like Inokori Sensei and Hatsukoi no Ehon -another story- (which takes the song's same name into the point of view of Haruki) but aside of that, everything went nice and smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nSincerely enough, Lay-duce made a better job than Aniplex with the art of the characters, making their characters less \"shiny\" and more plain (in a Lovely Complex style or Kimi ni Todoke), however, most of the scenes were made out poorly. comparated to Yamako's (Mogelatte and Rokuro as well) great work as an artist for Honeyworks' PVs and Mangas. But, it went smoothly and felt really soft and shoujo-like, so, I'm not really mad nor sad about it.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nPerfect enough, I loved how they inteded in making songs with famous utaites like Amatsuki, and some character songs like Kiokemasuka, I'm amased by the content of the albums the group already released (surprisingly enough, all songs appear in the anime except for Romeo which appeared in the latest Honeyworks movie). Another fact we can add is that they didn't use the Chico w/Honeyworks formula for the opening, instead, they used the in-universe idol group \"LIPxLIP\" with the song \"Nonfantasy\" sung by Kouki and Nobunaga. And, you may not know it, but I love when the seiyuus sing in-tone, and the ending felt perfect, it fitted enough for the anime (and the last episode's ending was amasing, a reconstruction of Hatsukoi no Ehon, in the point of view of Aida in the present [this is not counted in as a spoiler since it was announced way before and the song released the same day the anime went airing]). Simply, delightful.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n*EXPECT SPOILERS IN THIS PART, READ WITH CAUTION*\\n\r\nUnlike the last 2 movies and the mangas, here we see a develop in character atmosphere, like Haruki after he realized he was only carrying out his brother's dream instead of his own, driving him crazy. Or Aida when she discovered about her savior, trying to escape from Haruki's wrong reaction. This is not the \"sugar sweet sweet\" couple people were expecting, no, this time, the characters had a deep connection with the background story, giving influence in their decisions. 6 episodes were enough to make my heart race and develop with Aida and Haruki, the best couple HoneyWorks could have (FUN FACT: They were planned to be the only couple in the Kokuhaku no Oto saga, but thanks to their PVs success, they expanded the whole saga universe)\\n\r\nAfter everything that happened, they both changed in their adult ages, both of them grew up and knew how to get afront the \"10 cm\" that were keeping them away.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI TOTALLY ENJOYED THIS ANIME, I was waiting for it ever since they announced it, and totally fell in love with various soundtracs (even though some of the tracks are re-used from past movies). HoneyWorks' fixed the errors they made with the movies, and made them look better, one thing for sure that I liked the most was the abscense of some characters like Hina, Kotaro and Sena. \u00bfThe reason? Obviously enough, because of the focus this couple was getting (I'm still proud of Gero because of his TV-anime debut as a seiyuu). I can't wait for HoneyWorks' next proyect.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

            "content": "Before starting this review, I would just like to say that you CAN watch the other 2 movies after or before watching this. That is because they occur at the same timeline. The only difference being that each focuses on different couples.\r\nHere's the titles of the 2 movies\r\nZutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai\r\nSuki ni Naru Sono Shunkan wo.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai\r\n10 cm. Such as short distance. And yet it is too much to close this gap between these 2 people. No matter what you try, distance in love is not something easily explained. Although the person you love may be right next toyou, you somehow feel that he/she is out of reach, almost impossible to ever meet to get closer. And when that person is on the other side of the world, you feel like you could reach him/her no matter what, holding on to your feelings. This is what 'Itsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta.' explores, the distance between people both literally and metaphorically. It is probably the best part about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is pretty good in my opinion, unless you don't want something a bit cliched. But even if it is, there are some anime series which do better on other things than just uniqueness. This is one of them, I think.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I wouldn't say the story is the best part about this work. I think it was a bit too simplistic. A boy and girl seem to have a good relationship together. A few obstacles appear and this affects their friendship. They try their best to fix things up. That's it. Nothing new about the story, this kind of story has already been explored in many other shows. If I was to pick something unique out of this, it's probably the male lead's hobby, which is film-making. Therefore I gave a 7.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, this series focuses on 1 main couple. They're a very cute couple, whom I strongly wished to get more screen-time when I watched the other 2 movies. Other than the main couple there are other 2 pairs and we see some of their development too (and of course you would see them as well in the other 2 movies).\\n\\n\r\nMiou is a good character, she is very honest and kind (too kind at times). The scenes when she's shy were the ones that made me really like her, it's a cute part of her personality. However her lack of confidence has been a slight problem. Miou was a bit too sensitive to the news about Haruki's brother, blaming herself for the problem. Going a bit overboard there. It felt as if her weakness in perceiving certain things was deliberately made to be an obstacle in her relationship with Haruki, So I lowered the character score to 7.\\n\\n\r\nHaruki is a very likeable character who is presented as someone who enjoys film making a lot, and is friendly to everyone in his club. I really liked the part where he doubted himself, people can always have a time when they're not at their best and start to question their decisions. Maybe he's a bit too good at film-making...\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good, way above average I'd say. Very bright colors are used to create a joyful atmosphere throughout. 10/10. However I was a bit disappointed by the movements, sometimes it really looked forced and repetitive. Of course the sound is good thanks to Honeyworks, both the OP and ED are great. 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe merry atmosphere in the anime is something I must go over on. It's the best aspect of this anime, and I've always seen ever since I watched the other movies. Whenever one or two of the characters are down, there is always someone who cheers them up or helps them out. It's a simple yet essential part of the anime, forming a good development and only strengthening their friendship.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a 9 would be suitable. I'm the type who gives higher scores than most people so... \\n",

            "content": "Riding the wave of the recent popularity of melodramatic teen-dramas with a mixture of coming-of-age and troubles of expressing one\u2019s feeling in fear of them not being mutual proved to be successful in the latest times, not judging the quality of each individual work related to these traits per se. However, one might as well be blind to not see that this particular instalment, harbouring the gloriously long LN-esque title \u201cItsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta\u201d (which I\u2019ll just call \u201cIBnKw10cmD\u201d from now on, because why not?), is just riding off the recent hype concerning these titles in a completely uninspired and passionlessway, not being more than your flavour of the month anxious teen-melodrama. Seriously, go to any middle-schoolyard and you\u2019d find more interesting and above else, qualitative writing than what we\u2019re being presented here could even have a title like SSNT14YO (\u201cStop sending nudes to 14 year-olds\") to compete with the high straightedge the title set itself up in that regard.\\n\r\nOkay, jokes aside. However, funnily enough, as I did my research this Anime series was based off a novel about some Vocaloid songs, which has already been adapted into two movies back in 2016. Whoever thought it would be a good idea to re-adapt IBnKw10cmD into a 6 episode long TV-series is beyond me. And whoever came up with the idea to adapt frickin\u2019 Vocaloid songs deserves an award all for himself.\\n\\n\r\nLast year of high-school arrives and aspiring filmmaker-kun Haruki falls in love or rather grows interested in shy-Japanese girl #45 Miou on first sight, while she\u2019s starring at a cherry blossom on the school-yard, detailing the colours of the blooms in much detail. Sparks of first love arise but is overshadowed by their inability to show each other\u2019s feelings and unsureness in what kind of future they want to see themselves in plus their hilariously dramatic connection to their recent pasts, of what they are still left in the unknown at the start of the series and unironically gets revealed by their teacher of classic Japanese literature by accident, friendly related to Haruki since long ago.\\n\\n\r\nJudging by how I decided to describe our two mains beforehand, it\u2019s a given that I think that they are far from good characters themselves. The ingredients (in terms of characteristics) of both have been thrown into the pot from a recipe so uncreative and generic, that you can predict the features of their character, how they relate to each other and what development they might undergo when conflict happens before you even start watching more than about 10 minutes.\\n\r\nHaruki, dedicated film-maker and aspiring big director in the film-biz falls in love with Miou, but doesn\u2019t seem to be able to close the final gap, leaving his club-work at a stand-still in quality later on, especially when her significant repel towards him happens to strike towards the middle, something I will get to later. While the conflict and essentially the love-story between him and her could\u2019ve been interesting, if it has been dealt with maturely and not in a checkbox-fashion of watered-down \u201cmust-have\u201d events, moments succeeding each other as it was from some kind of robotic formula was apparently the plan to go. The staff of IBnKw10cmD decided to not take any risks and play down the drama in some of the most uninspired ways I have seen to this day and with blandness-kuns on both sides of the romance-spectrum, them keeping me intrigued was out of the possibility as well. And with Haruki, he seems to be just there and wants to make films in the future, falling depressed in the middle for only semi-understandable reasons and makes his final attempt at a confession (which might\u2019ve or might not have worked) in \u201crainy anime confession scene #108\u201d at last. All his interactions, be it with his love-interest or with virtually any other character radically define him as a character with basically nothing of \"character\" in him, just a tool to bring the story forward. #Howtowritegoodprotagonists\\n\\n\r\nThe female counter-part, Miou Aida, is probably as shy as she can humanly get, has a voice that sounds so high-pitched it might as well go above humanly-audible frequencies sooner or later and would represent a non-survivable lifeform in today\u2019s day and age, as the trend of overly-shy anime love interests seem to go on forever. She\u2019s part of the art club, very talented at the art herself, but struggles to find both right words for Haruki or get her feeling on the canvas. The latter characteristic of her is very much undermined through the very forced subplot-line the art club has undergone in middle episodes. Couldn\u2019t they have been even more obvious and/or shiftless in how to depict the emotional conflict of hers across? I mean it\u2019s pretty ironic, that Haruki himself is the sole defender of some sort of subtlety in the final scene of his film project, he would even understand that storytelling like that will turn the show into a boring, chewy experience, at least I\u2019d hope so from someone aspiring to go to film school. But as I have been repeatedly speaking of the conflict which arises between the two main characters, ruining their incredibly \u201cpassionate\u201d moment during episode 2 in hindsight, which ended with a cockblock at a Japanese folklore festival, wearing kimonos and only slightly being cucked before the finishing line (where have I seen this before?), I will have to share the pretty ridiculous plotline initiating that:\\n\\n\r\n***Spoilers***\\n\\n\r\nThe relation between Saku (literature-teacher), the deceased brother of Haruki and Haruki himself has been revealed by complete coincidence, as Miou pays the grave of her saviour back then a visit, where she almost drowned in a nearby river, she meets Saku right before his graveyard. Because of the awkward situation, he reveals his connection to Haruki\u2019s brother, with who he was incredibly good friends with and still visits his grave yearly, to pay respect by laying\u2026a lolly on his grave. It\u2019s been revealed that he chills in his lab coat (classical style for a classical Japanese literature teacher, no question) licking on a lolly 24/7 because school is non-smoking, but laying it down on the grave of a good ol\u2019 bud adds even more bits of hilariousness. However, ignoring that little silly aspect of it is definitely possible, but ignoring the obnoxious feeling of forced drama added to it because of that, going on for three whole episodes, is definitely not doable.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and his brother seems to die because of a cold as he jumped into the water, or at least it\u2019s the only plausible disease which can be deduced by the way he chills at the bed with an IV connected to his body, nigga seems to have gotten it real rough. The other option would be that he drowned during his heroic action, but by the way the show presents it, it could be both.\\n\r\nBut I\u2019ll take it. A grown-ass man dying because of a cold. Great.\\n\\n\r\n***Spoilers-End***\\n\\n\r\nIBnKw10cmD has a small cast of minor characters as well, but their importance to the story (besides those I\u2019ve mentioned in the spoiler section) is utterly negligible and it speaks volumes, that I can neither tell you one name of them (especially the art club) or one single scene of relevance they had in the story. As with most of the show, it\u2019s just there for the sake of being there and never tries to do anything more with them than the bare minimum, basically marking them as extras, gotta love these kinds of series.\\n\\n\r\nAudiovisuals:\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is as average as it can get, regarding the Animation there\u2019s almost nothing notable to say besides that is okay, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s much room for usage of it in a story like this. Gotta add, that two or three scenes were directed decently (lead up to rainy anime confession scene #108), so I won\u2019t be labeled a mindless hater. Otherwise, the directing is as bland as it gets as well, doesn't really give me an opportunity to comment on any aspect specifically.\\n\r\nVA is fine in general, but with the soundtrack, they struck another nerve of mine, as it has been basically varying only two things the entire series:\\n\\n\r\n- Slow piano music on constant repeat, as engaging, eclectic, or beautiful as elevator music.\\n\\n\r\n- \u266b\u266b\u266b Bokura koi suru nan jyu nen nan byaku nen demo,\\n\r\nHikare aun dayo marude mahou no yoni,\\n\r\nAno ne konya yume no naka de wa,\\n\r\nKimi wa boku to koi ni ochiteru,\\n\r\nKiite mirai egaku ehon de,\\n\r\nKimi wo boku to ai wo mitsukeru,\\n\r\nItazura wo suru koi no kamisama,\\n\r\nKimi wo kidzutsuke nakaseta no nara,\\n\r\nBoku wa akuma ni nachauyo,\\n\r\nBokura koi suru nan jyu nen nan byaku nen demo,\\n\r\nHikare aun dayo marude mahou no yoni,\\n\r\nDeau mae kara sagashite ita yo kimi wo,\\n\r\nHiki sakareta ate ai de tsunagateru,\\n\r\nHatsukoi zutto nan jyu nen nan byaku nen demo,\\n\r\nSoshite kasanari aun da boku no monogatari to. \u266b\u266b\u266b\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, over the past years of watching Anime I\u2019ve grown weak. Weak in a sense, that I am way less resilient to series that are not even trying to derive from the fool-proof formula of genericism, offer a pot of \u201cmeh\u201d in virtually every single category and don\u2019t feel like anything but an attempt to strike some quick $ $ $, basically a product with no heart or value in it, just commerce. And with this show, we have basically found our prime suspect, a summation of underwhelming aspects, which makes a borderline terrible show as a whole. Fast Food at its finest.\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a much better coming-of-age story including the incredibly similar set-up of the search for passion for a single, unique subject (like Haruki and his film-making), try out \u201cWhisper of the Heart\u201d by Studio Ghibli. You can thank me later.\\n\\n\r\nStory (4/10)\\n\r\nArt (5/10), Animation (6/10)\\n\r\nSound (4/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10)",

Since i'm not used to write any. \r\nI'm also quite indecisive about if i should write a \"review\" about one episode i watched or just ignore this monstrosity altogether. But since this anime has apparently only 6 episodes. I'd give myself the freedom to do so. Let's do this :\r\nArt : The art in this anime is quite decent.Although the characters look bland and typical. Scenery-wise the art looks fine, but the character design is appalling. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound quality is mediocre. The voice actors sound a bit flat. But they seem to be doing a fair job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : Dull, bland, uninspired and utterly average... Every tedious clich\u00e9 you could find in the book was assembled to form those banal 1D characters. Their interactions are quite boring as well.

It's distasteful and trite.  \\n\r\nI dare say it's worst than those god awful and deplorable ecchi-harems/otome game adaptations.\\n",

            "content": "No matter what people might say, I personally like the HoneyWorks anime franchise. As of now, the story from their original music videos was adapted into two, hour-lenght movies, and this six episode series. The first movie focused on all of our three main couples, and I enjoyed it quite a lot. The second one was worse in comparison, the characters were especially weaker, but it still remained on the positive side of things. And now we have this. A short six episode series resolving around one of the main couples. Did it live up to the potential? For me, certainly yes.\r\nFirst question that comesto mind is, do you have to watch the movies to understand this series? Not really, it stays pretty independent from each other. But if you like romantic stories, there is no reason not to do so. It's a good watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, let's get to the bussines. The story is centered around one of the couples from the first movie: Miou Aida and Haruki Serizawa. I called them a couple, which technically shouldn't be the case because they're not dating or anything yet, but that doesn't really matter. This is a straightforward romance. No love-triangle, just pure one on one. Which is a really good thing. Being a short anime, the decision to focus only on one couple is welcome and we get to see the story around them develop a lot during the time. \\n\\n\r\nMiou is a shy and a self-confidence lacking girl, that enjoys painting more than anything. It's her own way of forgetting her problems, and she is both more lively and cheerful when she's in an artist environment. While being shy when talking to other people, it's not done over the top. It is always hard to balance out the personality traits of characters, especially when they are so over-used as the confidence lacking characters are. Miou however, is a case of a well made one. She's more quiet, but has her own sweet and happy moments. She can do something you wouldn't expect from her. And despite her falling into depression at a certain point, her motives to do so are understandable and her recovery is a well-fought battle.\\n\\n\r\nHaruki seems, unlike Miou, as an outgoing and forward type of guy. He holds a passion for movie-making, around which the whole plot of the show evolves. Despite his first given impression, whenever he's alone with Miou, he tends to get nervous aswell, not having the guts to even hold her hand. The good thing on Haruki is that he's extremely realistic as far as his personality goes. I can see myself in him. And I think it's that touch of reality that makes him a good character, because if we were talking about the other things he does or doesn't, he's as straight-forward as it goes. Ya know, he's good-looking, outgoing, friendly and a \"leader of the gang\". Despite all that, I still like him. Because the show did a really good job at showing both good and bad personality traits of both of our characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing of the show in itself is something, I would like to talk about for a bit. You see, incase you don't know yet, this is a romance drama. And the word drama can also mean trouble, as the modern animes seem to find it harder and harder to do a proper, not over the top drama that fits the atmosphere well. Which is not the case this time around. It could be actually called the carrying point of this show. Starts of slow and nicely, then suddenly picks up the pace at both ends, and although the peak could be called maybe a little too dramatic, I think I would just be nitpicking at that moment. The setup is decent, the turn-around respectable and the resolution nearly fabulous. I do find the two main characters written well too. They are lacking a bit at certain times, but that just adds to the fact that this show does it's best at making them beliavable.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're familiar with this franchise, you also know that there are three main couples overall. That's true in the grand scheme of things, but the other two just play the supporting role in this one. Akari + Souta and Natsuki + Yuu. Considering how things went in the first movie, I think and I hope that they will both get their own short animes, like Miou and Haruki did. They deserve it. Atleast Akari with Souta do, I find the two to be destined for each other. Anyways, these four are written in about the same way as the two. Different personalities, but every one of them feels realistic with their behaving, especially in the romantic moments. And despite their romance being cut off this time, they still work well as a supportive cast acting like High School friends do.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Itsudatte Boku- whatever 10 cm, is a quality show. And it's hell of a fun to watch. Despite not impressing me that much at the start, the show made me appreciate it's strong points and I wanted to see more and more every week. It's not as rememberable as I would like to, but to be honest, which school romance anime is? For me it's important that the show besides it's own selling points also had a big entertainment value. While it was seeing Miou and Haruki together or alone, I never started doubting their purpose in the show and I never got bored of them. Which can be said about their story aswell. Just a cherry on top of all things I've said is a very well made ending, that warms your heart to the core.\\n\\n\r\nThe general looks of this are really good. I always liked the desings of all the characters, which haven't changed since the movies. That stays the same and I still find it pleasant to look at. The animation feels on-point most of the time, despite not showing that many hard-effort scenes or moments.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the music of the movies. Both the vocal and ambient OST played a big role in them and I still find them very nice to listen to. That being said, no vocal songs aside from opening and ending were used in this one. Which is a shame in my opinion, as exactly these types of animes are the ones that would deserve it. The ambient OST stays almost the same, but felt a little less impactful than was before. Overall, despite the music taking a step back, it still be considered a huge plus when not comparing to the prequel movies. \\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\\n\r\nItsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta is a great example of a show that focused on the things an anime of this genre should have. It presents a well made dramatic story with a respectable cast around it. And with the fair producion value qualities, I just can't do anything else but say: This anime was a pleasure to watch.",

The most unique aspects of the show is its being short and the eye catching art it has , I bet no one would get bored of it if it is this long which I think is a positive thing for an anime like this , the overall sounding is done pretty good too it won't tire you throughout the show and the OP and ED are both above average.\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something cute and casual that won't take much of your time and help you relax , this is the anime for you.",

Granted, the episodes add up to one long a** movie, but I feel this method of focusing solely on Miou and Haruki did some good. Of course the movie was a good definition of a cheesy teenage romance, yet it wasn't distasteful cheese. It was like an \"I'm in the mood for this cheese\" cheesy. Andeven for a tantalizing romance, the ending had its mature parts. Although the conflict was a bit too weak for my liking, I don't think there's anything bad the viewers can't grasp from the trailer or name of the show\\n\\n\r\nArt:The art is once again beautiful and perfect for the setting and tone.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound weren't bad. Nothing extraordinary about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I feel like the highlight of the show are the two protagonists and the fact that all of the other characters were finally in their rightful roles: barely-relevant supporting characters!!! There are many romance anime (and shows in general) that either only focus on one character or don't delve into the love birds' personal stories at all. Both sides of the romance had backstories, goals, and hobbies, and the actual love story wasn't the sole focus. I got to know more about the characters which I felt made the love story more sell-able. I've already said it on multiple accounts that I find some of the other characters rather cliche and/or annoying, but at least they weren't main characters and were shoved into a more secondary role.",

The real reason I started this review was just so I can have it on record how much I absolutely ADORE the ED for this anime. Don't get me wrong the OP is ok, but the ending themeis my favorite ED of all time, I literally cannot watch it without wanting to tear up.

            "content": "Before I start I want to say that I haven't seen the two prequel movies that preceded this series, which have a more general focus on characters that appear in this anime. This series in particular focuses mainly on one of the couples that appear in the two films, and it isn't necessary to watch them before proceeding with this series. With that, I'd like to come out and say that I think this anime has been slept on considerably; it's a cute little romance story that would definitely be appreciated by a lot of people who need their romance fix when they've run outof things to watch. It's a very straightforward shoujo-like plot that doesn't do much new, but goes through the usual conventions in a very beautiful and enjoyable way.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons why I like this show is because it does exactly what people want to see out of a drama-romance anime; with it's short length (only 6 episodes), it forces the story forward without much in the way of pointless filler or storylines that don't correlate with the main narrative. This gives it great pacing in my opinion with the constraints given. However this was also a negative for me; the main story they chose to focus on was one about a character who was connected to both protagonists and impacted them personally in some way. This left it feeling like the anime wasn't about the main couple but rather about this character and how they deal with revelations about them that leave them wrapped up in doubt and frustration. And with the short amount of episodes, the anime couldn't further explore the couple's story beyond that. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the anime does have a conclusive ending that was the one everyone was waiting to see, and it felt very gratifying. It also has superb animation and attractive character designs that are incredibly pleasing to look at, as well as a top-tier soundtrack. For a show that felt more like an OVA than a full series, it was a pleasant surprise. The two main characters, Haruki and Miou, were both likeable and had unique traits about them which made them stand out from usual romance protagonists as well as being very cute with each other. The anime also focuses on two side couples which are also likeable and enjoyable to see develop and eventually receive a conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nItsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta is a short and sweet little romance series that I think a lot of people have missed, and I think it's exactly what lovers of romance/shoujo anime are looking for. It does all the usual conventions of a love drama in a visually appealing and entertaining fashion but doesn't have much in the way of content, as it remains only 6 episodes long. While it is a cute love story that I overall recommend, in the end it did leave a little more to be desired.\\n\\n",

This is a compact yet sweet story highlighting the emerging love and dreams of two artistic teenagers.\r\nThe story itself is quite heartwarming, even though it does have its own clich\u00e9ness or genericness. While it's a short anime, the amount of plot included in each episode felt perfect. You can think of the timeline as a division of thirds. Starting with the connection, then the breakdown, and lastly the resolution. The other characters didn't had that much screentime compared to the main pair but as supportive characters, they were handled well.This did gave more focus to the MCs, and overall, the progression for their development flowed nicely from the start towards the end. A bit of melodramatic hiccups around the middle part is the only thing that I found to be forceful to their personality. As for their passion in films and drawings respectively, this theme was a welcomed addition to create more layers to the story. Passion is definitely a strong emotion, something akin to a double-edged sword. Stemming from their love of their own aspirations, in certain situations, can lead to depression but the latter more positive side to it is a stronger romantic love. This part was the aspect that engaged me to what would otherwise be a bland narrative.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the art style is the definition of eye-catching. It kept that floating feeling in the air, an atmosphere that warmed my heart at a lot of their interactions. The animation was smooth though in a way, it does get a bit repetitive for their dynamic movement. It's a minor letdown anyways because the blushes and reactions from the characters were still adorable to see. An aspect that I found to be the strongest was the auditory section. Firstly, the OP and ED was catchy and very fun to listen to, especially with the ending song. The harmonious singing-in-tune and overall beat of the song conveyed the pleasant side of this anime. All of the background music that were used also sounded sweet to my ears. Piano is one of my favorite instrument so hearing this familiar sound from a few scenes had a complementing effect on me.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's not a special romantic anime but it had this joyful atmosphere that made me want to see the love development all the way through the end. Certainly was a momentary but enjoyable heartwarmer.",

            "content": "When going into 10 centimeters I expected an anime that was going to be cliched just from the mere title: *Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart*. Having being raised with a Shoujo manga and anime beginning this isn't all that bad to me. Sometimes the most entertaining stories can be those that don't try to stray away from the norm.\r\nItsudatekoi does a pretty good job at realizing what its strengths are and how to best hide its weaknesses. It's a short anime (6 episodes) that explores many of the existential crises that High School seniors go through before graduation. While this show's maintheme is romance, I would say it has a heavier focus on drama because by halfway through we can see the crises that start fostering within the minds of MCs Aida Miou and Haruki Serizawa.\\n\\n\r\nI want this to be spoiler free, so I won't talk about that plot point because each of those characters individual crises are showcased in episode 3 (Aida) and episode 4 (Haruki).\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to the small amount of episodes, these dramatic elements lacked a sense of development. It hits the viewers like a truck and we can understand, at least relate, to their ongoing struggles. But, with the short-time frame, it hits hard and, almost, instantly settles itself. It was like the screenwriters only knew how to build tension, but not transfer that tension into various plot-points within the next couple of episodes. I am not blaming the screenwriters on this because I doubt even great directors like Hosoda or Takahata could have figured out how to properly funnel out all the the dramatic elements into 18 minutes without it feeling rushed or improperly finished. 1 or 2 more episodes would have been massively beneficial for this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters, all of them are easily relatable and fairly realistic. However, they are boring to watch. While I am normally for the trade-off between realism and enjoyment. I just found all the conversations and interactions between the characters to be mundane and lack any sort of progression. And no, a singular scene doesn't save the fact the characters were dry as licking paper.\\n\\n\r\nDo I believe Itsudattekoi is a bad anime? No. I think it's a fine anime with a lot of flaws stemming from its pacing issues, most likely due to its short run-time.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime to someone? That is also very unlikely. There are better romance anime out there that explore these same concepts whether they are or are not in school. However, if you have the time and this is somewhat interesting to you, then you won't be disappointed because its not a bad anime. Just don't expect a top-tier experience.",

A movie a compilation of them\"\r\nThis series wasn't one good moment, it was a series of meaningful moments strung together from start to end, like a compilation.\r\nItsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta; well that was mouthful. As it's English name is Our love has always been 10 centimetres apart, so I'm gonna call it \"Our love\" from now on.\r\nWanted to start by saying that I have NOT seen the other two movies, so my review is as a fresh pair of eyes to the franchise.\r\nFor those of you wondering the movies are:\r\nZutto Mae kara Sukideshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai\\n\r\nSuki ni Naru Sono Shunkan wo.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was a cute 6 episode series which told a romance story I really enjoyed. It is not a spectacular or an innovative breakthrough to the romance genre, but is a story worth watching and enjoying.\\n\\n\r\nBreakdown;\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this story progress, for both the main characters and those around them. It was something slightly different to other things I've seen and the ending was well presented in my opinion.\\n\r\nAlso worth saying that 6 episodes is around 144 minutes, which is much longer than the films. For that I'm glad because it didn't feel rushed.\\n\r\nWith a good first episode and good ending, this story was one that I appreciate for sure.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\\n\r\nNice and easy on the eyes. At times colours felt a bit grey, but still looks sharp.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\\n\r\nSome great songs.. but not so great timing. I thought the opening and ending were strong though, especially with how the song complimented the video to reflect the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:8\\n\\n\r\nA fun group of main and side characters. I think the amount of screen time given to all characters were well balanced, so it is easy to see your favourite character. However, none of the characters were unique or inventive. They were fun for the time of watching, but forgettable afterwards. Also I felt like two characters looked way too similar (sure they were related, but it was unrealistic). This may have been for affect but it became distracting at times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\\n\r\nEasy to watch and the drama sure built tension that got me excited. All moments had meaning so there was never a reason not to enjoy. That said \"Our love\" doesn't have the \"it\" factor that to make it a 10/10 enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nAll this said, my review is only from this series. I assume that after watching the films, my thoughts may differ. For now though, \"Our Love\" has been a cute romance, with sweet moments to make me smile.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've got some spare moments I recommend watching.\\n",

            "content": "\"The Colour of Love is that of Fireworks\"\r\n*Spoiler Free*\r\nThe adaption of games is hard, and it'g going to be harder if adapted from a vocaloid. The show introduces itself as a shoujo-like story, following two who are \"destined\" to meet, whilst this might seem a bit cliche, the foundation of the show is actually built consistently on and what you get in the end is a well constructed piece of work\r\nStory 7/10\r\nWhilst taking into consideration it's limited 6 episode, this show really epitomises how to create a good story in the space of a short time. Looking at only one couple from the Honeyworks confessioncommittee serie, it dives straight into the romantic aspect of how the couple feels, the simplicity of the show is it's strength and hence it drew out the potential of the show. This in my opinion is critical especially since the show is only half of that of an average series. For the better or worse the show will be extremely direct in terms of plot driving, but it helps drive the romance within the story.\\n\r\nHowever I felt towards the last few episodes that the story was being held back, preventing the plot from moving on, hence proving to be an unsatisfactory point. Whats more is that although having the hardships of adapting a song, the characters did feel a bit cliche, something I will elaborate on in the character section. Another point is the predictable story, something that is prone to this kind of anime, in that the eventual said ending would be pretty easy to guess if one has been paying attention the whole way. But I digress, what I found more fascinating was the execution of the plot, it was very fluid and I felt that I could always understand what was going on, hence proving to be a strength in the story. Romance wise in terms of plot, made me feel more lonelier than I already am...\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nLay-Duce did a pretty good job in terms of animation and art, nothing felt clunky and at times it looked as though the scenes were drawn by bigger companies like J.C or Kyoani. The landscape of the story was done very beautifully\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nYou can't really complain about the sound and music since this was adapted from a vocaloid and the music was arranged by Honeyworks, I am 100% biased here but the music was perfect, the tone fit every aspect of the plot as it was an essential ingredient to the mood in every scene, a detail that cannot be looked over.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nThe show focuses on a single couple, while trying to show that there are other characters from the cast of 6 in the story, however from the perspective of someone who has never read the original series, listened to the character songs or watched the 2 movies prior to the TV show, they would probably be lost wondering what the characters relations or motives may be. Despite not being a slice-of-life, I felt that it did not explore the school aspect of the said high school students enough, there and there it revealed how each student behaved in class and during break, but there was potential to elaborate on the other features of the school life. Furthermore as mentioned in the story section, I added that the characters seemed a bit cliche, with a shy heroine and a strong yet harbours a secret that weakens the character male lead, with this you can really predict what will eventually happen in the series especially with our said heroine. Nonetheless the character interactions within the plot is well done, and it is shown in the influential decisions that effectively result in character's reactions and emotions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nAs a fan of Honeyworks I was hyped from the moment the series was announced, and while this review may be unreliable, with 6 episodes it was a nice experience to enjoy a short series with not too much to think about\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nItsudatte Bokura no koi wa 10cm datta is a high 8, Whilst music and Story was a high point for the show, I felt that it could've been perfect if they nailed the characters for a better score, and also with a romantic school drama, it is expected that nothing mind blowing would be explored as the genre has already quite reached its limits. Nevertheless the show did very well for 6 episodes whilst competing with other shows in the middle of the Fall season of 2017",

            "content": "Soft spoilers ahead as in just the way I believe this anime will tend to go and did so in the last two movies. Putting this in front just because I tend to be very sensitive when it comes to any type of spoilers, so some of you might not want to read this just yet until they have seen this for yourself.\r\nIt might be standard, cliche or whatever you wanna call it, but at the end of the day it was still pretty good in my honest opinion. I'm not gonna deny the fact that overtime watching the same stuff over and over againhas influenced me in a way so I don't \"enjoy\" these cliche romance animes as much as I used to, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are bad. (I still enjoy them, just not as much as before) Many people tend to believe that because something has already happened in some other anime it's suddenly not as good anymore, which is a rather stupid way of thinking, or atleast that's how I see it.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime so far resembles many romance/shoujo anime and if you have watched a ton, I'm pretty sure you already know what I mean (and If you haven't you shouldn't be quick to judge). What this anime/movies (this whole HoneyWorks thing in general) tries to do is capitalize on these so called cliches and present them as well as they can, and I think they are doing a fairly good job on this.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack was decent, art is my favourite part as usual and characters even though they are completely generic have some sides which I tend to adore a lot. Also I've always wanted this type of a setting where there are a bunch of stories told and they intertwine with each other in a fascinating way, All in all, you shouldn't expect much groundbreaking plot twists from this anime but enjoy it just as it is: a completely generic but well done high-school love story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love these types of anime I guarantee that you will enjoy this quite a bit and if you haven't watched the rest of the story so far go ahead and catch up (there are 2 movies) and if you don't, oh well just go ahead and watch something else :)",

The more dull rather than colorful ensemble of characters ranges from the meek/weak-willed main heroine, the cynical sensei, and the happy-go-lucky blond-haired bishounen. I will say that I did like the secondary characters more than the leads as they were actually really supportive to the main character's struggles.\r\nAnd as frustrating as the characters were, the story, which started as your typical tale of young love, ended up being even more irritating. The story ended up to be a melodramatic, nonsequitur narrative caused by the unreasonable guilt and thinking of the main heroine. Without going into detail, the main character becomes extremely annoying and thinks so poorly of herself it made me lose all pity for her. Additionally the main guy has this strange mental breakdown that makes him question his future and made me question if this anime was under a different genre completely. I would've been happy if they cut out two episodes of the two characters contemplating and walking in circles around each other. \\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, I still admit that each cliche continuously fed my guilty pleasures and I watched the six episodes not completely offended. It was overall sweet and romantic which is what it promised and although I had a lot of problems with the characters and the story I will say that the emotion had me back on board by the end. \\n\\n\r\nWatch this anime if you're bored (and you're really craving some romance), fully expecting the problems that will arise, and just taking it for what it is--a cliched, romantic comedy for teenage girls.",

Again just overcoming obstacles and closing that 10 CM distance really made this a great anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If an anime can make me cry and screaming because I want something to happen, then that makes for a really great anime.

Miou is a girl who's not only shy, but brave when the moment catch her, she loves painting as a passion even though she categorizes it as a \"hobby\". Both of them had already appeard in a lot of HoneyWorks PVs (including Hatsukoino Ehon, their story's PV) as well as in the past 2 movies: \"Zutto mae Kara suki Deshita\" and \"Suki ni naru sono Shunkan wo\", so people may already had a hint they both liked each other, however, it is not necessary to lean on the movies to know their stories, but otherwise, compliment. Haruki and Miou have a really good relationship but never get to cross their own 10cm distance, that's where the title comes in action \"Our love has always been 10cm apart\" (clever, since the lyrics of Hatsukoi no Ehon touch the same words and topics)\\n\r\nThis series, not only cover and adapts cleverly the songs and manga we've already seen, but also develops the story in its own with some thing we hadn't seen in anyways (like when Haruki got his own self-problem), however, a lot of songs were not covered and were a vital part of the story like Inokori Sensei and Hatsukoi no Ehon -another story- (which takes the song's same name into the point of view of Haruki) but aside of that, everything went nice and smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nSincerely enough, Lay-duce made a better job than Aniplex with the art of the characters, making their characters less \"shiny\" and more plain (in a Lovely Complex style or Kimi ni Todoke), however, most of the scenes were made out poorly. comparated to Yamako's (Mogelatte and Rokuro as well) great work as an artist for Honeyworks' PVs and Mangas. But, it went smoothly and felt really soft and shoujo-like, so, I'm not really mad nor sad about it.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nPerfect enough, I loved how they inteded in making songs with famous utaites like Amatsuki, and some character songs like Kiokemasuka, I'm amased by the content of the albums the group already released (surprisingly enough, all songs appear in the anime except for Romeo which appeared in the latest Honeyworks movie). Another fact we can add is that they didn't use the Chico w/Honeyworks formula for the opening, instead, they used the in-universe idol group \"LIPxLIP\" with the song \"Nonfantasy\" sung by Kouki and Nobunaga. And, you may not know it, but I love when the seiyuus sing in-tone, and the ending felt perfect, it fitted enough for the anime (and the last episode's ending was amasing, a reconstruction of Hatsukoi no Ehon, in the point of view of Aida in the present [this is not counted in as a spoiler since it was announced way before and the song released the same day the anime went airing]). Simply, delightful.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n*EXPECT SPOILERS IN THIS PART, READ WITH CAUTION*\\n\r\nUnlike the last 2 movies and the mangas, here we see a develop in character atmosphere, like Haruki after he realized he was only carrying out his brother's dream instead of his own, driving him crazy. Or Aida when she discovered about her savior, trying to escape from Haruki's wrong reaction. This is not the \"sugar sweet sweet\" couple people were expecting, no, this time, the characters had a deep connection with the background story, giving influence in their decisions. 6 episodes were enough to make my heart race and develop with Aida and Haruki, the best couple HoneyWorks could have (FUN FACT: They were planned to be the only couple in the Kokuhaku no Oto saga, but thanks to their PVs success, they expanded the whole saga universe)\\n\r\nAfter everything that happened, they both changed in their adult ages, both of them grew up and knew how to get afront the \"10 cm\" that were keeping them away.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI TOTALLY ENJOYED THIS ANIME, I was waiting for it ever since they announced it, and totally fell in love with various soundtracs (even though some of the tracks are re-used from past movies). HoneyWorks' fixed the errors they made with the movies, and made them look better, one thing for sure that I liked the most was the abscense of some characters like Hina, Kotaro and Sena. \u00bfThe reason? Obviously enough, because of the focus this couple was getting (I'm still proud of Gero because of his TV-anime debut as a seiyuu). I can't wait for HoneyWorks' next proyect.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

This seemed interesting in its own way so I stuck by since it was only 6 episodes. They pack in a lot in just those 6 episodes, you really get to know what they went thru and I cried. \r\nThe only thing I didn't really like was Miou's voice. It was so highpitched and soft that it was annoying. I loved the the drama and how they had to deal with it and how theyboth needed each other to realize what they want. I recommended this to my husband and he totally loved it too!!",

This show is riding the whole \"misunderstanding/miscommunication' wave TOO hard. It literally makes something that much harder to watch when the problem or in this case, the miscommunication could be fixed with a simple exchange of words! I'm stopping almost every 5 min out of anger to rant because of Miou's thoughts and decisions. I get the whole not being confident and shy but GEE WILLIKERS ease up on the poor-decision making/ thought process. It's not hard to makethe conflict in an anime interesting. Like WOW. It got hard to watch. I am going to continue watching because I've watched almost every romance anime there is and I felt like watching one and had no other choice unless I wanted to re-watch something. But as stated in the first sentence, I'm only on episode 4 so hopefully, it can redeem itself but honestly if I watch this episode and they are still on the same problem it will be looking grim...",
