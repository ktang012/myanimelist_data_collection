            "content": "Going back to One Punch Man, I really thought of something. Something that can make or break this show to several of its viewers. And that's the joke. The one prominent singular joke. \r\nI'm not saying this is going to be a completely balanced review. And most of you might get upset over that fact, and even start to hate me for it too. And I can understand why. I would hate it if someone didn't provide both sides to the argument for my favorite show, but keep in mind that I am not authoritative force, and I cannot dictate how or what you shouldthink. For all you know, you might just stumble a 4 paragraph post by me describing how shoving hotdogs up your ass is actually a good thing. But I'm hoping that maybe next time you go to the grill, you can ponder on what you're going to do with that hotdog. Or maybe you still won't do that, but you'll at least know why some people might like sticking hotdogs up their ass. But anyways, let's get on with this review.\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man has got to be one of the most commonly talked about show I've seen this year, even impacting the smash community when one of the smash player's shaved their beard and started using Ryu. In all honesty, how many shows can you say do that? But does this fulfill the hype, and is this the savior of anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you are like me, and expected One Punch Man to be a satire, then you will be disappointed. Rather than making fun of its tropes directly, One Punch Man parodies it instead by over-exaggerating them to the point where it becomes funny. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily, but there are problems with that. With the already ridiculous start of the series, it makes it hard to enjoy the jokes when they are virtually indistinguishable. You can't top off something so exaggerated, similar to how you can't top off beating an enemy with a single punch. Because of this, as the series went on, the joke lost its charm as it wasn't special anymore. After seeing a couple of episodes, you know what to expect from it, which really damaged the comedy effect. And yes, the final episodes did stray away from that, but even that was just a elongated scene of what was soon going to happen. If you really look at it, it was just Saitama getting beaten up with a variety of attacks.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem of One Punch Man getting repetitive may seem like a small thing, but in fact, it really isn't. When a comedy starts to get unappealing, there isn't much that can save that. The parody is all that One Punch Man seemed to offer, and if you don't like that, than you definitely won't like the show. \\n\\n\r\nNear the end, it was hinted that the focus will eventually shift from the parody aspect to the side characters, something that would benefit the series as the more \"Slice of Life\" aspects where the strong suit of One Punch Man, but for now, the first season is all we got.\\n\\n\r\nYou could say that being repetitive and anticlimactic is the point of One Punch Man, and it in itself is actually also parodying the repetitive nature of most action shows, but I disagree. There should be something that would want to make the watcher come back for more. Your daily life as a human being isn't characterized by the same exact thing each time. Maybe the steps building up to 'the punchline' are different, or maybe you don't  exactly engage with 'the punchline' each time. The moment in this case is the same exact thing, with the only differences being how the villains look or where the fight is taking place. What kind of show is engaging, but doesn't have an engaging story? Even if that was the point, how is it fun to watch the same thing 12 times?\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the parody aspect of it, then the repetitiveness of the joke shouldn't be a problem for you, but if you wanted a bit more than just that, then you won't be getting that from One Punch Man.\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone tells you that the animation of One Punch Man is bad, then they're just trying to shit on the show for the sake of shitting on the show. Though inconsistent at times, the show looked amazing when it called for a fight scene, and average at least when it called for a more Slice of Life moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe music did a good job in making you hyped and excited for each fight and episodes. It's not something I could see anyone listening outside from this anime, but it's good nevertheless in enhancing the show.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say in such a simple show like this. I'll ask once again if it wasn't clear the first 100 times. Did you like the joke, or did you not? After you found that out, you'll know what to do.",

            "content": "This is a complete review after watching all 12 episodes of One Punch Man.\r\n**CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS**\r\nI remember when I was 8 years old, I used to be excited for a new Pokemon episode everyday. I used to run from school to my house so that I wouldn\u2019t miss any single moment. Then as you grow up, such excitement starts to fade away. No matter how good a show is, only a few shows can generate such an excitement for a viewer. I never would\u2019ve imagined that an anime would make me feel that excitement again at 20 yrs. And lucky for me, it aired onSundays!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man\u2019s story is simple- The story of an average guy who\u2019s a hero for fun. Now what makes this unique is that this show is a parody. For people new to that genre, it\u2019s an imitation of other work. Basically what this anime does is it makes a parody out of shounen genre, where you have a male protagonist who gets beaten down, and then trains or in some other way defeats the bad guy. Here, the MC is just over-powered to the extent that he gets depressed there\u2019s no one strong enough to challenge him. You might think that such a strong person would be revered as a God by the people. Sadly, you\u2019re mistaken. The people don\u2019t even know he exists!! . This really plays a major point in the later episodes, when Saitama has to show his strength infront of the public, and becomes one of the highlight of this series. This show was created to poke fun at all tropes in anime. This is a story made to enjoy, not to be taken seriously. Anyone who is open-minded will enjoy this anime to its full extent.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow the only reason I gave this a 9 is because of the meticulously high standard set by Ufotable in the Fate series and Kara no Kyoukai movies. But by no means is it far behind. In most anime, usually the MC has some kind of weapon, you can just add some flashy effects to go with it. But here, we have a hero who\u2019s weapon are just his fists . The fights had to be carefully drawn and animated. And when you have a studio like Madhouse doing it, you know they rarely disappoint. Fluid motion, spectacular effects, no weird faces, nothing overdramatic. Simple, yet awesome. The best part of this anime has to be the \u201cSaitama Expressions\u201d. If you didn\u2019t smile atleast a little when you saw the \u201cOK\u201d face, then I guess your sense of humour is locked up somewhere. Madhouse know how to make the viewer enjoy the anime to the full extent. The way they used Tatsumaki\u2019s \u201cchibi mode\u201d expressions from the webcomic, and boldly animated it in the anime deserves separate praise. Also the landscape for OPM universe is also brilliant. Even the ordinary people are drawn with careful details. Another important aspect here is the design for the villains, especially Sea King and Boros, each having something unique, and they give out the \u201cstrong, badass\u201d vibe when you just look at them.  Also, the art in the final episode is 11/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGod-level. Simply eargasmic. When you have an opening theme that makes you want to shout \u201cONE PUUUUUUUNCH!\u201d every time you hear it, you know the soundtrack\u2019s gonna be amazing. For me, the first thing I\u2019d hear in my mind every morning when I wake up is someone shouting \u201cONE PUUUUUUNCH!\u201d That\u2019s how much I love that opening theme. From character bgm\u2019s to fight themes, the music suits every situation perfectly, making them more epic. I would rewatch every episode again just to hear the music, that\u2019s how good it is. The voice acting is also brilliant, especially Aoi Yuuki, who brilliantly brought out Tatsumaki\u2019s bratty voice, and Yuki Kaji, whose voice fits Sonic\u2019s character perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOnce in a lifetime you watch shows where every character in it makes an impact. One Punch Man is mine. I can probably name every single character that appeared in these 12 episodes. That\u2019s how much of an impact they make. Saitama with his care-free attitude, the loyal cyborg Genos, Jack\u2019o Lantern Panic, Brattymaki, Justice Rider, the S-class heroes like Silver Fang, Metal Bat, Pri-Pri Prisoner, King, and all the others have a uniqueness that makes you remember them. Even characters whom play a cameo like Carnage Kabuto, Mosquito Girl, Snek, Stinger, Amai Mask manage to leave an impression, which is something most anime fail to do. And when you have such a strong character cast, the anime rarely falters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was made to enjoy, and One Punch Man nails the formula. I enjoyed every second of it. 24x12 minutes of pure awesomeness. It makes you laugh, the \u201cwow\u201d feeling when you watch those spectacularly animated fight scenes, even the simple dialogues between the characters make you laugh hard. There is no walking in on naked girl scenes, boob-grabbing, fan service and other shit like that. This anime makes me remember that Charlie Chaplin didn\u2019t have to talk to make people laugh and enjoy his movies. Just his reactions and expressions were enough. And Saitama\u2019s expressions and reactions reminded me of that again. And no matter how many times you rewatch it, you\u2019ll never get bored. That\u2019s the kind of masterpiece this is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is a masterpiece. I\u2019ve been watching anime for about 8 years, watched around 400 anime series, and I\u2019d only have around 5 anime which I\u2019d give a 10/10. But this show is just simply that good. If I could I\u2019d have given this a 999/10 for enjoyment. Studio Madhouse is just leagues ahead of any anime studio. I wish I could go to Japan and personally congratulate them for making such a great anime. While I\u2019m at that, I could also beg them to make a Season 2 of the anime when the manga has enough material for it. Natsume Shingo, the director of this anime, deserves all the credit for bringing together an amazing team, and voice cast to create this anime. Overall, One Punch Man does what it sets out to deliver, Entertain. And boy oh boy it does so in style!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There are only two types of people in the world: one who absolutely love One Punch Man, and other who strongly dislike it for being too predictable. Now finally that the anime is over, I can review it properly. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nOne Punch Man is an action-comedy anime which tells a story about a man named Saitama who is 'a hero just for fun' in a world where monsters and heroes are quite common. He is quite overpowered and manages to kill anyone in just a single punch, which has made his life quite boring. Soon a new cyborg named Genos is introduced who is insearch for another robot who destroyed his village and he later requests Saitama to become his master after seeing his strength.\\n\r\nAt first the story sounds quite predictable and the idea of killing anyone in a single punch adds more to it. Yes, it's true! It becomes a little predictable and the humor of killing anyone in a single punch dies off quickly. But the anime doesn't has only that much to offer. The story starts developing from 5th episode with the introduction of Hero Association and a ranking system which classifies heroes into C class, B class, A class and S class having rankings in each class. New characters are introduced and the story becomes more interesting. The last two arcs were very good, so just don't drop the anime in your early episodes thinking that it's getting predictable or is not worth watching.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is the best element of One Punch Man! The art of this anime is fabulous. Madhouse has again done a wonderful job. The backgrounds are really well done and the fighting scenes are amazing. Infact One Punch Man and Fate/Zero are the best graphics anime I have seen in my life! One Punch Man is actually a pretty average budget anime. The secret behind One Punch Man's amazing graphics lies behind the fact that it has been directed by Shingo Natsume (Key animator of Gurren Lagann, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Hachimitsu to Clover), assisting Kazuya Murata and with the legendary Kenichi Konishi supervising the animation, Sejoon Kim (animator of Gundam) as a regular animation director. Another notable element of One-Punch Man's visuals is the digital animation, something also tied to Natsume's presence. Other than the animation staff, there is someone else who deserves special credit. People who have read Yusuke Murata's version of One-Punch Man \u2013 the one the anime is based on \u2013 know that even before the anime, the series already was animated. Sort of. Sometimes rather arbitrarily, Murata would go on to draw sequences step-by-step with a ridiculous level of detail, almost as if they were key animation sheets. Something he is capable of putting off because he's an exceptional and dedicated artist, but also because he is a fan of animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nAnother element of One Punch Man which makes the show amazing! Opening and Ending song, both are wonderful. I keep listening to both of them over and over again because they are that awesome. All the OSTs are also worth listening to, and some are just superb which may give you goosebumps! Voice acting is also top notch. Many talented voice actors like Miyano Mamoru, Sawashiro Miyuki, Kaji Yuki, Sakurai Takahiro, Nakamura Yuuichi, Hayami Saori, Namikawa Daisuke etc are there and they have done a great job.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nAll the characters are quite likeable. They have unique personalities and possess a unique charm in themselves. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI will write a few words on my (and people's) most favorite characters from One Punch Man:\\n\\n\r\n1. Saitama - Our favorite hero, the protagonist of the show, quite humorous.\\n\\n\r\n2. Genos - Saitama's partner, best disciple, cyborg and cool. \\n\\n\r\n3. Mumen Rider - C class hardworking hero who rides a cycle but is physically pretty weak to fight with monsters but is very courageous and hardworking/\\n\\n\r\n4. Sonic - A ninja! What more? Everybody likes ninjas (Naruto haters please keep it low! -_-)\\n\\n\r\n5. Tatsumaki? - You know what I am talking about if you have seen 11th episode of One Punch Man! ;) [If you still don't understand, let me know -_-']\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed One Punch Man because of it's intense action which were beautified by amazing graphics and coated with amazing soundtracks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.6/10\\n\r\nIf you like action-comedy (with frequent serious arcs), adventure and superpower anime, and elements like graphics and sound are an important factor for you then you MUST WATCH this anime! Even if you don't like all that, you can give it a try. I assure you that One Punch Man is NOT some random cliche anime which has random power boosts which makes it impossible to watch. It is quite entertaining.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S-Comments appreciated :)",

            "content": "When it comes to satires and parodies alike, there really isn't any sort of arithmetic equation or analytical evaluation needed to determine its value. To put it as simply, it all boils down to a rudimentary question: were you kept amused and were you entertained? \r\nIf you said \"no\" then that's fine, there really isn't any need to justify that answer any further, same also applies if you had said \"yes.\" You see, shows geared to keep you amused are that simple, the same way disliking or liking a specific genre of music doesn't inherently determine its worth to the next person to listen toit. Of course, there are many different brands of comedies out there, some sub-genres of which can be measured by its degree of writing and comedic timing, but this should also come with the understanding that within the marginalizing of \"comedy\" as a genre, there are also room for low-brow humor that relies entirely on dick jokes and crass observations. I say all this to make this point, comedy, like music and other forms of interests that determine an individual's taste, is at essence, a subjective thing. And when something's worth is dependent entirely on whether someone is amused/entertained or not, it's automatically a magnet for contention. For everyone that finds a joke funny, there will be those that stand in opposition.\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is a joke that's rather predictable and repetitive if you only care for the punchline but at the same time, a great deal more satisfying if you're keen to the subject matter that's following up to its inevitable destination. In a way, it's an inside joke among friends, just done so for everyone else to hear. It isn't trying to hide it, there's no workaround into deciphering any deep seeded message. What you see is precisely what you get. One Punch Man is a lineage carried over from super sentai/superhero/shounen stories that took a look at itself in the mirror and came to a simple conclusion; that conclusion being that super sentai/superhero/shounen shows are hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nNo really, think about it for a second. It's a form of storytelling that was forged from the need to give moral messages by embodying everything in basic \"black or white\" terms, where you either stand for good or evil. What makes it funny is that these absurd stories are often played straight with no witticism or awareness of its laughable morality message whatsoever. It's a stone-faced, Bible thumping message on morality that's delivered to its audience by grown men and women wearing brightly colored spandex. It's the kind of irony that's only feasible within the realm of fiction, but hilarious in real life when examined. Of course, the inherent silliness of superhero stories have given rise to many satirical outlooks on the subject matter, but for the most part, those aimed more so to poke fun of that form of storytelling, rather than laughing along with it. But every now and then we get a show that isn't out to sully the impact of the subject matter being satirized, instead, it embraces it to its full extent. Rather than teetering between comical nonsense and serious commentary, it decides why to bother holding up that facade, to begin with. It's a show that comes to the conclusion that if you're going to be bat shit crazy, you might as well go all the way.\\n\\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen this long winded intro is written for the sole purpose of introducing an anime that does just that, One Punch Man. Not only is it aware of the utter nonsense that populates the super sentai/superhero landscape, but it figures that there's no point in trying to deny it. It's a show that revels in the stupidity with no shame or care for onlookers. It's an anime that's comfortable in its spandex suit and flaunts it for all to see. It's a joke that tells you to put away the analytical scrutiny, loosen up your thinking cap, and just come along for the good ole dumb ride that's about to take place. \\n\\n\r\nAs I've already previously stated, your individualistic feelings for the show is the deciding factor on its inherent value. So with that being said, this review is written from the point of view of someone who, for the most part, found the journey with OPM to be satisfactory. Whether you disagree with this statement or not isn't important. I'm not here to tell you OPM is great, and I'm not here to tell you it's anything deeper than what it is; rather, I'm here to explain what kinks OPM managed to properly iron out, and where I as a viewer found noticeable bumps on the journey.\\n\\n\r\nWhile OPM provided a great deal of entertainment, it also had its fair share of issues that detracted from the overall experience. For one, if this anime was created with less effort on the part of the studio (Madhouse) with its audiovisuals, there would be little to credit it for otherwise. The driving force behind OPM is how pristine and well-oiled it looks and feels as a product. This is an anime that relies heavily on the platform of storytelling it is using. This is an anime that works so well because it IS an anime. It's the sense of scale behind every action being taken by our characters. The impact and fluidity of every animated movement. The hyper-detail behind every intricately choreographed action set-piece and moments of high-octane clashes. The flurry of saturated color that follows every frame. The elastic expressions of the personalities in motion. This is an anime that takes full advantage of its medium, and had it been a show that coasted along to a by-the-numbers checklist, there wouldn't be any need to discuss it at all. This was a passion project brought to life in spectacular fashion. Everything from the traditional heavy metal guitar riffs in the background, to the highly detailed shading of the character designs, makes this feel like more than an assembly line production simply made for profit, it became a work of passion.\\n\\n\r\nIt stands to reason that the audiovisual presentation and aesthetic appeal was what propelled this show to instant stardom. So the question remains, why is it so aggressively detested by others?\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen the arguments from detractors of the show, you've undoubtedly caught wind of the \"One Joke Man\" mantra, and to be quite honest, that isn't a bad assessment of the show in a nutshell. Saitama, our lead character and resident impersonator of Mr. Clean, is a man that has grown bored of his acquired strength in pursuit to become a superhero. For reasons vaguely explained, he has reached a point where he can obliterate his foes in one punch. And if you were expecting a \"but\" at the end of that sentence, don't hold your breath, this is the joke. It's like the climatic end to a battle shounen, where our main character goes through his training arc and defeats the antagonist, after he hit his ultimate form of over-powered potential... but instead of simply ending the story there, we're given an extended \"what if\" prologue that asks the question: what happens after the final conflict is over, after our hero reaches the apex of the beat 'em up food chain?\\n\\n\r\nAnd from that question emerges this product; this joke. And while there is an overarching story unfolding in the background, it's the joke that takes precedence and placed on center-stage for our amusement. And it's this joke that creates the split among those who adore the show and those that carry around the \"One Joke Man\" picket sign in protest to its popularity. As trivial of an argument it may seem, this comedic gag is the reason for the rift among anime viewers, which has become a joke within itself (super meta shit). \\n\\n\r\nThere are two main parts to the overarching story: one of which involves Saitama and his ironic post-climb to the top of a superhero organization to gain recognition, while also trying to fulfill his excessive need to seek out an enemy that can finally put up a challenge. And the other subplot revolves around his apprentice and eventual friend, Genos, who's goal can be seen as the stereotypical hero story of vengeance. And while both stories are played straight, it's the awareness the show has for its content which lets everyone in on the joke, and also what makes the parody of the subject matter both amusing, and in a weird way, self-indulgent. While the show follows these narratives in a fashion expected, it does so with a constant sense of witticism and deliberate elbow nudging. This, as a result, can lead to scenes where expository dialogue is given, while our lead is trying to dismiss it, the equivalent of which is like the character breaking the fourth wall and looking into the camera saying \"isn't this shit boring? I wish he would shut up already!\" It's these moments that make what can be seen as a fairly common story, into one that's not only fun to follow, but also something like brownie points for the viewer that are keen to the observations. It's an anime that actively interacts with the expectation of the audience watching it. And while these moments still play second-fiddle to the constant beat 'em up action on screen, it's those moments that give OPM its sense of identity. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the beat 'em up action, OPM effectively nails this aspect down without much debate. While the satirical moments sprinkled throughout shines in its own way, it's the fight scenes that elevates this title to a growing household name. It's the fuel behind the hype if you will. And while that may be a superficial reason to bolster its value, it's still a viable reason for the sake of consumable entertainment. One of its primary genres is action after all, and when it comes to action, very few shows can stand as competition to the consistent level of quality encapsulated in OPM.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of OPM are just that, characters. You're not looking at them for any profound message or character depth, rather it's the eccentricity of the personalities themselves that works. From the typical hero of justice stereotypes found in characters like Genos and Mumen Rider, to the more obvious satirized ones like Amai Mask and Metal Bat. It's comic book personalities brought to life and set loose, all for the sole purpose of wacky antics and populating the setting with a garden variety of personas. The villains can range from the ultra-silly like a lobsterman wearing underwear (similar to something found in the likes of super sentai works), to the more maniacal dimensionless baddie who's sole purpose in life is to fight strong opponents (similar to that of most battle shounens). It's this variety of Saturday morning cartoon level characters that keep things fresh. And with the over-exaggerated character designs, it becomes even more elevated than what would typically be seen from this kind of show. \\n\r\nAlthough, this, as a result, creates the most shallow cast imaginable, and while they're still endearing in the already goofy backdrop they're placed in, they're not in any way new to what would come out of this brand of storytelling. The more you buy into the comedic outlook the show presents everything in, the easier it is to buy into their placement in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis, of course, leads to one of the more noticeable problems the show can't seem to get a grasp on, and that's that nothing it does can be taken seriously. The show goes out of its way to paint everything in clown makeup, so when it does try to take things down a more serious route the final result is more of an apathetic shrug and resounding \"who cares,\" than anything you can deem potent. This isn't to say that those more serious moments don't hold meaning, but that in the context of a parody that has been doing nothing but laughing along with the audience, the moments are simply unwarranted. It's like if a stoner comedy stopped everything dead in its tracks to present a D.A.R.E speech against the use of drugs. Thankfully these moments aren't ever-present throughout the show's run-time. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue that many might have with OPM is quite obviously the joke itself. Being that it's a repetitive comedic gag, many might find the novelty of the gag to have less impact as the show goes on. This, of course, is a reasonable concern, since variety is what keeps long-running sitcoms and comedies on the air. The show attempts to alleviate that concern with the involvement of characters like Genos, who serves as the duality to Saitama's placement in the story. \\n\r\nAnd then there's Saitama himself, who is a deadpan protagonist for a majority of the show's run-time. Those unfamiliar or simply indifferent to deadpan humor will of course not find anything in Saitama, making him uninteresting to most, and rightfully so. And like the concern of the run-on joke losing its luster, the myriad of other wacky characters introduced are the show's defense to keep the attentiveness of those who simply can't be bothered with the uncaring and often cynical outlook Saitama is given. This isn't a case where the lead is a blank slate, but rather he's a character that should have already been done with his arc and involvement in the story. This is the follow up to where a typical hero story should have ended, the downward spiral of a man who has already achieved all that there is to do in his given universe. Which of course is the point of this prolog inspired series, but like I've already stated, the inherent value of OPM rests with the viewer's taste in comedy, so this problem may not even register at all to a lot of people.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite these indeterminate shortcomings, the show still manages to do enough to keep itself together. Because it's so self-aware, a great deal of these issues is often made to be null and void. It's hard to dissect a show that is so honest about what it is. This doesn't wash away the issues it may have, but it certainly makes it more palatable to a consumer that isn't necessarily concerned about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI can go on and on about what the show had working against it, but at the end of the day, I walked away with a title that constantly kept me entertained. The fights were great fun, the animation was handled with care, the OST was kickass, the satirical jabs kept me cackling, and above all else, I was more than satisfied as a viewer and fellow enthusiast of anime. Sure the run-on gag lost steam at times, and yes the plot wasn't always engaging, but as far as enjoyment is concerned, OPM scratched an itch that previously only Jojo of the same year was able to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIs One Punch Man over-hyped? Yes, it certainly is. But does that make it inherently bad? No, it doesn't. While it may be blown out of proportion due to the fact that its contemporaries are of less than stellar quality, there are still merits to the appraisal it receives. It isn't a title that will break new ground anytime soon, and partially, it's a Frankenstein who's existence can be credited with the recent high demand for superhero stories in pop culture. But as an action-comedy that's out to simply have fun and revel in the absurdity of its story, One Punch Man is a show that can keep even the most jaded of audiences entertained, and if only for that aspect alone, I think it's worth trying out.",

            "content": "One-Punch Man is pretty much exactly like what it sounds. We got a bald guy named Saitama who literally beats his opponents with a single punch. He is so powerful that throughout his life, he gets bored with the opponent he fights with. Because when a guy like him can beat up opponents with just one punch, it doesn\u2019t get very fun right? Regardless, Saitama has a heart of gold and in this series, we follow his daily adventures as a hero, as the man who one punches his enemies.\r\nIn general, the series is actually a TV anime adaptation of the remake of the webmanga by ONE. As such, the art is based on Yusuke Murata\u2019s work rather than the original series. The original web series became an internet sensation as it began publishing in June 2009. Given the nature of the series as well the fast growing popularity, there\u2019s a lot of expectations coming from fans about the adaptation. Honestly, I can say that it\u2019s also a sensation. \\n\\n\r\nDirected by Shingo Natsume, he became more well-known recently with his involvement with directing Space Dandy. For One-Punch Man, the series would have to go all out and tear the house down with what it has to offer. The first episode easily establishes the show as an animation powerhouse with the high production quality by Madhouse. The fighting movements, rapid camera angles, and overall cinematics is stellar throughout many of its action sequences. In addition, Saitama\u2019s role easily makes him entertaining to watch because of just simply how badass he is despite being drawn in such a simple way. With a bald head, average height, muscular toned body, and heroish cape, he is the guy that everyone needs to keep an eye on. What mostly makes Saitama stands out is his way of fighting. Yes, most of his fights are rather quick fashioned because of how overpowered he is. I think at some point, Saitama can be dubbed as \u2018One-OP Man\u2019 just because of how ridiculous he is with the way his fights concludes. His hero name is \u2018Caped Baldy\u2019 and it\u2019s pretty self-explanatory why.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to picture One-Punch Man as more of a parody, a satire of superheroes and battle shounen. While the story of One-Punch Man isn\u2019t a masterpiece, it\u2019s still appealing because of Saitama\u2019s daily adventures. These adventures takes him to new places, conflicts with new enemies, and also establishing alliances with new friends. One of his most prominent friends is Genos, a cyborg dubbed as the \u201cDemon Cyborg\u201d. He is Saitama\u2019s disciple and often tries to earn his respect. Their growing relationship seems peculiar at first but also very amusing to watch as they have a fun chemistry. The majority of the other characters of the series are part of a group known as the Hero Association, an organization apparently formed with the purpose to fight monsters and protect City Z. What\u2019s unique about the Hero Association is that the group is composed of all type of heroes ranging from a child prodigy, psycho esper, prideful samurai, or even genius scientists. Throughout Saitama\u2019s daily adventures, he also encounters a variety of adversaries and villains. Whether it\u2019s speedy ninjas or oversized sea monsters, Saitama always seems to find a way to defeat them. This might be the part that strains some people from watching. A common question that may pop up is \u201cwhat\u2019s the point then if Saitama can just one hit KO all his opponents?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI think the main objective of the show is to portray the action as a parody. It\u2019s like the show is self-aware especially with Saitama\u2019s antics. This extends to his iconic fight with Genos, the invasion of Boros\u2019 forces, or his training test to become a hero. Although the comedy can feel exaggerated, it\u2019s also very engaging with all sort of gags the show tries to pull. Every episode also introduces a diverse range of heroes or monsters so there\u2019s plenty to offer for those looking into variety. Certain underrated characters such as License-less Rider also gets their spotlight of fame so the show isn\u2019t just entirely about Saitama. As the comedy can occasionally feel overwhelming, it\u2019s still delightful with the character expressions (mostly coming from Saitama) and excitement it brings. Even the dialogues can offer a sharp appeal that will give the fans to remember something about.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all the comedy, there\u2019s still some set of standards the show follows. The rankings of the Hero Association such as \u201cS-Rank\u201d or \u201cB-Rank\u201d have meanings behind them that associates with their reputation. Unfortunately, Saitama is assigned a lesser rank than most may expect mostly because of his appearance. Only a few recognizes his true abilities although he himself doesn\u2019t seem to care that much either. What he does care though is being a hero and that\u2019s something to really be recognized. While most of his fights ends in just one punch, the way Saitama performs it is bizarrely amusing. One minute, he is starring into something that appears to be overwhelmingly above his abilities. The next minute that something turns into being punched to oblivion. Saitama\u2019s speed and endurance is also extremely impressive as he has taken superhuman level attacks at point-blank range. Again, some people will notice that his fights tends to be \u201canti-climatic\u201d. However, look at the bigger picture here. The way Saitama gives his opponents the hope that they will win effortlessly, the dull expressions he shows in the face of danger, and his inability to remember the names of his opponents are also portrayed more as a parody for comical purposes. It then translates to their defeat which is all that much more devastating. That\u2019s almost like an artistic way of fighting. On the other hand, Saitama\u2019s characterization in this adaptation isn\u2019t very promising. There\u2019s not much revealed about his past so you\u2019ll have to search around the OVA to learn more about his background story. And also, while the adaptation captures the magic of the manga (by even adding some workable filler content), it does omit some aspects which fans may be disappointed about.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve said it before but I\u2019ll say it again. Madhouse has proven themselves of animating this to the highest caliber. The action sequences, background scenery, facial expressions, and overall tone of the show is delivered with exquisite art. It also has an experimental feel to it with the way the characters are designed with a wide spectrum of different looks. What\u2019s most interesting is how Saitama is designed with such simple features especially during comedic scenes. Whether human or monster, One-Punch Man stands as a solid testament for an adaptation by animation standards.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is just as powerful especially with some of the character themes that matches with fighting sequences. The OP song also approaches itself with a stereo beat and heroic-like theme of heavy lyrics. On the other hand, Saitama\u2019s voice is pretty normal despite his overwhelming power. However, some other characters voiced in the show is noticeable such as Genos, Tatsumaki, Boros, and a few others of the villain variety. Be prepared for a hyperactive ride.\\n\\n\r\nOne-Punch Man may seem a bit overrated as it exploded into popularity. From an internet sensation to a TV smash hit, the series continue to grow. A second season is also likely in the inevitable future as well as mentioned by the producers. And the reason being is the sheer success it has achieved. It might not have Shakespearean level storytelling but it\u2019s definitely something fun to take home with every episode. The battle shounen genre has been around for ages and it\u2019s nice to see how One-Punch Man makes fun of it as a satirical battle blockbuster.\\n",

            "content": "After finishing this show I have concluded that it certainly lives up to its name. Oh no no, not the majority opinion of it, silly goose, I mean the actual show title, \u201cOne Punch Man,\u201d because this show genuinely does only have ONE joke, and it gets old very, very fast.\r\nEverything you need to know or possibly can know about this anime is in its title. The main character defeats every villain in one punch, but what else? That can\u2019t possibly be it, can it? Well\u2026 for all intents and purposes, the show is indeed branded as a parody. But in order for us tosee how successful it is at doing so, let me give you the definition of a \u201cparody.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nParody; /noun/ \u201can imitation of the style of a particular writer, artist, or genre with deliberate exaggeration for comic effect\u201d\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s also look at its synonyms.\\n\\n\r\nmockery, ridicule, satire. Oh there we go, that\u2019s the word. Satire. A satire, and I quote, is the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize a specific \u201cthing,\u201d be it person, place, concept, story, or what-have you. In the case with One Punch Man, the satirical parody is criticizing the Superhero/Shonen genre/demographic and its over the top, predictable nature. Or at least, it would be if it weren\u2019t so incredibly inept at doing so. \\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man\u2019s humorous scenes are so incredibly few and far between (not to mention hit or miss altogether) that the whole show feels more like a comedic action shonen rather than a parody of one. Does it have its funny moments? Sure, but not enough to constitute it as a successful satire, let alone being an actual criticism of something. All it does is fall into the exact same pitfalls of a regular long-running Shonen manga or Marvel comic, and doesn\u2019t present any kind of commentary or criticism (humorous or not) to anything at all. With a team of mere monkeys, it can be boiled down to a very simple, boring formula.\\n\\n\r\n1.\tA threat is present to (insert city here)\\n\r\n2.\tSaitama (our hero) arrives and spends 5 to 10 minutes dicking off\\n\r\n3.\tSaitama defeats the antagonist with ONE-U PAUNCH-U!!!\\n\r\n4.\tRinse and repeat for next week\\n\\n\r\nSo now that we see there is no actual criticism, there\u2019s absolutely no tension in this anime either. While the fight scenes are gorgeously animated (By Madhouse, king of all studios) there\u2019s not much to think or feel when watching one. Sure, there are a lot of pretty colors and explosions and things being destroyed, but do you know what else has that? Transformers. Does Transformers have an engaging plot, or a worthwhile satirical aspect to it? No. Does One Punch Man? No. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as far as disgustingly overpowered, boring protagonists go, Saitama isn\u2019t nearly as insufferable as Kirito but he\u2019s not far off the beaten path. He\u2019s bored with his power to defeat anything in one punch, but who blames him? What kind of life is interesting if you have to work at nothing, if there\u2019s no challenge? What kind of show is interesting, if it doesn\u2019t have any kind of identity or intelligence to it? We never even see Saitama\u2019s training, or his trials and tribulations to becoming what he is now; we just get to see the aftermath! Endless rising action, I\u2019m telling you! No climax whatsoever! \\n\\n\r\nAnd like every 12 episode anime, this show has a cast of heroes and villains that\u2019s larger than Tom Cruise\u2019s ego, and none of them get any kind of worthy screen time either. The closest we get to any kind of character development is the sidekick of Saitama, Genos. But whatever problem he\u2019s in, whatever dilemma he faces, you can just let go of your worry and kick back, knowing Saitama will ONE PUNCH the FUCK out of whatever has him in its grasp. That just tears to shreds ANY semblance of development or changes that Genos could have gone through. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, the character development is thrown to the curb for running jokes, the humor is stale, the action is boring because it\u2019s so predictable, and the entertainment value is comparable to that of staring at a door. You know its gonna open, and you know its gonna close. Because it\u2019s a door. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cBut Keyboard!\u201d I hear one obligatory reader say aloud, \u201cThat\u2019s the point! He defeats everything in One Punch!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nTell me how that\u2019s entertaining, because I don\u2019t see it. Every episode is literally, and I\u2019m not kidding here, LITERALLY, the exact. same. thing. Imagine watching Superman Returns on repeat, with a little tiny bit of the same SNL skit hiding in the background. Twelve times in a row. That\u2019s not entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nBut if you liked it, good for you. I have nothing against you, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to find enjoyment in something my cynical ass mind couldn\u2019t, and I\u2019m being honest when I say that if this show had a little to no following at all, my reaction would be the same, so don\u2019t come to me screaming and hollering about me hating on it because it got popular. I don\u2019t hate popular things, especially when my favorite anime is the highest fucking rated entry on the site. I instead choose to look at what it proposes regardless of its reputation. So, in a TL;DR summary, here is what I found in doing so-\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n-\tGorgeous animation\\n\r\n-\tSolid soundtrack\\n\r\n-\tMakes you really appreciate the good stuff out there\\n\r\nMIXED:\\n\r\n-\tComedy is hit-or-miss\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-\tBoring, repetitive, and stagnant premise\\n\r\n-\tPredictability is through the roof\\n\r\n-\tFails at being a parody because of its hit-or-miss comedy and lack of satirical commentary on what its supposed to be a parody of\\n\r\n-\tNot enough comedy altogether \\n\r\n-\tOne note side characters, one note villains, one note protagonist. \\n\r\n-\tTitle gives everything away\\n\\n\r\n3/10. As of yet, One Punch Man has plenty of time to redeem itself. A second season with a little more improvement on its intention and it could be something really great.\\n\\n\r\nBut for now, I recommend watching the door. At least that actually took some ingenuity.",

            "content": "Ever since I started reading the One Punch Man manga by Murata back in 2013, I couldn't wait until the day OPM actually got an anime adaption. When I heard Madhouse was picking up the project, my excitement grew ever so vastly. Now, after finally completing the anime, I can say without doubt, that I'm glad the adaption was done by Madhouse and no other. \r\nOne Punch Man tells a story of Saitama, an average man living an average life, with a... not-so-average hobby: being a superhero. There's something that sets this man apart from other heroes though. You guessed it: he tends to defeatall enemies that come before him in a single punch. The humor in One Punch Man is definitely repetitive. That's not to say there aren't other forms of comedy within the series. What makes this series so enjoyable if the main character just defeats every enemy with ease? It's the characters' thoughts, motives, interactions, reactions, and so much more. \\n\\n\r\nOne joke that is constantly reused in the series, is of course, Saitama defeating his enemies in one punch. If running gags aren't your cup of tea, then it's possible you won't enjoy the series. In the end, comedy is still a hit or miss.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also doesn't completely uphold an entire slice of life & comedy routine as earlier episodes may suggest. There is, believe it or not, an actual storyline. The series takes off in a setting which generally consists of full-time comedy, but it slowly takes a turn towards a slightly more serious plot, without dropping all aspects of its previous perks. There is another controversial issue I will address. The entire series is not a parody. Parts of it are, sure. However, it should be noted that the there are serious tones that include plenty of comedy, in a not so parodic attitude. The series never intends to drop its comedy; it's faithful to that fact, and that's appreciative. \\n\\n\r\nEach character has their perks. From hero to villain to your ordinary citizen, each one contributes to the series' success, be it comedy relief, sympathy, contempt, devotion, or ambition. An entertaining comedy, from my perspective, should always include entertaining characters, ones you can relate to, or feel very passionate about. One Punch Man never lacks this. The diverse plethora of characters allow many different types of viewers to enjoy this series. \\n\\n\r\nI mentioned how the character interaction is a strong selling point, and that's largely due to how well the seiyuus (voice actors) perform. Each and every seiyuu also fit their character roles astoundingly well. In addition to that, Madhouse stays faithful to both ONE and Murata (artists of the original webcomic and manga, respectively) in terms of art, adapting the source material in a fashion where all comedic value of a specific scene is retained, matching, perhaps even trumping, the source material.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are both top notch. Anyone saying otherwise is kidding themselves. Madhouse consistently releases quality animation with few exceptions in OPM. At times you may notice the art in the animation alters during several fight scenes. While this art style may be unappealing to some audiences, it does not mean the fluidity and flow of the animation drop in any way. That being said, I did also mention there were exceptions; One Punch Man's animation is not without flaws. In some scenes (more so the less important, minor scenes), it's quite obvious the animation quality is just not on par. However, this is highly negligible when you realize why some of the time and budget had to be cut for those scenes: to fuel the intensity and quality of the more iconic, influential, and critical moments, fights, and episodes. \\n\\n\r\nFor manga readers, there may be scenes and frames in which the anime looks rather poor in comparison to the manga. I, myself, am guilty of being slightly affected by this, but one must understand that animation frames cannot always consistently uphold the quality that is displayed in manga, more notably when the artist is Yusuke Murata, and especially when the budget of One Punch Man is claimed to be average by the animators to begin with, where they've gone above and beyond to perfect the adaption of One Punch Man as much as possible. And as previously mentioned, it's evident that a lot of the worktime is shifted towards the more impactful scenes, so the overall quality remains refined. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to choose one thing Madhouse produced without flaw, it would be the soundtrack. From the opening intro, to the BGM during fight scenes, to the ending song, every bit of it, flawless. How well the music is incorporated into the series drives the anime by a longshot. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 11\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\r\nWas ecstatic from start to finish - fully enjoyed watching this series. Well, minus some scenes in which I had too high expectations for, but that's negligible as many of my expectations are unreasonable. It's disheartening to see the series come to an end, but I will pray for second season, and put my faith in Madhouse and Murata. \\n\\n\r\nIf you really enjoyed watching this anime, I highly recommend reading the manga (maybe even the webcomic if the manga does not quench your thirst), even starting at the beginning, since Yusuke Murata's art really makes the franchise shine.",

            "content": "One Punch Man is a comedy/parody shounen anime. Unfortunately it fails as a parody and it fails as a shounen.\r\nThe Comedy:\r\nSaitama, the main protagonist, is really really strong, but he's also bored. He is so strong that he doesn't even get excited while fighting really strong opponents. That's the main joke of the anime, and if you don't like it, well, too bad, because it will be shoved down your throat every single episode. There's nothing much else to talk about him, it's basically all his personality. \r\nOutside of Saitama the humor is pretty much hit or miss. It's funny, because this is supposed tobe a parody anime, but even then it takes itself wayyyy too seriously. Expect the typical epic/dramatic ost playing often, innocent people suffering and in danger,  melodramatic speechs about justice, etc etc. After thorwing all that at you the main character, bored as always, will easily defeat the dangerous villain. OPM lives in a weird limbo between typical shounen and parody, it would probably be better if it decided what it wants to be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Plot:\\n\r\nThe anime is pretty much plotless. A random generic villain  will appear, cause some ruckus, and be defetead by the bored bald protagonist every time. At some point a hero association appears, what about it? It serves to introduce new characters, and that's it. The association does nothing the whole anime, as far as the anime goes there's no conspiracy behind it or anything. The main character wants to go up in the association, but of course that doesn't matter one bit, it only serves to provide some more \"hilarious\" jokes about how the main character is so strong and yet he is misunderstood by everybody. \\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing to keep you hooked and wanting more, wondering what will happen next. If, god forbid, a second season is made I pretty expect to be exactly the same thing as season 1: main protagonist is bored jokes and generic villains appearing, with pretty much nothing else. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNothing much to talk about really. One or two tracks are good I guess, the rest is average. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nThe art is bland and forgetble. The animation is good and fluid, but to be honest the fights itselves are not that good. Everything is so fast, it's difficult to see things clearly sometimes. Although this anime really is above average in this category, it seems like a child throwing a tauntrum to get your attention: there is very little variety in the fights (every character pretty much fights like a DBZ character), it is all completely predictable, but hey, it looks cool, and the camera spins really fast, and there is epic music, so it is good, right???\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nVeridict:\\n\r\nOPM is all flash and no substance. It should mantain your attention for at least these 12 episodes, but that's it. It's just one more of those anime who pander the lowest common denominator. If you are expecting something truly interesting, fun or exciting you can forget it. \\n\\n\\n",

That is, you should not having put too much thinking on characters and story as it may erode your enjoyment, but the erosion rate on characters and story might be slower than erosion rate based on action animation variables because its animation is so good to be re-watched and there are no annoying characters traits. \\n\\n\r\nFOr the story, it is just there for the sake of completeness or as a complementary element for its near-perfect animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nThose people who score One Punch Man as below 8 might weight more on story as their anchoring on Death Note's story quality standard while people, including myself, who score 8 and above is biased by the animation alone, but more than enough to satisfy their fundamental needs when watching anime.",

            "content": "\"I am here to attend the supermarket sale and have fun....and I'm all out of coupons\"\r\nTo be honest with you, I've been bored with anime for quite a while now.  Sure, I've been watching some anime but it's mostly restricted to anime that have already finished or are over 10 years old. \r\nSo, naturally, when I heard about One Punch Man, I brushed it off as more of the same old sh*t that's been airing for the past five years. How wrong I was....\r\nNow, after waiting patiently for over 81 days, I have come to put an end to all the ridiculous criticism thatOne Punch Man has received.\\n\r\nI, Pompous Phoenix, saviour of the universe and protector of mankind, will you use my considerable powers to  vanquish all you false pretenders.\\n\\n\r\n\"\"DADDY!! Is it a bird? Is it a plane? IT'S SUPERM-well, unfortunately, it's just a BIRD but it is a bird who will RISE FROM THE ASHES and promises to OBLITERATE ALL OPPOSITION with his EGOTISTICAL VIEWS and as much GRANDIOSE as he can muster\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nWe as a community tend to immediately gang up on the most popular anime at the time, I'm looking at you SAO. As you can guess, it's open season for OPM.\\n\r\nUnlike most animes these days, with their overly ambitious stories and pretentious settings, what we have here is a show that doesn't take itself  TOO SERIOUSLY or TOO FLIPPANTLY. T\u0336h\u0336a\u0336t\u0336 \u0336d\u0336o\u0336e\u0336s\u0336n\u0336'\u0336t\u0336 \u0336m\u0336a\u0336k\u0336e\u0336 \u0336a\u0336n\u0336y\u0336 \u0336s\u0336e\u0336n\u0336s\u0336e\u0336,\u0336 \u0336y\u0336o\u0336u\u0336 \u0336d\u0336i\u0336p\u0336s\u0336h\u0336  What do I mean by this? Although, it's ranked the 11th greatest anime and already has 192,406 members on MAL, it only came into existence as a hobby for upcoming manga artist, ONE. Yes, the anime with an average score of 9.02, was only made because ONE was BORED. You'd think that this would mean an eventual drop in quality or failure to even kick-start the series, right?\\n\\n\r\nIn short, no. It is this boredom that leads into ONE's creative and innovative ideas. What's a genre that suits ONE perfectly and hasn't been explored enough? SUPERHEROES. Combine this with comedy, and you have a brand new genre in itself. This show is primarily focused on being a parody of the superhero genre as a whole. This is where the show really thrives with pretty much every superhero clich\u00e9 you've ever heard of packed neatly into 12 episodes. From the overpowered as f*ck main character to the diabolically evil as f*ck simply because they are ugly as f*ck. One Punch Man takes all these clever jokes and uses them to their full potential and somehow manages to never falter in it's quality or it's quantity. \\n\\n\r\nI see a lot of reviews for this anime saying,\"You shouldn't take this seriously or it's only a COMEDY\". While I'm in inclined to agree with the later and will rephrase in case you weren't listening, IT'S JUST A F*CKING COMEDY YOU NEON GENESIS SADISTS. In the case of \"being serious enough\", OPM has this near perfection. Typical comedy based animes will often have a moment where it trades it's usual light hearted comedy for a moment of \"seriousness\". OPM only has a few moments of \"seriousness\" but because there are so little of them it only makes them more MEMORABLE and IMPACTFUL. They will often deal with topics like morality, media, defining a hero etc.\\n\r\nEat your heart out Clannad, I can have deep meaningful moments and still be pissing myself with laughter 5 minutes later.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe main hero of the story is Saitama, who is every lead shonen character's wet dream. Saitama is the incarnation of BOREDOM and it is less about how funny he IS but how funny he REACTS.The point of his character is that he has ALREADY \"become the strongest in the world\", which is then used as the overrunning gag throughout the show. This is quite a fresh idea that would pique the interest of most people. Although, this idea can only remain funny for so long the same way any joke will become tiring after a while.\\n\\n\r\nThis is only saved thanks to a certain blond haired cyborg by the name of Genos. While Saitama is the incarnation of BOREDOM, Genos is the incarnation of SERIOUSNESS. He is the Naruto/Luffy/Ichigo of the story, the one who is obsessed with becoming stronger, except as more of a dead serious, humourless sidekick. People like to believe that Saitama being so incredibly overpowered ironically ruins the show but this is not the case. While we can't relate to Saitama's ridiculous strength, we can relate to Genos constant struggle for power. While we can't relate to Genos' dashing good looks (well, you can't), we can relate to Saitama's plain and average looks.\\n\\n\r\n*I have to give high praise to both Furukawa and Ishikawa for their respective performances as Saitama and Genos which was nothing short of AWESOME*\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting characters, it would be best described as if you were visiting your favourite restaurant. With so many different types and variations to select from these characters are all excellently made. We've got Silverfang, who is the equivalent of Dumbledore on steriods, Sonic, who is Saitama's never ending rival and is definitely not a hedgehog, Tatsumaki, who is an annoying little sh*t, and a load more of strong and weak, cool and weird, smart and stupid characters that you will encounter throughout the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nDO YOU WANT TO SEE M0THERF*CKING  LASERS?!

You add it's incredible animation by Madhouse with this soundtrack, and you've got Gold. \\n\r\nEven the sound in this show is INSANE, just take a look at the fight between Saitama and Genos. I'd highly recommend giving OPM's OST a listen to as it's well worth your time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nLet's get something clear. I'm not giving OPM a 10 because it's perfect. ALL SHOWS HAVE FAULTS. I'm giving it a 10 because it reached it's full potential but still managed to keep it's humour, action, characters in check throughout these incredible 12 episodes. A satisfying conclusion with no silly cliffhangers or overarching plot points.\\n\\n\r\n* BREAKING NEWS!! We have just received news about the possibility of a second season and I can officially tell you.....how the f*ck am I supposed to know?! It can go either way with MadHouse really, but I nevertheless remain optimistic* I can however, leave with this inspirational quote from the Caped Baldy himself that only the true OPM fans will appreciate.......\\n\\n\r\n\"Ok\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "'One Punch Man' is a caricature of 'Superman' on steroids. It's an anime that has stapled itself as a parody that you're not supposed to take seriously at times, while also having supposed more serious aspects later down the line, as every OPM fan has told me prior to my viewing of it. Like Superman, it features the main character, Saitama, defeating opponents with no trouble at all, with the marketable 2015 gimmick of them being 'one punched'. If you minus the laser and X-Ray vision, Saitama is literally Superman of Japan. So you may be wondering to yourself, \"This sounds great! Why such alow score?\"\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is the definition of an over-hyped phenomenon. Yes, this has been said by many people for the past 3 years and I'm 'unoriginal', but there's practically no other way to describe it.\\n\\n\r\nI consider Superman to be one of the worst superheroes in comics. Well, maybe not as bad as Doorman, but he's still a bullshit superhero. Why? It's simple; he's boring, predictable, too powerful, and has a dull weakness. And unfortunately, Saitama shares the same fate as Superman. Except, he's more powerful than Superman, since he has no weakness. You could also rename this anime to 'One Joke Man', because all it truly is is one big joke that simply wasn't for me in the end. Any sort of build-up, tension, and actual serious moments in the show from other characters' engagements with the villains are ruined by Saitama's presence. And when Saitama does encounter a villain, the outcome is always the same: Saitama defeats the villain in less than 5 minutes all the time. It's a shame too, because the villains of One Punch Man did look to have potential. \"But this is supposed to be the parody aspect of One Punch Man dude!\" They could've handled the satire ridiculing other powerful protagonist shows much better than the boring narrative that was One Punch Man.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the length of One Punch Man, newly introduced characters only have a minuscule amount of screen-time or any sort of development, when clearly, you ARE supposed to care for these characters. The top 13 heroes of the league have no depth at all except for Genos, Saitama's sidekick and a character who'd I actually consider good in the show.  Unfortunately, like the villains, his time is stolen from the \"LOL, so funny!\" moments of Saitama defeating every threat he faces. Genos recognizes Saitama's strength when they first meet and wants to become stronger. Stronger he will never become, but at least to be recognized by Saitama as a worthy sidekick. Another character, Sonic (the hedgehog) was also an interesting villain to follow, but, yes, like everyone else, Saitama steals the show. Same with Mumen Rider, Boros, and probably every other character. Am I starting to sound like a broken record? My bad, but if you got through One Punch Man, I'm sure you're used to repetitiveness by now.\\n\\n\r\nI can only think of two moments in One Punch Man that made me chuckle. But other than that, the 'comedy' aspect of the show falls flat on its face most of the time. And like mentioned above, One Punch Man is on rinse and repeat for each episode, providing nothing new or interesting that changes the outcome of the show or adds further development for the cast. A point that most people don't seem to mention is the logic in how Saitama became the most powerful being on the planet. Going back to Superman, there's logic as to why he's powerful; he's a Kryptonian, an alien from another world that gets his power from the Sun. Batman, another superhero that's superior to Superman in all aspects, has logic as well; he has no real super powers. It's all his gadgets, combat skills, and sweet toys that make him a REAL superhero to humanity, since he's an ordinary human himself. Saitama gets his powers by doing an ordinary training routine taken to the maximum, near impossible levels of an ordinary human to achieve. That's even more bullshit than most shounen protagonists and them achieving their powers in such a short time! \\n\\n\r\nThe only aspects of One Punch Man that really stunned me was the artwork and animation. For the majority of scenes, the art aspect was phenomenal. Designs were sharp, not expressionless or lackluster, and character models had good choreography and designs. Music and sounds were average for the most part, the only memorable track being the opening theme, but most soundtracks for suspenseful and villain encounter moments were good. Nothing to complain about for those elements, maybe the only thing being the soundtracks at times being inconsistent or not used properly for some moments of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, One Punch Man was only 12 episodes long. So the length of it was bearable and watchable because of the fantastic animation and artwork, but I would've most likely ended up dropping it if it was any longer or the standard length of a shounen anime. It had potential too, and I won't admit in saying that the first and second episodes really intrigued my interests. Then after the third, fourth, fifth, sixth... yeah. It got boring, super repetitive, and predictable very fast. The parody aspect of One Punch Man failed because of this unfortunately. If what I said throughout this review sounded decent and interesting as a parody series that doesn't take itself seriously with the logic of the world and characters, while having a Superman-like protagonist with no weakness one punching every encounter he faces, then I think you'd enjoy this a lot. For the rest of you that see this and don't like how the show's repetitive nature plays out, I wouldn't suggest this.\\n\\n\r\nHere's me hoping for a better outtake on the series for season 2, but I won't be getting my hopes up.",

            "content": "Goddamn, last season was heavy on the shonen/superhero stuff, wasn't it? Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya. Ushio and Tora. Noragami Aragoto. And of course, the most popular one of them all, One Punch Man. It's going to be difficult to find something new to say about each of them, but lord knows I'm going to try my damndest to do so. Might as well start with the one that got everyone's attention, even if not for all the right reasons. I mean it's a giant understatement to say that I wasn't the only one who watched One Punch Man, but it's also abig understatement to say that I wasn't the only one who wasn't impressed with the thing.\\n\\n\r\nIt's even worse in my case, because I don't get shonen action as substance at all. I don't hate it, and there was a time when I enjoyed pretty much everything that came out of Shonen Jump's mouth the same way I enjoyed Marvel v. Capcom, but you'd think the genre would grow up along with the audience and focus more on substance rather than repeat the same outdated Dragonball Z-style over and over again because holy hell did we not get sick of that ten years ago. But with the explosive popularity of One Punch Man along with David Production continuing to make more bloody adaptations of Jojo, I think it's pretty clear that that isn't going to happen anytime soon. So who cares if the plot is weak? Who cares if the satire goes for all the easy shots? Who cares if the characters don't have any real struggles or flaws or story or anything going for them besides how they look and a stupid name? It's a popcorn anime, and it's very good at what it does.\\n\\n\r\nExcept even by the standards of popcorn anime, I'm not sure it does. I mean you have the director of Space Dandy and the production values from Madhouse on this project, so obviously you're going to get a great-looking show. With that said, why is the action so fucking bad? Every time it showed up, the camera would spin around or zoom far-out whilst characters threw massive explosions at each other or delivered a punch in a desperate attempt to make it look cool when in reality, it looks overblown and retarded. There is absolutely no choreography being applied to any of the action and it becomes really boring to watch as a result. And even if there was, it is an absolute cakewalk to determine who's going to win the fight before it even starts because the whole show is built around Saitama saving the day in his own dry way with nobody in the entire universe being close to his level in terms of fighting prowess. Add in the fact that nobody really dies in this show anyways but the one-off characters who have less charisma than a Marvel villain and there's a limit to how much tension One Punch Man is allowed to have in regards to its fight scenes (i.e. zero).\\n\\n\r\nNot helping is the fact that Saitama is an incredibly boring character who has no depth to him besides one joke: he's a normal dude who became the strongest in the world by training really hard and is bored with his life as a result. Every other hero in this show became powerful through genetics or body modification, and as such don't believe Saitama when he says that he just worked hard, nor do they trust him because thanks to his lack of brains, he's lowly ranked in the Hero Association. This could have made for some interesting conflict, but One Punch Man never really treats Saitama's invincibility as anymore than a cheap joke or a deus ex machina trying to be a cheap joke, no thanks to the other heroes having zero chemistry with the dude and making DC's good guys look like Marvel's. Aside from a cyborg whose only real purpose in life is to lose so that Saitama can have someone to save, I can't recall a single time he's ever had a real conversation with anybody. Hell, I'm pretty sure Genos has had more overall screen time than him.\\n\\n\r\nAnd don't even get me started on the villains in this thing, who make Marvel's bad guys look like DC's. I can't even remember anyone's name, let alone what they added to anything. There was some attempt at making the final bad guy an \"invincible contrast\" to Saitama, but it was so poorly handled it made the relationship between Spiderman and Green Goblin look like Batman and The Joker - and I still didn't bother to remember the dude's name afterwards. Word of advice to anyone creating a bad guy: Marvel's villains are absolutely awful! Nothing but a bunch of random animal or element gimmicks applied to some misguided fool trying to overcompensate for the fact that Mad Hatter has them beat in the character department. But you know what's worse than that? Actual animal or element gimmicks fully realized in physical form, without even an attempt to make them realized as actual characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll of which could have been forgiven if the show was funny, as One Punch Man is supposed to be a comedic satire on the shonen action/superhero genre. Thing is, the show only has one joke (Saitama being Saitama) and said joke never made me laugh. Not once. Which would already have been a giant problem by itself, but the fact that the satire sucks too does it no favors. And not just because it goes for all the easy shots, but said shots are even misaimed a few times. There's one moment in the show where Saitama makes himself out to be the bad guy in order to save face for the other heroes due to some random jackass who apparently never appreciates anything in his life, but it falls incredibly flat because it's incredibly obvious it was done so that the show can repeat its one joke. Not one single person was buying the jackass's bullshit, so there was no reason for Saitama to do that, especially since it's never brought up again afterwards. It's an extreme, but by no means the only part of the show where it's clear the writers have no ambition for this show beyond taking cheap potshots at a genre that has been satirized so well in the past.\\n\\n\r\nLet me make it clear that One Punch Man is by no stretch of the word \"bad\". It knows what it wants to be and does it well, even if it wants to be is nothing higher than mediocre at best. Because if we're judging it in comparison to the rest of the shonen/superhero anime that aired in Fall, One Punch Man is the worst of the shonen action anime that I have seen. Good visuals can only take you so far, and whilst I commend Madhouse for keeping the quality high for most of its run, thirteen episodes is a long time to watch something that has little to no substance. Hell, the specials don't have anything noteworthy about them visual-wise, leaving you with nothing at all.\\n\\n\r\nMy advice to you guys? Watch Concrete Revolutio instead. And no, I'm not going to stop sucking Concrete Revolutio's dick until more people admit they were wrong to abandon it for the much weaker Sunday superhero show.",

            "content": "With One-Punch Man finished airing, there is one thing anyone can agree on, and that is how split the community is about the show: there are people who absolutely love it, considering it the pinnacle of their experience, and others that consider it to be very bland and boring, with terrible humour. Now the question is whether these opinions on the show are justified or not, and naturally it is, on both sides. Is One-Punch Man overrated? Yes, it is. But is it mediocre, bad? No, in my opinion it is not, it's an enjoyable anime with fantastic animation and action.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe premise of One-Punch Manis simple, Saitama being a superhero so overpowered, that he is capable of defeating any type of villain in one single punch. Bored with the fights, he trudges through life indifferent to any major problems regarding his environment, such as monsters attacking the city, concerned mainly with the household such as his shopping list or vandalism. This doesn't mean that there is any lack of action at all; in fact it is one of its main focus, which is fun to watch. This leads to another problem: the fights are tensionless on its own, as it is very predictable what the outcome will be, which is partially adressed with comedic elements. The good thing is that the anime is self-aware of its stupidity,being quite unpredictable at times, which makes it in turn an enjoyable watch.\\n\\n\r\nOther focal point of the anime is the humor, as One-Punch Man makes a parody of the superheroes, which enhances the anime to keep the story fresh and enjoyable. Someone who dislikes superheroes might also dislike this show. These jokes are often mingled with Saitama's indifference, as well as the characters personalities. However, the humor seems to be the major issue with the audience. Yet I must mention that the humor gets old, and is not as well relayed  to the viewers as it was in the manga. In fact, at times it can be rather lackluster. Nevertheless, the action scenes made up for it. Other thing to consider is the amount of destruction made by the superheroes, which could be seen as something hilarious, meaning they're quite useless when trying to preserve property and life.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also certain evolution of the story present; from focusing upon making a parody of defeating its foes in one hit, it makes a transition to have some sort of story attached to it, introducing challenges and ranks amongst the superheroes, invasion of super villains, you name it. This defeats somewhat the main purpose of the anime, as now it's basically a plotless, action heavy show. Some may also point out that the episodes seem stretched out longer than necessary. Nevertheless, audiences observe social critique as well in the anime, which could be compared with how society views celebrities. Superheroes represent these, people excepting them to be perfect, which is naturally not the case. The egoistic nature of humans are shown as well, in addition to blaming people for their own ailments, even though these tried to help out. People are prone to blame others for their own misdoings or doesn't go flawlessly.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in One-Punch Man are varied, yet very one-dimensional and stereotypical, which fits with the narrative and overall story that it is trying to convey. Saitama being an indifferent character to anything concerning him; then there is Genos, a cyborg with a straightforward personality who is Saitama's disciple. Naturally little to no character development takes place. The superheroes themselves are often of selfish nature, whose only objective is fame.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters are diverse, both for the superheroes and villains: ninjas, cyborgs, aliens, martial artists, mad scientists and monsters are on the order of the day. The reasons behind villains actions are of course very bland and uninteresting, as it follows the stereotypes. Nonetheless, it must be mentioned that some of the comedic elements are greatly enhanced by these and their personalities, in addition to being somewhat interesting in some regards.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of One-Punch Man is certainly top-notch, action scenes drawn fantastically and very fluid and diverse, what is to be expected of a Madhouse produced anime. There are some scenes in which some movements are bended a bit too much to my liking. The art style of the anime if appealing, yet nothing really out of the norm. Character designs for villains and superheroes are nevertheless diverse and very detailed, further enhancing the overall animation. In addition, backgrounds are well displayed as well. The animators managed to portray impressively the strengths of the superheroes with the diverse animations and camera angles.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack used in One-Punch Man matched well with it, yet is nothing outstanding on its own. Voice actors performed their role well, in addition to matching with the personality of each character. The opening was quite an interesting watch, in addition to have a fitting music to it.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nOverall One-Punch Man was an enjoyable experience, yet experienced shortcomings storywise as well as in the comedy department. Nevertheless, the well executed action scenes alongside the top-notch animation quality, certainly makes it worth a watch on its own, yet is not suited for anyone who is in pursuit of a well crafted story alongside with good and diverse humour, as it can be a hit-and-miss for some.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.\\n",

However, the execution of this series is very poor.\r\nStory - There is little to no discernible story line it seems, and whatever is there is needless drawn out and fraught with cliche, that more or less parody shouen story-lines, but without providing any actual comedy. Basically turning into a shitty version of what they are trying to make fun of.\r\nArt/Sound - Only redeeming element of this anime, the art style is fantastic and it comes with a very good audio quality, thevoice acting is about average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Characters in this series tend to come off as extremely bland, and boring. This is quite a shame since the design and back story's of these characters are very interesting. This combined with decent voice acting should provide a decent set of characters. However, it doesn't this time, and it is very disappointing  \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion - This is a very disappointing series, fantastic art and sound combine with an awful story and lackluster characters make this series just disheartening and one of the most boring anime I have ever seen  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Every year there is at least one particular show that receives massive coverage for whatever reason.In 2015, without a question was One Punch Man's year in the spotlight and for good reason; the initial premise of One Punch seemed to be a goldmine, for it was thought to be a clever,satiristic view of the shonen and action anime that has been dominate since the last decade. \r\nSo then, with roses thrown before the curtain is raised, does One Punch Man live up to its potential ? Without even a sigh, no would be the answer. \r\nThe biggest flaws that Opm suffers from are the counterproductive characterizations, and repetitive wall paint humor gags. \\n\r\nThe show's content is mainly derived from Saitama and Genos fighting new villains each episodes which is axiomatically plain itself , so the show has to induce humor to make things interesting but fails to do so because the show keeps using the same joke over and over again . Speaking of Saitama and Genos, Saitama is arguably the weaker of the two because his apathetic nature makes him too static for the audience to actually care about him;Thankfully, Genos proves to be a better character because of the mystery and passion floating in his background;However, and ironically so, the most enjoyable character was one of the other heroes, Tornado; her Asuka-esque attitude and powers made her a much more attractive personality, yet we never got much from her. The action that does take place is rather vivid in fluid , thus, making the show enjoyable in that respect; the animation is nice polished as well. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, One Punch Man fails to do many things right but not in the extreme sense.While, It is shame that it could fulfill its potential at least it's watchable and could be considered entertaining if nothing else is on.",

            "content": "One Punch Man was a fairly popular anime from the tail end of last year. It was based off of a webcomic by One, which has also been adapted into a manga. The anime came from Madhouse, which could be good or bad and there's no real way to ascertain which it is just because it has a lot of fans. After all, some of the worst anime I've seen have had pretty substantive fan bases. Then again, just last week I reviewed Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex: 2nd Gig, which was both popular and really good. So, let's take a look andI'll see if it lives up to the hype.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nSaitama is a hero for fun. When major trouble threatens people, he shows up and dispatches the threat with a single punch. There's just one problem, he's so strong that it's all become rather boring for him. The series follows Saitama as he faces various menaces, the most threatening of which is his own melancholy.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the biggest flaw with the comedy of the series is that it gets repetitive pretty quickly. Most of it follows the same pattern. A menace shows up, gets built up as a grave and pressing threat, fighting against and beating other heroes, Saitama shows up and one shots it. In between fights we get some other jokes, a lot of which are about Saitama being bored and disinterested with what he's doing. Then we have a character who exists entirely as an unfunny gay stereotype, Puripuri Prisoner. Thankfully, he's a minor character and only shows up in a few episodes but his scenes can be pretty cringe-worthy.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the main repeated joke of the series can be funny a few times and there are some pretty amusing scenes betwixt the action sequences. Some of which are actually quite clever in the ways they tackle shounen action series tropes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters in One Punch Man are pretty stock action tropes with a comedic twist. They aren't particularly complex but most of them are perfectly good for a parody work. I actually do quite like the contrasting dynamic with Saitama's more jaded and frivolous outlook with Genos' more youthful and serious outlook. The best moments in the series come from these two playing off of one another. There are other characters with potential but, due to the short length of the series, a lot of them end up getting used for a single joke and don't really get any interactions or dynamics to play off of their potential.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation are both really good in this series. The action sequences, at least before Saitama shows up, can be really interesting to see, even though you know how they're going to end. There are also some really nice and detailed villain designs in this. The one major flaw is that the action scenes get boring and repetitive when Saitama is involved. They either end really quickly or he lets the villain knock him around for a bit without any concern before ending it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is okay. There are some strong actors in this and they give perfectly passable performances. They're just not particularly good or memorable. The music is pretty standard. It's not bad nor is it good. It's just functional.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nAside from our stereotype running around and frightening guys he finds attractive, there isn't any. So, this is a series that would be better with less ho-yay.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes right down to it, whether or not One Punch Man is going to work for you really depends on whether or not you're the type of person who can keep laughing at the same joke, even when you know it's coming. If you can see slightly different versions of the same joke and keep laughing, this one may have the punch for your funny bone. If, on the other hand, you're a person who needs humour to be surprising in order to get a laugh out of it, you should definitely skip it. If you're like me and you can gain amusement from the same joke under certain circumstances but you need time between the versions, I would recommend seeing it, but giving it around ten days between episodes so that it doesn't get overly repetitive for you. In the end, in spite of its short comings, it's a decent parody series. I give it a 6/10. Next week, I'm looking at Ginga Ojousama Densetsu Yuna: Shin'en no Fairy.",

            "content": "Jesus christ, calm the fuck down. It's a pretty good anime. It is neither the greatest nor the worst thing to ever be produced, contrary to how most people seem to be treating it.\r\nIt's a shame that such a disclaimer is necessary, but there really only seem to be two kinds of people when it comes to One Punch Man - those who consider it a cancer on the anime industry, and those who worship it as though it were the second coming. And while, in all honesty, this would probably not be as hyped as it is if it weren't the only thing comingout at the time worth being hyped over, it's a lot closer to the latter than the former.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there was always going to be a divide with this show, because it's a comedy series that doesn't really have many jokes in it. Much of the humour of One Punch Man is achieved through tone and through juxtaposition, and that's not something that works for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best methods of humour comes from the unexpected - juxtaposition between what you'd expect to happen, and what does. One Punch Man uses this to great effect, by building up a fictional universe in which everything takes itself completely seriously with the same dramatic stakes that would apply to any battle shonen anime, totally unaware that absolutely everything they believe to be true, and which they take so seriously, is completely and utterly meaningless, because Saitama makes the entire setting redundant. It's a hilarious farce that forms the core of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, Saitama is the perfect protagonist for a show like this. His inability to read the mood, lack of concern for any of the extremely threatening Eldritch Horrors that attack him, and his nonchalance towards... well, everything, make a great setup for the contrast of tone between over-the-top badassery and comedy that this show runs on.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of what makes this show work is that it's actually pretty good as the action series it's making fun of. While it is impossible to take seriously, it's still hard to not be impressed by how well-drected and inventive the fight scenes are. The animators have really outdone themselves here - in particular, the way they show off some of Saitama's most ridiculously overpowered attacks are impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside, however, is that sometimes the show takes itself too seriously - in particular, during the mid-to-late episodes. While the balance between action and comedy is usually well maintained, it suffers when it skews more towards action. Also, OPM is often accused of being repetitive, and this isn't entirely unfounded - again, the show doesn't really rely on jokes for its humour, and instead goes for tone-based humour, so this is not as much of a problem as it would be for a show that was specifically focused on gags. But it repeatedly uses anticlimaxes as the source of its humour, and while there is plenty of variation in the execution of them, it can still feel like the same thing over and over, and this may be a dealbreaker for some people.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, though, One Punch Man delivers a unique brand of comedy, and is extremely well-presented. Even at its worst point, it's an average action series, and it's best, it's a fantastic farcical comedy.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: Not actually the greatest thing ever made. Still well worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 10/10\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nActing: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Samurai Flamenco, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann",

            "content": "\u201cSaitama\u201d, I guess that name often heard by all of the anime fans out there including me this lately. Well, that makes sense because this anime One Punch Man that adapted from a manga remake by Yusuke Murata and originally written by ONE has caught a large attention through it series. As most people knew, there\u2019s pro and contra that shows up among anime fans out there about this show and because of that, I feel that I have to watch this no matter what. And now I finally did it so I\u2019m gonna present this review of me for this anime. For more 20minutes in each episode, you will find an extraordinary action and superhero stuff with a little bit parody that makes you stay and watch this anime till your jaw drops. Well, if anyone ask me how good it could be, then I can tell you that this anime is worth to watch especially to all of you who like an enjoyable anime filled with the surprising act.\\n\\n\r\n(SPOILER ALERT)\\n\\n\r\n(*) Story\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an incredibly powerful hero lives in the city, so powerful till he can easily defeat his enemies with a single punch. Well, most people will probably think, \u201cthat is sooo boring!\u201d. But, don\u2019t you ever think like that, my friend! Why? Let me tell you about it. There\u2019s some beneficial things that the story section have in this anime (besides the character section). First, the story itself. I mean, the main story is so simple like I bet that many people from around the world have probably thought the same main idea just like this anime have. So simple till no one will ever tire to watch this anime from the very beginning till the end. The title suits the story, and that wasn\u2019t made to overwhelm the power that the main character have but to making it more unique than the other anime that already exist out there. Second, the action setting. The story takes place in Japanese metropolis city which is great. Because that is a number one story background in a suggestion that will get epic when there\u2019s some unstoppable character with massive power like heroes count in it. The violence, the destruction and the instant of falling objects that will make the audience\u2019s jaw drops over and over again when they watch it. The actions itself are superb too. Believe me, even though this is a superhero anime, doesn\u2019t mean that it's saved for children to watch it. I mean, you\u2019ll find a lot of blood splashing too in it. This make sense because the seinen demographic that the manga remake have. And the last but not least benefit of the story is the parody. Actually, \u201cparody\u201d is one of the genre that hard to adapt for several reasons but the writer making it so natural and easy to received. You\u2019ll meet many characters which you found familiar from other anime characters that show up in this anime. I guess the writer just want to represent all of the heroes anime in his creation and making it resemble with each of character in the story. But, again.. that\u2019s a very wonderful idea cause it makes the audience not bored when some familiar yet remindful character pops up and makes a little comedy in it. The writer has changed this genre from hard to playful yet fun genre to watch. But, despite all above, the story itself still have some problem. For an example like the conflict of the story, the \u201cexistence\u201d of it nearly gone. Probably because the main story (the super power stuff) consumed all of the episode and changes it to a next over-power level to shows up. It\u2019s surely great, but.. I believe \u201cconflict\u201d is the section that has to exist in any stories. Luckily, the main character in the story brings himself to self-conflict in several episodes that explain who he really is. Like disrespectful that he received from others and he solved it just by several words. For the ending, it\u2019s still an uncertain ending. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of problems that they still need to solve or explain, like who Metal Knight really is, the past of Genos, the intention of Amai Mask, and many other problems. But besides that, the story still fun to watch. You will like the writer\u2019s creativity for add the main character\u2019s adventure with many various characters or like the association that made up and the surprising events that show up. I can say it filled with so much action and mind-blowing effect.   \\n\\n\r\n(*) Art\\n\r\nThe art was very good. It surely fits the story. You can feel the sensation of every move like you watch a real superhero. I bet the creators put all of their hard work in this section. And believe me, making an action anime with the unusual move or fighting-battle like that is not just as simple as you flip your hand. But, they have succeeded to bring an action to all of the episode which extremely stunning. Well, the creator did save energy to draw the main character, Saitama which I found simple to draw him just like an egg (no hurt feelings, it\u2019s true) for several condition in the story but has managed to change his appearance to a serious one when he\u2019s in an epic battle. But, that was good because with his unique appearance like that, he becomes the most memorable character and he \u201cis\u201d the main character after all. And don\u2019t tell me about the animation, it\u2019s really remarkable! Until now, I still remember the scene when Genos forced Saitama to train with him seriously, the art in that scene was sooo amazing and for the favorite was the final battle scene\u2026. Believe me, it was more than \u201camazing\u201d. No protest in this section.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Sound\\n\r\nOkay, about the opening and ending\u2026. hmm, well\u2026. actually, those two are not really my favorite type of song but as long as they fit the story I guess that\u2019s fair enough. I mean the opening was really \u201csuperheroic\u201d, both the instrument and the lyrics. They have succeeded to symbolize One Punch Man to a song originally. And about the back sound was really epic! I really appreciate Makoto Miyazaki for his work on the music because it has nailed it to serves the audience like they watch a real superhero film. It just fits in with the classical music playing on and made a great symphony to rising the atmosphere of every scene. For the voice actor, Saitama\u2019s role was voiced by Makoto Furukawa. He has made it describe Saitama\u2019s personality like how passive he was sometimes or when he turns into serious-mode, his voice changed dramatically. And the other main character, Genos was voiced by Kaito Ishikawa. I think he has succeeded too. He made it to serves the audience about Genos\u2019s personality who always curious about the secret power of Saitama even though he is a cyborg. And don\u2019t forget about other\u2019s voice actor like Aoi Yuki (Tornado), Yuki Kaji (Sonic), Yuichi Nakamura (Mumen Raider), Kenjiro Tsuda (Atomic Samurai), Minami Takayama (Child Emperor), Sakurai Takahiro (Zombieman), Mamoru Miyano (Amai Mask) and many other. Their name has been known by most anime fans for the popular role in other anime. And they weren't disappointed the audience in here either.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Character\\n\r\nThe character section still has some sort of problem. For an example like the fast introduction of the characters (besides the main characters). It just so fast till I realize I didn\u2019t know who the heck he or she really is till their name was being told. Well, I guess that\u2019s impact of how simple the story is, making it a little bit fast pace. And another example is about the sudden new character that shows up like when the Ocean King knocks the superheroes down in the shelter, there\u2019s several character that suddenly appear which turns out to be a hero too (except Snake). And when I watch that I felt\u2026. hmm, \u201coh-kaay so suddenly there\u2019s another hero in the shelter that I really didn\u2019t get a clue about who they are\u2026\u201d I admit it that I\u2019m confused for a second but then Genos finally came to the shelter and my confusion out of focus, changed into curiosity about what will happen next after other superheroes got beaten. I guess that \u201cmisdirection\u201d has only half-succeed. And for the last example, the development of the characters. I didn\u2019t see any development in this story, there\u2019s some self-conflict but it hasn't brought some kind of development to the main characters. But I guess that\u2019s fine, compared to the amount of the episode of this anime. I think if the episode more than twelve, maybe they could fix this problem. Or probably the writer just want to tell the audience about the main story first before the developmental section, hmm, I don\u2019t know. It all depends on the writer. But for me, I guess that to have a story like this it doesn\u2019t enough for just twelve episodes. Well, they did make OVA\u2019s after all, let\u2019s just hope that the OVA\u2019s give some kind of explanation, answer or repair those problems. But other than that, the character section did nail it for some reason. Like the design of the supporting characters, the illustrator has made the characters was easy to memorize because their unique appearance and the similarities to other anime\u2019s character. Like Silverfang, I did found easy to memorize him because he really similar to Zeno Zoldyck from Hunter X Hunter. And he did found the easy way to introduce Saitama and Genos as the main character of the story with the differential appearance they have. I mean, Saitama\u2019s appearance so simple (bold, bright costume with red gloves) different than Genos who has the complex appearance (blonde-pale yellow hair, armored costume, black long pants). It\u2019s making them so easy to memorize plus with their story background, age info, and their personality. I bet many people too has become their fans for that reasons (besides \u201cthe popular\u201d and \u201cthe badass\u201d reason). That points explain why this two main character more loved by the audience rather than the other characters. Well, if you guys want to know more about the other characters (supporting), I think you should read the webtoon, the remake manga or just searching to find more. Because you\u2019ll not get that in this anime. It\u2019s full of action and the main character\u2019s role.           \\n\\n\r\n(*) Enjoyment\\n\r\nI enjoying it very much till the end. Although at the first episode, I\u2019m not really into it but the story, the characters, and the sound were amazingly succeeded to draw both \u201cenjoy\u201d and \u201ccuriosity\u201d to me. This anime was really fun to watch. You\u2019re not gonna tired of watching each of episode, I bet there are a lot of anime fans out there that finished watching this anime just only one day or half-day because of it enjoyed. And it actually makes me re-watch this anime again from the very beginning. If you ask which section that satisfy me the most, then the answer is in this section. Because the hesitation to watch it from the start was totally gone as the story goes on and suddenly you just realize that you have watched till the last episode. Speak of the last episode, that was certainly an epic battle that you can found only in this anime. So, despite it lacks for some part as I mentioned above, you will not get bored to watch this and I can say that One Punch Man is highly recommended for all of the anime fans out there. Finally, for a suggestion, don\u2019t mind about the pro and contra about this show, just watch it for yourself and the final score certainly depends on your taste of anime. Everyone has different taste and likes, good and bad are relative, you\u2019re the one who decide it.",

            "content": "Going back to One Punch Man, I really thought of something. Something that can make or break this show to several of its viewers. And that's the joke. The one prominent singular joke. \r\nI'm not saying this is going to be a completely balanced review. And most of you might get upset over that fact, and even start to hate me for it too. And I can understand why. I would hate it if someone didn't provide both sides to the argument for my favorite show, but keep in mind that I am not authoritative force, and I cannot dictate how or what you shouldthink. For all you know, you might just stumble a 4 paragraph post by me describing how shoving hotdogs up your ass is actually a good thing. But I'm hoping that maybe next time you go to the grill, you can ponder on what you're going to do with that hotdog. Or maybe you still won't do that, but you'll at least know why some people might like sticking hotdogs up their ass. But anyways, let's get on with this review.\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man has got to be one of the most commonly talked about show I've seen this year, even impacting the smash community when one of the smash player's shaved their beard and started using Ryu. In all honesty, how many shows can you say do that? But does this fulfill the hype, and is this the savior of anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you are like me, and expected One Punch Man to be a satire, then you will be disappointed. Rather than making fun of its tropes directly, One Punch Man parodies it instead by over-exaggerating them to the point where it becomes funny. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily, but there are problems with that. With the already ridiculous start of the series, it makes it hard to enjoy the jokes when they are virtually indistinguishable. You can't top off something so exaggerated, similar to how you can't top off beating an enemy with a single punch. Because of this, as the series went on, the joke lost its charm as it wasn't special anymore. After seeing a couple of episodes, you know what to expect from it, which really damaged the comedy effect. And yes, the final episodes did stray away from that, but even that was just a elongated scene of what was soon going to happen. If you really look at it, it was just Saitama getting beaten up with a variety of attacks.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem of One Punch Man getting repetitive may seem like a small thing, but in fact, it really isn't. When a comedy starts to get unappealing, there isn't much that can save that. The parody is all that One Punch Man seemed to offer, and if you don't like that, than you definitely won't like the show. \\n\\n\r\nNear the end, it was hinted that the focus will eventually shift from the parody aspect to the side characters, something that would benefit the series as the more \"Slice of Life\" aspects where the strong suit of One Punch Man, but for now, the first season is all we got.\\n\\n\r\nYou could say that being repetitive and anticlimactic is the point of One Punch Man, and it in itself is actually also parodying the repetitive nature of most action shows, but I disagree. There should be something that would want to make the watcher come back for more. Your daily life as a human being isn't characterized by the same exact thing each time. Maybe the steps building up to 'the punchline' are different, or maybe you don't  exactly engage with 'the punchline' each time. The moment in this case is the same exact thing, with the only differences being how the villains look or where the fight is taking place. What kind of show is engaging, but doesn't have an engaging story? Even if that was the point, how is it fun to watch the same thing 12 times?\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the parody aspect of it, then the repetitiveness of the joke shouldn't be a problem for you, but if you wanted a bit more than just that, then you won't be getting that from One Punch Man.\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone tells you that the animation of One Punch Man is bad, then they're just trying to shit on the show for the sake of shitting on the show. Though inconsistent at times, the show looked amazing when it called for a fight scene, and average at least when it called for a more Slice of Life moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe music did a good job in making you hyped and excited for each fight and episodes. It's not something I could see anyone listening outside from this anime, but it's good nevertheless in enhancing the show.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say in such a simple show like this. I'll ask once again if it wasn't clear the first 100 times. Did you like the joke, or did you not? After you found that out, you'll know what to do.",

            "content": "This is a complete review after watching all 12 episodes of One Punch Man.\r\n**CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS**\r\nI remember when I was 8 years old, I used to be excited for a new Pokemon episode everyday. I used to run from school to my house so that I wouldn\u2019t miss any single moment. Then as you grow up, such excitement starts to fade away. No matter how good a show is, only a few shows can generate such an excitement for a viewer. I never would\u2019ve imagined that an anime would make me feel that excitement again at 20 yrs. And lucky for me, it aired onSundays!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man\u2019s story is simple- The story of an average guy who\u2019s a hero for fun. Now what makes this unique is that this show is a parody. For people new to that genre, it\u2019s an imitation of other work. Basically what this anime does is it makes a parody out of shounen genre, where you have a male protagonist who gets beaten down, and then trains or in some other way defeats the bad guy. Here, the MC is just over-powered to the extent that he gets depressed there\u2019s no one strong enough to challenge him. You might think that such a strong person would be revered as a God by the people. Sadly, you\u2019re mistaken. The people don\u2019t even know he exists!! . This really plays a major point in the later episodes, when Saitama has to show his strength infront of the public, and becomes one of the highlight of this series. This show was created to poke fun at all tropes in anime. This is a story made to enjoy, not to be taken seriously. Anyone who is open-minded will enjoy this anime to its full extent.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow the only reason I gave this a 9 is because of the meticulously high standard set by Ufotable in the Fate series and Kara no Kyoukai movies. But by no means is it far behind. In most anime, usually the MC has some kind of weapon, you can just add some flashy effects to go with it. But here, we have a hero who\u2019s weapon are just his fists . The fights had to be carefully drawn and animated. And when you have a studio like Madhouse doing it, you know they rarely disappoint. Fluid motion, spectacular effects, no weird faces, nothing overdramatic. Simple, yet awesome. The best part of this anime has to be the \u201cSaitama Expressions\u201d. If you didn\u2019t smile atleast a little when you saw the \u201cOK\u201d face, then I guess your sense of humour is locked up somewhere. Madhouse know how to make the viewer enjoy the anime to the full extent. The way they used Tatsumaki\u2019s \u201cchibi mode\u201d expressions from the webcomic, and boldly animated it in the anime deserves separate praise. Also the landscape for OPM universe is also brilliant. Even the ordinary people are drawn with careful details. Another important aspect here is the design for the villains, especially Sea King and Boros, each having something unique, and they give out the \u201cstrong, badass\u201d vibe when you just look at them.  Also, the art in the final episode is 11/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGod-level. Simply eargasmic. When you have an opening theme that makes you want to shout \u201cONE PUUUUUUUNCH!\u201d every time you hear it, you know the soundtrack\u2019s gonna be amazing. For me, the first thing I\u2019d hear in my mind every morning when I wake up is someone shouting \u201cONE PUUUUUUNCH!\u201d That\u2019s how much I love that opening theme. From character bgm\u2019s to fight themes, the music suits every situation perfectly, making them more epic. I would rewatch every episode again just to hear the music, that\u2019s how good it is. The voice acting is also brilliant, especially Aoi Yuuki, who brilliantly brought out Tatsumaki\u2019s bratty voice, and Yuki Kaji, whose voice fits Sonic\u2019s character perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOnce in a lifetime you watch shows where every character in it makes an impact. One Punch Man is mine. I can probably name every single character that appeared in these 12 episodes. That\u2019s how much of an impact they make. Saitama with his care-free attitude, the loyal cyborg Genos, Jack\u2019o Lantern Panic, Brattymaki, Justice Rider, the S-class heroes like Silver Fang, Metal Bat, Pri-Pri Prisoner, King, and all the others have a uniqueness that makes you remember them. Even characters whom play a cameo like Carnage Kabuto, Mosquito Girl, Snek, Stinger, Amai Mask manage to leave an impression, which is something most anime fail to do. And when you have such a strong character cast, the anime rarely falters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was made to enjoy, and One Punch Man nails the formula. I enjoyed every second of it. 24x12 minutes of pure awesomeness. It makes you laugh, the \u201cwow\u201d feeling when you watch those spectacularly animated fight scenes, even the simple dialogues between the characters make you laugh hard. There is no walking in on naked girl scenes, boob-grabbing, fan service and other shit like that. This anime makes me remember that Charlie Chaplin didn\u2019t have to talk to make people laugh and enjoy his movies. Just his reactions and expressions were enough. And Saitama\u2019s expressions and reactions reminded me of that again. And no matter how many times you rewatch it, you\u2019ll never get bored. That\u2019s the kind of masterpiece this is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is a masterpiece. I\u2019ve been watching anime for about 8 years, watched around 400 anime series, and I\u2019d only have around 5 anime which I\u2019d give a 10/10. But this show is just simply that good. If I could I\u2019d have given this a 999/10 for enjoyment. Studio Madhouse is just leagues ahead of any anime studio. I wish I could go to Japan and personally congratulate them for making such a great anime. While I\u2019m at that, I could also beg them to make a Season 2 of the anime when the manga has enough material for it. Natsume Shingo, the director of this anime, deserves all the credit for bringing together an amazing team, and voice cast to create this anime. Overall, One Punch Man does what it sets out to deliver, Entertain. And boy oh boy it does so in style!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There are only two types of people in the world: one who absolutely love One Punch Man, and other who strongly dislike it for being too predictable. Now finally that the anime is over, I can review it properly. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nOne Punch Man is an action-comedy anime which tells a story about a man named Saitama who is 'a hero just for fun' in a world where monsters and heroes are quite common. He is quite overpowered and manages to kill anyone in just a single punch, which has made his life quite boring. Soon a new cyborg named Genos is introduced who is insearch for another robot who destroyed his village and he later requests Saitama to become his master after seeing his strength.\\n\r\nAt first the story sounds quite predictable and the idea of killing anyone in a single punch adds more to it. Yes, it's true! It becomes a little predictable and the humor of killing anyone in a single punch dies off quickly. But the anime doesn't has only that much to offer. The story starts developing from 5th episode with the introduction of Hero Association and a ranking system which classifies heroes into C class, B class, A class and S class having rankings in each class. New characters are introduced and the story becomes more interesting. The last two arcs were very good, so just don't drop the anime in your early episodes thinking that it's getting predictable or is not worth watching.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is the best element of One Punch Man! The art of this anime is fabulous. Madhouse has again done a wonderful job. The backgrounds are really well done and the fighting scenes are amazing. Infact One Punch Man and Fate/Zero are the best graphics anime I have seen in my life! One Punch Man is actually a pretty average budget anime. The secret behind One Punch Man's amazing graphics lies behind the fact that it has been directed by Shingo Natsume (Key animator of Gurren Lagann, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Hachimitsu to Clover), assisting Kazuya Murata and with the legendary Kenichi Konishi supervising the animation, Sejoon Kim (animator of Gundam) as a regular animation director. Another notable element of One-Punch Man's visuals is the digital animation, something also tied to Natsume's presence. Other than the animation staff, there is someone else who deserves special credit. People who have read Yusuke Murata's version of One-Punch Man \u2013 the one the anime is based on \u2013 know that even before the anime, the series already was animated. Sort of. Sometimes rather arbitrarily, Murata would go on to draw sequences step-by-step with a ridiculous level of detail, almost as if they were key animation sheets. Something he is capable of putting off because he's an exceptional and dedicated artist, but also because he is a fan of animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nAnother element of One Punch Man which makes the show amazing! Opening and Ending song, both are wonderful. I keep listening to both of them over and over again because they are that awesome. All the OSTs are also worth listening to, and some are just superb which may give you goosebumps! Voice acting is also top notch. Many talented voice actors like Miyano Mamoru, Sawashiro Miyuki, Kaji Yuki, Sakurai Takahiro, Nakamura Yuuichi, Hayami Saori, Namikawa Daisuke etc are there and they have done a great job.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nAll the characters are quite likeable. They have unique personalities and possess a unique charm in themselves. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI will write a few words on my (and people's) most favorite characters from One Punch Man:\\n\\n\r\n1. Saitama - Our favorite hero, the protagonist of the show, quite humorous.\\n\\n\r\n2. Genos - Saitama's partner, best disciple, cyborg and cool. \\n\\n\r\n3. Mumen Rider - C class hardworking hero who rides a cycle but is physically pretty weak to fight with monsters but is very courageous and hardworking/\\n\\n\r\n4. Sonic - A ninja! What more? Everybody likes ninjas (Naruto haters please keep it low! -_-)\\n\\n\r\n5. Tatsumaki? - You know what I am talking about if you have seen 11th episode of One Punch Man! ;) [If you still don't understand, let me know -_-']\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed One Punch Man because of it's intense action which were beautified by amazing graphics and coated with amazing soundtracks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.6/10\\n\r\nIf you like action-comedy (with frequent serious arcs), adventure and superpower anime, and elements like graphics and sound are an important factor for you then you MUST WATCH this anime! Even if you don't like all that, you can give it a try. I assure you that One Punch Man is NOT some random cliche anime which has random power boosts which makes it impossible to watch. It is quite entertaining.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S-Comments appreciated :)",

            "content": "When it comes to satires and parodies alike, there really isn't any sort of arithmetic equation or analytical evaluation needed to determine its value. To put it as simply, it all boils down to a rudimentary question: were you kept amused and were you entertained? \r\nIf you said \"no\" then that's fine, there really isn't any need to justify that answer any further, same also applies if you had said \"yes.\" You see, shows geared to keep you amused are that simple, the same way disliking or liking a specific genre of music doesn't inherently determine its worth to the next person to listen toit. Of course, there are many different brands of comedies out there, some sub-genres of which can be measured by its degree of writing and comedic timing, but this should also come with the understanding that within the marginalizing of \"comedy\" as a genre, there are also room for low-brow humor that relies entirely on dick jokes and crass observations. I say all this to make this point, comedy, like music and other forms of interests that determine an individual's taste, is at essence, a subjective thing. And when something's worth is dependent entirely on whether someone is amused/entertained or not, it's automatically a magnet for contention. For everyone that finds a joke funny, there will be those that stand in opposition.\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is a joke that's rather predictable and repetitive if you only care for the punchline but at the same time, a great deal more satisfying if you're keen to the subject matter that's following up to its inevitable destination. In a way, it's an inside joke among friends, just done so for everyone else to hear. It isn't trying to hide it, there's no workaround into deciphering any deep seeded message. What you see is precisely what you get. One Punch Man is a lineage carried over from super sentai/superhero/shounen stories that took a look at itself in the mirror and came to a simple conclusion; that conclusion being that super sentai/superhero/shounen shows are hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nNo really, think about it for a second. It's a form of storytelling that was forged from the need to give moral messages by embodying everything in basic \"black or white\" terms, where you either stand for good or evil. What makes it funny is that these absurd stories are often played straight with no witticism or awareness of its laughable morality message whatsoever. It's a stone-faced, Bible thumping message on morality that's delivered to its audience by grown men and women wearing brightly colored spandex. It's the kind of irony that's only feasible within the realm of fiction, but hilarious in real life when examined. Of course, the inherent silliness of superhero stories have given rise to many satirical outlooks on the subject matter, but for the most part, those aimed more so to poke fun of that form of storytelling, rather than laughing along with it. But every now and then we get a show that isn't out to sully the impact of the subject matter being satirized, instead, it embraces it to its full extent. Rather than teetering between comical nonsense and serious commentary, it decides why to bother holding up that facade, to begin with. It's a show that comes to the conclusion that if you're going to be bat shit crazy, you might as well go all the way.\\n\\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen this long winded intro is written for the sole purpose of introducing an anime that does just that, One Punch Man. Not only is it aware of the utter nonsense that populates the super sentai/superhero landscape, but it figures that there's no point in trying to deny it. It's a show that revels in the stupidity with no shame or care for onlookers. It's an anime that's comfortable in its spandex suit and flaunts it for all to see. It's a joke that tells you to put away the analytical scrutiny, loosen up your thinking cap, and just come along for the good ole dumb ride that's about to take place. \\n\\n\r\nAs I've already previously stated, your individualistic feelings for the show is the deciding factor on its inherent value. So with that being said, this review is written from the point of view of someone who, for the most part, found the journey with OPM to be satisfactory. Whether you disagree with this statement or not isn't important. I'm not here to tell you OPM is great, and I'm not here to tell you it's anything deeper than what it is; rather, I'm here to explain what kinks OPM managed to properly iron out, and where I as a viewer found noticeable bumps on the journey.\\n\\n\r\nWhile OPM provided a great deal of entertainment, it also had its fair share of issues that detracted from the overall experience. For one, if this anime was created with less effort on the part of the studio (Madhouse) with its audiovisuals, there would be little to credit it for otherwise. The driving force behind OPM is how pristine and well-oiled it looks and feels as a product. This is an anime that relies heavily on the platform of storytelling it is using. This is an anime that works so well because it IS an anime. It's the sense of scale behind every action being taken by our characters. The impact and fluidity of every animated movement. The hyper-detail behind every intricately choreographed action set-piece and moments of high-octane clashes. The flurry of saturated color that follows every frame. The elastic expressions of the personalities in motion. This is an anime that takes full advantage of its medium, and had it been a show that coasted along to a by-the-numbers checklist, there wouldn't be any need to discuss it at all. This was a passion project brought to life in spectacular fashion. Everything from the traditional heavy metal guitar riffs in the background, to the highly detailed shading of the character designs, makes this feel like more than an assembly line production simply made for profit, it became a work of passion.\\n\\n\r\nIt stands to reason that the audiovisual presentation and aesthetic appeal was what propelled this show to instant stardom. So the question remains, why is it so aggressively detested by others?\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen the arguments from detractors of the show, you've undoubtedly caught wind of the \"One Joke Man\" mantra, and to be quite honest, that isn't a bad assessment of the show in a nutshell. Saitama, our lead character and resident impersonator of Mr. Clean, is a man that has grown bored of his acquired strength in pursuit to become a superhero. For reasons vaguely explained, he has reached a point where he can obliterate his foes in one punch. And if you were expecting a \"but\" at the end of that sentence, don't hold your breath, this is the joke. It's like the climatic end to a battle shounen, where our main character goes through his training arc and defeats the antagonist, after he hit his ultimate form of over-powered potential... but instead of simply ending the story there, we're given an extended \"what if\" prologue that asks the question: what happens after the final conflict is over, after our hero reaches the apex of the beat 'em up food chain?\\n\\n\r\nAnd from that question emerges this product; this joke. And while there is an overarching story unfolding in the background, it's the joke that takes precedence and placed on center-stage for our amusement. And it's this joke that creates the split among those who adore the show and those that carry around the \"One Joke Man\" picket sign in protest to its popularity. As trivial of an argument it may seem, this comedic gag is the reason for the rift among anime viewers, which has become a joke within itself (super meta shit). \\n\\n\r\nThere are two main parts to the overarching story: one of which involves Saitama and his ironic post-climb to the top of a superhero organization to gain recognition, while also trying to fulfill his excessive need to seek out an enemy that can finally put up a challenge. And the other subplot revolves around his apprentice and eventual friend, Genos, who's goal can be seen as the stereotypical hero story of vengeance. And while both stories are played straight, it's the awareness the show has for its content which lets everyone in on the joke, and also what makes the parody of the subject matter both amusing, and in a weird way, self-indulgent. While the show follows these narratives in a fashion expected, it does so with a constant sense of witticism and deliberate elbow nudging. This, as a result, can lead to scenes where expository dialogue is given, while our lead is trying to dismiss it, the equivalent of which is like the character breaking the fourth wall and looking into the camera saying \"isn't this shit boring? I wish he would shut up already!\" It's these moments that make what can be seen as a fairly common story, into one that's not only fun to follow, but also something like brownie points for the viewer that are keen to the observations. It's an anime that actively interacts with the expectation of the audience watching it. And while these moments still play second-fiddle to the constant beat 'em up action on screen, it's those moments that give OPM its sense of identity. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the beat 'em up action, OPM effectively nails this aspect down without much debate. While the satirical moments sprinkled throughout shines in its own way, it's the fight scenes that elevates this title to a growing household name. It's the fuel behind the hype if you will. And while that may be a superficial reason to bolster its value, it's still a viable reason for the sake of consumable entertainment. One of its primary genres is action after all, and when it comes to action, very few shows can stand as competition to the consistent level of quality encapsulated in OPM.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of OPM are just that, characters. You're not looking at them for any profound message or character depth, rather it's the eccentricity of the personalities themselves that works. From the typical hero of justice stereotypes found in characters like Genos and Mumen Rider, to the more obvious satirized ones like Amai Mask and Metal Bat. It's comic book personalities brought to life and set loose, all for the sole purpose of wacky antics and populating the setting with a garden variety of personas. The villains can range from the ultra-silly like a lobsterman wearing underwear (similar to something found in the likes of super sentai works), to the more maniacal dimensionless baddie who's sole purpose in life is to fight strong opponents (similar to that of most battle shounens). It's this variety of Saturday morning cartoon level characters that keep things fresh. And with the over-exaggerated character designs, it becomes even more elevated than what would typically be seen from this kind of show. \\n\r\nAlthough, this, as a result, creates the most shallow cast imaginable, and while they're still endearing in the already goofy backdrop they're placed in, they're not in any way new to what would come out of this brand of storytelling. The more you buy into the comedic outlook the show presents everything in, the easier it is to buy into their placement in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis, of course, leads to one of the more noticeable problems the show can't seem to get a grasp on, and that's that nothing it does can be taken seriously. The show goes out of its way to paint everything in clown makeup, so when it does try to take things down a more serious route the final result is more of an apathetic shrug and resounding \"who cares,\" than anything you can deem potent. This isn't to say that those more serious moments don't hold meaning, but that in the context of a parody that has been doing nothing but laughing along with the audience, the moments are simply unwarranted. It's like if a stoner comedy stopped everything dead in its tracks to present a D.A.R.E speech against the use of drugs. Thankfully these moments aren't ever-present throughout the show's run-time. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue that many might have with OPM is quite obviously the joke itself. Being that it's a repetitive comedic gag, many might find the novelty of the gag to have less impact as the show goes on. This, of course, is a reasonable concern, since variety is what keeps long-running sitcoms and comedies on the air. The show attempts to alleviate that concern with the involvement of characters like Genos, who serves as the duality to Saitama's placement in the story. \\n\r\nAnd then there's Saitama himself, who is a deadpan protagonist for a majority of the show's run-time. Those unfamiliar or simply indifferent to deadpan humor will of course not find anything in Saitama, making him uninteresting to most, and rightfully so. And like the concern of the run-on joke losing its luster, the myriad of other wacky characters introduced are the show's defense to keep the attentiveness of those who simply can't be bothered with the uncaring and often cynical outlook Saitama is given. This isn't a case where the lead is a blank slate, but rather he's a character that should have already been done with his arc and involvement in the story. This is the follow up to where a typical hero story should have ended, the downward spiral of a man who has already achieved all that there is to do in his given universe. Which of course is the point of this prolog inspired series, but like I've already stated, the inherent value of OPM rests with the viewer's taste in comedy, so this problem may not even register at all to a lot of people.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite these indeterminate shortcomings, the show still manages to do enough to keep itself together. Because it's so self-aware, a great deal of these issues is often made to be null and void. It's hard to dissect a show that is so honest about what it is. This doesn't wash away the issues it may have, but it certainly makes it more palatable to a consumer that isn't necessarily concerned about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI can go on and on about what the show had working against it, but at the end of the day, I walked away with a title that constantly kept me entertained. The fights were great fun, the animation was handled with care, the OST was kickass, the satirical jabs kept me cackling, and above all else, I was more than satisfied as a viewer and fellow enthusiast of anime. Sure the run-on gag lost steam at times, and yes the plot wasn't always engaging, but as far as enjoyment is concerned, OPM scratched an itch that previously only Jojo of the same year was able to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIs One Punch Man over-hyped? Yes, it certainly is. But does that make it inherently bad? No, it doesn't. While it may be blown out of proportion due to the fact that its contemporaries are of less than stellar quality, there are still merits to the appraisal it receives. It isn't a title that will break new ground anytime soon, and partially, it's a Frankenstein who's existence can be credited with the recent high demand for superhero stories in pop culture. But as an action-comedy that's out to simply have fun and revel in the absurdity of its story, One Punch Man is a show that can keep even the most jaded of audiences entertained, and if only for that aspect alone, I think it's worth trying out.",

            "content": "One-Punch Man is pretty much exactly like what it sounds. We got a bald guy named Saitama who literally beats his opponents with a single punch. He is so powerful that throughout his life, he gets bored with the opponent he fights with. Because when a guy like him can beat up opponents with just one punch, it doesn\u2019t get very fun right? Regardless, Saitama has a heart of gold and in this series, we follow his daily adventures as a hero, as the man who one punches his enemies.\r\nIn general, the series is actually a TV anime adaptation of the remake of the webmanga by ONE. As such, the art is based on Yusuke Murata\u2019s work rather than the original series. The original web series became an internet sensation as it began publishing in June 2009. Given the nature of the series as well the fast growing popularity, there\u2019s a lot of expectations coming from fans about the adaptation. Honestly, I can say that it\u2019s also a sensation. \\n\\n\r\nDirected by Shingo Natsume, he became more well-known recently with his involvement with directing Space Dandy. For One-Punch Man, the series would have to go all out and tear the house down with what it has to offer. The first episode easily establishes the show as an animation powerhouse with the high production quality by Madhouse. The fighting movements, rapid camera angles, and overall cinematics is stellar throughout many of its action sequences. In addition, Saitama\u2019s role easily makes him entertaining to watch because of just simply how badass he is despite being drawn in such a simple way. With a bald head, average height, muscular toned body, and heroish cape, he is the guy that everyone needs to keep an eye on. What mostly makes Saitama stands out is his way of fighting. Yes, most of his fights are rather quick fashioned because of how overpowered he is. I think at some point, Saitama can be dubbed as \u2018One-OP Man\u2019 just because of how ridiculous he is with the way his fights concludes. His hero name is \u2018Caped Baldy\u2019 and it\u2019s pretty self-explanatory why.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to picture One-Punch Man as more of a parody, a satire of superheroes and battle shounen. While the story of One-Punch Man isn\u2019t a masterpiece, it\u2019s still appealing because of Saitama\u2019s daily adventures. These adventures takes him to new places, conflicts with new enemies, and also establishing alliances with new friends. One of his most prominent friends is Genos, a cyborg dubbed as the \u201cDemon Cyborg\u201d. He is Saitama\u2019s disciple and often tries to earn his respect. Their growing relationship seems peculiar at first but also very amusing to watch as they have a fun chemistry. The majority of the other characters of the series are part of a group known as the Hero Association, an organization apparently formed with the purpose to fight monsters and protect City Z. What\u2019s unique about the Hero Association is that the group is composed of all type of heroes ranging from a child prodigy, psycho esper, prideful samurai, or even genius scientists. Throughout Saitama\u2019s daily adventures, he also encounters a variety of adversaries and villains. Whether it\u2019s speedy ninjas or oversized sea monsters, Saitama always seems to find a way to defeat them. This might be the part that strains some people from watching. A common question that may pop up is \u201cwhat\u2019s the point then if Saitama can just one hit KO all his opponents?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI think the main objective of the show is to portray the action as a parody. It\u2019s like the show is self-aware especially with Saitama\u2019s antics. This extends to his iconic fight with Genos, the invasion of Boros\u2019 forces, or his training test to become a hero. Although the comedy can feel exaggerated, it\u2019s also very engaging with all sort of gags the show tries to pull. Every episode also introduces a diverse range of heroes or monsters so there\u2019s plenty to offer for those looking into variety. Certain underrated characters such as License-less Rider also gets their spotlight of fame so the show isn\u2019t just entirely about Saitama. As the comedy can occasionally feel overwhelming, it\u2019s still delightful with the character expressions (mostly coming from Saitama) and excitement it brings. Even the dialogues can offer a sharp appeal that will give the fans to remember something about.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all the comedy, there\u2019s still some set of standards the show follows. The rankings of the Hero Association such as \u201cS-Rank\u201d or \u201cB-Rank\u201d have meanings behind them that associates with their reputation. Unfortunately, Saitama is assigned a lesser rank than most may expect mostly because of his appearance. Only a few recognizes his true abilities although he himself doesn\u2019t seem to care that much either. What he does care though is being a hero and that\u2019s something to really be recognized. While most of his fights ends in just one punch, the way Saitama performs it is bizarrely amusing. One minute, he is starring into something that appears to be overwhelmingly above his abilities. The next minute that something turns into being punched to oblivion. Saitama\u2019s speed and endurance is also extremely impressive as he has taken superhuman level attacks at point-blank range. Again, some people will notice that his fights tends to be \u201canti-climatic\u201d. However, look at the bigger picture here. The way Saitama gives his opponents the hope that they will win effortlessly, the dull expressions he shows in the face of danger, and his inability to remember the names of his opponents are also portrayed more as a parody for comical purposes. It then translates to their defeat which is all that much more devastating. That\u2019s almost like an artistic way of fighting. On the other hand, Saitama\u2019s characterization in this adaptation isn\u2019t very promising. There\u2019s not much revealed about his past so you\u2019ll have to search around the OVA to learn more about his background story. And also, while the adaptation captures the magic of the manga (by even adding some workable filler content), it does omit some aspects which fans may be disappointed about.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve said it before but I\u2019ll say it again. Madhouse has proven themselves of animating this to the highest caliber. The action sequences, background scenery, facial expressions, and overall tone of the show is delivered with exquisite art. It also has an experimental feel to it with the way the characters are designed with a wide spectrum of different looks. What\u2019s most interesting is how Saitama is designed with such simple features especially during comedic scenes. Whether human or monster, One-Punch Man stands as a solid testament for an adaptation by animation standards.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is just as powerful especially with some of the character themes that matches with fighting sequences. The OP song also approaches itself with a stereo beat and heroic-like theme of heavy lyrics. On the other hand, Saitama\u2019s voice is pretty normal despite his overwhelming power. However, some other characters voiced in the show is noticeable such as Genos, Tatsumaki, Boros, and a few others of the villain variety. Be prepared for a hyperactive ride.\\n\\n\r\nOne-Punch Man may seem a bit overrated as it exploded into popularity. From an internet sensation to a TV smash hit, the series continue to grow. A second season is also likely in the inevitable future as well as mentioned by the producers. And the reason being is the sheer success it has achieved. It might not have Shakespearean level storytelling but it\u2019s definitely something fun to take home with every episode. The battle shounen genre has been around for ages and it\u2019s nice to see how One-Punch Man makes fun of it as a satirical battle blockbuster.\\n",

            "content": "After finishing this show I have concluded that it certainly lives up to its name. Oh no no, not the majority opinion of it, silly goose, I mean the actual show title, \u201cOne Punch Man,\u201d because this show genuinely does only have ONE joke, and it gets old very, very fast.\r\nEverything you need to know or possibly can know about this anime is in its title. The main character defeats every villain in one punch, but what else? That can\u2019t possibly be it, can it? Well\u2026 for all intents and purposes, the show is indeed branded as a parody. But in order for us tosee how successful it is at doing so, let me give you the definition of a \u201cparody.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nParody; /noun/ \u201can imitation of the style of a particular writer, artist, or genre with deliberate exaggeration for comic effect\u201d\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s also look at its synonyms.\\n\\n\r\nmockery, ridicule, satire. Oh there we go, that\u2019s the word. Satire. A satire, and I quote, is the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize a specific \u201cthing,\u201d be it person, place, concept, story, or what-have you. In the case with One Punch Man, the satirical parody is criticizing the Superhero/Shonen genre/demographic and its over the top, predictable nature. Or at least, it would be if it weren\u2019t so incredibly inept at doing so. \\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man\u2019s humorous scenes are so incredibly few and far between (not to mention hit or miss altogether) that the whole show feels more like a comedic action shonen rather than a parody of one. Does it have its funny moments? Sure, but not enough to constitute it as a successful satire, let alone being an actual criticism of something. All it does is fall into the exact same pitfalls of a regular long-running Shonen manga or Marvel comic, and doesn\u2019t present any kind of commentary or criticism (humorous or not) to anything at all. With a team of mere monkeys, it can be boiled down to a very simple, boring formula.\\n\\n\r\n1.\tA threat is present to (insert city here)\\n\r\n2.\tSaitama (our hero) arrives and spends 5 to 10 minutes dicking off\\n\r\n3.\tSaitama defeats the antagonist with ONE-U PAUNCH-U!!!\\n\r\n4.\tRinse and repeat for next week\\n\\n\r\nSo now that we see there is no actual criticism, there\u2019s absolutely no tension in this anime either. While the fight scenes are gorgeously animated (By Madhouse, king of all studios) there\u2019s not much to think or feel when watching one. Sure, there are a lot of pretty colors and explosions and things being destroyed, but do you know what else has that? Transformers. Does Transformers have an engaging plot, or a worthwhile satirical aspect to it? No. Does One Punch Man? No. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as far as disgustingly overpowered, boring protagonists go, Saitama isn\u2019t nearly as insufferable as Kirito but he\u2019s not far off the beaten path. He\u2019s bored with his power to defeat anything in one punch, but who blames him? What kind of life is interesting if you have to work at nothing, if there\u2019s no challenge? What kind of show is interesting, if it doesn\u2019t have any kind of identity or intelligence to it? We never even see Saitama\u2019s training, or his trials and tribulations to becoming what he is now; we just get to see the aftermath! Endless rising action, I\u2019m telling you! No climax whatsoever! \\n\\n\r\nAnd like every 12 episode anime, this show has a cast of heroes and villains that\u2019s larger than Tom Cruise\u2019s ego, and none of them get any kind of worthy screen time either. The closest we get to any kind of character development is the sidekick of Saitama, Genos. But whatever problem he\u2019s in, whatever dilemma he faces, you can just let go of your worry and kick back, knowing Saitama will ONE PUNCH the FUCK out of whatever has him in its grasp. That just tears to shreds ANY semblance of development or changes that Genos could have gone through. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, the character development is thrown to the curb for running jokes, the humor is stale, the action is boring because it\u2019s so predictable, and the entertainment value is comparable to that of staring at a door. You know its gonna open, and you know its gonna close. Because it\u2019s a door. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cBut Keyboard!\u201d I hear one obligatory reader say aloud, \u201cThat\u2019s the point! He defeats everything in One Punch!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nTell me how that\u2019s entertaining, because I don\u2019t see it. Every episode is literally, and I\u2019m not kidding here, LITERALLY, the exact. same. thing. Imagine watching Superman Returns on repeat, with a little tiny bit of the same SNL skit hiding in the background. Twelve times in a row. That\u2019s not entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nBut if you liked it, good for you. I have nothing against you, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to find enjoyment in something my cynical ass mind couldn\u2019t, and I\u2019m being honest when I say that if this show had a little to no following at all, my reaction would be the same, so don\u2019t come to me screaming and hollering about me hating on it because it got popular. I don\u2019t hate popular things, especially when my favorite anime is the highest fucking rated entry on the site. I instead choose to look at what it proposes regardless of its reputation. So, in a TL;DR summary, here is what I found in doing so-\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n-\tGorgeous animation\\n\r\n-\tSolid soundtrack\\n\r\n-\tMakes you really appreciate the good stuff out there\\n\r\nMIXED:\\n\r\n-\tComedy is hit-or-miss\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-\tBoring, repetitive, and stagnant premise\\n\r\n-\tPredictability is through the roof\\n\r\n-\tFails at being a parody because of its hit-or-miss comedy and lack of satirical commentary on what its supposed to be a parody of\\n\r\n-\tNot enough comedy altogether \\n\r\n-\tOne note side characters, one note villains, one note protagonist. \\n\r\n-\tTitle gives everything away\\n\\n\r\n3/10. As of yet, One Punch Man has plenty of time to redeem itself. A second season with a little more improvement on its intention and it could be something really great.\\n\\n\r\nBut for now, I recommend watching the door. At least that actually took some ingenuity.",

            "content": "Ever since I started reading the One Punch Man manga by Murata back in 2013, I couldn't wait until the day OPM actually got an anime adaption. When I heard Madhouse was picking up the project, my excitement grew ever so vastly. Now, after finally completing the anime, I can say without doubt, that I'm glad the adaption was done by Madhouse and no other. \r\nOne Punch Man tells a story of Saitama, an average man living an average life, with a... not-so-average hobby: being a superhero. There's something that sets this man apart from other heroes though. You guessed it: he tends to defeatall enemies that come before him in a single punch. The humor in One Punch Man is definitely repetitive. That's not to say there aren't other forms of comedy within the series. What makes this series so enjoyable if the main character just defeats every enemy with ease? It's the characters' thoughts, motives, interactions, reactions, and so much more. \\n\\n\r\nOne joke that is constantly reused in the series, is of course, Saitama defeating his enemies in one punch. If running gags aren't your cup of tea, then it's possible you won't enjoy the series. In the end, comedy is still a hit or miss.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also doesn't completely uphold an entire slice of life & comedy routine as earlier episodes may suggest. There is, believe it or not, an actual storyline. The series takes off in a setting which generally consists of full-time comedy, but it slowly takes a turn towards a slightly more serious plot, without dropping all aspects of its previous perks. There is another controversial issue I will address. The entire series is not a parody. Parts of it are, sure. However, it should be noted that the there are serious tones that include plenty of comedy, in a not so parodic attitude. The series never intends to drop its comedy; it's faithful to that fact, and that's appreciative. \\n\\n\r\nEach character has their perks. From hero to villain to your ordinary citizen, each one contributes to the series' success, be it comedy relief, sympathy, contempt, devotion, or ambition. An entertaining comedy, from my perspective, should always include entertaining characters, ones you can relate to, or feel very passionate about. One Punch Man never lacks this. The diverse plethora of characters allow many different types of viewers to enjoy this series. \\n\\n\r\nI mentioned how the character interaction is a strong selling point, and that's largely due to how well the seiyuus (voice actors) perform. Each and every seiyuu also fit their character roles astoundingly well. In addition to that, Madhouse stays faithful to both ONE and Murata (artists of the original webcomic and manga, respectively) in terms of art, adapting the source material in a fashion where all comedic value of a specific scene is retained, matching, perhaps even trumping, the source material.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are both top notch. Anyone saying otherwise is kidding themselves. Madhouse consistently releases quality animation with few exceptions in OPM. At times you may notice the art in the animation alters during several fight scenes. While this art style may be unappealing to some audiences, it does not mean the fluidity and flow of the animation drop in any way. That being said, I did also mention there were exceptions; One Punch Man's animation is not without flaws. In some scenes (more so the less important, minor scenes), it's quite obvious the animation quality is just not on par. However, this is highly negligible when you realize why some of the time and budget had to be cut for those scenes: to fuel the intensity and quality of the more iconic, influential, and critical moments, fights, and episodes. \\n\\n\r\nFor manga readers, there may be scenes and frames in which the anime looks rather poor in comparison to the manga. I, myself, am guilty of being slightly affected by this, but one must understand that animation frames cannot always consistently uphold the quality that is displayed in manga, more notably when the artist is Yusuke Murata, and especially when the budget of One Punch Man is claimed to be average by the animators to begin with, where they've gone above and beyond to perfect the adaption of One Punch Man as much as possible. And as previously mentioned, it's evident that a lot of the worktime is shifted towards the more impactful scenes, so the overall quality remains refined. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to choose one thing Madhouse produced without flaw, it would be the soundtrack. From the opening intro, to the BGM during fight scenes, to the ending song, every bit of it, flawless. How well the music is incorporated into the series drives the anime by a longshot. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 11\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\r\nWas ecstatic from start to finish - fully enjoyed watching this series. Well, minus some scenes in which I had too high expectations for, but that's negligible as many of my expectations are unreasonable. It's disheartening to see the series come to an end, but I will pray for second season, and put my faith in Madhouse and Murata. \\n\\n\r\nIf you really enjoyed watching this anime, I highly recommend reading the manga (maybe even the webcomic if the manga does not quench your thirst), even starting at the beginning, since Yusuke Murata's art really makes the franchise shine.",

            "content": "One Punch Man is a comedy/parody shounen anime. Unfortunately it fails as a parody and it fails as a shounen.\r\nThe Comedy:\r\nSaitama, the main protagonist, is really really strong, but he's also bored. He is so strong that he doesn't even get excited while fighting really strong opponents. That's the main joke of the anime, and if you don't like it, well, too bad, because it will be shoved down your throat every single episode. There's nothing much else to talk about him, it's basically all his personality. \r\nOutside of Saitama the humor is pretty much hit or miss. It's funny, because this is supposed tobe a parody anime, but even then it takes itself wayyyy too seriously. Expect the typical epic/dramatic ost playing often, innocent people suffering and in danger,  melodramatic speechs about justice, etc etc. After thorwing all that at you the main character, bored as always, will easily defeat the dangerous villain. OPM lives in a weird limbo between typical shounen and parody, it would probably be better if it decided what it wants to be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Plot:\\n\r\nThe anime is pretty much plotless. A random generic villain  will appear, cause some ruckus, and be defetead by the bored bald protagonist every time. At some point a hero association appears, what about it? It serves to introduce new characters, and that's it. The association does nothing the whole anime, as far as the anime goes there's no conspiracy behind it or anything. The main character wants to go up in the association, but of course that doesn't matter one bit, it only serves to provide some more \"hilarious\" jokes about how the main character is so strong and yet he is misunderstood by everybody. \\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing to keep you hooked and wanting more, wondering what will happen next. If, god forbid, a second season is made I pretty expect to be exactly the same thing as season 1: main protagonist is bored jokes and generic villains appearing, with pretty much nothing else. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNothing much to talk about really. One or two tracks are good I guess, the rest is average. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nThe art is bland and forgetble. The animation is good and fluid, but to be honest the fights itselves are not that good. Everything is so fast, it's difficult to see things clearly sometimes. Although this anime really is above average in this category, it seems like a child throwing a tauntrum to get your attention: there is very little variety in the fights (every character pretty much fights like a DBZ character), it is all completely predictable, but hey, it looks cool, and the camera spins really fast, and there is epic music, so it is good, right???\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nVeridict:\\n\r\nOPM is all flash and no substance. It should mantain your attention for at least these 12 episodes, but that's it. It's just one more of those anime who pander the lowest common denominator. If you are expecting something truly interesting, fun or exciting you can forget it. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"I am here to attend the supermarket sale and have fun....and I'm all out of coupons\"\r\nTo be honest with you, I've been bored with anime for quite a while now.  Sure, I've been watching some anime but it's mostly restricted to anime that have already finished or are over 10 years old. \r\nSo, naturally, when I heard about One Punch Man, I brushed it off as more of the same old sh*t that's been airing for the past five years. How wrong I was....\r\nNow, after waiting patiently for over 81 days, I have come to put an end to all the ridiculous criticism thatOne Punch Man has received.\\n\r\nI, Pompous Phoenix, saviour of the universe and protector of mankind, will you use my considerable powers to  vanquish all you false pretenders.\\n\\n\r\n\"\"DADDY!! Is it a bird? Is it a plane? IT'S SUPERM-well, unfortunately, it's just a BIRD but it is a bird who will RISE FROM THE ASHES and promises to OBLITERATE ALL OPPOSITION with his EGOTISTICAL VIEWS and as much GRANDIOSE as he can muster\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nWe as a community tend to immediately gang up on the most popular anime at the time, I'm looking at you SAO. As you can guess, it's open season for OPM.\\n\r\nUnlike most animes these days, with their overly ambitious stories and pretentious settings, what we have here is a show that doesn't take itself  TOO SERIOUSLY or TOO FLIPPANTLY. T\u0336h\u0336a\u0336t\u0336 \u0336d\u0336o\u0336e\u0336s\u0336n\u0336'\u0336t\u0336 \u0336m\u0336a\u0336k\u0336e\u0336 \u0336a\u0336n\u0336y\u0336 \u0336s\u0336e\u0336n\u0336s\u0336e\u0336,\u0336 \u0336y\u0336o\u0336u\u0336 \u0336d\u0336i\u0336p\u0336s\u0336h\u0336  What do I mean by this? Although, it's ranked the 11th greatest anime and already has 192,406 members on MAL, it only came into existence as a hobby for upcoming manga artist, ONE. Yes, the anime with an average score of 9.02, was only made because ONE was BORED. You'd think that this would mean an eventual drop in quality or failure to even kick-start the series, right?\\n\\n\r\nIn short, no. It is this boredom that leads into ONE's creative and innovative ideas. What's a genre that suits ONE perfectly and hasn't been explored enough? SUPERHEROES. Combine this with comedy, and you have a brand new genre in itself. This show is primarily focused on being a parody of the superhero genre as a whole. This is where the show really thrives with pretty much every superhero clich\u00e9 you've ever heard of packed neatly into 12 episodes. From the overpowered as f*ck main character to the diabolically evil as f*ck simply because they are ugly as f*ck. One Punch Man takes all these clever jokes and uses them to their full potential and somehow manages to never falter in it's quality or it's quantity. \\n\\n\r\nI see a lot of reviews for this anime saying,\"You shouldn't take this seriously or it's only a COMEDY\". While I'm in inclined to agree with the later and will rephrase in case you weren't listening, IT'S JUST A F*CKING COMEDY YOU NEON GENESIS SADISTS. In the case of \"being serious enough\", OPM has this near perfection. Typical comedy based animes will often have a moment where it trades it's usual light hearted comedy for a moment of \"seriousness\". OPM only has a few moments of \"seriousness\" but because there are so little of them it only makes them more MEMORABLE and IMPACTFUL. They will often deal with topics like morality, media, defining a hero etc.\\n\r\nEat your heart out Clannad, I can have deep meaningful moments and still be pissing myself with laughter 5 minutes later.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe main hero of the story is Saitama, who is every lead shonen character's wet dream. Saitama is the incarnation of BOREDOM and it is less about how funny he IS but how funny he REACTS.The point of his character is that he has ALREADY \"become the strongest in the world\", which is then used as the overrunning gag throughout the show. This is quite a fresh idea that would pique the interest of most people. Although, this idea can only remain funny for so long the same way any joke will become tiring after a while.\\n\\n\r\nThis is only saved thanks to a certain blond haired cyborg by the name of Genos. While Saitama is the incarnation of BOREDOM, Genos is the incarnation of SERIOUSNESS. He is the Naruto/Luffy/Ichigo of the story, the one who is obsessed with becoming stronger, except as more of a dead serious, humourless sidekick. People like to believe that Saitama being so incredibly overpowered ironically ruins the show but this is not the case. While we can't relate to Saitama's ridiculous strength, we can relate to Genos constant struggle for power. While we can't relate to Genos' dashing good looks (well, you can't), we can relate to Saitama's plain and average looks.\\n\\n\r\n*I have to give high praise to both Furukawa and Ishikawa for their respective performances as Saitama and Genos which was nothing short of AWESOME*\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting characters, it would be best described as if you were visiting your favourite restaurant. With so many different types and variations to select from these characters are all excellently made. We've got Silverfang, who is the equivalent of Dumbledore on steriods, Sonic, who is Saitama's never ending rival and is definitely not a hedgehog, Tatsumaki, who is an annoying little sh*t, and a load more of strong and weak, cool and weird, smart and stupid characters that you will encounter throughout the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nDO YOU WANT TO SEE M0THERF*CKING  LASERS?!

You add it's incredible animation by Madhouse with this soundtrack, and you've got Gold. \\n\r\nEven the sound in this show is INSANE, just take a look at the fight between Saitama and Genos. I'd highly recommend giving OPM's OST a listen to as it's well worth your time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nLet's get something clear. I'm not giving OPM a 10 because it's perfect. ALL SHOWS HAVE FAULTS. I'm giving it a 10 because it reached it's full potential but still managed to keep it's humour, action, characters in check throughout these incredible 12 episodes. A satisfying conclusion with no silly cliffhangers or overarching plot points.\\n\\n\r\n* BREAKING NEWS!! We have just received news about the possibility of a second season and I can officially tell you.....how the f*ck am I supposed to know?! It can go either way with MadHouse really, but I nevertheless remain optimistic* I can however, leave with this inspirational quote from the Caped Baldy himself that only the true OPM fans will appreciate.......\\n\\n\r\n\"Ok\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "'One Punch Man' is a caricature of 'Superman' on steroids. It's an anime that has stapled itself as a parody that you're not supposed to take seriously at times, while also having supposed more serious aspects later down the line, as every OPM fan has told me prior to my viewing of it. Like Superman, it features the main character, Saitama, defeating opponents with no trouble at all, with the marketable 2015 gimmick of them being 'one punched'. If you minus the laser and X-Ray vision, Saitama is literally Superman of Japan. So you may be wondering to yourself, \"This sounds great! Why such alow score?\"\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is the definition of an over-hyped phenomenon. Yes, this has been said by many people for the past 3 years and I'm 'unoriginal', but there's practically no other way to describe it.\\n\\n\r\nI consider Superman to be one of the worst superheroes in comics. Well, maybe not as bad as Doorman, but he's still a bullshit superhero. Why? It's simple; he's boring, predictable, too powerful, and has a dull weakness. And unfortunately, Saitama shares the same fate as Superman. Except, he's more powerful than Superman, since he has no weakness. You could also rename this anime to 'One Joke Man', because all it truly is is one big joke that simply wasn't for me in the end. Any sort of build-up, tension, and actual serious moments in the show from other characters' engagements with the villains are ruined by Saitama's presence. And when Saitama does encounter a villain, the outcome is always the same: Saitama defeats the villain in less than 5 minutes all the time. It's a shame too, because the villains of One Punch Man did look to have potential. \"But this is supposed to be the parody aspect of One Punch Man dude!\" They could've handled the satire ridiculing other powerful protagonist shows much better than the boring narrative that was One Punch Man.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the length of One Punch Man, newly introduced characters only have a minuscule amount of screen-time or any sort of development, when clearly, you ARE supposed to care for these characters. The top 13 heroes of the league have no depth at all except for Genos, Saitama's sidekick and a character who'd I actually consider good in the show.  Unfortunately, like the villains, his time is stolen from the \"LOL, so funny!\" moments of Saitama defeating every threat he faces. Genos recognizes Saitama's strength when they first meet and wants to become stronger. Stronger he will never become, but at least to be recognized by Saitama as a worthy sidekick. Another character, Sonic (the hedgehog) was also an interesting villain to follow, but, yes, like everyone else, Saitama steals the show. Same with Mumen Rider, Boros, and probably every other character. Am I starting to sound like a broken record? My bad, but if you got through One Punch Man, I'm sure you're used to repetitiveness by now.\\n\\n\r\nI can only think of two moments in One Punch Man that made me chuckle. But other than that, the 'comedy' aspect of the show falls flat on its face most of the time. And like mentioned above, One Punch Man is on rinse and repeat for each episode, providing nothing new or interesting that changes the outcome of the show or adds further development for the cast. A point that most people don't seem to mention is the logic in how Saitama became the most powerful being on the planet. Going back to Superman, there's logic as to why he's powerful; he's a Kryptonian, an alien from another world that gets his power from the Sun. Batman, another superhero that's superior to Superman in all aspects, has logic as well; he has no real super powers. It's all his gadgets, combat skills, and sweet toys that make him a REAL superhero to humanity, since he's an ordinary human himself. Saitama gets his powers by doing an ordinary training routine taken to the maximum, near impossible levels of an ordinary human to achieve. That's even more bullshit than most shounen protagonists and them achieving their powers in such a short time! \\n\\n\r\nThe only aspects of One Punch Man that really stunned me was the artwork and animation. For the majority of scenes, the art aspect was phenomenal. Designs were sharp, not expressionless or lackluster, and character models had good choreography and designs. Music and sounds were average for the most part, the only memorable track being the opening theme, but most soundtracks for suspenseful and villain encounter moments were good. Nothing to complain about for those elements, maybe the only thing being the soundtracks at times being inconsistent or not used properly for some moments of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, One Punch Man was only 12 episodes long. So the length of it was bearable and watchable because of the fantastic animation and artwork, but I would've most likely ended up dropping it if it was any longer or the standard length of a shounen anime. It had potential too, and I won't admit in saying that the first and second episodes really intrigued my interests. Then after the third, fourth, fifth, sixth... yeah. It got boring, super repetitive, and predictable very fast. The parody aspect of One Punch Man failed because of this unfortunately. If what I said throughout this review sounded decent and interesting as a parody series that doesn't take itself seriously with the logic of the world and characters, while having a Superman-like protagonist with no weakness one punching every encounter he faces, then I think you'd enjoy this a lot. For the rest of you that see this and don't like how the show's repetitive nature plays out, I wouldn't suggest this.\\n\\n\r\nHere's me hoping for a better outtake on the series for season 2, but I won't be getting my hopes up.",

            "content": "Goddamn, last season was heavy on the shonen/superhero stuff, wasn't it? Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya. Ushio and Tora. Noragami Aragoto. And of course, the most popular one of them all, One Punch Man. It's going to be difficult to find something new to say about each of them, but lord knows I'm going to try my damndest to do so. Might as well start with the one that got everyone's attention, even if not for all the right reasons. I mean it's a giant understatement to say that I wasn't the only one who watched One Punch Man, but it's also abig understatement to say that I wasn't the only one who wasn't impressed with the thing.\\n\\n\r\nIt's even worse in my case, because I don't get shonen action as substance at all. I don't hate it, and there was a time when I enjoyed pretty much everything that came out of Shonen Jump's mouth the same way I enjoyed Marvel v. Capcom, but you'd think the genre would grow up along with the audience and focus more on substance rather than repeat the same outdated Dragonball Z-style over and over again because holy hell did we not get sick of that ten years ago. But with the explosive popularity of One Punch Man along with David Production continuing to make more bloody adaptations of Jojo, I think it's pretty clear that that isn't going to happen anytime soon. So who cares if the plot is weak? Who cares if the satire goes for all the easy shots? Who cares if the characters don't have any real struggles or flaws or story or anything going for them besides how they look and a stupid name? It's a popcorn anime, and it's very good at what it does.\\n\\n\r\nExcept even by the standards of popcorn anime, I'm not sure it does. I mean you have the director of Space Dandy and the production values from Madhouse on this project, so obviously you're going to get a great-looking show. With that said, why is the action so fucking bad? Every time it showed up, the camera would spin around or zoom far-out whilst characters threw massive explosions at each other or delivered a punch in a desperate attempt to make it look cool when in reality, it looks overblown and retarded. There is absolutely no choreography being applied to any of the action and it becomes really boring to watch as a result. And even if there was, it is an absolute cakewalk to determine who's going to win the fight before it even starts because the whole show is built around Saitama saving the day in his own dry way with nobody in the entire universe being close to his level in terms of fighting prowess. Add in the fact that nobody really dies in this show anyways but the one-off characters who have less charisma than a Marvel villain and there's a limit to how much tension One Punch Man is allowed to have in regards to its fight scenes (i.e. zero).\\n\\n\r\nNot helping is the fact that Saitama is an incredibly boring character who has no depth to him besides one joke: he's a normal dude who became the strongest in the world by training really hard and is bored with his life as a result. Every other hero in this show became powerful through genetics or body modification, and as such don't believe Saitama when he says that he just worked hard, nor do they trust him because thanks to his lack of brains, he's lowly ranked in the Hero Association. This could have made for some interesting conflict, but One Punch Man never really treats Saitama's invincibility as anymore than a cheap joke or a deus ex machina trying to be a cheap joke, no thanks to the other heroes having zero chemistry with the dude and making DC's good guys look like Marvel's. Aside from a cyborg whose only real purpose in life is to lose so that Saitama can have someone to save, I can't recall a single time he's ever had a real conversation with anybody. Hell, I'm pretty sure Genos has had more overall screen time than him.\\n\\n\r\nAnd don't even get me started on the villains in this thing, who make Marvel's bad guys look like DC's. I can't even remember anyone's name, let alone what they added to anything. There was some attempt at making the final bad guy an \"invincible contrast\" to Saitama, but it was so poorly handled it made the relationship between Spiderman and Green Goblin look like Batman and The Joker - and I still didn't bother to remember the dude's name afterwards. Word of advice to anyone creating a bad guy: Marvel's villains are absolutely awful! Nothing but a bunch of random animal or element gimmicks applied to some misguided fool trying to overcompensate for the fact that Mad Hatter has them beat in the character department. But you know what's worse than that? Actual animal or element gimmicks fully realized in physical form, without even an attempt to make them realized as actual characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll of which could have been forgiven if the show was funny, as One Punch Man is supposed to be a comedic satire on the shonen action/superhero genre. Thing is, the show only has one joke (Saitama being Saitama) and said joke never made me laugh. Not once. Which would already have been a giant problem by itself, but the fact that the satire sucks too does it no favors. And not just because it goes for all the easy shots, but said shots are even misaimed a few times. There's one moment in the show where Saitama makes himself out to be the bad guy in order to save face for the other heroes due to some random jackass who apparently never appreciates anything in his life, but it falls incredibly flat because it's incredibly obvious it was done so that the show can repeat its one joke. Not one single person was buying the jackass's bullshit, so there was no reason for Saitama to do that, especially since it's never brought up again afterwards. It's an extreme, but by no means the only part of the show where it's clear the writers have no ambition for this show beyond taking cheap potshots at a genre that has been satirized so well in the past.\\n\\n\r\nLet me make it clear that One Punch Man is by no stretch of the word \"bad\". It knows what it wants to be and does it well, even if it wants to be is nothing higher than mediocre at best. Because if we're judging it in comparison to the rest of the shonen/superhero anime that aired in Fall, One Punch Man is the worst of the shonen action anime that I have seen. Good visuals can only take you so far, and whilst I commend Madhouse for keeping the quality high for most of its run, thirteen episodes is a long time to watch something that has little to no substance. Hell, the specials don't have anything noteworthy about them visual-wise, leaving you with nothing at all.\\n\\n\r\nMy advice to you guys? Watch Concrete Revolutio instead. And no, I'm not going to stop sucking Concrete Revolutio's dick until more people admit they were wrong to abandon it for the much weaker Sunday superhero show.",

            "content": "With One-Punch Man finished airing, there is one thing anyone can agree on, and that is how split the community is about the show: there are people who absolutely love it, considering it the pinnacle of their experience, and others that consider it to be very bland and boring, with terrible humour. Now the question is whether these opinions on the show are justified or not, and naturally it is, on both sides. Is One-Punch Man overrated? Yes, it is. But is it mediocre, bad? No, in my opinion it is not, it's an enjoyable anime with fantastic animation and action.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe premise of One-Punch Manis simple, Saitama being a superhero so overpowered, that he is capable of defeating any type of villain in one single punch. Bored with the fights, he trudges through life indifferent to any major problems regarding his environment, such as monsters attacking the city, concerned mainly with the household such as his shopping list or vandalism. This doesn't mean that there is any lack of action at all; in fact it is one of its main focus, which is fun to watch. This leads to another problem: the fights are tensionless on its own, as it is very predictable what the outcome will be, which is partially adressed with comedic elements. The good thing is that the anime is self-aware of its stupidity,being quite unpredictable at times, which makes it in turn an enjoyable watch.\\n\\n\r\nOther focal point of the anime is the humor, as One-Punch Man makes a parody of the superheroes, which enhances the anime to keep the story fresh and enjoyable. Someone who dislikes superheroes might also dislike this show. These jokes are often mingled with Saitama's indifference, as well as the characters personalities. However, the humor seems to be the major issue with the audience. Yet I must mention that the humor gets old, and is not as well relayed  to the viewers as it was in the manga. In fact, at times it can be rather lackluster. Nevertheless, the action scenes made up for it. Other thing to consider is the amount of destruction made by the superheroes, which could be seen as something hilarious, meaning they're quite useless when trying to preserve property and life.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also certain evolution of the story present; from focusing upon making a parody of defeating its foes in one hit, it makes a transition to have some sort of story attached to it, introducing challenges and ranks amongst the superheroes, invasion of super villains, you name it. This defeats somewhat the main purpose of the anime, as now it's basically a plotless, action heavy show. Some may also point out that the episodes seem stretched out longer than necessary. Nevertheless, audiences observe social critique as well in the anime, which could be compared with how society views celebrities. Superheroes represent these, people excepting them to be perfect, which is naturally not the case. The egoistic nature of humans are shown as well, in addition to blaming people for their own ailments, even though these tried to help out. People are prone to blame others for their own misdoings or doesn't go flawlessly.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in One-Punch Man are varied, yet very one-dimensional and stereotypical, which fits with the narrative and overall story that it is trying to convey. Saitama being an indifferent character to anything concerning him; then there is Genos, a cyborg with a straightforward personality who is Saitama's disciple. Naturally little to no character development takes place. The superheroes themselves are often of selfish nature, whose only objective is fame.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters are diverse, both for the superheroes and villains: ninjas, cyborgs, aliens, martial artists, mad scientists and monsters are on the order of the day. The reasons behind villains actions are of course very bland and uninteresting, as it follows the stereotypes. Nonetheless, it must be mentioned that some of the comedic elements are greatly enhanced by these and their personalities, in addition to being somewhat interesting in some regards.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of One-Punch Man is certainly top-notch, action scenes drawn fantastically and very fluid and diverse, what is to be expected of a Madhouse produced anime. There are some scenes in which some movements are bended a bit too much to my liking. The art style of the anime if appealing, yet nothing really out of the norm. Character designs for villains and superheroes are nevertheless diverse and very detailed, further enhancing the overall animation. In addition, backgrounds are well displayed as well. The animators managed to portray impressively the strengths of the superheroes with the diverse animations and camera angles.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack used in One-Punch Man matched well with it, yet is nothing outstanding on its own. Voice actors performed their role well, in addition to matching with the personality of each character. The opening was quite an interesting watch, in addition to have a fitting music to it.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nOverall One-Punch Man was an enjoyable experience, yet experienced shortcomings storywise as well as in the comedy department. Nevertheless, the well executed action scenes alongside the top-notch animation quality, certainly makes it worth a watch on its own, yet is not suited for anyone who is in pursuit of a well crafted story alongside with good and diverse humour, as it can be a hit-and-miss for some.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.\\n",

However, the execution of this series is very poor.\r\nStory - There is little to no discernible story line it seems, and whatever is there is needless drawn out and fraught with cliche, that more or less parody shouen story-lines, but without providing any actual comedy. Basically turning into a shitty version of what they are trying to make fun of.\r\nArt/Sound - Only redeeming element of this anime, the art style is fantastic and it comes with a very good audio quality, thevoice acting is about average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Characters in this series tend to come off as extremely bland, and boring. This is quite a shame since the design and back story's of these characters are very interesting. This combined with decent voice acting should provide a decent set of characters. However, it doesn't this time, and it is very disappointing  \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion - This is a very disappointing series, fantastic art and sound combine with an awful story and lackluster characters make this series just disheartening and one of the most boring anime I have ever seen  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Every year there is at least one particular show that receives massive coverage for whatever reason.In 2015, without a question was One Punch Man's year in the spotlight and for good reason; the initial premise of One Punch seemed to be a goldmine, for it was thought to be a clever,satiristic view of the shonen and action anime that has been dominate since the last decade. \r\nSo then, with roses thrown before the curtain is raised, does One Punch Man live up to its potential ? Without even a sigh, no would be the answer. \r\nThe biggest flaws that Opm suffers from are the counterproductive characterizations, and repetitive wall paint humor gags. \\n\r\nThe show's content is mainly derived from Saitama and Genos fighting new villains each episodes which is axiomatically plain itself , so the show has to induce humor to make things interesting but fails to do so because the show keeps using the same joke over and over again . Speaking of Saitama and Genos, Saitama is arguably the weaker of the two because his apathetic nature makes him too static for the audience to actually care about him;Thankfully, Genos proves to be a better character because of the mystery and passion floating in his background;However, and ironically so, the most enjoyable character was one of the other heroes, Tornado; her Asuka-esque attitude and powers made her a much more attractive personality, yet we never got much from her. The action that does take place is rather vivid in fluid , thus, making the show enjoyable in that respect; the animation is nice polished as well. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, One Punch Man fails to do many things right but not in the extreme sense.While, It is shame that it could fulfill its potential at least it's watchable and could be considered entertaining if nothing else is on.",

            "content": "One Punch Man was a fairly popular anime from the tail end of last year. It was based off of a webcomic by One, which has also been adapted into a manga. The anime came from Madhouse, which could be good or bad and there's no real way to ascertain which it is just because it has a lot of fans. After all, some of the worst anime I've seen have had pretty substantive fan bases. Then again, just last week I reviewed Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex: 2nd Gig, which was both popular and really good. So, let's take a look andI'll see if it lives up to the hype.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nSaitama is a hero for fun. When major trouble threatens people, he shows up and dispatches the threat with a single punch. There's just one problem, he's so strong that it's all become rather boring for him. The series follows Saitama as he faces various menaces, the most threatening of which is his own melancholy.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the biggest flaw with the comedy of the series is that it gets repetitive pretty quickly. Most of it follows the same pattern. A menace shows up, gets built up as a grave and pressing threat, fighting against and beating other heroes, Saitama shows up and one shots it. In between fights we get some other jokes, a lot of which are about Saitama being bored and disinterested with what he's doing. Then we have a character who exists entirely as an unfunny gay stereotype, Puripuri Prisoner. Thankfully, he's a minor character and only shows up in a few episodes but his scenes can be pretty cringe-worthy.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the main repeated joke of the series can be funny a few times and there are some pretty amusing scenes betwixt the action sequences. Some of which are actually quite clever in the ways they tackle shounen action series tropes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters in One Punch Man are pretty stock action tropes with a comedic twist. They aren't particularly complex but most of them are perfectly good for a parody work. I actually do quite like the contrasting dynamic with Saitama's more jaded and frivolous outlook with Genos' more youthful and serious outlook. The best moments in the series come from these two playing off of one another. There are other characters with potential but, due to the short length of the series, a lot of them end up getting used for a single joke and don't really get any interactions or dynamics to play off of their potential.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation are both really good in this series. The action sequences, at least before Saitama shows up, can be really interesting to see, even though you know how they're going to end. There are also some really nice and detailed villain designs in this. The one major flaw is that the action scenes get boring and repetitive when Saitama is involved. They either end really quickly or he lets the villain knock him around for a bit without any concern before ending it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is okay. There are some strong actors in this and they give perfectly passable performances. They're just not particularly good or memorable. The music is pretty standard. It's not bad nor is it good. It's just functional.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nAside from our stereotype running around and frightening guys he finds attractive, there isn't any. So, this is a series that would be better with less ho-yay.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes right down to it, whether or not One Punch Man is going to work for you really depends on whether or not you're the type of person who can keep laughing at the same joke, even when you know it's coming. If you can see slightly different versions of the same joke and keep laughing, this one may have the punch for your funny bone. If, on the other hand, you're a person who needs humour to be surprising in order to get a laugh out of it, you should definitely skip it. If you're like me and you can gain amusement from the same joke under certain circumstances but you need time between the versions, I would recommend seeing it, but giving it around ten days between episodes so that it doesn't get overly repetitive for you. In the end, in spite of its short comings, it's a decent parody series. I give it a 6/10. Next week, I'm looking at Ginga Ojousama Densetsu Yuna: Shin'en no Fairy.",

            "content": "Jesus christ, calm the fuck down. It's a pretty good anime. It is neither the greatest nor the worst thing to ever be produced, contrary to how most people seem to be treating it.\r\nIt's a shame that such a disclaimer is necessary, but there really only seem to be two kinds of people when it comes to One Punch Man - those who consider it a cancer on the anime industry, and those who worship it as though it were the second coming. And while, in all honesty, this would probably not be as hyped as it is if it weren't the only thing comingout at the time worth being hyped over, it's a lot closer to the latter than the former.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there was always going to be a divide with this show, because it's a comedy series that doesn't really have many jokes in it. Much of the humour of One Punch Man is achieved through tone and through juxtaposition, and that's not something that works for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best methods of humour comes from the unexpected - juxtaposition between what you'd expect to happen, and what does. One Punch Man uses this to great effect, by building up a fictional universe in which everything takes itself completely seriously with the same dramatic stakes that would apply to any battle shonen anime, totally unaware that absolutely everything they believe to be true, and which they take so seriously, is completely and utterly meaningless, because Saitama makes the entire setting redundant. It's a hilarious farce that forms the core of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, Saitama is the perfect protagonist for a show like this. His inability to read the mood, lack of concern for any of the extremely threatening Eldritch Horrors that attack him, and his nonchalance towards... well, everything, make a great setup for the contrast of tone between over-the-top badassery and comedy that this show runs on.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of what makes this show work is that it's actually pretty good as the action series it's making fun of. While it is impossible to take seriously, it's still hard to not be impressed by how well-drected and inventive the fight scenes are. The animators have really outdone themselves here - in particular, the way they show off some of Saitama's most ridiculously overpowered attacks are impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside, however, is that sometimes the show takes itself too seriously - in particular, during the mid-to-late episodes. While the balance between action and comedy is usually well maintained, it suffers when it skews more towards action. Also, OPM is often accused of being repetitive, and this isn't entirely unfounded - again, the show doesn't really rely on jokes for its humour, and instead goes for tone-based humour, so this is not as much of a problem as it would be for a show that was specifically focused on gags. But it repeatedly uses anticlimaxes as the source of its humour, and while there is plenty of variation in the execution of them, it can still feel like the same thing over and over, and this may be a dealbreaker for some people.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, though, One Punch Man delivers a unique brand of comedy, and is extremely well-presented. Even at its worst point, it's an average action series, and it's best, it's a fantastic farcical comedy.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: Not actually the greatest thing ever made. Still well worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 10/10\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nActing: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Samurai Flamenco, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann",

            "content": "\u201cSaitama\u201d, I guess that name often heard by all of the anime fans out there including me this lately. Well, that makes sense because this anime One Punch Man that adapted from a manga remake by Yusuke Murata and originally written by ONE has caught a large attention through it series. As most people knew, there\u2019s pro and contra that shows up among anime fans out there about this show and because of that, I feel that I have to watch this no matter what. And now I finally did it so I\u2019m gonna present this review of me for this anime. For more 20minutes in each episode, you will find an extraordinary action and superhero stuff with a little bit parody that makes you stay and watch this anime till your jaw drops. Well, if anyone ask me how good it could be, then I can tell you that this anime is worth to watch especially to all of you who like an enjoyable anime filled with the surprising act.\\n\\n\r\n(SPOILER ALERT)\\n\\n\r\n(*) Story\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an incredibly powerful hero lives in the city, so powerful till he can easily defeat his enemies with a single punch. Well, most people will probably think, \u201cthat is sooo boring!\u201d. But, don\u2019t you ever think like that, my friend! Why? Let me tell you about it. There\u2019s some beneficial things that the story section have in this anime (besides the character section). First, the story itself. I mean, the main story is so simple like I bet that many people from around the world have probably thought the same main idea just like this anime have. So simple till no one will ever tire to watch this anime from the very beginning till the end. The title suits the story, and that wasn\u2019t made to overwhelm the power that the main character have but to making it more unique than the other anime that already exist out there. Second, the action setting. The story takes place in Japanese metropolis city which is great. Because that is a number one story background in a suggestion that will get epic when there\u2019s some unstoppable character with massive power like heroes count in it. The violence, the destruction and the instant of falling objects that will make the audience\u2019s jaw drops over and over again when they watch it. The actions itself are superb too. Believe me, even though this is a superhero anime, doesn\u2019t mean that it's saved for children to watch it. I mean, you\u2019ll find a lot of blood splashing too in it. This make sense because the seinen demographic that the manga remake have. And the last but not least benefit of the story is the parody. Actually, \u201cparody\u201d is one of the genre that hard to adapt for several reasons but the writer making it so natural and easy to received. You\u2019ll meet many characters which you found familiar from other anime characters that show up in this anime. I guess the writer just want to represent all of the heroes anime in his creation and making it resemble with each of character in the story. But, again.. that\u2019s a very wonderful idea cause it makes the audience not bored when some familiar yet remindful character pops up and makes a little comedy in it. The writer has changed this genre from hard to playful yet fun genre to watch. But, despite all above, the story itself still have some problem. For an example like the conflict of the story, the \u201cexistence\u201d of it nearly gone. Probably because the main story (the super power stuff) consumed all of the episode and changes it to a next over-power level to shows up. It\u2019s surely great, but.. I believe \u201cconflict\u201d is the section that has to exist in any stories. Luckily, the main character in the story brings himself to self-conflict in several episodes that explain who he really is. Like disrespectful that he received from others and he solved it just by several words. For the ending, it\u2019s still an uncertain ending. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of problems that they still need to solve or explain, like who Metal Knight really is, the past of Genos, the intention of Amai Mask, and many other problems. But besides that, the story still fun to watch. You will like the writer\u2019s creativity for add the main character\u2019s adventure with many various characters or like the association that made up and the surprising events that show up. I can say it filled with so much action and mind-blowing effect.   \\n\\n\r\n(*) Art\\n\r\nThe art was very good. It surely fits the story. You can feel the sensation of every move like you watch a real superhero. I bet the creators put all of their hard work in this section. And believe me, making an action anime with the unusual move or fighting-battle like that is not just as simple as you flip your hand. But, they have succeeded to bring an action to all of the episode which extremely stunning. Well, the creator did save energy to draw the main character, Saitama which I found simple to draw him just like an egg (no hurt feelings, it\u2019s true) for several condition in the story but has managed to change his appearance to a serious one when he\u2019s in an epic battle. But, that was good because with his unique appearance like that, he becomes the most memorable character and he \u201cis\u201d the main character after all. And don\u2019t tell me about the animation, it\u2019s really remarkable! Until now, I still remember the scene when Genos forced Saitama to train with him seriously, the art in that scene was sooo amazing and for the favorite was the final battle scene\u2026. Believe me, it was more than \u201camazing\u201d. No protest in this section.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Sound\\n\r\nOkay, about the opening and ending\u2026. hmm, well\u2026. actually, those two are not really my favorite type of song but as long as they fit the story I guess that\u2019s fair enough. I mean the opening was really \u201csuperheroic\u201d, both the instrument and the lyrics. They have succeeded to symbolize One Punch Man to a song originally. And about the back sound was really epic! I really appreciate Makoto Miyazaki for his work on the music because it has nailed it to serves the audience like they watch a real superhero film. It just fits in with the classical music playing on and made a great symphony to rising the atmosphere of every scene. For the voice actor, Saitama\u2019s role was voiced by Makoto Furukawa. He has made it describe Saitama\u2019s personality like how passive he was sometimes or when he turns into serious-mode, his voice changed dramatically. And the other main character, Genos was voiced by Kaito Ishikawa. I think he has succeeded too. He made it to serves the audience about Genos\u2019s personality who always curious about the secret power of Saitama even though he is a cyborg. And don\u2019t forget about other\u2019s voice actor like Aoi Yuki (Tornado), Yuki Kaji (Sonic), Yuichi Nakamura (Mumen Raider), Kenjiro Tsuda (Atomic Samurai), Minami Takayama (Child Emperor), Sakurai Takahiro (Zombieman), Mamoru Miyano (Amai Mask) and many other. Their name has been known by most anime fans for the popular role in other anime. And they weren't disappointed the audience in here either.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Character\\n\r\nThe character section still has some sort of problem. For an example like the fast introduction of the characters (besides the main characters). It just so fast till I realize I didn\u2019t know who the heck he or she really is till their name was being told. Well, I guess that\u2019s impact of how simple the story is, making it a little bit fast pace. And another example is about the sudden new character that shows up like when the Ocean King knocks the superheroes down in the shelter, there\u2019s several character that suddenly appear which turns out to be a hero too (except Snake). And when I watch that I felt\u2026. hmm, \u201coh-kaay so suddenly there\u2019s another hero in the shelter that I really didn\u2019t get a clue about who they are\u2026\u201d I admit it that I\u2019m confused for a second but then Genos finally came to the shelter and my confusion out of focus, changed into curiosity about what will happen next after other superheroes got beaten. I guess that \u201cmisdirection\u201d has only half-succeed. And for the last example, the development of the characters. I didn\u2019t see any development in this story, there\u2019s some self-conflict but it hasn't brought some kind of development to the main characters. But I guess that\u2019s fine, compared to the amount of the episode of this anime. I think if the episode more than twelve, maybe they could fix this problem. Or probably the writer just want to tell the audience about the main story first before the developmental section, hmm, I don\u2019t know. It all depends on the writer. But for me, I guess that to have a story like this it doesn\u2019t enough for just twelve episodes. Well, they did make OVA\u2019s after all, let\u2019s just hope that the OVA\u2019s give some kind of explanation, answer or repair those problems. But other than that, the character section did nail it for some reason. Like the design of the supporting characters, the illustrator has made the characters was easy to memorize because their unique appearance and the similarities to other anime\u2019s character. Like Silverfang, I did found easy to memorize him because he really similar to Zeno Zoldyck from Hunter X Hunter. And he did found the easy way to introduce Saitama and Genos as the main character of the story with the differential appearance they have. I mean, Saitama\u2019s appearance so simple (bold, bright costume with red gloves) different than Genos who has the complex appearance (blonde-pale yellow hair, armored costume, black long pants). It\u2019s making them so easy to memorize plus with their story background, age info, and their personality. I bet many people too has become their fans for that reasons (besides \u201cthe popular\u201d and \u201cthe badass\u201d reason). That points explain why this two main character more loved by the audience rather than the other characters. Well, if you guys want to know more about the other characters (supporting), I think you should read the webtoon, the remake manga or just searching to find more. Because you\u2019ll not get that in this anime. It\u2019s full of action and the main character\u2019s role.           \\n\\n\r\n(*) Enjoyment\\n\r\nI enjoying it very much till the end. Although at the first episode, I\u2019m not really into it but the story, the characters, and the sound were amazingly succeeded to draw both \u201cenjoy\u201d and \u201ccuriosity\u201d to me. This anime was really fun to watch. You\u2019re not gonna tired of watching each of episode, I bet there are a lot of anime fans out there that finished watching this anime just only one day or half-day because of it enjoyed. And it actually makes me re-watch this anime again from the very beginning. If you ask which section that satisfy me the most, then the answer is in this section. Because the hesitation to watch it from the start was totally gone as the story goes on and suddenly you just realize that you have watched till the last episode. Speak of the last episode, that was certainly an epic battle that you can found only in this anime. So, despite it lacks for some part as I mentioned above, you will not get bored to watch this and I can say that One Punch Man is highly recommended for all of the anime fans out there. Finally, for a suggestion, don\u2019t mind about the pro and contra about this show, just watch it for yourself and the final score certainly depends on your taste of anime. Everyone has different taste and likes, good and bad are relative, you\u2019re the one who decide it.",

Don't expect anything special. Saitama is average. But the anime isn't. It's going to be one of the most entertaining action anime you'll ever see.",

Check. \r\nLike Superman on steroids. One! Punch!\r\nNo plot worth mentioning? Check. \r\nThe overall plot is uneventful to say the least, and the show is mostly episodic. Even within each episode there is little meaningful moral conflict or development. It's good vs evil for the blandest reasons, and none of it matters in the long run. There are plenty of fight scenes though.\r\nBland throwaway characters? Check. \r\nMost of the cast is a collection of one-shot nobodies with barely any screentime. The villains are a revolvingdoor of bland bad guys ready to get punched to pieces. The heroes get maybe a few minutes if they are lucky. The motives of the characters are so generic that when they are holding their usual speeches even the protagonist Saitama is disinterested. The few recurring characters don't fare much better. Saitama was actually bored of his own sidekick's backstory.\\n\\n\r\nLimited joke repertoire? Check. \\n\r\nOne! Punch!\\n\r\nActually, that's not quite fair. There are a few other ones:\\n\r\n- The Hero Association is a bunch of faceless bureaucrats who do more sitting in meetings than helping people.\\n\r\n- The repetitive nature of the show is itself a joke. Just make sure you're sitting comfortably because it's a long one.\\n\\n\r\nMindnumbingly repetitive? Check. \\n\r\nOnce you have figured out the formula, expect more of the same:\\n\r\n1. Random villain of the week appears and explains his backstory. Evilutionary scientist, alien overlord, king of the lizard people, whatever.\\n\r\n2. Saitama's sidekick Genos or some other heroes get thrown around.\\n\r\n3. Saitama appears and there's a punch.\\n\r\n4. Tune in next week. Same bat-time, same bat-channel.\\n\\n\r\nToo many episodes for the plot? Check... somewhat.\\n\r\nBut to fully parodize this there should have been at least a hundred. Future seasons may be able to fix this. All aboard the hype train.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo all is well, then? Well, yes, if you don't mind ending up as bored as Saitama himself. One Punch Man has taken mimicry to the point where it suffers from the same tedium as its targets. From fight scene to fight scene, from generic villain to generic villain, it has captured the formulaic nature of shonen and superhero shows and become just as formulaic.\\n\\n\r\nThe show accurately portrays how Saitama's existential angst and disillusionment with society have turned into apathy, and it inspires the same in the viewer. After a while, watching this show starts feeling meaningless.",

            "content": "I haven't watched much anime in recent years.  Like a lot of users, I was an avid consumer of the medium in my early 20s, but my viewership steadily declined as I approached 30 and other interests took over.  A few years ago, I watched \"Attack on Titan\" and it was dreadful, giving me the impression that I wasn't missing out on much.  \r\nOne night, on a lark, I decided to give \"One Punch Man\" a shot, which I didn't have particularly high hopes for.\r\nNot only did it turn out to be an excellent series, but it revitalized my interest in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is simple enough, following the exploits of heroic, dull-witted Saitama, who decides to become a costumed hero after failing a job interview and encountering a half human, half crab mutant in his underwear attacking people nearby.  Unfortunately, after three years of training, he has reached a point where he kills every opponent with a single punch, leading to a boring existence where no villain, no matter how terrifying or deadly, presents any challenge to him.  \\n\\n\r\nSurely, this one-note joke would wear thin quickly?  \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't, thanks to the series' masterful navigation between action, humor, and parody, all within the same episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs a pure action series, cutting out all the jokes, it's very good.  Fight choreography is crisp and frequently inventive, featuring an array of moves and bizarre combatants.  Madhouse did a fine job animating it, with numerous frames and a keen eye for detail.  Hell, \"One Punch Man\" is a much better fight anime than most dead serious shows in the genre.  Consider the match between Genos and Mosquito Girl.  Take away Saitama's presence, and you have a memorable fight that wouldn't be out of place in any classic action anime.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's an important point to keep in mind.  The fights themselves are always treated with full seriousness, never as a joke.  This gives them meaning, important in a series where the protagonist's victory is assured.    \\n\\n\r\nAs a comedy, it's not uproarious, but it has plenty of funny moments.  Saitama's calm, dull-witted attitude towards life in the midst of inhuman freaks, a silly professional Hero Association, and a generally bizarre world produces considerable amusement.  At the same time, it doesn't go too far, to the point of making Saitama an idiot or embarrassing him, as so many other series do.  This is especially important because at crucial moments throughout the series, Saitama proves that he is a real hero, not merely in physical strength but in strength of character.  \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the entire cast shines here.  The teen cyborg Genos is a trusty, likable sidekick to Saitama.  Amai Mask and Metal Knight are both enigmatic, seemingly villainous entities whose intentions are shrouded in mystery.  Even one-note characters like Spring Mustachio or Puripuri Prisoner are funny and have more inspired designs than many leads.  Everyone has a unique look and defined personality.  \\n\\n\r\nAs a parody, there are numerous characters and moments inspired by other shows.  Some are played for laughs, like the arrogant ninja killer Sonic being a hapless, overconfident take on Hiei from YuYu Hakusho.  Or the Deep Sea King's fangs and heart decorations reminding one of Dio Brando from JoJo. \\n\r\nOthers are worthy tributes to the original, like Genos being a version of Casshern.    \\n\\n\r\nCombine the action, humor, and parody together, and one has a truly special, excellent series, one whose mass popularity is genuinely deserved.  Strongly recommended for all anime fans.",

            "content": "Although one of the most influential and important superheroes of all time, Superman kind of sucks as a character. He has a bland personality. He's OP as fuck and defeats virtually any threats with little difficulty. He is a moral paragon and for over 80 years has fought for good and punished evil in a Manichean and childish style. This offers his character very little in terms of internal conflict or psychological development. He has no weaknesses to overcome, no need to improve, and never faces challenges that make the reader feel worried that he could possibly lose. Even IF he somehow loses once every40 years, the writers will create some fucking bullshit like a \"healing coma\" to explain that he didn't really lose.\\n\\n\r\nWhat if you took a HUGE animation budget and gave it to an anime almost solely devoted to bashing Superman? You would get One Punch Man! If you are a true weaboo and have no familiarity with American comics like Superman...just imagine if Inferno Cop had a lovechild with Dr. Slump and that child had an ungodly high production budget. That's basically what this is.\\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\nThe eponymous One Punch Man is an incredibly lame and OP costumed hero who effortlessly defeats random opponents on a daily basis. These fights almost always result in absurdly high casualties and destruction, but this is just hand-waved and forgotten, much like the movie Man of Steel. One Punch Man is quickly joined by a spoof of Iron Man and fights a spoof of The Rhino from Spiderman, who randomly transforms into Eva Unit 1 for...reasons. This is all in just the first few episodes! OPM even jumps the shark by episode 3 or 4 and references the MUDA MUDA MUDA meme from JoJo. I just pray they have the restraint to NOT make a John Cena joke! OPM basically has no plot, but when you are a spoof series that doesn't take itself seriously, you really don't need a plot. Did Apocalypse Zero have a plot? No. It just made fun of Hokuto no Ken, Super Sentai, and Kamen Rider. That's it!\\n\\n\r\nHumor:\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned previously that OPM has a lot of superhero spoofing and geek referential humor, but that doesn't really capture the full picture. OPM has that style of REALLY stupid and immature humor that is entirely self-aware and revels in its own stupidity. I mentioned earlier the likes of Inferno Cop and Dr. Slump, which you should definitely check out if you enjoyed OPM. However, OPM has its own distinct tastes. It isn't quite as stoner centered in its comedy as Inferno Cop, which basically just wanted to be the anime version of Aqua Teen Hunger Force. While OPM shares its 4th wall breaking, playful stupidity, and even its strong hatred of Superman with Dr. Slump, it isn't as pun filled and there isn't as much sex humor. This is a somewhat unique brand of stupidity that you simply have to assess for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nWhat is the main thing that makes One Punch Man different from all the other shows I've compared it to? One Punch Man is animated by Studio Madhouse and they are actually using their full efforts to make this silly spoof as aesthetically pleasing as possible! The animation is fluid, the character models look funny, the blood is heavily stylized, yet done in a way that instantly invokes laughter. Visually, OPM is actually pretty damn good!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nOPM is the most hyped anime of this year by FAR. Is it actually as good as everyone is saying? No it isn't, but at least it IS pretty funny and enjoyable. Considering the hype train was fueled by the same anime threads that backed the likes of Nichijou and Food Wars, this was actually above expectations. I can say I honestly laughed quite a few times and enjoyed myself. By some miracle, this isn't one of the plethora of absurdly overhyped anime out there with a fandom of hipster douchebags who like it \"ironically\". I'm looking at you Stardust Crusaders! If you haven't seen One Punch Man, I would definitely recommend checking it out!",

OPM still sucks and terribly.\r\nI tend to keep my reviews short but i found the need to enlighten this \r\nworld about why OPM sucks so i decided to give a detailed review based \r\non 12 episodes of the anime.\r\nI tried my best to make this review spoiler free.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nIn a sentence \"An extremely overpoweredguy who knocks out douches \\n\r\nwith one punch\" sounds legit.Comedy is supposed be the main objective \\n\r\nof this anime but imo their attempts at comedy were pathetic.I fail to \\n\r\nunderstand how naming people or rather creatures Vaccine \\n\r\nMan,Beefcake,Smile Man,License-less Rider,Atomic Samurai,Pig God are \\n\r\nsupposed to make us laugh.There were a few moments where i had a faint \\n\r\ngrin but they got overshadowed by the stupidity of the mc.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe best part of this anime is the art.Ofcourse the art would be \\n\r\namazing because it is made by Madhouse.Also this is the only reason \\n\r\nwhy i decided to watch this anime.\\n\r\nI cant believe i am appreciating OPM but i have to say this as guys, \\n\r\nthe minute details in the surroundings were actually impressive.Also \\n\r\nthe animation in the last episode was good.The character design of \\n\r\nlord Boros was epic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nThere was this one guy in our college who kept annoying me by singing \\n\r\nsome random anime opening and turns out that it was OPM's opening.He \\n\r\nalso told me that the soundtracks were amazing and give the vibe of a \\n\r\nGodlike badass.After listening to soundtracks especially Saitama,s \\n\r\nmain theme instead of screaming \"ONE PUUUUUNCH MAAAAN\" i yelled \"WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: -1/10\\n\r\nI read this description of Saitama on the OPM wiki which was\\n\r\n\"In this new action-comedy, everything about a young man named Saitama \\n\r\nscreams \"AVERAGE,\" from his lifeless expression, to his bald head, to \\n\r\nhis seemingly unimpressive physique. However, this average-looking \\n\r\nfellow doesn't have your average problem... He's actually a superhero \\n\r\nthat's looking for tough opponents! The problem is, every time he \\n\r\nfinds a promising candidate he beats the snot out of them in one \\n\r\npunch. Can Saitama finally find an evil villain strong enough to \\n\r\nchallenge him? Follow Saitama through his hilarious romps as he \\n\r\nsearches for new bad guys to challenge!\"\\n\\n\r\nSo the strongest guy huh.. then nothing to watch here.This is a failed \\n\r\nattempt at parody.I cannot comprehend how they show <SPOILER>his ass \\n\r\ngetting kicked by Boros,suddenly starts retaliating and finally Boros \\n\r\nagrees that he was no match to Saitama.So this is just another shounen \\n\r\nanime without all the friendship drama although it doesnt have that \\n\r\ntag.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 0/10\\n\r\nI wasted 17280 seconds of my precious life on this disgusting piece of \\n\r\ncrap.I should be on tons of meth to give OPM a score of 0 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\r\nThe only reason i gave it 1 is because of Madhouse.Guys trust me i had \\n\r\nto do a reality check twice after i finished this anime about why \\n\r\npeople liked this so much.I began doubting whether i was living in the \\n\r\nnormal world or i was living in the parallel universe where anime like \\n\r\nperfect insider and one outs barely manage to get an 8.5 but this shit \\n\r\ngets a score around 9.\\n\\n\r\nPlease donot watch this even if people recommend this anime as it would be a sheer waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you excuse me i gotta go ONE PUNCH that guy in the face who told me OPM soundtracks were amazing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I only feel that you can review content after you have completed it, and with this being my first review i did not want make that mistake (especially after that excellent finale) \r\n(SKIP TO OVERALL IF YOU DONT LIKE LONG READS)\r\nOne Punch Man is a parody so it obviously  has a decent focus on comedy and quips to keep some gears running whist you are watching, but don't let that put you off as the series has amazing fight sequences with outstanding animation, when the general thought would be \"How can this series have good fights if the main dude is OP\". I willadmit, i came to \"ONE PUUUUNCCCHHH\" as very stubborn, sceptical individual, as im that type of hipster that attempts not to follow the hype, however i gave this series a chance and it met my expectations and more in all its areas. \\n\\n\r\nStory(8/10) - A CLASS Satisfied)\\n\r\nCall the plot simple, because it really is SIMPLE; just like the main protagonists face & look, the series SCREAMS SIMPLE. But being simple does not make this series bad because it understands this fact & benifits from it , as the world is very dense but is created from such a simple concept that it makes the series that much more interesting but easy to understand and enjoy. \\n\r\nAlthough from the side plots & comments about sinister/absent characters, i feel that the plot is building to a more intense & serious place for the  future ( i have not read the manga) .\\n\\n\r\nArt(10/10 - 9/10)\\n\r\nIm not here to debate about the pay for artists & animators, as the topic is for a different time, but with this series having a near average budget for a 12 episode run just baffles me. \\n\r\nNot one corner was cut to keep the feel & beauty of this series running consistently, as the attention to detail in scenes makes the world created One come to life, as visually - every character has something to offer in looking aesthetically pleasing for viewers (even Saitama) , so much love was put into it.\\n\r\nTHE FIGHT SCENES ARE JUST EPIC IN ANIMATION!\\n\r\nBut being critical, the worlds strongest mans fight animation was not on par with the others - yet it did kinda have its own lankey charm aha)\\n\\n\r\nSound(10/10 ONE PUNCCCCHHHHHH)\\n\r\nOkay, if you don't like epic music & a tense soundtrack to keep you on the edge of your seat... you wont like this Soundtrack. However i think everyone can appreciate how the music direction suits the series to make the experience whole.\\n\r\nTHANK GOD this series did not use a \"Silly song\" to play whenever the characters are up to their comedic antics, as the use of pause and silence in the sound makes the experience even funnier in moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10/10 Mumen Rider!!) \\n\r\nThe characters in this series have a lot to offer, as each is unique in the One Punch Man universe to create a dynamic yet interesting world. Now this is not saying that you will not feel some characters are being generic or similar to others created in anime or any other media , but OPM actually plays on this trope.\\n\r\nAlso OPM actually has some emotional & serious scenes with a bunch of its characters, that most viewers (especially myself) can empathise with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10 I clapped when the finale ended)\\n\r\nI actually never reviewed an anime online, but i really just enjoyed this series so much that i needed to share my views of it to the internet( so that others could experience what i did)\\n\r\nJust complete the series and give it a chance, and for a long time anime viewer this series is perfect to kickstart faith in new original anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL( 10/10) \\n\r\nAfter originally being sceptical about One Punch Man, I actually had this series set in my mind as a 8/9 out of 10; But after the finale and such a satisfying run, the series is a complete 10 \"Masterpiece\" of its own.\\n\\n\r\nALTHOUGH, do not take a rating of 10 to say that this anime is \"better\" or \"cooler\" than others( which i may of rated lower), i just believe, in itself this series gives everything and more to expect in its genre; in a smart fashion that leaves me extremely satisfied with \"that\"12 episode run being complete product filled with love at every corner.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for your time & don't be a hater - at least appreciate the effort.\\n",

            "content": "It's an absolute embarrassment how highly this show is rated in the Anime community, over many long running and sophisticated animes that took effort to write and sent emotions running high and low. I feel like this rating is driven purely by emotion from people who enjoy the eccentricity of a self-aware anime. To be fair, that is a very comedic aspect and is worth some points. However, this anime was never meant to be serious and has been drastically overrated for the aforementioned reason. The storyline is very shallow and it seems like it was put together on the spot as you continue throughepisodes. It becomes very dreadful to watch only a few episodes in and the focus turns away from Saitama. Saitama has a very unique personality, and his apprentice has a satirical unfitting one. But characters fade in and out of the show quickly, with no real connections being made between the watcher and other characters. Also, the comedy is very one-dimensional for a series based on comedy. It focuses solely on exaggerations and comic relief. The art is arguably very creative for people who don't mind the styles switching once and a while, and that was a plus for me. It actually adds to it's eccentricity. Anyway, in conclusion, I'd give it somewhere between a 3 and a 4.",

            "content": "*Message to everybody who saw my score and was like\"What an idiot\", \"Is this guy serious\", \"This man clearly has no taste in anime\", \"Uncultured Swine\". Keep in mind EVERYBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO THEIR OWN OPINION*\r\nThis is my first and probably my last anime review, but I write this with the purpose being so that I don't forget the reason why I didn't really like this anime which puts me into the minority of people who have watched it. So in turn, I won't give you a real review with a story, art, sound, etc. numerical value breakdown but just a semi-short breakdown ofthe show as a whole. I also have NO PROBLEM with the character being completely over powered and that this is an end game shounen... just putting that out there.\\n\\n\r\nGOOD\\n\r\n=====\\n\r\nMadhouse does it again with their Art and Sound...\\n\\n\r\nBAD\\n\r\n====\\n\r\n     Overall, I can't see what makes this show a 10/10 to other people, but everybody is entitled to their own opinion. I believe that the major problem I have with the show is that it is episodic. There was very little plot to start with and on top of that I started to realize that there would be no plot advancement due to the show being episodic. If that's the case than why don't I just go watch modern day television. I myself enjoy shows with a great story and overall character development which I just think this show lacks in general. I mean did Saitama really gain his superpowers that way...really? Where are all these super villains coming from? How did they get their powers? How did the Heroes get their powers? How did the Hero Association come to exist? Will at least some of the extensive amount of questions I have ever really be answered? Find out on the next episode of One Punch Man... Oh wait I guess we won't will we? Oh yeah.. Episodic, I forgot... sigh.... but I regress.\\n\\n\r\n     There is also the problem I have with the characters. This show is also what I believe to be a solely comedic anime, hence the characters look, feel, act, and just how dense they can be, but like I said that's probably due to this being a comedy. Another reason for my dislike would be the that I find the Comedy of it to be really dry and unsavory, but that's my own sense of humor. If others find that sort of comedy amusing, than I can see why. This show also takes 5-6 episodes in my opinion to pick up and even start showing signs of a potential story(The story pickup in my eyes by the way is the introduction of the Hero Association). That's almost HALF the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n======\\n\r\nAfter finishing the show, It has definitely come to grow on me.... at least a little. I also do believe that their should be a second season of One Punch Man and i'm sure there will be due to its immense popularity. But I only say this in the hopes that the second season will be where the actual story lies.\\n\r\n     Hopefully the people who read this can see my reasoning behind this and not just write me off as an Anime Pleeb.

            "content": "Okay... One Punch Man is a weird show to describe my thoughts on it, but I will try my best.\r\nThis show started out actually fairly mediocre for me, it never hooked me right off the bat, and didn't hook me until around the Sea King arc. But even tho it did hook me really late in the game, it still never sold me on it being a show worth watching again, or even recommending to someone else. But just as each episode went by I found myself enjoying it more and more.\r\nArt/Animation) it looks solid, tho I'm the type of person who would rather takea more realistic type animation style such as Nagi no Asukara/Kara no Kyoukai/Garden of Words. But it still works for the show, it isn't \"the best animation I've ever seen\" like how some people say it is, but you can clearly tell how much effort the animators loved working on this project.\\n\\n\r\nMusic) The OST is fantastic and wish that I could have it immediately but sadly we aren't getting it until the middle of January. As for the ED, I felt as it is was really lacking, it was slow and forgettable. But for the OP... man, at first I hated the song, but over time it began to grow on me even tho it still isn't the best opening of the season... but short answer, I really enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nComedy) It was really hit and miss for me, some of the witty dialogue just didn't get to me. But the one thing that i found the most hilarious about this whole show was where in the very beginning of the whole show when Genos first met saitama and started asking him a lot of questions and just continuously speaking faster and faster until saitama snaps and yells \"Enough you idiot! Shorten it to 20 words or less!!!\".\\n\\n\r\nStory) I found it to be lackluster at first, just being the same shit after each episode: terror in city by some strange monster, saitama shows up, the monsters make fun of him, saitama throws one single punch and the match is over. But over time you were introduced to the hero system, and each class rank. And you met more and more bad guys, then talked about the danger system and other stuff. Tho the plot is super basic, i feel as if just keeps going and might never have a definitive end until Saitama decides to retire and hang up his suit forever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters) As I explained earlier about the hero system and the ranks and stuff, this is where I believe how the writer simply used this as a ploy in my opinion to shoehorn in other \"heroes\" just for the sake of them being there and having witty dialogue. But the thing is, the show introduced like 10 or more different characters in the last few episodes and we never learn anything about them until the end of the show. But I will say this, they all have very unique and interesting (sometimes) character design and powers.\\n\\n\r\nMy thoughts on the last episode were it was fun and good, and left me wanting more... but the thing is, there isn't more. So I'm really perplexed about this \"ending\" for say, because I know that the manga keeps going, but i feel as if the anime just ended and didn't have any closer for this series. So I really hope to see a season 2 to this series, because I just want to learn more about this world/characters while also seeing how the \"story\" progresses.\\n\\n\r\nIn the long run, I can wholeheartedly say that I would recommend this series to other anime fans to watch... but for all the people saying it is the \"savior of anime\"... well it isn't so deal with it, and it isn't even the best show to air this season. Anyways, I would give this series an 8/10.",

            "content": "Ok so it's time to give OPM what it deserve. The show was promising and fun to watch at the begining but at the end of the last episode, I had only one word in my head : flat. The story is flat, the background is flat, the characters are flat, tatsumaki is flat and so is Saitama's face. At least there are a good match. It was disappointing. \"What I am watching ? Even Bleach and Fairy Tail have better characters and storyline\" and oh god I really hate Fairy Tail. \r\nThe concept was fine, but one shot everyone is really boring if youdon't show something else. So let me guess what will happen next ? A new villain will appear, Genos will get destroyed, then X randoms heros will get beatten too and Saitama will do the job and Mumen Rider will get the credits.  Such suspense, much originality, very surprised WoW. Doge approuves.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse saved a part of the show thanks to a very good animation, but once again I was disappointed by Saitama's fight. I had very high expectations since the show can only provides fighs, and once again it was average. The fights are just empty and even the last one was lame. Saitaima get punched again and again taking the hits like it was nothing, just lost in though.... \"Oh Gosh hit him already !\" Then Saitama wakes-up to blow the guy in one hit. \"Okay guys we need a new fight idea\" 1) \"Make more stupid ennemies\" 2) \"Saitama wins in two punchs\" 3) \"what about something that balance the fights ?\" ... Get the meme reference ?\\n\\n\r\nSo OPM looks like Bleach with poor dialogues, poor storyline, no characters developpement and so on. You cloud say \"OPM only has 12 episodes\". It's true. But even in 12 \u00e9pisodes a show needs to bring some background / storyline to be better than just a chain of stupid fights. In this regards, OPM failed. We can say that OPM is a blockbuster and easily enjoyable but don't expect too much.\\n\\n\r\nAnd obviously, I didn't find it funny at all.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, even Bleach is way better as a Bankai is more impressive than a one punch man.",

The hype around the series is well deserved and understandable. The author of the series simply made a good choice story and plotwise and Madhouse turned his manga into one hell of an amazing anime. The art, animation, scenery, cutsequence, sound and so on were amazingly well done.\r\nAnimation: 10/10\r\nVery solid, but even amazingly detailed animation, as well as incredibleportrayage of physics (the action in the series is very physics-heavy).\\n\r\nUnique character looks and good effects. Nice pause sequence.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nOf course the story isn\u00b4t the best part about the anime, however it is quite intriguing, e.g. the whole story around saitama and his social standing is well done in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nMadhouse did an amazing job on soundtracks, the theme song, character voices and SFX as they tend to. The theme song is catchy and the soundtracks create a perfect atmosphere for whatever is currently displayed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters in One Punch Man are what I really liked in the series. There\u00b4s quite a large cast with interesting, funny and likeable people AND creatures.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThe overwhelming sensation that I had during the entire series: Joy. All put-together the anime features great comedy which made me laugh out loud several times. The amount of power or \"overpoweredness\" of saitama also made my jaw drop basically every episode, giving me goosebumps and making me laugh or squeal. The action is, as I already said, very well displayed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall opinion: 10/10\\n\r\nI give this series 10 out of 10 points, because I simply enjoyed it beyond belief. It\u00b4s fresh and has a very unique feel to it, stunning you every episode.",

            "content": "I don't normally look at this site's review average before watching an anime, but OnePunch Man getting a 9.02 is worthy of a few eyebrows. Naturally my curiosity piqued and I started watching it. Is it enjoyable? Yeah maybe. Is it worthy of a 9/10. No, most definitely not.\r\nOnePunch Man as an anime set itself out to be a parody of shounen hero animes. As in, it sets itself out to be different than your typical shounen show (hah pun laugh dammit). The concept itself (and by extension the first episode) is a good representation of that, Saitama is portrayed as a boring invincible heroand uses very normal offense and defense moves instead of standard flashy attacks and doesn't announce his moves. In fact, the first episode alone makes for  very good episode, but a gimmicky one at that that doesn't lend itself to be extended into a series.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with OnePunch Man is that, with a character so absurdly powerful such that all battles end with one punch, action scenes lose their tension and therefore become dull. The first episode played on this joke well enough, but when the following episodes start doing it, you really start to lose interest in the fight scenes. Most people recommending me this series told me that the series is mostly comedy, not action. Those people are dirty filthy liars. OnePunch Man should NOT have been done as an action series primarily, and should have been a comedy series first and foremost with fights serving as prelude or outcome of a gag and not the crux of the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nMost action scenes either involve Genos or the other loser heroes from the Hero Association. The thing is, once the episode starts focusing on them (they do towards the 2nd half with the introduction of the Sea King arc and the Boros arc) instead of Saitama, then OnePunch Man starts to lose its identity ; it just ends up delving into generic shounen action anime while the heroes get jobbed and wait for Saitama to finish the monsters off. Also none of the heroes ever get into a life-threatening situation where any tension or drama can be felt, instead after you see that one guy survive the so-called lethal blow by the Sea King in episode 7 or so, you know for sure none of the heroes are gonna be facing any situation that may put their lives in peril. This severely diminishes any effect the fight may otherwise have.\\n\\n\r\nEven the comedy scenes, few as they are, aren't that special or anything. It's fairly hit and miss, and most of the best scenes are in the first few episodes. The one memorable comedic moment I can remember from the anime (outside the OP where he punches the star man) is from the last episode where Saitama asked for directions out of the spaceship only to go in the opposite direction, grinning like a maniac, to fight the bad guys. Scenes like this are surprisingly rare for a comedy series, scenes that work so well and have perfect comedic timing aren't easy to find. Most of the jokes generally involve Saitama's superhuman strength despite his very average appearance/fighting style and they wear off really quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is alright, I wasn't expecting much out of a series that set itself to be a parody of the shounen genre, but I really didn't like how they handled the exposition scenes. Often characters just break and go on rambling on and on. Occasionally Saitama butts in and tells them to can it, but only very late after almost the entire expository scene is done. The central theme in which a true hero is not necessarily a highly-ranked one, or one associated with some form of bureaucracy isn't conveyed well. In the sense that Genos, Saitama and Momen Rider are obviously people the show wants you to root for while everyone else is either a jerk or a perv or comically evil but still part of the Hero Association for one reason or another. They are very one-dimensional and given how many characters there are, you hardly get to have any screentime with some of the Class S heroes even. Characters like Tatsumaki and Sweet Mask make like a cameo at best and what's worse is that their importance is only teased at the very end of the series. If the anime doesn't get a continuation (very unlikely), that means essentially this whole series is one big product placement for the manga series, like most manga-to-anime adaptations.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite its many flaws, OnePunch Man is still very much watchable. Just don't go in expecting anything spectacular. Like its titular character,  Saitama, OnePunch Man is ultimately very average.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nSlightly above average because there was nothing else good on Winter Season. Tentative score, may revisit on a later date.",

            "content": "One Punch Man was one of the biggest anime hits of 2015, and although most of the momentum is gone, it still remains a staple series in 2019 and season 2 is one of the most awaited anime of 2019. One Punch Man has been widely acclaimed for its animation and comedy. I immensely enjoyed One Punch Man the first time I watched it, but the more I rewatched it, the more I realized that One Punch Man had some very glaring flaws.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nOne Punch Man doesn't really have a plot; It just follows the story of Saitama and Genos as they struggle to makeit to the grocery store sale in time and find powerful villains. I found the comedy of One Punch Man to get old really quickly. The main joke is, as stated in the title, Saitama can one punch anyone, and that joke gets old really quickly. The first couple times One Punch Man made the one punch joke I laughed, but then after that, it just gets repetitive and stale.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is widely acclaimed to have outstanding animation, and I can vouch for that. The animation was very fluid, and the fight scenes were very dynamic. The animation quality also stayed consistent throughout One Punch Man, there never really was a drop in animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening and themes of One Punch Man are definitely fantastic, it just isn't as good as some other animes. Ex: Naruto, Fairy Tail, Samurai Champloo, Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nThere is virtually no character development in One Punch Man, the protagonist already starts out as the most powerful character in the series after all. Most characters are bland, one-dimensional and only there for comic relief. The only character I genuinely cared for was Genos. I wanted to find out more about his backstory\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is a very enjoyable show, I would suggest you casually watch it. The humor isn't for everyone, and One Punch Man isn't supposed to be taken too seriously. However, if there is one thing everyone will love about One Punch Man, it will be the fights. The fights are incredibly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is a good anime, if taken casually, however when you pay more attention to the finer details, you will find that One Punch Man is not as good as it seems.\\n\\n",

Defeating a monster can be a source of comedy but also of inspiration and drama, which sounds like not taking a solid stance. The show ends up falling into its own trap of exploiting tropes which could be avoided by either cutting off all idealistic crap or integrating it better. About the animation, it varies from passable to good and when it wants, impressive. Not nearly as consistent as people claim it to be, butas far as seasonal adaptations go, this one is surely among the best. Mob is far more cinematic and energetic all things considered while also knowing to handle tone better. Rewatching it definitely put me in a weird spot where I value the highlights more than its entirety. Still, fun and accessible.",

It fits the show perfectly\\n\r\nOpening and ending are memorable, i couldn't skip them. (*spoiler* Especially at the fight between Saitama and Boros, it reached the climax*spoiler*)\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI remember back in the days people used to say 2D animation would be abandoned in the near future. But after watching OPM, i've understood the concept that 2D animation isn't dying (as long as Madhouse makes great series like opm). \\n\\n\r\n  *Character designs: 10/10 (come on you can't deny that heroes and villians both have unique faces/body shapes. Of course most of them are unrealistic but who cares? It absolutely doesn't mean it is bad.)\\n\r\n  *Animation: 10/10 \\n\r\n  *Backgrounds: 10/10\\n\r\n  *Visual effects: 10/10 (the fights are very detailed and enjoyable, not full of horrible CGIs)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs you see, these are mainly made up out of generic archetypes but this show managed to flesh them out. Most of them are memorable and pretty good written. \\n\\n\r\n* Backstory: 10/10 (Backstory is often necessary to explain a character's motivations and intentions.  Gladly opm many characters have their own interesting backstories and none of them were rushed. At least they didn't put the viewers to sleep.)\\n\r\n  *Personality: 10/10 (each has their own motives and goals, don't forget that good characters make people care about everything else in the story. the characters in opm did it perfectly)\\n\r\n  *Development: 10/10 (The character traits facilitate the character developments in good way.  For example we all change some for the better, some for the worse. None of us are the same person we used to be 3 or 4 years ago. Like this.\\n\r\nCharacter arcs in opm are done by these steps:\\n\r\n1. The establishment arc(the start point)-  In the first 2 episodes we saw why and how Saitama has become hero and understood his motives.  *spoiler* He only seeks the strong opponents in order to escape from his boredom *spoiler*\\n\r\n2. The change arc - *spoiler* Saitama was someone who is a hero for a hobby. His live was boring and liveless, then Genos and other heroes appeared. Hes no longer a hero for a hobby, its his journey to become a professional hero. *spoiler*\\n\r\n3. The growth/fall arc - His journey had many holdbacks and problems. Because of his overwhelming power, people started to doubt and call him \"a fake hero\". But he didn't give up, more importantly he sacrificed himself for other heroes in order to keep their honor and ambition. Thats what true hero is! Even if he doesn't have any worthy opponents or fame, his life has meaning. Life is not boring at all. Thats what Saitama has realized at the end of the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nNot gonna lie, I really enjoyed this series, almost every episodes were hype. (I don't think i have to write a long essay for this section, my personal score after all)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOPM is a must watch for any anime fan, regardless of taste. Its very good shounen anime, not some random cliche show which has forced drama and rushed long backstory. It deserved its own place!",

            "content": "A simple webcomic with sloppy drawing and started out as a hobby, re-drawn by a god-tier manga artist, and now it has an anime adaptation which is now the most Popular Anime of the Decade. This Anime exceeds the expectation of the many which makes this anime incredible especially for its fight scenes, but for now, it has ended and we have to wait for more than a year in order for this anime to have a sequel, since the source material still lacks for it to be animated.\r\nAnime vs. Manga vs. Webcomic\r\nNow I just want to tell people that I\u2019ve read the Manga versionand the Webcomic before this anime was announced, it was March at that time, going back to its comparison the Anime is no doubt the best of the three, since it\u2019s the final package of adaptation, but it doesn\u2019t mean the Manga can be ignored that has breathtaking art almost comparable to its anime, as for the Webcomic, which is the origin of the series, excels in plot and character development, the cr\u00e8me of OPM series which lacks on the anime. The Webcomic has already finished its top notch arc, the Garou Arc, but the manga is still preparing for that arc which is the most incredible plot with great character development with balanced fights of OPM series, though I don\u2019t want to talk about it since it will be a spoiler and it\u2019s not yet re-drawn.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt is indeed unique, unlike any shounen premise which has a basic formula of \u201cFight and Train until you get stronger\u201d nor the western style of \u201cSuper\u201d w/ a story of fighting for humanity. OPM utilizes itself for its \u201cGag Purposes\u201d that destroys the common principle styles and logic which is always used on many shows and series and which destroys what was set in the common mentality. The story is incomplete that leaves me unsatisfied, the story in the Webcomic is yet to come and the manga has uncovered many characters which makes it fun to read, but the anime is still on its introduction, more likely, it has covered up its awesomeness of its theme, and after that, is quite underwhelming, but It doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t like it, but rather, it is really predictable when it comes to plot device, we already know who\u2019s going to win, so basically we already know what\u2019s going to happen and we\u2019re just waiting for to see the results, the reaction and the scale of the fight. It needs a sequel to appreciate this anime completely, and because of that I encourage people to read the Manga at Chapter 37, and if you\u2019re into plot, just finish the ongoing manga and read the Webcomic version at Chapter 51.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAesthetic sound and Visually Outstanding, when it comes to its Output, everything is just awesome, no doubt that this is one of the best anime when it comes to Art and Sound, it\u2019s really good that even reading the manga the anime had exceed my expectation, the only problem when it comes to animation was the \u201cImpact Factor\u201d the manga did it, every small detail of art nor the casual and funny scenes is just artistically outstanding, well the manga has the best dedicated manga artist who dedicated his life into it, going back to the anime, the art of the anime is good, but sometimes it becomes mediocre then it goes to fight scenes, the show cuts loose with evocative smears, spinning cameras, and wild linework combined with great guitar solo and memorable music which brings the fights into life, so it\u2019s like a switch, it\u2019s like an \u201con and off\u201d concept which makes the anime sometimes underwhelming, especially after overwhelming fights which heightens the tension of the anime scene. The Last episode is the very evidence of it, the first half was just awesome, then the second half is quite underwhelming.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat made me love this anime was the Sound, it\u2019s the best, I wish I can copy the guitar solos through hearing, but for now, I want to point out that this Anime has a magnificent anime Opening, which didn\u2019t spoil any audiences and have created a story while showing how cool Saitama is, and the Background music which livens everything especially when it comes to its fighting scenes, the only thing that I hate was the Ending[ed] especially the memorable alarm clock with a sad song to end its awesomeness of each episode.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters, the highlights of the whole series, they are just memorable, they\u2019ve got unique appeal and their character designs fit their very image. There\u2019s a simple symbolism for Saitama and Genos, they are liken to Yin[white and Yang[black] that balances them in this series. Though Saitama\u2019s Highlights would fall to episode 7 and 9, I don\u2019t want to talk about since it will be a spoiler for those who didn\u2019t watch the anime. OPM\u2019s supporting characters makes this story, they are appealing and they are awesome, but only few of them have developed and the others were just shown just to show their scale of power to win the fight, to observe, or to lose the fight. The antagonist are very clich\u00e9d, there\u2019s nothing bad to them nor good points, they are just there to show the scale of power of different level and to be defeated by mc, fortunately some heroes were given a time to show off their skills. There might be flaws when it comes to plot character device, but there are some hidden ethics and logic in this anime, and there\u2019s more in the its manga and webcomic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow most of the viewers have enjoyed this anime, while some have loathed it since its too overrated, but for me, it\u2019s really good, the fighting scenes was good, one of the best executed anime, it\u2019s jaw dropping and the visually stunning with great combination of impressive sound, the characters are really unique that many people have been captivated into them. Many have created thousands of arts, have been cosplayed by many audiences, many have become bald just to do that, and many who are new to anime have watched this and most of all, it\u2019s heavily known throughout the world, it\u2019s just popular that it has conquered social meds, forums and more. It\u2019s funny(not sure why some people doesn\u2019t find it funny) and sometimes it touches the audiences, but most of the time, it\u2019s awesome.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth to watch, it\u2019s an all ages anime[but it\u2019s R - 17+ (violence & profanity)] it\u2019s really good to recommend it to new to anime, but the anime is still incomplete, it needs a sequel in order to bring out its full potential, it\u2019s still lacks since it has covered only the first half of the whole series, while the best quality of this series exist in its manga and webcomic. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is really good and no doubt enjoyable, the people behind it made it really good, and the funny thing is, people were inspired by Saitama\u2019s Training Regimen that many NEETS, Otakus and many more have worked out that a joke turned into motivation. I want to recommend this as an action comedy, highly recommended for new to anime viewers and casual viewers.",

            "content": "One Punch Man was quite a unique and refreshing experience, albeit quite far from a perfect one. It\u2019s flaws are apparent and certain points of the show can be rather mundane at times. In spite of this, One Punch Man is a show that rarely fails to put a smile on my face while watching it. It\u2019s intent is to lampoon the absurdity of overpowered characters and superhero tropes in general, and in doing this it manages to craft a new path of its own that is filled with style, flashy spectacle, and endearing quirkiness. It may have its shortcomings in terms of maintaining everlastingappeal over its course, but it nonetheless does all it needs to do to stand on its own two feet.\\n\\n\r\nOur hero for fun, Saitama, is the center of attention as well as the selling point of the show itself. He is the embodiment of everything One Punch Man represents and what it has to offer. He fights not on the behalf of others, but because he can. It\u2019s unfortunate for him that he\u2019s so damn strong that no villain has a chance of making him flinch, or holding any sort of fight, and this makes Saitama both fatigued and rather bored of his daily routine. This alone is enough to sell the experience to viewers, and to propose an underlying wonder of various instances in most other stories involving superheroes. To start off, the routine of arrogant and ostentatious villains meeting their demise by the hand, or should I say \u201cfist\u201d, of a mellow, half-eyed bald guy in a cape is done in such a comical fashion that is not only humorous, but immediately envelops Saitama as a character, as well as what One Punch Man intends to evoke. We have to wonder if the strongest superheroes we know and love have ever fallen in the same boat as Saitama, deprived of any challenge of exhilaration, and ultimately questioning the point of it all. This is a concept which is both humorous and a breath of fresh air in regards to superheroes, making for a very suitable approach on the topic. However, the question that lies now is if this one concept is enough to carry the show all the way through its duration.\\n\\n\r\nThe answer is no. Because it is a one-note gag in where the outcome is pretty much the same in all instances, it would become repetitive and exceedingly mundane to rely on that one gag entirely. One Punch Man luckily manages to refrain from this trap. It refreshes itself by introducing various new characters to add more flavors to the experience, and building on that of Saitama\u2019s. The first character to come to mind is Genos, who serves as a foil to the main character. In contrast to Saitama, Genos is dedicated to his work, and is extremely loyal to Saitama in hopes to achieve his own agenda. This also paves way for some rather funny and amusing interactions between the two. Saitama often gets sick of Genos leeching onto him and blabbering about his ambitions, while Saitama himself tends to silently dread over his own problem. This makes for a great chemistry which keeps the viewing experience alive, proving that One Punch Man has more to offer than a single gag repeated over and over.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, it\u2019s a shame that some other characters don\u2019t get that same amount of fleshing out as our two main heroes. For other characters, we have Tatsumaki, a petite, ill-tempered girl with psychokinetic powers. There\u2019s also Puri-Puri-Prisoner, who is the standard and generic stereotype of a homosexual male: being very feminine. These two along with many others don\u2019t receive a significant amount of development and are seemingly only there to fill in the gaps with more personalities and flashy action scenes. This isn\u2019t a bad thing though, far from it in fact. But I still feel as if this is where the consequence of One Punch Man being a premature adaptation of its source really stands out. Variety is always acceptable, but not to the point to where it feels like padding.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully there are certain side-characters which stand out from the rest. One example is Speed-o\u2019-Sound Sonic who, after his humiliating defeat from Saitama, labels him as a rival. He actively pursues Saitama on a frequent basis in hopes for vengeance and redemption, which leads to plenty of rather humorous and amusing moments, not even limited to the fight they had which started the whole dilemma. It either leads to a trivial but endearing face-off, or into another situation entirely. In addition there is Mumen Rider, a hero on a bike who pedals to the face of danger, only to get his ass handed to him in the process. What\u2019s significant about his character, however, is that he is ironically one of the biggest sources of inspiration for Saitama. Mumen Rider\u2019s dedication to keeping everybody safe despite how weak he is, puts Saitama in wonder of what true heroism is. Saitama\u2019s significant development as a character highlights that the show isn\u2019t merely a vessel for simple jokes, but provides an actual story to get invested into.\\n\\n\r\nSaitama himself is a notoriously well-rounded character, contrary to what his appearance might imply.  In addition to his apathy towards saving the day, his personality is like a normal human being in nearly every relatable way. He has a routine of chores, plans for the day, and plenty of personality and subtext in his dialogue. In fact, if most other characters in the show received the amount of attention as this, I feel like One Punch Man would be successful in offering the completely polished experience it deserved.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of this said, how well does One Punch Man live up as a parody? To begin with, to parody means to imitate a particular concept or style, and to exaggerate it for comedic effect. It goes without saying that the existence of Saitama himself fits this idea quite well. The exaggeration comes from Saitama defeating villains in a single punch, and his boredom with the whole concept of being a hero. The comedic effect comes from both the absurdity of the bad guys and Saitama\u2019s apathy. But where does One Punch Man live up as a parody beyond this? Unfortunately this is where the whole attempt to parody typical shounen falls short. The show predominantly revolves around Saitama\u2019s character arc, his frequent encounters with villains, and verbal exchanges with different characters. The whole purpose of being a parody is seemingly gone to waste once Saitama encounters his first epiphany. Many of the jokes from there on out feel rather arbitrary, as if the writer had lost interest in writing a parody and decided to write very standard jokes which offer no insight on the concept of heroism in general. Saitama\u2019s arc is a good thing by itself, and other characters are certainly a joy to watch as well. But after the first few episodes, One Punch Man really feels like it took some steps backwards in terms of what it could have achieved.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual department of One Punch Man is good enough in and of itself. Animation is very fluid and well-choreographed as expected of Studio Madhouse, and has the added benefit of being very flashy. Additionally, the character designs manage to look distinct and capture the extravagant nature of the show without looking overly simplistic. There\u2019s plenty of flair to be seen in the designs from Genos\u2019s cybernetic anatomy to Sonic\u2019s sleek attire. By contrast, one-note villains are given a relatively simple and goofy design, indicating that they won\u2019t be seen for long. More prominent villains are more complex in appearance, yet colorful enough to stand out. The characters\u2019 personalities and roles in the story are clearly reflected in their designs, which is the perfect approach for the kind of show One Punch Man is, and so I truly commend the original artist for his work. \\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle beyond this is lacking, however. The backgrounds have very little to no flair in how they\u2019re designed, being little more than average photorealism. They\u2019re crafted in such a way that mimics real life, and are actually somewhat appealing visually. But the problem is that it conflicts with the more cartoony designs of the characters, thus resulting in a fairly lackluster presentation. Particularly, the city which Saitama resides in is a rather dull and boring sprawl of grey hues. With how much flair is put into the character designs and action sequences, this area sorely lacks creativity or vibrance, and comes off as a lazy choice on part of the producers. Other shows like Space Dandy and Gurren Lagann are wacky in roughly the same vein as One Punch Man, and manage to have a far more polished visual presentation with backgrounds that fall in line with the proper visual style, and at certain times looking far better than One Punch Man ever manages. Even Boku no Hero Academia, a show with notably more similarities to One Punch Man in concept, displays some creativity and polish by giving its backgrounds a comic-book feel to them. With how tonally consistent these shows are, I don\u2019t see much reason for One Punch Man not to conform to this approach. It gives me the impression that the team over at Madhouse put a strict focus on how to make the character models and animations dazzling, and just ended it there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so with all of this said, One Punch Man may not evoke anything particularly meaningful throughout its runtime. And it certainly falls short of being a parody as mentioned earlier. However, the one major question regarding One Punch Man in spite of all this would be: is it worth watching? As far as I\u2019m concerned, the answer is yes. The humor, likeable characters, and exhilarating action sequences are sure to keep viewers satisfied, and at the very least makes One Punch Man ultimately an entertaining and worthwhile experience. It has steps forward and steps back, but the overall product is a success in my eyes and is feel-good watch that I would warmly recommend to many.",

If you're looking for an action packed, thrilling anime to watch, I can assure you that this isn't what you're looking for. Every episode feels like a repeat of the last as each follows the same predictable formula. The protagonist Saitama is no doubt the biggest mistake in the show. He is portrayed as emotionless and nonchalant making it hard for the audience to connect with. Compared to the other characters in the show, he is lacking especially in terms of character development.\r\nOverall, One Punch Man is a great watch ifyou're looking for something action packed and thrilling. Character progression, exciting battles, an energizing protagonist, it has it all. A very decent watch.",

            "content": "The anime series One Punch Man may be considered one of the most successful shows in terms of popularity and rating around the year. It\u2019s one of the shows that has a lot of praise through the manga readers and its anime fans for a lot of reasons. It\u2019s one of those shows that could also become one of the favorites of the year (which is nothing bad to be quite honest) and I get the hype about the series around from different people, in fact I talked to too many and they explained why they enjoy the series and love it. However there comesat times where I question through myself if I like it or not, and to explain why I had some tiny issues with the show to say the least without going through the whole misunderstanding that I am calling the show shit or garbage. I\u2019m not going to go through something like that like other people, in fact the show does a good job with its own ideas and its original plot, but this would come as a personal perspective.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I start my review keep in mind that this would be based on my personal opinion regarding on One Punch Man (the anime), so I will for one not compare it with the manga series and will just talk about the anime in general, and the second thing and a warning is that if you do not like the reasons or you want to understand more about my reasonings you are free to talk to me around my profile or account, any comments are welcome about the show regardless if it\u2019s a good or bad one.\\n\\n\r\nThe extra warning is that I may spoil somethings in the anime to defend my statements in the review so keep in mind this review would have tiny spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way I will go and start the review of One Punch Man.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story focus around our main protagonist Saitama, who in other words is known as \u201cOne Punch Man\u201d because the guy goes to one hit K.O towards the villains he faces against. He himself is searching for a worthy opponent that could endure his strength in this case.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly the plot is simple enough for someone to get, so don\u2019t worry there\u2019s no too deep for you type of stuff in this case and I\u2019m really aware it\u2019s not supposed to be a depth series (on the anime standard). This series is made for the sake of being fun and entertaining and that\u2019s what the series is supposed to be established in the first place so I personally think it\u2019s not striving to be something convoluted in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nThe main idea or focus is the hero, in which heroes are people that protect the city or the world from the evil villains regardless whether their lives are in danger or not. What One Punch Man does greatly within this idea is to focus on the supporting characters or the heroes within certain situations of the series or in each said arc later on in the episodes, which gives a different perspective idea and a balance between them and Saitama\u2019s perspective as well. Which is a nice balanced idea except for one of the episodes being more focused on the other heroes, which makes it in my opinion a nice idea to make it more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing the show does nicely would be that it doesn\u2019t drag itself too much to get into the main things (for the meaning the villain arcs) since it does build up in a way the progression between Saitama and Genos as becoming heroes in the association by going through training, and also by going through the main test, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also doesn\u2019t seem to be dragged out too much with the comedy either as it then adds some different ideas in order to not make the enjoyment factor of the show lose its spark. Example being when Puri Puri Prisoner went to the ultimate Hulk mode and then by accident he broke the sweater his boyfriend made (which I laughed so much on that by the way) and When Tornado was of course battling against the giant dinosaur and the conversation was in my opinion funny. The show does a nice job at not making me and the viewers bored in a way. \\n\\n\r\nThe way the show executes the plot is something that the show does good at, it doesn\u2019t go to a complete clich\u00e9 route and it does in cooperate things that I personally would find it rather interesting. It doesn\u2019t really go and give ya a headshot either or anything, and the show is well mixed with everything it delivered.\\n\\n\r\nHowever I do have to say there is an issue to come in hand with the series, and this comes depending on the person viewing the show. My only problem would be the first 3 episodes, while the 3 episodes were just introductions I would say I found it really hard to get into in the anime series, and this is just for me. I think some people would have the same problem to get into the show however I think that just depends on what the person is looking for. The 3 episodes wouldn\u2019t be one of the best but it wouldn\u2019t be one of the worst either, it does establish the show itself at least. It\u2019s just for me that I found it hard to get into the anime, but as the episodes passed by I got into it more. So this all depends on you to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story is one of the few strong points of the show and it does a nice job with what it establishes and adds upon. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis is another part the show shines, however it may be one of the weakest components in my personal opinion due to some few reasons, but let\u2019s start with the good parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole cast of characters are composed of different personality traits, which people for my personal eye would at least like one of them since the show does also give a time to shine in order to know them a bit better, and the main cast being focused a lot of times except for one.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist Saitama, this would all depend on the personal eye, but at first I really didn\u2019t liked the character because I personally found him as an empty egg shell. However as the episodes passed by he does show some personality during the villain arcs, as the show also puts him in situations where the characters would develop later on. Example being Mumen Rider.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Mumen Rider I would say he\u2019s one of the nicest characters in the series, and it\u2019s not because he looks cute or anything. He is the prime example of a character even without powers, he\u2019s determined to protect the people in the city regardless of what happens to him. His determination in one of the episodes displays him that way and I love how the anime handled him.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with other characters example being Genos, and about him I would say he\u2019s not one of the best characters in the show, however he does show his actual strength through the series and he also develops and tries to become stronger in order to save people, regardless. Thanks to Saitama of course.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end Sonic being one of the most ridiculously enjoyable characters, I would say this guy/girl (I don\u2019t even fucking know, someone please kill me) I found him quite ridiculous in some way because of how his personality is one of the type of personalities I like in anime characters, not to mention he was voiced by one of my favorite voice actors (BIASED I know).\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty the main cast were nicely developed in a way however, my only issue would be the supporting characters or other heroes in the anime. While they are focused around the villain arcs I somehow felt like they need more time to be shown and have a little bit of development for them and spotlight more (exception of a few) and I kind of felt empty and shallow on most except for a few cast of characters. So that just comes for my eyes. I felt like they were just shadows and just needed more time. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re bad characters at all, they\u2019re just not that great either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this might be the weakest point of the show in my personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the best things One Punch Man has to offer when it comes to its fight scenes (with a few issues that are minor with it) considering the anime nails at the animation department at most. It doesn\u2019t look very choppy and it does an amazing job thanks to the Key Animators behind the show. It does a nice job at the right moment to add their best guns at one of the bigger fights (example being the Boros vs Saitama fight which that was one of the best animation fights I have seen in my opinion and enjoyed throughout the year). The fights looks dynamic and nicely choreographed, adding some spark with sugar to give some effect (this is just a metaphor but you get what I mean). The animators also do a nice job with the details they give through the series and does not feel dragged out for the most part at least, I guess to say the least they know who to take which fight to make it look well without feeling extremely choppy. \\n\\n\r\nThe staff knows how to nail the parts and because of the budget being the average budget they use also their talent and their own skills in order for the series look iconic and fluid, dynamic and entertaining. So it\u2019s not on the level of Unlimited Blade Works to say the least where in Unlimited Blade Works it had a lot of budget for great animation, but One Punch Man excels with the direction they took for the series at least for my personal perspective.\\n\\n\r\nThe production quality or the art style isn\u2019t really one of the best out there in terms of medium, but it does a nice job in terms of not making it either stale or just plain or too how to basic either. Simple enough this is one of the weak part about the curriculum however it doesn\u2019t make it bad overall.\\n\\n\r\nFor the character designs they look well done and the designs don\u2019t look either derpy or anything like that, or anything worse. I will give the show some credit for that as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the art department and production quality of the show is quite passable and good enough while the animation is the strongest nailing point of the show, with little minor inconsistencies (and I will point out the issue here with which inconsistency)\\n\\n\r\nI will say this is personal, but I personally did not liked the punches animation (example the one from the Giant in Episode 1) that looked too inconsistent and choppy for my eyes. Not to mention it looked ugly, no offense just being honest, but that's the only issue I would have here.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound/Voice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nThe final curriculum in the anime is the music and sound, along with the voice acting department, which would go either way in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor the music department I will say the soundtrack does a nice job to give a dynamic mode in the scenarios of the anime, which does even a nice job with its soundtrack giving an upbeat techno move, and sometimes even rock music compositions. I also found the idea of the final episode adding the full Opening song in the fight quite nicely and fitting with the rhythm of the soundtrack. However I do have to say the soundtrack as a standalone wouldn\u2019t be THAT noticeable to say, but it\u2019s nothing like the soundtrack is generic since it does give an iconic feeling and an entertainment value during the action scenes. \\n\\n\r\nFor the sound department the anime does a nice job with its effects without feeling like it sounded like a fart at least. It gives a more realistic approach on that department which would make me wanna go like an idiot for wanting to see it again and again. Even the explosions are like a KABOOM. You get me here.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting department does a nice job in that department as well. All voice actors did a nice job with their respective roles and as well with their personalities despite being a bit lacky due to the screentime. I will give the show props on that.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Opening and the Ending song I will say these things.\\n\\n\r\nFor the Opening being from JAM PROJECT (the same people who composed the Opening of Garo Series and Mazinkaiser OP) I might have to say the song didn\u2019t got into me at first but then I liked it afterwards. I will give credits towards the Opening since for me I find it very very catchy and preferable I will say, until today I listened to it 100 times after the full version. \\n\\n\r\nFor the Ending song\u2026 I really don\u2019t know. I found it pretty melancholic and slow, which I don\u2019t like that type of songs but its typical to have an ED like that, It\u2019s quite forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Personal Enjoyment/Overview:  \\n\\n\r\nNow this will go towards my personal approach towards the show and how much I liked it, so prepare for this section to be quite long at least.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated in my previous curriculum, I will say that I got into a struggle into getting in the anime series for the first couple of episodes, mainly because I personally did not find them quite as entertaining as I thought even though I did stated it establishes the show in a way. For me it was hard to get into the series and as the episodes passed by I quite started to like it more and more than before, and in the end I love it towards a degree.\\n\\n\r\nI also had a personal issue with the fans of the series as if the hype kind of affects a bit of the perspective of the anime. Now I\u2019m not saying that the fanbase overall are bad, but seeing people saying like \u201cOne Punch Man is Anime of the Year\u201d and them going on the dickriding squad it\u2019s quite ridiculous and for me it feels quite uneasy. I can see why they say it but just for me, I will just say I have a different anime of the year, even of the season.\\n\\n\r\nAnd my later on little problem is that outside of the series I will say some few people I have met or known have always put the opinions of others that  not give the show a 10 are the pinnacle of anime members or to say giving One Punch Man a less than an 8 is a sin. Although that's just the way people perceive the series, that's not a bad thing. Each person has a different opinion on the show and I will totally doubt people will have a different thought at hand, it's easy. I doubt or may assume this series would turn into a spazzing controversy or I may be wrong, may be. But that's how I perceived it.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the show not being #1 of my favorites I will just say it was fun and entertaining from the start (a little enjoyment) until the end (where I enjoyed a lot). The show can be considered as a series to enjoy and have a nice time without worrying too much.\\n\\n\r\nIn the overall review in the end, One Punch Man delivered new things on the table for the season and probably the year, and may become recognized as one of the more favorites from everyone, and one of the series that executes the plot well, the art and animation greatly despite being average budget, iconic and dynamic soundtrack while the characters falls short a bit due to my statements above. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the question remaining from the anime community:\\n\\n\r\nDid \"One Punch Man\" saved anime? To leave that into my answer... it's well, 50-50. At one hand if its really about the sales of the industry then sure, maybe. However on the other hand for me anime did not need saving in terms of seasonals and year of 2015, for me it's ridiculous. But that comes to my words at hand. That's all. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch the series I would totally recommend One Punch Man.",

            "content": "And now presenting; Puddin\u2019s First Review! \r\nI know a little something about superheroes, ladies and gents, and I know a little something about comedy. One Punch Man gets a looooot of love for, apparently, \u201cdoing both of these things so well,\u201d so obviously a natural Joker like moi, was obviously going to be drawn to this after having read all of Les Mis in one sitting and had a craving for something a bit less heavy handed. Something that could make me laugh that isn\u2019t my own jokes for once, you know? \r\nBut this, this is NOT what I expected, nor what I consider a\u201cPioneer of Parody.\u201d Folks, telling the same joke more than once, let alone OVER and OVER again kills it. KILLS IT. It takes a crowbar right to the gut and yanks, gnashes, tears it to shreds, until there is nothing more but a pile of viscera and doggy dinner scraps sopping wet in cold, ripe blood. Does that sound very appetizing to you? DOES IT? Because to me, The Clown Prince of Crime himself, that sounds deliberately disdainful. In fact, telling a joke more than once is quite similar to explaining the joke. And if you have to explain a joke, then there is no joke!\\n\\n\r\nAnd all of the heroes in this show? RIPOFFS! A man who can defeat anything in one punch, wears a cape, flies around, and is BALD? Excuse me, but you seem to have mish-mashed good ol\u2019 Lexy and Supes into some horrid catastrophe of a character, and labeled him some contrived \u201cHero\u201d wearing something only that total HACK Ronald McDonald would put on willingly. And people think \u201cSatanma\u201d or whatever his Wapanese name may be, is a hero? Must I describe to you what a hero is? I certainly hope not, there seems to be loads of them running around nowadays, you\u2019d know it if you saw it, all it takes is some fraud wearing colorful underwear over their pants and BOOM! You have yourself a hero, listeners, and they don\u2019t even need to have powers. Take Bat Brain and his boy-toy sidekicks of his. \\n\\n\r\nAnd what just really hurts me inside is that they didn\u2019t even have the decency to rip him off like all the rest- the best we get is Green Tornado, Asian Cyborg, and Katana wannabe. If that type of damn near PLAGIARISM is allowed to go on further, I swear upon my mother's grave that Madhouse Studio will have earned itself a place on my hit-list, and finally live up to its name\u2026 literally! Have you seen what I can do with some paint and a little patience? I\u2019ve transformed whole museums into art houses truly worth experiencing, how hard can a little cartoon company be?\\n\\n\r\nAnd don\u2019t give me all of that guff about \u201cthe animation,\u201d kiddo, because I could care less. In a down to earth sense, what matters here ain\u2019t the look, as I\u2019ve learned throughout my days, it\u2019s the substance behind the appearance. There\u2019sa aint\u2019sa no substance\u2019s here to be found but a poorly written aneem, partner. \\n\\n\r\nSo in short, avoid this like the plague. It neither makes you laugh nor accurately portrays all of those superpowered boners dicking around in tights. If you want superheroes, well then, put on a cape and a mask and hope I don\u2019t kill your whole family. If you\u2019re in the mood for a real laugh, go watch \u201cA Serbian Film\u201d or \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d Either one works!",

            "content": "One punch man is an okay show, okay in today's anime industry means it is a normal man standing in the middle of a group of retards. But the hype is way too much for OPM, cause the anime adaptation does not deserve it beyond the flashy visuals.\r\nI seen all versions of OPM from the doodles by ONE, to the flashy version by Murata, to the current anime version. And the humor value decrease with each version.\r\nONE realized he is making a joke, so the art style that looks like scribbles was part of the joke, it was not meant to be taken that serious.Yes there are serious part, but  the focus was comedy.\\n\\n\r\nMurata on the other hand, took it too serious and while the action greatly improve in action, the humor associated with the original art style were gone.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the anime, it took it way too seriously. For example, the mosquito scene, in the original and Murata version it should be a slap on Saitama's face when he claimed he is invincible and emotionally dead when he got agitated by such a small thing. But the anime completely missed that context. And things like Genos background, in the manga was a wall of text in a panel that nobody reads, but the anime have it so long that the joke fall flat, you can't make fun of a concept and play it straight.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact the entire problem of the anime adaptation can be summed up in one phrase, \"it is too long\". Depressingly it is not something they could fix, you see OPM is one of those shows that suffer the adaptation time distortion disease, the two versions of the manga allows you to read through them very fast so the \"one-punch joke\" doesn't grow stale and you appreciate the characters more. But the for the anime version it is way too long for too little payoff.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, there really isn't much, it is all episodic, so the comedy and action are the story of the anime. The characters are more about making use and fun of various tropes, there are some depth to characters like mumen rider and saitama, but it is mostly flat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you like flashy actions, you would like it. But if you are here for the comedy, read Murata or ONE's manga. OPM anime is one joke stretched too long that caused it to rip it self in two, terrible shame.",

            "content": "Now that I have got your attention via my ratings (even when I know many will insta dislike my review), read the last paragraph at least. lol\r\nDo try and read through this fully..\r\n:p \r\nOne Punch Man, saviour of anime or just a creator of an idiotic fanbase?\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSo its over, the most anticipated anime of fall 2015. An anime which generated so much fanbase that it routinely got subreddits of the day and had a subtopic created in meme pages. But as experience teaches us, popularity does not automatically convert to quality but we also cant deny if we act as hipsters and start dishing outbad reviews just because they are popular, it makes us look like the fools. So where does One Punch Man stand really?\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all the manga deals in a lot of themes, there are gags, there are subtle references to society, there are fights and there is \"man of steel\" esque destruction. It is a shounen action at heart and never tries to be something else. you will find over the top action, lots of dialogues in fights, lots of punches and kicks thrown, yeah, until the protagonist comes in.\\n\\n\r\nYeah One Punch Man is about this, it just shows the futility of the powerup times in dragonballz, the \"deep philosophical talk\" in between fights and even takes a jab on people talking in space. It is telling you, \"look there are so many tropes in shounens, but you know what at the end of the day its all about one finishing move, one punch\" and to do so they created an insaney op hero as a jab to all the OP badasses out there, and then giving a hilarious backstory of how he got his power. Which serves twofold, naive watchers and kids might try to follow his regimen and get fitter(of course some adult discussion is necessary so that the kid doesnt overwork himself), and this has actually happened in japan and secondly more seasoned watchers can understand this as a parody of all the various training regimes in different shounens.\\n\\n\r\nHowever as you can already imagine, you know from beforehand how each fight will end, you know whatever be the opponent he is going to kill him by one punch, and that no matter how you look at it will reduce the thrill of the anime. But the anime intends to be that. Its almost as if it is telling you \"I am not you standard shounen with great fistfights, so if you expect sudden twists, you better drop me, I aint for you\". But then inspite of this the anime hooks a large section of the watchers, even watchers which are calling this one a shit anime. Why is that? it is because \"one punch Man\" isnt about One Punch Man, it isnt about Saitama killing villains, its not how whether he can recreate a big bang with his punch, its about something else. but to show that something else the author needed to put the obvious storyline in the way he did, and at the end, that cannot count as positive, even when I understand what his intention was.\\n\\n\r\nOne punch Man is about Saitama getting recognition he deserves, you root for him, want him to show the others how good he is , but then suddenly you find someone else to root for, a hero with no powers, trying his hardest, because \"its not about winning and losing its about whether you stand up to somebody\", and OPM delivered this to perfection in 1 line better than any other shounens have done in 200 episodes. And as more and more heroes get introduced, starting from the tsundere loli to the ninja and the martial artist, you tend to harbour some affectionate feeling for some of them as well(the names are sometimes hilarious as well Puri puri prisoner) and hate when they dont recognize saitama. this anime makes you either love/hate the characters, and unless its indifference thats pretty much a job well done for an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then in the final episode, MADhouse delivered one of its finest animation masterpieces. It elevated the manga by linking some stuff with the very first episode itself, created such fluidity in animation without much CGs that ufotable will be proud of them and used the correct soundtracks at the correct moment to create an epic final battle, a battle which lasted more than one punch. It is very rare for the anime transition from manga to be so brilliant even during the gags, but this last episode exceeded all expectations. When I read the manga , because the story wasnt that interesting(already said why), I wasnt really sure about the anime, but based MADhouse took that and created an anime which will rank among its best animated works for years to come(yeah you can fuck off hipsters, I have seen people saying the animation was bad trust me, either they are idiots or dont know English).\\n\\n\r\nOh yes one last thing, episode 12 actually makes you feel for the hero and villain both, in a way very different from any other anime out there.And the scrnshot you will find everywhere is actually a great depiction of how it is very lonely at the top. One came searching for a fight of a lifetime and got it, while the other at least had some enjoyment but still couldnot use his full potential. The last gag after credits was genius as well.\\n\\n\r\nBut as with all half decent anime, the problem was a cancerous fanbase which increased exponentially given the nature of the anime. the anime was fun, there were fights and OP characters with great animation and blood pumping music. Goku and Superman vs Saiatama posts flooded the groups and memes flooded the pages which resulted in antagonism towards the anime by a certain section. But is a cancerous fanbase the right parameter to judge how good an anime is? because then you are judging an anime not by the anime itself buy by the people who watch it, which is preposterous. I urge all the people to ignore all the OPM posts and judge the anime just as itself without the fanbase and you will see that even if it has created such a fanbase, it is still a damn good shounen, which makes you feel without melodrama and gets your blood pumping without shouting for one episode.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end what is the answer to my original question. Saviour of anime? No. \"Just a creator of cancerous fanbase? No. this is an anime which made the world look up again. This is an anime which taught the world there are anime beyond DBZ. This is an anime which made the common mass who only watched DBZ look up and see how \"compactly\" an idea can be presented.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime which finally started putting the wheels in motion, so that the world can now move on from Dragonballz and realize even in that genre, even with just fistfights and no psychological battles, you can make a good anime and probably the anime which will inspire many more to actually delve more into the medium as such. And thats why probably it is a \"New Wave\" in the world of anime, even if it is not a saviour.\\n\\n\r\nactual rating- MADHOUSE/10",

            "content": "WORD OF WARNING: MY REVIEW IS ON THE ANIME AND THE ANIME ALONE. I HAVE NOT READ THE MANGA OR THE WEB-COMIC.\r\nI just don't understand the massive hype that surrounds One Punch Man. Everyone around me seems to have nothing but praise for it, whilst I'm sitting here - blankly - trying to figure out what was just so damn innovative about this anime. There was virtually no plot to One Punch Man and there is only so much humour can do to prop up something that doesn't have a leg to stand on.\r\nSpeaking of the humour; it was funny - at first. There wasa wry and satirical element to it that was quite charming. However, it wore thin and One Punch Man ended up feeling like a parody that had become a parody of itself due to the crap script and lack of an actual storyline. This probably has something to do with the fact that the Producers want to milk OPM for many seasons, but a lot of potential plot threads were left untouched and just hanging without any of the characters acknowledging their existence - almost as if those events never happened in the first place. It wasn't exactly frustrating, but moreso boring because OPM began to rely too heavily on a monster-of-the-week format, without hinting at even a semblance of an overarching plot. This meant that once I went to bed, and then woke up, I couldn't really remember what had happened in OPM the night before (and I have a very good memory). \\n\\n\r\nI think that speaks as a fundamental flaw regarding OPM because if it doesn't leave a lasting impression on one's mind how good can it really be, right? \\n\\n\r\nEven Saitama became boring to me mainly because the plot nowhere which meant that his character really didn't have any room to grow as a person. Once he became a member of the Hero Association, whatever development his character was experiencing suddenly stopped. He remained the same nonchalant and deadpan person that he was for the rest of the anime, which was, frankly, rather dull and did nothing to capture one's interest. He just remained flat.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy supporting characters such as Genos, Sonic and Silverfang but it was just really difficult for me to root for Saitama when he was just so unappealing to me - personality wise, that is. (I care little for a characters looks.)\\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note, I thought the animation of OPM was very, very good. The animators did a very good job in capturing Saitama's expressions and I was found it enjoyable watching his fight scenes and seeing him get excited. The OST matched very well to every frame, as well, though I sometimes found the electric guitar riffs a bit annoying. The closing theme was very beautiful too.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, despite my complaints regarding OPM it didn't bore me enough to force me to watch it and I did end up finishing it. I guess there was some sort of a charm to it, though it was significantly dulled by the end and I can't guarantee that I'll return for season 2.",

            "content": "I have those friends who only watch superhero anime, and those who are obsessed with the superhero genre. They watch many western cartoons, and shows such as Dragon Ball Z, in which you see the common pattern of the main character being overpowered. Most often, they begin as an average person, who one day, discovers their power, or wants to protect their city, etc. I tend to see that the protagonist meets the antagonist, who is at that point stronger than them. Many villains later, the protagonist meets the primary antagonist, and attempts to stop them. At first the protagonist looks near defeat, but something,such as the power of friendship, or determination, gives the protagonist the sudden strength required to defeat the antagonist. The fact that this pattern is repeated so often is annoying for me, and I feel that it's hard to sympathise with characters, when the plot armour is so evident. That's why I love One Punch Man, so immensely. It parodies the whole superhero genre, with it's light attitude.\\n\\n\r\nIn the fictional Japanese metropolis of City Z, we follow the story of Saitama, an overpowered hero, who only fights for fun. As represented by his name he can defeat anything in one punch, but this bores Saitama, so he infinitely searches for a worthy opponent. He meets people such as Genos, who is a robot, who represents one of your stereotypical heroes, searching for strength, and becoming Saitama's disciple. Saitama searches for recognition, for his heroic acts, but doesn't receive much attention, as people believe he's a counterfeit hero. This is what makes the viewer feel sorry for Saitama, as we venture through each episode, hoping his struggle will end.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tells us how a hero is  not all it seems to be, and everyone's motivation may vary. Many other characters are introduced later on, and the interaction between characters, brings humour, I haven't seen in other anime for a long time. The art and sound is amazing, despite the fact, the development team, received an average budget. This anime is outstanding, and people who hate the genre, can even come to love it. It's not shy of shocking you, and I'd say it's a must watch for any anime fans.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI thank my father every day for strong hair genes.\r\nMany of the men in my family, especially my father\u2019s brothers (my uncles), have lost their hair quite early on. But not my father. He\u2019s beginning to get streaks of grey, but it\u2019s still (almost) all there.\r\nI myself like to keep my hair short \u2013 \u201cfive on top, two on the sides\u201d or some such hairdo lingo \u2013 but I also only get a haircut once every five months or so. It doesn\u2019t get long, but it gets messy. Messy enough for my father to nicknameme \u201cShaggy.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI wait so long mostly out of laziness and partially to relish in my genetics. Saitama of One Punch Man does not have the same luxury, but what he does have is an anime that, like a fist hitting a face, leaves its mark.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nAs was said, One Punch Man stars Saitama, a man who can take out any foe with just a single punch. After \u201crecruiting\u201d his \u201capprentice\u201d Genos, the flame-wielding cyborg, the anime proceeds to make due on the title\u2019s promise.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically speaking, One Punch Man is a comedy. That means lots of jokes and gaffs are had. But that doesn\u2019t do the narrative justice. Hidden behind Saitama\u2019s huge head rests some rather clever writing.\\n\\n\r\nTo see this cleverness, it\u2019s best to start from a surface level and work upwards.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, the anime is about an unbelievably powerful hero. He takes down giants, flies around the city, and crushes mosquito monsters with simply a slap. Standard stuff for a superhero anime.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, One Punch Man gets interesting. Instead of just being about an unbelievably powerful hero, it\u2019s about an unbelievably powerful hero who has become so strong that he is bored with it all. Literally nobody can match him. As such, he cares more about getting to a supermarket sale than he does facing the behemoth before him.\\n\\n\r\nThen the anime really starts to shine. Now it\u2019s about an unbelievably powerful hero who has become bored with his profession and goes unnoticed. Due to his first-unregistered-then-Class-C rank, his actions are often credited to other heroes nearby. Other times, nobody even sees what he does to save them all \u2013 the final fight against Lord Boros, despite involving the moon and the separation of the atmosphere, silently drifts away like hair from a balding head.\\n\\n\r\nDespite reaching this height, One Punch Man takes its narrative up one more level. When everything comes together, it\u2019s about an unbelievably powerful hero who has become bored with his profession, gone unnoticed, and has adopted a self-imposed, anti-hero persona.\\n\\n\r\nRather than denying the claims of society deeming him a cheat or giving into their taunts or trying to convince people of his impossible strength, he pretends. He pretends to be the \u201cbad guy.\u201d By lying, he supports the other heroes and maintains society\u2019s morale for the system in place.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s the cleverness of One Punch Man: It\u2019s not a zero-to-hero tale but a \u201chero-to-zero\u201d one. Obviously Saitama\u2019s not an actual zero \u2013 he is literally the strongest man in the universe, and his \u201cevil\u201d persona is used for positive purposes. But the structure of the narrative makes it appear this way. It builds and builds and builds away from the comedy-oriented side to the more dramatic, realistic side the more the anime twists that clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nThe big question, of course, is why? Well, the answer to this question comes from the answer to an age-old question: What makes a hero, a hero? Sacrificing one\u2019s self for the greater good, doing what is \u201cright\u201d over what is right, and so on. In other words, being a hero is more than just the power, the speed, and the abilities.\\n\\n\r\nAnd One Punch Man shows this answer through reversing the clich\u00e9. Saitama can defeat anybody with a single punch. But what makes him a hero is his willingness to carry every single negative that comes from him being, well, unbelievably powerful.\\n\\n\r\nStepping down from these thematic heights and back to that surface level, One Punch Man sees highs and lows in its comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOn the high end, the anime does well with small or witty jokes, like when Saitama misinterprets a sentence as a homosexual advance or when he responds with a monotone \u201cOK.\u201d On the low end, some jokes can carry on for a bit too long \u2013 Genos providing his background and Saitama explaining the \u201csecret\u201d to his power come to mind.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the narrative itself does have a few negatives worth noting. Some of the dramatic moments, such as the guy who calls out Saitama after he defeats Deep Sea King or the two (younger) tank-top brothers trying to humiliate him, fall flat due to their overt nature.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, the narrative earns points for the way it ends. The final fight between Saitama and Lord Boros sees Saitama winning. The fight is (obviously) cool, but it is Lord Boros\u2019s words to Saitama that are the coolest.\\n\\n\r\nTheir exchange indicates an intriguing detail: Lord Boros was still too weak of an enemy for Saitama. The anime could\u2019ve made the two men equally matched (and, to be fair, the battle made it appear that way for a time). Yet, after an entire season of indestructible enemies, topping off with this literal conqueror of the universe, the anime says that Saitama\u2019s full power has still yet to be matched.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the narrative is smart, funny, and cool. Not perfect, but executed nicely nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nIt almost does not need to be said; One Punch Man excels at actual animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights alone are enough to make this obvious. Huge explosions, choreographed sequences, and detailed abilities dance across the screen in a flurry of movement. But if that weren\u2019t enough, downtime fills itself with fluid scenes, like when Saitama taps Genos on the head after taking their tiny skirmish seriously or when Saitama tries to get exact change out of his coin purse.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while the various backgrounds are not that impressive \u2013 a dilapidated city, the inside of a dojo, etc. \u2013 the artistic direction nails it elsewhere. Fights take on many forms, from spanning entire canyons to including slow-motion segments, that increase intensity. Saitama switching between super relaxed and super serious boosts the comedy. And both the lighting and perspective are played with over the course of the season.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character designs, both the heroes and the villains hold some combination of detailed, interesting, and fitting. There are too many designs to go through, but examples always help. Saitama\u2019s unassuming garb fits both his laidback nature and hidden powers. Lord Boros\u2019s singular eye, spikey hair, and golden armor turn him into the universe-wrecking ruler that he is. And the Deep Sea King, with his regal, jester look and his larger, aquatic look, make for quite the intimidating antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of One Punch Man is not the best in the world, but they are by no means horrible. They simply rest somewhere in-between.\\n\\n\r\nSaitama is the obvious person to start with. While he never officially gets nicknamed \u201cOne Punch Man\u201d in the anime, that really is what he does. No matter who or what, he can defeat his enemy with a singular punch.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not dumb, Saitama is not the smartest dude out there. He has difficulty remembering or recognizing people, he failed the written portion of the hero-registration exam, and he walks through life with impressive nonchalance. This last detail helps to make his actions comedic or dramatic when required. Comedy with his hidden technique \u201cConsecutive Normal Punches\u201d and drama when he decides to take the situation a little more seriously.\\n\\n\r\nSaitama was not always the strongest entity in existence, though. He had humble beginnings; he wanted to be a superhero and not a businessman. So he trained and fought and won. Only to find that he trained and fought and won too much. So much so that being a hero had lost its charm after three short years.\\n\\n\r\nThis lost charm does not affect his fighting prowess. Far from it. In fact, it may have helped since his carefree attitude tends to give him an element of surprise against his foes. Nevertheless, it makes him question what he has given up personally to get to this point. Sadly, this question never truly gets explored.\\n\\n\r\nWhat defines Saitama, however, is not his powerfulness or his silliness \u2013 it\u2019s his willingness. His willingness to be the hero he needs for everyone else, sacrificing fame, pride, and glory in the process. That is, he becomes the \u201cbad guy\u201d not because he wants to but because he should. That turns Saitama from just a strong hero and into a strong person.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Saitama comes Genos. Genos joins the fray early on, quickly flocking to Saitama\u2019s side when he witnesses his immeasurable strength. His character serves two purposes: to remind and to support. He reminds the audience of Saitama\u2019s power, acting as a reference given his Class-S distinction. And he supports Saitama by not just looking up to him as a mentor but also being a close friend.\\n\\n\r\nGenos also has a peculiar backstory, a motive that drives him forward besides learning the secret to Saitama\u2019s strength. In the past, a fellow robot-related enemy wronged him, and, ever since, he has been seeking to return the favor. Unfortunately, the anime puts this conflict in the back of its mind for a vast majority of the season, resurfacing only briefly near the end.\\n\\n\r\nThree other characters are worth discussing: Amai Mask, Sonic, and Mumen Rider.\\n\\n\r\nAmai Mask is a side character that first introduces himself to Genos following the hero registration exams. Strangely, he focuses most on the image that heroes inadvertently give off. He visits talk-shows, he complains about the failures of the higher-ranked heroes, and so on. However, his most interesting contribution to his cause stems from his refusal to move up in the ranks when he apparently can. The reason? He can weed out or prevent weaker heroes from ascending to the top tier, thereby maintaining a more polished image of heroes in general.\\n\\n\r\nSonic is also a side character, but he\u2019s not around all that much. Not just because of his smaller status or even his speed, but because the anime did not have a place for him within the narrative. Regardless, he reveals a darker side to heroes, a more morally ambiguous one: Not all heroes want to be good. Sonic is not obligated to aid others just because he has super-sonic speed, and him caring more about proving his power (be it for money, himself, or any other \u201csinful\u201d reason) proves this.\\n\\n\r\nMumen Rider is yet another side character, but he\u2019s on the opposite end of the Class-system spectrum. As the number one Class-C hero, the people expect him to help but not a level comparable to the other, stronger heroes. He demonstrates this himself: He loses to lesser villains, he doesn\u2019t have any special abilities, and he rides around on a bicycle.\\n\\n\r\nMore importantly, he knows this, too. He does not move to Class B because he understands his limitations as a hero. That\u2019s what makes his stand against Deep Sea King so noteworthy. There\u2019s powerful symbolism in him getting off his bike and standing up for himself, but it\u2019s him trying and failing \u2013 highlighting that, like people, even heroes have limits \u2013 that means the most.\\n\\n\r\nNow, none of these five develop over the course of the season, but that may arguably be the point. I.e., as heroes do, they each have a role to serve. Saitama sacrifices, Genos supports, Amai Mask prevents, Sonic proves, and Mumen Rider highlights. To be fair, they perform their roles well. Even so, such a theme does not get explored to any high degree.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s the extent of One Punch Man\u2019s characters. More exist, such as the evil scientist, Lord Boros, and the myriad of other heroes, but they are not looked at enough or not around long enough to be considered important to the story at hand.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man\u2019s opening track designed itself to get its audience pumped up for the coming attractions, and it accomplished that goal handily enough. Each part of the piece comes together: the hard rock, the changing pace for the lyrics and tempo, and that final, stellar note sung by the singer. It\u2019s an awesome OP that is both fitting and fun to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track realizes that the OP and the anime itself may saturate the audience with adrenaline, so it chooses to go down the contrasting route. The ED is soft, starting and ending in a gentle manner while the middle gets filled with dainty tunes and instruments. In other words, the ED is meant to calm the audience down, and it works. (The OP is still better, though.)\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the music and sound-effects hit their mark as well. The OST contains, like the OP and ED, both sides: hard-and-heavy plus techno tracks for the battle sequences, and laid-back plus sadder tracks for those more grounded moments. Furthermore, One Punch Man includes many different sound-effects for punching, telekinesis, lasers, swords, explosions\u2026. Too many to list \u2013 which is certainly a positive. And as a small, extra treat, the tiny guitar riff between the A and B parts of each episode added even more coolness to the overall package.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, while no impressive performances are found, a couple of people deserve a shout-out. Makoto Furukawa as Saitama sits on top, bringing to life the all-powerful, happy-go-lucky hero. And Aoi Yuuki as Tatsumaki \u201cTerrible Tornado\u201d annoys everybody without grating the audience\u2019s nerves. Everyone else voiced their parts nicely but not notably.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say I adored this one, but I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the obvious reasons was Saitama. One second he has that dopey look on his face, and then the next second he exudes extreme focus. This constant dichotomy of nonchalance and seriousness, like when he says he has \u201cnothing to do\u201d so he tags along to the Class-S meeting or when punches the praying-mantis monster\u2019s head off while asking him to pay for his ceiling, made me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also had other funny jokes. Sonic lightly getting tapped in the junk by Saitama caused the anime to go to a short \u201cintermission\u201d and made me chuckle out loud. Or people thinking that some evil monster lived in Saitama\u2019s part of the city when it was actually all his (accidental) fault got a nod out of me for its cleverness.\\n\\n\r\nThinking about the characters more, one of my favorites was Tornado. She did nothing else but whine and complain, yet she was hilarious whenever she happened to be doing so. Especially because the anime changed her design from a normal one to a goofy one whenever she took her rants a bit too far.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the battles, I was actually not all that into any of the fights. The final fight was at least cool because Saitama finally did more than usual \u2013 which is why I am most partial to the tiny skirmish between Saitama and Genos. Even then, just the last thirty seconds of it. Saitama chooses to listen to Genos\u2019s rules for the fight, and death follows. Okay, not quite, but the single-worded frame and Saitama\u2019s ginormous fist made that conclusion imminent.\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man has, similar to Saitama, a lot of strength. An interesting theme for its narrative, awesome animation, and hardcore music coalesce to bring about quite the intriguing show. Some problems exist \u2013 a lack of depth to the characters, comedy troubles, etc. \u2013 but they do not fully ruin the experience. Genetically speaking, the anime won a small lottery.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, faux hero-to-zero theme creates a strong structure that is hurt slightly by some mistimed comedy and overt sequences\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, awesome actual animation, cool artistic direction, and nice character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Saitama, Genos, and a few others serve their roles well but lack further depth or development\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, great OP, good ED, nice OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, a nice amount of laughs and some cool moments\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "First time writing a review for an animation on this site, so the varied categories are helpful for being more precise with what you like about a show, but in a way that only makes the digression of assigning a number to something all the more difficult, especially for someone with such a limited experience of anime like me.\r\nSo I'll leave it at a 6, which for me really means a 3/5, I like that scale better. The show was fine enough, not as funny as I thought it was going to be. Thinking back on it, the only part I can remember enjoying andlaughing was Saitama going off at the Hero training test and the switch from the normal artstyle to the intense artstyle. But beyond that there wasn't anything touching about the show, not even the idea of Saitama feeling depression from it all.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end I can only think of the show as mildly interesting. It's almost like the opposite of Mob Psycho 100 for me. Mob was a show that kind of got me back into the fun feeling of shonen anime like watching Naruto when I was younger, but once the anime was done I had no real desire to watch any more of it. Now with One Punch Man, I didn't enjoy it that much-just wanted to get through it quickly-but now would like to even go read the later issues. Everyone new by the end of the anime that there is nothing left for Saitama to really do, and now we only have certain plot threads to go through with the other heroes bickering with each other. If that's where the writer wants to really go with it, then I'll read it, because right now that sounds kind of interesting, but as for the show, it was perfectly fine and others may find it fun, but I won't be rewatching.",

I mostly hate this anime i enjoyed the first 6 episodes it was kind of funny that the character could one punch anything and kind of funny when saitama freaked out but it got old really quick after 6 episodes I wanted this anime to end. good thing this was only 12 episodes anymore then that  i would of gave it a 4/10. this anime could of been good if it was only 6 episodes but overall is so fucking overrated and enjoyed very little of it.",

            "content": "One Punch Man starts with a brilliant concept, the protagonist isn't on his journey to become the strongest one, the most powerful hero on the planet, the pirate king or whatever; he already has reached the maximum level, defeating all his enemies with a single punch. As a viewer, you won't have to go through all the struggles that a hero might face like in every other typical battle shounen, and this is an incredibly satisfying and enjoyable aspect of the story. Saitama beats everyone. The parody of the shounen genre is refreshing and hilarious at time, Saitama is a passive MC who became ahero for fun, he doesn't have any other standard motivation like protecting everyone, he is just bored. This can result in ridiculous situations, where even the people saved by him find it hard to believe his strength, since he doesn't look like a hero at all. Here you have ulterior satire in the contrast between Saitama and the other heroes, who are painted in a way you understand that their real motives are purely selfish- but they maintain a facade to be acclaimed by the citizen and rise to fame. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple, pretty linear, but unique in a way you haven't seen before. It succeeds mainly as a parody, it never fails to make you laugh and it still can make you reflect at times, like when it tries to be a mirror to society and how the genuinely good people are most of the times surclassed by those who only care about their interests. It has some amazing fight scenes, the animation and production as a whole is incredible (well, it's madhouse), even the music is fitting.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really whats good about the show, Saitama and his disciple Genos are really good people, you come to care about them, and it's almost impossible to dislike them- Genos is loyal, correct guy, a true hero in my opinion. And Saitama is just awesome, ridiculously awesome. He has some amazing talent and doesn't even care about it, his facial expressions are almost idiotic, stylized to maximize his nonchalance. The supporting cast has some huge personalities.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's worth its hype, being 100% enjoyable and entertaining, what i think an anime should aspire to be, and with amazing production. Its only flaw is that by the end of the show, the story still hasn't gone nowhere. Well, not that it is necessary.\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "* CONTAIN MINOR SPOILER*\r\n==============================================\r\nTHE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS ANIME: THE CONCEPT\r\n==============================================\r\nThe good thing about this anime is the concept is different with other superhero anime. Normally, you will watch super villain who smart and very dangerous, and the super hero who want to protect the city at all cost. Normally it is serious. \r\nIn this anime, THE CONCEPT IS FLIPPED upside down\r\nNow, the villain is just a stupid person who want to beat the others and the main character is super strong and can beat the villain into pulp by just one punch. And it is wrapped in comedy-action drama.\r\nThe concept is good.\r\n==============================================\r\nTHE BAD THINGABOUT THIS ANIME: ALL EXCEPT THE CONCEPT\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\\n\r\nI expect this to be a good comedy anime, so I just sit casually, but...\\n\\n\r\n1. First, the comedy is not really funny. In the first episode, There is a child with chin like a butt. I find it is not funny at all. Then, most of every episode there is a naked man. Then the bad guy turns into a stupid person who act cool when winning. \"I sound like a robot to make it cool\". And this joke is repetitive. The same joke is shown over and over.\\n\\n\r\n2. The main characters is a hero for fun. He has no interest at helping people at all. He is so selfish and egoist.\\n\r\nIf there are monsters, he does not care about the others' safety. If others are injured and like dying, he does not care, or sometimes he just asked \"are you alive?\" but nothing more.\\n\r\nHe rarely listens to other people and rarely becomes serious in real life.\\n\r\nHe does not care about others' opinion about himself because at the first place, he is already been by himself alone. He is anti-social and never in this anime he decided to discuss about plan or working together..\\n\\n\r\nThe main character here is not a good character. I bet if Saitama does not have the power, nobody will praise him for his attitude.\\n\r\nThe only good character in this anime is mumen rider. Even though he is weak, he keep trying to help others.\\n\\n\r\n3. No main conflict and no twist.\\n\r\nIn this 12 episodes anime, you will find repetitive episode over and over. \\n\r\nThe difference is there is another new villain.\\n\r\nThere is a little conflict though: \"a hero who do not get appraised\", but actually saitama do not care at all, because at the first place he is anti-social. He did not get any disadvantages at all because of this issue.\\n\r\nThen, no twist. Saitama is still the most powerful character till the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\nSo, here I will give 4 as bad.\\n\r\nIt will be good if you have a different taste of joke than me. \\n\r\nHowever, I prefer joke like \"si juki\" or \"Bowling King\" who can make you laugh hard.\\n",

            "content": "In the past, I've watched several anime series involving humans with superpowers like Dragon Ball Z and Naruto and cartoons about superheroes like Superman, Batman, Spiderman and so much more. Now, this anime series redefines the superhero/superpower genre. \r\nThe review rundown:\r\nStory: One Punch Man's story is about a man named Saitama who is just (oh well) a hero for fun where he takes out every single monster and supervillain, who tries to terrorize the city, in just a single punch hence the name of the series title. Later, a cyborg named Genos appears to search the person responsible for the destruction of his village andlater becomes Saitama's disciple to hone his skills to destroy the culprit. (Ahem, no spoiler please) Anyway, the story is very simple at first but it becomes deeper as it progresses plus there is a lot of laughs, jokes and running gags just like any other anime out there. Every episode has villains which the main characters has to fight just like the rogues gallery from most comic book series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  The characters of the story are diverse plus each character including Saitama himself have different personalities in which the viewers can enjoy watching it. The villains appear every episode brings color to the series itself just like any superhero tv series. Plus, some of the characters are parodies from other anime series (Spoiler Alert!) such as Vaccine Man who looks like Piccolo from Dragon Ball series which can bring memories to older generations.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: The series is animated by Madhouse and the character designs are created by ONE. The animation quality is awesome plus the flashy special effects during fight scenes such as Saitama's punches that bring awesome results. The art shift of the characters that fits their personality which totally fits from the webcomic such as Saitama's \"OK\" face and Tatsumaki's chibi mode.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sounds and music of this anime are awesome. The opening theme The Hero!!~Okoreru Kobushi ni Hi wo Tsukero~ by JAM Project is eargasmic since it is very cool and I've got a Last Song Syndrome upon hearing the song especially from the first phrase \"ONE PUUUUUUUUNNNNNCCCHHHH!!!!\".  The voice actors are really good and they bring all-star cast members:\\n\r\nFor the Japanese version, it features well-known seiyuu like Yuki Kaji (Eren Yaeger of Attack on Titan), Aoi Yuki (Iris of Pokemon the series Black and White), Unsho Ishizuka (Professor Oak of Pokemon the anime), Tessho Genda (Duke Togo A.K.A. the eponymous Golgo 13 of Golgo 13:Queen Bee) and so much more.\\n\r\nThe English dubbed version is no joke, it features voice actors from video games, cartoons and other anime series such as Max Mittleman (Kousei Arima of Your Lie in April) , Zach Aguilar (Slaine Troyard of Aldnoah Zero), Todd Haberkorn (Natsu Dragneel of Fairy Tail), Ray Chase (Noctis of Final Fantasy XV), Keith Silverstein (Hawk Moth of Miraculous Ladybug and Nazeem of Skyrim), Marieve Herington and Laura Post (Honoka Kousaka and Nozomi Tojo of Love Live!) and so much more. Plus, there are voice actors from Funimation Entertainment joining the party such as Christopher Sabat and Mike McFarland (Piccolo and Baby of Dragon Ball series).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The series is totally enjoyable because it is not your ordinary superhero/superpower anime has to offer because there are a lot of comedy which brings you a good laugh to many viewers which deviates most of the superhero media.",

            "content": "The first time I heard about the \"One Punch Man\", I thought that it was something really stupid or boring, but after checking this anime myself, I can totally say that I enjoyed it more than I could expect. The title says enough about what the  main chcaracter is capable of, and the gag goes on for some episodes, introducing parodies and clich\u00e9 villains, and characters all unique in their own regards.\r\nWhat surprised me about this anime wasn't the main character, or the plot overall, but how even characters who appeared for few episodes, or even for few minutes were all particular detailed andmade.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals, drawings and effects are simply amazing, as expected from Madhouse. Even in mere gags  and comedic scenes, the animation has always been on point. The music also is amazing. It is well timed to get you pumped and hyped for something, just as it can get sad or serious in other situations. The cast also is great! If you're a consumed anime watcher, or even a casual as myself, you'll probably recognise some very famous voice actors that played their roles perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, I'll point out a couple of flaws as well: First, is that, as me, you may not find some gags as funny as some others would, and the show tends to exaggerate itself too much even for comical standards. Plus, there is a lack of tension, as if there is no thrill or mystery to anything.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless,  One Punch Man positively surprised me to the point that I can give it an almost perfect 10/10. Enjoyment, a little hype and fun. All you can desire from a series like this.",

            "content": "Hype is the first thing that pops up in your head when hear One Punch Man, and why wouldn't it. One Punch Man fans have been extremely excited ever since it was confirmed to get an anime series. Nevertheless, with hype comes a lot of expectations. One mess up and you\u2019ll get hate from both manga/webcomic fans and those who wanted to see what One Punch Man is all about. Luckily Madhouse knows what they\u2019re doing very well and they didn\u2019t disappoint. The anime is a page-by-page adaptation of what fans wanted, and what newcomers are now interested in. Its satirical style parodying shounen andsuperhero tropes makes this a breath of fresh air in the anime medium. A gateway anime to many, One Punch Man helps in increasing the anime community.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe story focuses on Saitama, an average, bald-headed, expressionless man. However, little can one expect him to be the strongest man on earth who defeats all of his opponents with just one punch (hence the title!). The problem is that he is so strong that he is craving for a strong enough opponent so he can have fun with what he\u2019s doing. The story right off the bat feels very unique. Many anime focus on the protagonist becoming more and more powerful. However One Punch Man focuses the aftermath of that story, and how being the strongest may not be as good as it sounds. Though it may see uninteresting at first, because for how long can you have fun with a protagonist that is flawless in his strength, however the anime does a great job handling that as it\u2019s jokes end up staying fresh and its focus on other characters makes you still keep your interest. One Punch Man may not have the most fantastically written story, but it gets the job done. And it\u2019s the simplicity of the story that makes it the more enjoyable. Just leave your brain somewhere else and you\u2019ll have a blast with One Punch Man. \\n\r\nStory: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nAs a superhero-action anime, it delivers with its large-scale battles. As a parody-comedy it delivers with its satirical humor and hilarious characters. One Punch Man exactly what it is and it makes sure to only focus on that. No deep messages (besides Mumen Rider\u2019s speech), no buildup, no tragic storylines, just a crap load of fun. One Punch Man is sort up built up of small story arcs that rarely connect to one another besides its characters. And each arc delivers in entertainment, whether it be large-scaled, beautifully animated action, or slapstick humor. The pacing is also really good, as the anime takes its time on focusing on other characters and delivering consistent entertainment without any empty moments. The concept of One Punch Man is something that easily could have been a disaster, but luckily doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s absolutely perfect in its presentation. It\u2019s an anime that can bring in the most experienced anime watchers, and those who are entering this medium and are new to it. It parodies on superheroes is something that can appeal to a larger audience than just anime fans. The mixture of comedy and action makes this one of the greatest anime to come in recent times.\\n\r\nPresentation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nSaitama is a breath of fresh air in terms of action protagonists. Most characters focus on getting stronger, Saitama would envy those characters as he is too strong to enjoy his fights, if they can even be considered as fights. Saitama is hilarious and badass at the same time, so no wonder why he is so likeable. Saitama\u2019s transition from a detailed expression to expressionless will get me every time. Saitama\u2019s disciple, Genos, is one complete badass. He wants to become stronger, and Saitama is his hope. Even if he gets his ass kicked more than he does to others, his style and fighting skills are what makes him get a lot of fans, in the anime and outside. One Punch Man offers a humongous cast of character and each of them are unique in their own way. You have Sonic, the baddie that can\u2019t admit someone can be stronger than him, Mumen Rider, who may not have the most strength, but he has the most heart, and so much more. The heroes impress with their uniqueness and their humorous presentation, the villains impress with their over-the-top concepts and designs. There\u2019s always a character you end up loving in One Punch Man, because of the likeability of all of the characters. However, there are some characters that do get sidelined at times are just used to merely be a contrast for Saitama. However characters are great enough to cover up this flaw.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nMadhouse really went on point with the art of One Punch Man. There were two ways to tackle it: make the art cruddy looking to add to the humor (just like the webcomics), or make the art extremely detailed and fancy (like the manga remake). Madhouse manages to find a place between the two as the anime uses sketchy-style drawing as an effect, yet have detailing that makes the anime still gorgeous. This way, the studio gets to please both webcomics and manga fans, while bringing in new fans. The backgounds are well detailed. The color palette is restricted for the better. Vivid and bright colors wouldn\u2019t work with One Punch Man, so the limited color usage is great. The character designs are superbly presented. Each character looks totally unique in their own ways. Characters such as Watchdog Man wearing a dog costume to fight crime is just one of the many ridiculous designs this anime has to offer. Not to mention Genos looks extremely great with his cyborg design. And the most important part, Saitama is designed perfectly with him jumping around between an excited character with a detailed, buffed-up design, to an unenthusiastic, minimal detailed, average looking character. \\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nJust like the art, Madhouse manages to deliver extremely smooth animations that can satisfy for webcomics and manga fans. The sketchy and smooth feeling combine to make superb animations. With its large-scale battles, all over-the-top, the animations bring those to life. The smooth rotations used in this anime show how beautifully animated it is. The contrast between the over-the-top animations with Saitama\u2019s simplistically drawn face adds up to its already excellent humor. Only very few anime can be so consistent with its style and One Punch Man manages to succeed. The animations are so fast that they don\u2019t give you time to breath and that is just perfect. The fast-pacing and the animations perfectly blend together. Not to mention that the final fight was so well done, and so well stylized that I couldn\u2019t help but grin like a creep for the entire episode. There are very slight hiccups with the animations, but they easily get overshadowed with the animations that are great in One Punch Man. Also character movements have a very realistic feeling to it (such as Mumen Rider getting of his bicycle). The realism makes it feel like as if the animations were rotoscoped at times.\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nSince there is an abundance of characters in One Punch Man, a large seiyuu cast is required. The two main characters of One Punch Man, is voice acted by seiyuu that weren\u2019t much heard of, yet they still manage to do an excellent job as Saitama and Genos. Furukawa Makoto does a great job as Saitama as he can give both energy and a lack enthusiasm at perfect times. He is the perfect voice for Saitama. And it\u2019s funny how they got a zero to voice act Satama and after this anime he might become a hero. Ishikawa Kaito does Genos and he does it perfectly. He is able to add the coolness to Genos and that desperation of trying to get stronger. He really did make Genos into a fan magnet with his voice acting skills. A lot of big name seiyuu do some pretty minor characters, considering their talent. Miyano Mamoru is Amai Mask, Namikawa Daisuke is Doctor Genus and Pig God, Hayami Saori is Fubuki, Sawashiro Miyuki is Mosquito Girl, Nakamura Yuuichi is Mumen Rider, Miki Shinichiro is Snek, Kaji Yuki is Sonic, Yuuki Aoi is Tatsumaki, and Sakurai Takahiro is Zombieman (He only said one line!). Everyone manages to do fantastic with their role, because of their excellent skills.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nAt first, I was pretty afraid about the music as One Punch Man needs the perfect music to be more than what it can be. Once again, One Punch Man doesn\u2019t disappoint in this category. The Opening \u201cTHE HERO !!\u201d, is perfect as it perfectly represents what this anime is about. It\u2019s super catchy and it warms you up for what is yet to come. However the ending \u201cHoshi yori Saki ni Mitsukete Ageru\u201d, is the complete opposite as it\u2019s too peaceful and soothing to be an One Punch Man ending. However, that\u2019s what makes it more enjoyable as it adds so much irony to the anime. Not to mention it\u2019s a beautiful song. The OST is outstanding. Every track impresses. Its adrenaline filled beats are sure worth listening to on repeat. The Genos Theme in particular is what impressed me the most. And the OST that is played when Saitama gets the job done is perfect too. Oh, and who can forget Mumen Rider\u2019s Theme! The music is so well placed during the action scenes that I couldn\u2019t be more impressed as a One Punch Man fan.\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nThe entertainment values One Punch Man has is through the roof. With is hilarious tongue-in-cheek humor, its parodies on superhero and shounen tropes and its large-scale battles, you\u2019ve got one entertaining anime. Add the beautiful animations and art, and some fantastic background music, and you\u2019ve got this anime elevated to a whole new level. One Punch Man\u2019s got something for everyone, whether they be experienced anime watchers on newcomers, One Punch Man is here to appeal to anyone. It manages to please One Punch Man\u2019s webcomic and manga fans as it incorporates both styles together in one in the anime version.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, One Punch man is a breath of fresh air in the anime medium. It\u2019s a great gateway anime for those who aren\u2019t familiar with the anime medium, and its feels something unique and fresh for those who have been watching anime for a long time. It pleases manga and webcomic fans by being loyal to the original source. With its great humor and over-the-top action, mixed with its high production values, great animations and fantastic music, it\u2019s a complete entertainer. If you haven\u2019t watched the most hyped anime of the decade yet, you\u2019re missing out. Try it out and see how you like it! I\u2019ll be off to make some more One Punch Man gifs!\\n\\n\r\n+ A complete entertainer in both comedy and action. \\n\r\n+ Fantastic concept about the life of an overpowered character.\\n\r\n+ Great cast of characters, that are all unique and they stand out from one another.\\n\r\n+ Production values are through the roof as the art and animations are some of the best ever made.\\n\r\n+ The OST is superb as it is totally adrenaline boosting. \\n\r\n- Some supporting characters get side-lined at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.4/10",

            "content": "This show definitely deserves all the hype it has. \r\nIf you haven't seen this show and are considering it, I would highly recommend investing your time in this.\r\nyou may think that a story centered around the most OP character ever created may get boring at times, as did i, before watching the show but i have never been so wrong!\r\nthe show mixes a colorful cast of well designed characters with an amazing soundtrack and fairly simple plot to create a well-balanced and fully fleshed out show that kept me interested throughout the shows 12 episode run time.\r\nI may be the first One-Punch advocate to admitthat the show is not perfect. There were some boring down-times and arcs that may seem irrelevant and some major plot holes that a not seasoned anime fan may become stuck on, and i feel at times i was hanging on the back of one character, Saitama, to carry me through the show.\\n\r\nThat being said, Saitama is one of the most likable characters in the history of anime. He manages to keep the show light and comedic, and i feel if he was replaced by another copy-paste character, the show would be labeled as a \"try too hard dragon ball knock-off\".\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very satirical at times and makes fun of anime in general, as Kill La Kill attempted to do in 2013. I feel as if they make all the characters OP on purpose. It always seem as as if one villain outshines the last, and every hero get increasingly more powerful as the show went on, trying to get the audience as hyped up as they can before the finale, and it worked.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the finale, the show's end was fairly satisfying, leaving me with a feeling of closure. Just when you think the show couldn't get any crazier, it gets crazier. The animation was well done and the music was outstanding. The show also sets up for a potential season 2, which is scheduled to premiere in October, and i am very excited to see how much farther Mad House can take it.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, i rate this show a 9. I know people on this site all have different scoring method, myself included, but if i had to rate the show on a level of enjoyment(which i did for this review) this show would get a solid 10 by me, no questions asked, and i think that's the most important thing.\\n",

The character of saitama is op and not op at the same time and his sidekick genos is just my favorite,this anime is just complete in every way and requires a deep mind to get into but it has comedy elements of children too.

            "content": "In every single anime. great ones such as Fullmetal Alchemist all the way to shit ones likes SAO. We already know more-or-less the general ending. The hero prevails even under the most unlikely scenario...every...time. \r\nMany are those who say that One Punch Man is too predictable. Well I say One Punch Man is just more direct than other anime. OPM does away with the tease of power struggles and focuses on more important and unpredictable immersions which we would not love OPM without. We know Saitama always wins, but what about the world around him? What goes on inside people's minds? His reactions to society'sconstruct and behavior? The roles of others in times of turmoil? Human interactions among heroes?\\n\\n\r\nDoing away with the power-struggle, One Punch Man was able to concentrate on these ideas that we can all relate to while having a blast watching Saitama completely annihilate every big-mouth in one spectacular punch. It's pure entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nOh whats that? You wanted to see struggle? The hero in danger? Well just look at Genos! A hero who's strong and badass enough, yet gets ripped to shreds in almost every one of his fights. You can always just concentrate on the other heroes and appreciate their struggle, but just know that at the end of the episode the heroes have to prevail so One Punch Man jumps into action and makes the good ending we've come to expect. Oh shit One Punch Man is also the name of the anime? Am I thinking about this too much? Is Saitama just a symbol for inevitable good endings in all anime? Is he bored of good endings because he for once wants the thrill of not knowing the outcome? Is there an alternative? Is this shit stupid? Yea this paragraph is pretty bad I should end the review.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I enjoyed these 12 episodes, I would not be rating this season a 10 if a sequel was not on its way. Despite being 12 amazing episodes, One Punch Man hasn't expanded far enough into some crucial character development which it can definitely do with more time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music and the animation are perfectly fitting and always nails the tone and the feeling it's going for especially during the awesome fights. \\n\\n\r\nPS - I know I haven't written much, but who actually reads past the 2nd or 3rd paragraph in a positive review that doesn't make you piss your pants like many SAO and other series prone to MAL's best comedic writers.\\n\\n\r\nI just a guy who's writing this review for fun.",

            "content": "One-Punch Man continuously combines the humour and extremely well made action sequences in a way I haven't seen before. This show hits you with a joke or a mind-blowing scene either in a battle or off the battle. The jokes are somewhat subtle - the humor is sometimes just implied. But it has a charm of its own in its own way.\r\nStory: 10 - The story is a masterpiece without a doubt. As the title says he is a man of One-Punch battle.The world building is also great. ONE has successfully imagined a world brimming with heroes and monsters that is very interesting and feelsincredibly vast. There are all kinds of monsters in this show. We have monsters based on animals, monsters based off robots, monsters based off of rogue expert practitioners of martial arts, just to name a few. On the side of the heroes it's the same. We have here an incredibly diverse cast of heroes that all have very unique styles. The story pick offs from a very interesting development and the logic is crazy which makes it even better. A typical man becomes the worlds strongest man in three years with only casual training and lost his hair because of it. The story development is great and each episode will make you want to watch what happens one way or the another. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 - The art is brilliant. It is much better than expected. When One Punch Man was decided to be made into anime, not much expectations were made into the anime art. However not only the art is better than expected , the modern art brought into the anime makes the anime incredibly amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - The credit belongs to madhouse, the opening is so well done, it is so damn difficult to skip through it. ALso, the fights have amazing modern music which enhances the viewing and listening experience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 - Characters are just the best, I have grown fond of the characters from the very first episode. The characters are all unique and funny in their own way and that contributes greatly to the viewers' overall enjoyment of the show. Especially Saitama and Genos. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 - I am without a doubt enjoying the anime, I look forward to the day each episode is released for the fun 22 episodes of each episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 - It is a masterpiece without a doubt which has been never seen before. The anime story,characters,art and story &amp; character development are all brilliant. I can't wait for the Season 2 of One Punch Man! \uff08\u301c^\u2207^)\u301c",

            "content": "This show is a must watch in my opinion.\r\nThe one thing I will say is to not look too deep into what you think show is, I've seen people saying it strays away from its 'parody' tag and saying it as a bad thing. It doesn't really parody anything for any of the main characters.\r\nAnyway onto the review none of you care about.\r\nStory - 7\r\n------------------------------\r\nThe story of OPM isn't a particularly deep one, nor is it that different from numerous other stories you've heard before. But it is a well told one, and a well paced one.\r\nEffectively the show from 1 all the way throughto 12 is about our hero, Saitama, fighting things and generally being unbeatable. Whilst he goes around saving the day, all the other heroes and civilians believe him to be just a normal average hero, or a fraud. This he clearly isn't to anyone who sees him, but because of his outlook on heroism he doesn't really mind not being recognized as the best. The jokes of the show come mainly from this misunderstanding, or from the gross power difference between Saitama and whatever he's fighting.\\n\r\nGood story, not anything amazingly special though.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\r\nNow the art in this show is absolutely outstanding. The fight sequences have some of the most in depth and interesting artistry I've seen in a show. Take a look at the OPM manga, and imagine it fully animated. That's what you get here. \\n\r\nGlorious.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\r\nThe sound for this show is brilliant. (In all honesty i don't know how sound could ever really be a 10/10, which is why this is an 8 from me.) The sound design hits all the triggers, and has lovely noises in all the right places. The fights feel heavy and epic, and the comedy feels slapstick and easy. The switches between these moments don't feel jarring, and flow together perfectly.\\n\r\nTo top it off the OP for this show is great, and will have fans shouting 'WAN PANCH' at their screens when it hits.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\r\nA great selection of personalities is on show here, and they all complement each other wonderfully.\\n\r\nWe have our Hero, Saitama - A hero for fun, slapstick and uncaring; all whilst being the most powerful man in perhaps the universe.\\n\r\nAlongside him is Genos - Saitama's disciple, and cyborg enamored by our hero's greatness.\\n\r\nThen we have the collection of heroes, all vying for power and recognition. Each with a distinct ability set and personality set.\\n\r\nFinally there comes the villains, these are effectively the reflection of the heroes. The again struggle to showcase their powers, but they differ in that they all have the mad super-villain motive of - destroy the earth, kill all humans.\\n\r\nNice bunch of characters. Oh, and they're voice acted well too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\r\nWhereas I can admit this show probably isn't for everyone, I think most people will love it. Its an easy watch, especially if you go and discuss it with some friends after the fact.\\n\r\nYeah, if you're anything like me - you should feel the 'hype'.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\r\nThis is a well put together show, that faithfully adapts the source material in a way that only ever improves.\\n\r\nA must watch for anyone that likes anything, you may not love it but you should definitely give it a go.\\n\\n\r\nBaiBaiBai \u30fe(^_^)\\n",

Everyone was like \"Best anime ever\", \"Anime of the year, 100%\", \"Finally anime worth watching\". I was so excited, and decided to wait until the last episode so that I don't need to wait every week for a new one. I excepted huge team fights between Heros and Villains, where on verge of defeat MC jumps in, anddefeat all enemies with single punch, like a BADASS, but instead of Heroes vs Villans, we have Saitama vs Villains, where he kills opponent with one punch and End the day(sure fights are cool, and animation is Godlike, but it's boring, and it isn't funny as they thought it would be, at least not for me). In every episode there is a new Nemesis that is cocky as fuck, and thinks that he is the Main dick of all Villains, and every one of them gets killed by Saitama with one punch(I know that name of anime is \"ONE PUNCH MAN\", but it isn't funny). As for Saitama, well he is one of Gods blessings. There is not much to tell about him, he is strong, very strong, too strong, one of strongest anime characters ever, he is bald, he isn't very smart, he doesn't care for anything(except bargain day at the supermarket) because he is strongest, he is poor, and he is looking for worthy opponent. There is Genos, another very cool character, he is android and Saitamas friend. There are few other characters that I liked, but I decided to mention only MCs. Animation and art are EPIC and BEAUTIFUL. I personally didn't see an anime with better animation and art except Fate series. Battles are Godlike(I hate when Saitama fights, because he is screwing with his opponents for a while, and kills them with one punch afterwards), I especially enjoy Genos's fights even tho he always lose a big fight, I really love to see him firing flames(they are well animated, beautiful, and detailed). Soundtrack is good, and it really gets you hyped for battle, but you can only enjoy this anime when you watch battles. When they are not fighting, they are just screwing around, trying to be funny, but fail badly. That's all from me. I hope I was from any help, but if I wasn't, sorry for wasting your time.",

I wasn't focusing on the combat scenes much because it was pretty predictable after a couple of scenes and i thought that wasn't the point of this anime. But then, more boring and cheesy fighting scenes. Kinda killed the characters for me. \r\nThe characters were pretty cool and loved the dynamics between them. It's just everything went downhill after the 7th or 8th episode. The story could have been more interesting. I mean since episode 8 I've been watching an episode every month or something. The last episode was so slow and it felt like i was watchingit for so long, I had to browse the internet while watching. I'm glad i finished it. Definitely not watching season 2 unless with a couple of friends to joke on it. \\n",

            "content": "Looking at the ratings for One Punch Man, most may agree that it is probably one of the best animes for Fall 2015 but there are still some who feel that it is over-hyped. \r\nSo, here is my review on One Punch Man, which will be kept spoiler-free as possible. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nOne Punch Man is a parody of most shounen anime - where the main protagonist usually gets defeated and trains to become more powerful. But in One Punch Man, Saitama kills his enemies with . . . ONE PUNCH. Poking fun of anime tropes is what makes the story great, despite its rather simpleplot. However, it can get rather predictable over time because the viewer would know how the episode would end - the villain getting defeated by Saitama. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMADHOUSE strikes again! \\n\r\nThe art is amazing and some scenes are so well illustrated, leaving deep impressions on the viewer. The art is suitable for the fast-paced action of the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nONE PUUUNCHH!  \\n\r\nOne Punch Man's opening gets you hyped up for the episode and is really catchy too, I find myself humming the tune of the opening 'The Hero'. Voice actors whom I think did an amazing job would be Aoi Yuuki (Tatsumaki), Yuki Kaji (Sonic) and Ishikawa Kaito (Genos), who brought out their character's personalities. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were diverse, with different personalities. Even the villains who appeared for only one or two episodes were unforgettable. The heroes are quirky, from the Gandalf/Dumbledore-like Silverfang to the bratty Tatsumaki. Saitama and Genos are rather unique characters. Although Saitama is the main character, Genos seems to have the 'Protagonist' vibe with his serious nature. Both are opposites - Saitama being a bored, laidback individual and Genos being a more serious character with the quest for revenge. Characters in One Punch Man bring out the story and are one of the factors that I think that make this series so enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite a few shortcomings, One Punch Man is an enjoyable show to watch and well-presented. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nGreat show and it never failed to disappoint me. It may seem overrated but it does deserve most of the hype. This is a show which I would definitiely rewatch for the humour. \\n\\n\r\nI'm also hoping for a season 2!",

            "content": "One Punch Man is another anime which lies amongst the top of several databases (having a score of 9.5 on IMDb) and another anime which makes me scratch my head wondering what the deal is that makes everyone love it. For me, this was another one of those works which had incredible production values but failed when it came to the actual story. Now despite the score I gave it, I don't really hate One Punch Man. The series had a very likeable premise and I could see why people would like it right away. With an overpowered superhero that can beat every villain, youknew you were going to get a self-aware series that was parodying other superheroes and superhero movies. Where the show failed to hook me was how it was never really anything else and I was soon bored of it.\\n\\n\r\nART and SOUND\\n\\n\r\nAs said earlier, the show has some great production values. The art style is rather unique as it is not exactly following the basic way most anime are drawn. The main character, for example is bald and has small and round eyes (as seen from the poster itself) as opposed to so many other series (and my, the memes I've seen referencing that!) This works to the show's benefit. We are expected to laugh whenever we see that and his somewhat dumb and silent personality helps to do so.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the MC, most of the major characters are drawn in the most eccentric way possible. The villains almost always consist of large monsters in a humanoid form and two villains rarely look similar. They all have their own unique design and each of them are very well drawn and detailed. The heroes too are no less. Each of them are drawn in a very eccentric manner. \\n\\n\r\nI did not have much to complain about in the sound section because while I didn't fancy any of the music the show had, they matched with the feeling the series was trying to create. The opening sound was upbeat and it (with it's video showing Saitama beating monsters black and blue) was adrenaline pumping. The voice acting was alright. It was usually loud and over the top with people screaming but the villains would always repeat lines such as \"You can't beat me\" or \"I'm going to take over the world.\" Also, the way some characters speak is far too eccentric.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is not something I found exceptional, but I'll say that it worked.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY and CHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the story is known to all. A jobless hero, named Saitama, wishes for a worthy opponent as everyone else is easily beaten by him in one punch. The series cannot really be called episodic as the story arcs usually last for a minimum of two episodes. However the events that occur in them are the same with only slight variations with the only sign of progression being the advancement of the hero to a higher rank.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, nothing in this anime makes the least bit of sense. Cities are destroyed an rebuilt in an instant. People instantly forget large, earth-destroying monsters as well as heroes who beat them without much effort(just because they are not in some association). They main attraction here was the comedy and even that I found to be uninteresting as it was usually the same joke repeated over and over. Yeah, the joke of Saitama defeating opponents in one punch is used in almost every episode and I quickly got bored of it. Furthermore, I could easily predict what was going to happen and when because the series is insanely repetitive. Heck, there were times when I could pinpoint when a joke was going to be used! There was very less variety in jokes and most of the jokes aside from the main one was something often found in shounen (such as characters being incredibly dumb, or having a very short attention span)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were no better. They could be defined in a few sentences and their looks alone told you what you were to expect from these characters. Neither of them develop in any manner and many of them don't even have a major role to play. They were hardly given any backdrop besides the initial two or three episodes and even that felt very weird. \\n\\n\r\nWhat pissed me off the most about them was how retarded they acted. And I'm not talking about the things that were done for laughs. Saitama not getting the highest rank despite it being obvious to all that his power is godly is complete BS.  Furthermore, the amazing Hero Association never bothers to deploy their highest ranked members(who also, for some reason never attend any meetings of any sort) for a threat that can destroy the entire world (but are ready on the job when some...dinosaur is spotted in a hilly area far from civilization).\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I should add how all 'progress' in the series plays out like a video game. In the beginning nobody notices you. If you join a guild, someone will recognize you and as you finish more and more quests, you get more and more noticed by the people in the cities A to Z(and that's what these cities are actually called in this anime!)\\n\\n\r\nThe VERDICT\\n\r\nI find One Punch Man to be insanely overrated and over-popular. Like many other shows I have problems with (and are in the tops of any list), it is pretty looking but has a shitty story (in this case there's not even a story). For dumb comedies, I would watch Gintama and for actually good comedies,I would suggest watching The Tatami Galaxy. I won't give One Punch Man a recommendation unless you're really short on time and need a very specific type of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nART:9/10(Pretty with nice monster designs)\\n\r\nSOUND:8/10(Suits the show)\\n\r\nSTORY:2/10(Nothing to look forward to except the premise)\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:3/10(Forgettable)\\n\\n\r\nThe GOOD\\n\r\n(+)Nice Premise\\n\r\n(+)Good artwork\\n\\n\r\nThe BAD\\n\r\n(-)Very repetitive\\n\r\n(-)Jokes lack variety\\n\r\n(-)Zero plot and interesting characters\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review! Feedback will be greatly appreciated and BTW, I watched this show because I like anime, please don't ask me the same.      \\n",

            "content": "I love self-deprecating humor. When you can make fun of yourself, the possibilities are endless. Anime is no different. So, enter \"One Punch Man\". A superhero show so entertaining, it's only a matter of time before Disney buys it and tries to fold it into \"The Avengers\". \r\nThe storyline is simplicity itself. Really powerful superhero goes around fighting the bad guys who seem to appear at a constant basis. The fun part is that he's so powerful, he really doesn't care. He's doing this for fun. And why should he care when the bad guys he's often fighting (though mildly creative) are a bunch ofmonologue spouting villains of the week. It's a joy to see them get squished. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is better than it should be for a show like this. Great amounts of bright colors, ridiculous looking villi ans and heroes, and fight sequences that so over-the-top they make DBZ look subdued and realistic. But, then again, I suppose that was all rather the point. It's supposed to be silly. Sound effects are worthy of the art quality and give a legit feel to this satire. There are many times where the art will shift from simple to more detailed in order to bring a more serious tone to the scene at hand, only to have it end in silly fashion. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters carry the show. From Saitama, Mr. One Punch Man himself, and his deadpan \"yeah, bro\" attitude towards any threatening situation, to his cyborg disciple Genos who provides the straight-man to compliment Saitama's care-free demeanor, and the grocery list of villains and heroes with hilariously complex backstories and sets of powers who provide the meat of the show. Most of these characters will have you looking at mundane objects differently forever. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sub vs. Dub battle is something of a wash. Both casts do a good job in their roles, which are mostly comprised of hammy performances. Makoto Furukawa suits the titular role perfectly with his voice reflecting the boredom that fits the character in Japanese. But, Max Mittelman with his trademark \"laid back teenager\" voice, does a different but equally decent job in English. A special mention goes to Miyano Mamoru, who has a crucial (but smaller) role as Amai Mask. His voice perfectly suits that character, the same voice who gave Light Yagami in \"Death Note\" that pretty-boy confidence with a touch of sinister intention, fits equally well in this role and gives a hint of what's to come. So much so, I'm giving the win here to the Japanese cast.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show in much the same way I enjoyed the film \"Deadpool\". It's the right show at the right time. With so many super powered Anime shows and superhero films flooding the market even as I write these words, it's a breath of fresh air to watch a show that throws pies in both their faces. If you're like me, and you're tired of overly dramatic Anime and Superhero titles, give this one a watch. At only 12 episodes, it may be one of the most binge-worthy Anime I've seen in a long time. A great time. 9/10. Check it out. Cheers!",

            "content": "Video Version: https://youtu.be/N3WlH4ud_mk\r\nIn recent time, every other coming out is so hyped that it is treated as god's gift to mankind and every fanboy claims that it is the \u201csavior of anime\u201d. And the show this season that has been labeled \u201cthe savior of anime\u201d is One-Punch Man but is this show really as good as the fanboys say or is it just another overhyped pile of garbage. Let\u2019s find out.\r\nStory\r\nIn case you don\u2019t know the plot of One Punch Man, it\u2019s pretty self-explanatory, the guy wants to become a hero so he trains really hard that he loses his hair and can now defeatany of his opponents in just one punch. And the plot for any given episode is very basic: Saitama meets a really ridiculous and over the top bad guy and with that comes comedy then he is defeated in just One Punch and rinse and repeat you get One Punch Man. But I\u2019m not going to sit here and criticize its story because that\u2019s not what One Punch Man is even about and if you go into it expecting an amazing story, you\u2019re going to miss the whole point of the show. But I must say that in the story department, One Punch Man is quite lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man follows the story of Saitama. You know the rule in anime that the longer the hair the greater the power, the rule that Naruto Bleach and Dragonball follow and in the midst of this comes Saitama as a parody of the whole shounen genre. Saitama was a normal guy working a normal job, but all of this changed when he saves a child and decides that he will now become a hero for fun. And from then on Saitama trains day in and day out to become stronger and, as a result, he trains so hard that he loses his hair\u2026 Because that totally makes sense. Saitama is a very funny character and the juxtaposition of what he looks like and what he can do is pretty amazing and he definitely is a badass. Though Saitama is funny and is a badass he is just that. He is very 2D and there isn\u2019t much to him other than those two traits. But that\u2019s the charm of his character.\\n\\n\r\nThe second main character is Genos aka Tony goddamn Stark as that is pretty much what he is. He has a very cool introduction, but he is a very weird character as though he is a good companion to Saitama and both of together are a good duo and have charisma together it always felt like he was the damsel in distress always needing Saitama to come save the day.\\n\\n\r\nThere aren\u2019t really any other characters that actually matter apart from the antagonists. A great antagonists can make or break a show such as Johan Liebert from Monster or Gilgamesh from Fate Zero and on that front, One Punch Man definitely delivers. You know amazing antagonists such as a Giant Crab Wearing underwear and a mole, a goddamn mole! All joking aside, that\u2019s not what One Punch Man is even going and by no means will you remember the antagonists because they only get around 3 to 4 minutes of screen time per episode.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nThe music for the show was good. The OST perfectly compliments the tone of the show with intense scenes with intense music. And the opening and ending songs are pretty amazing.\\n\\n\r\nProduction/History\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is the adaptation of an ongoing webcomic of the same name written by the manga author ONE and has been adapted by Studio Madhouse. And I must say, Madhouse has knocked it out of the park keeping in mind this is what the source material looked like. Almost every episode has, at least, one scene that looks incredible. But the animation definitely the highlight of the show.  One Punch Man premiered in the Fall of 2015 with 12 episodes and knowing Madhouse, we probably won\u2019t get a sequel. \\n\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\\n\r\nAt points, One Punch Man was just kind of childish and didn\u2019t make me laugh but these scenes were few and far between. This is not a series  you can marathon, it gets boring and repetitive easily as the joke becomes less funny as each episode passes and some episodes such as episodes 3 and 4 being absolutely boring.\\n\\n\r\nPositives\\n\\n\r\nBut This anime does something that most fail at. One Punch Man handles tonal shifts very well, it goes from totally dumb to totally badass and back. It is a very self-aware show and isn\u2019t trying to be the next big masterpiece. One Punch Man is one of the only anime that actually made me laugh. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nAnd with the ridiculous amount of hype surrounding this show, I\u2019m kinda sad to say that it doesn\u2019t live up to the hype and it is impossible for it but the show is definitely entertaining if all you're looking for is some dumb fun but if you want any more from this show you will definitely be disappointed especially if you\u2019re on the hype train. And it certainly not the best anime of the year but it definitely is one of the most enjoyable ones. And with all that being said I give this anime a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nDetails:\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall 7",

Today's a special day in case you didn't know. The market's selling veggies at 30% off.\"\r\nThis quote is basically everything what One Punch Man is about.\r\nMixing serious thoughts with comedy might be the best way how to deliver something deep without looking like a smart aleck. Well, the action side of this series is worth watching as well \u2013 mainly due to its very nice and fluid animation, but also because there are plenty ofother interesting characters who can actually get hurt. \\n\\n\r\nI think that the people, who didn\u2019t enjoy this show, were trying to find something in it that was never intended to be there. I am talking about romance and other daily problems a normal person can relate to. Maybe it is because of the way OPM is parodying other superheroes series. It takes all the overly used stereotypes and confront them with the real world, which makes you realize how stupid they actually are. E.g. every hero has to have a tragic background story, revenge is the number one motivation, an attack is only as powerful as its name, etc.\u2026 The other thing this show is taking from a real world is the human nature. Even though there are some nice people, the majority is not \u2013 especially in the times, when something is screwed up, the need for a culprit is bigger than the need for a hero. All those things might lead you to a conclusion that this show will get more and more real, but it won\u2019t. So don\u2019t watch it if that is what you were looking for \u2013 you will not enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nLuckily for me OPM was just what I wanted. Actually just the imagination that I myself should come up with a watchable 12 episodes long story based on a character that is so overpowered that no one can defeat him and stick to it for the whole time is certainly something I have never seen before.\\n\\n\r\nThe key lies in the diversity. So far a lot of characters were introduced, but almost every one brought something new in the show:\\n\r\nSaitama\u2019s main purpose is to deliver us wisdom in a way that will entertain us as well. \"Let me make one thing clear! I'm not working as a hero because I want you morons to admire me! I do it 'cause I want to!\" As I\u2019ve stated in my preview before the way I understood this is that whatever it is we do in our lives, we should always be passionate and enthusiastic about it. \\n\r\nGenos carries the potential plot, which might make the show be even more interesting in the future.\\n\r\nMumen Rider \u2026 even though he is weak, his extreme sense of justice and devotion to help others is provoking me to be a better person too.\\n\r\nSonic is an embodiment of an egocentric person. He is not a real villain. He just wants to be acknowledged. The only reason we get to see him more is just because Saitama is aware of it as well.\\n\r\nS-heroes \u2026 they are all unique. We haven\u2019t seen everyone in action yet, but they seem to have very different characters, plus their special powers are making the show more exciting. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the opening I wasn\u2019t aware of any music that would stand out. But if you take the time to listen to the OST you may actually be surprised how good the soundtrack is. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you have the time and you like super heroes, I recommend you to watch it. Really! I was more excited to see the last episode than the new Star wars movie. It had to be very difficult for the author to keep the show fresh every week, but it was executed very well.\\n",

The author knows that it would be boring, that's why the story does not only tell about Saitama, it tells about others too. Saitama isn't the only character in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was done by seven different studios under the name of MadHouse, the animators are famous for their amazing artwork and choreography. Natsume Shingo, considered as a legend of fight scene animator is in charge.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OSTs in this anime are very amazing. The sound effects are realistic and  most of the voice actors are very popular.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA bald dude in a jumpsuit who is a planet buster? Check\\n\r\nA cyborg? Check\\n\r\nA scientist? Check\\n\r\nA samurai? Check\\n\r\nA ninja? Check\\n\r\nA hotheaded delinquent? Check\\n\r\nA hot guy who is a celebrity? Check\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe battles are just crazy, it has some casual jokes and the events coming at you nonstop.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend you to watch this anime.",

Nobody wants their new favorite show to be the new Attack on Titan, but god damn it, I can't help myself but like it.\r\nOne Punch Man started off as a webcomic with really shitty art, but after it became super popular, some ho made a manga out of it, and now it's an anime.\r\nThe story is very fun. It's about a guy who wanted to be a hero for fun, but soon became too strong, and stopped having fun fighting people and stopping bad guys.It was all too easy. Then a cyborg kid who wanted to stop evil and kill the cyborg who killed his family came along, and insisted that our hero Saitama teach him how to be a hero and to become strong.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all super funny and ridiculous. I think the characters are what made me love this show, particularly Saitama.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the show, so I definitely recommend it.",

Being famous as a one-hit kill, Saitama is indeed doesn't need much action screen time by his side. His opponents? well they got the privileges. And the anime makes it quite well timed. Although the character developments doesnt seem too good, it's tolerable. Since the anime only have 12 episodes.\r\nHowever, the comedy, which also it's strong component, can't come to terms VERY FUNNY. It tickles, but you wont screaming laughter or walk funny after watching. This anime was hyped for being gagful and laughable. But the execution on thecomedy part is a bit lousy.\\n\r\nMaybe there's also this minor thing where we actually can enjoy this anime in a long-term show because of these mysteries in our mind about the power all the S-class squad. But the PH squeezed it into one- forcefully trying to be amazing- season consists of 12 episode \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is quite good. I myself feel refreshed because there's finally a new mascot in anime world. Not just over-popular main chara like Kirito, Kaneki,etc. But a new Goku, Naruto, or Conan.\\n\r\nBut it's not worth the hype.\\n\r\nThis anime is Majestically Great, but not Perfect.\\n\r\nAll im saying is, this anime is worth re-watching, but not worth the hype.\\n\r\nThe hype for this anime,for me, is something that should be dedicated for anime that maybe scores 11/10.\\n\r\nThanks",

Oh, and also: THERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS.\r\nStory/Enjoyment: 8.5/10\r\nI couldn't really see a plot in this anime, which was why I combined the score of the story and the enjoyment. This absolutely had no story whatsoever, BUT... it doesn't change the fact that this is a parody. There was no intention for a story. This was just a sit-back-and-relax type of series where you don't need to think and take it seriously; and I don't mind that; becauseI freakin' LAUGHED MY ARSE OFF HERE! This was hilarious. The battle scenes were very intense and exciting to see as well!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nWell, what to expect from Madhouse Studios. The animation... Two Words: Madhouse Level...\\n\r\nExtra words: Which is GODDAMN AWESOME!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound FX were like the extra sprinkles added onto a CAKE! Yep, not a turd. The sound effects had made me fall off my chair. The final battle scene was one of the MOST INTENSE AND EXCITING SCENES I'VE EVER SEEN! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI loved how Saitama had went through each of the \"arcs\" and finally take on one of the most powerful enemies he's taken on. First of all, it was like eating a piece of sultana. Then as the series progressed, the enemies had become harder to beat until at the final battle, he couldn't beat the enemy within ONE PUNCH.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThat was worth the 6 hours of me watching this. I'm also excited for the second season airing in 2017!",

            "content": "(Small spoilers for Re:zero, My Hero Academia season 2 and The Dark Knight ahead. They won\u2019t be prevalent in the review, but I will bring them up at one point. Of course there are big spoilers for OPM too)\r\nThere are very few protagonists that I REALLY root for. Most main characters in the shows I watch are enjoyable, maybe even has some depth to them and some of them might even be very relatable and realistic. But it is very rare for me to find a protagonist that I TRULY root for. Where I want them to succeed. If I would choose a few ofthem, it would be Kotarou from Tsuki ga Kirei and Bojack Horseman from Bojack Horseman (Not an anime, but it doesn\u2019t matter). But one of the best I have ever seen is Saitama from One Punch Man. \\n\\n\r\nI rarely ever care about character\u2019s decisions in a show or movie. Or to be more precise, I rarely ever get angry at a characters decision even though I understand why he or she decides to do it. \\n\r\nSubaru chooses Emilia over Rem, who cares they\u2019re both boring as hell. \\n\r\nIzuku decides to help Todoroki get over his anger against his father, I just agreed with his actions.\\n\r\nBut something about the fact that Saitama decides to not only not show off his cool ass power, he even makes people hate him to make society like the other heroes more. \\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it is understandable why he does it. I\u2019m not bringing it up cause I think he\u2019s stupid or an asshole. Saitama is a great character because of this. \\n\r\nIn episode 7, One Punch Man has destroyed a meteor that could\u2019ve killed all of city Z. The price of this however is that the meteor separate into smaller parts, destroying a large part of the city. How does society thank him, by putting him on blast, shitting on him, screaming at him to give up. And just the fact that Saitama doesn\u2019t kill every single one of those fuckers makes him a great character and makes me scream at the computer at the same time (I didn\u2019t do that, but I really felt like it).\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard to explain. In summary, Saitama doesn\u2019t give a fuck. \\n\r\nHe doesn\u2019t care that everyone hates him, he even makes them hate him more.\\n\r\nHe doesn\u2019t care that the S-rank members don\u2019t know that he is the ultimate hero, cause he just does it for fun. \\n\r\nThere were so many times where Saitama shows how good of a person that he is, but I wanted him to become a worse one. \\n\r\nThis might sound bad, but to me that\u2019s what makes him such a fantastic character. He makes the show IMO. \\n\\n\r\nBut sadly, this quality isn\u2019t anywhere else. \\n\r\nWhile I LOVED Saitama and Mumen Rider (Who I won\u2019t talk about since this review will just get twice as long), the rest of the characters were surprisingly forgettable. Genos doesn\u2019t really have any flare to him, The enemies weren\u2019t that memorable (Except for one, which I\u2019ll talk about later) and the heroes are as plain. They were enjoyable to watch, don\u2019t get me wrong. But there wasn\u2019t anything to them IMO. It might be because Saitama and Mumen rider out-shined them enough to make fine characters look bad. But I was surprised at how much I didn\u2019t care for the story unless mumen rider or Saitama was there. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while that was the worst part of the show, there was one other part that I found nearly as bad. The exposition.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I liked the dialogue for the most part, where Saitama's was again the best, there was an abundance of very badly written exposition in the dialogue. Lines like \u201cI can blast through a 20mm steel plate with one of my shape-memory golden bullets\u201d. A character by the name of Golden ball says this when fighting an enemy. He\u2019s not explaining his power/weapon, where it would be natural for him to say what he can do. But he says it to his friend who knows his power very well, and the monster that he plans to kill. So why would he say this other than that he wants the audience to know what power he has. And he\u2019s not an important character. We don\u2019t need to know what his power is, because he is in one scene. \\n\r\nThis exposition is present throughout the whole show. And while it wasn\u2019t as bad as Suicide Squad, with lines like \"This is Katana. She's got my back. She can cut all of you in half with one sword stroke, just like mowing the lawn. I would advise not getting killed by her. Her sword traps the souls of its victims. \", just the fact that I\u2019m comparing this show to one of the worst movies I\u2019ve ever seen means that it\u2019s bad. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd while there are lots of things I really dislike about this show, LOTS OF THINGS. I just want to talk about one more thing. \\n\r\nBoros vs Saitama\\n\\n\r\nSomething about this fight is so\u2026 fascinating. I\u2019ll try to explain why.\\n\r\nFirstly, the animation is fucking incredible. The show has an overall fantastic animation except for some weird lip syncing and bad animation which were far and few between. But in that one fight, the animation was just so incredible. It\u2019s probably one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. Up there with Mob Psycho 100\u2019s Koyama fight and all of Mad Max: Fury Road. \\n\r\nThere are a lot of fight scenes that have incredible animation in this show, but they weren\u2019t nearly as memorable as this. But there was one more thing. And that\u2019s the character that is introduced in that \u201carc\u201d or whatever you would call it. And that is Boros himself. \\n\\n\r\nProbably the best antagonist I have ever seen is The Joker from The Dark Knight. I can talk about him for hours, and I have at points. But one of the things that makes him such a great antagonist for batman is that he has the same goal as him. They both want the soul of Gotham. And in many ways this is similar with Boros and Saitama. \\n\r\nBoth of them dream of meeting an opponent who doesn\u2019t die instantly. They just go about it in different ways. While Saitama dreams about it literally and is disappointed if a monster is killed by one punch, Boros tries to quench this thirst by going to as many planets as possible to find the opponent who can really challenge him. And I found that really interesting. \\n\\n\r\nBut yeah, I really enjoyed this show even though I disliked many parts of it. I\u2019ll give it an 8/10 for now.\\n\r\nDon\u2019t think I have ever compared a show or movie to one of the best and worst movies I have ever seen, but it is what it is I guess.",

To those who feel this way, I think you misunderstand what the show is about. The essence of the anime is the struggle for Saitama to enjoy fighting again and find a truly worthy opponent. The jokes are meant to be repetitive to reinforcethis idea. \\n\\n\r\nAlso there is depth to this anime, like the corruptness of the hero system and Genos' character arc. \\n\\n\r\nOverall super entertaining anime and I highly recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "This is my first review, so I'll try to be brief and clear.\r\nStory - 10: The plot revolves around Saitama, a perfectly average looking guy who, after three years of hard training, has become so strong he can defeat every enemy with one single punch. Despite this, he has no popularity whatsoever, so he dreams to be recognized as a hero by his fellow citizens. His struggles to achieve this goal give birth to some of the most hilarious scenes ever: the storyline is simple yet funny and it never gets boring.\r\nArt - 9: The art is simply amazing. The contrast between the fluid, highdetailed batlle scenes and the comcal ones (which almost resemble a parody) makes this show even funnier than it already is.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10: The soundtrack for this show cannot be described by mere words......It fits the anime perfectly, it actually makes you feel like you can destroy anything with just one punch. And the opening is just fantastic......\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10: Because of the storyline being so simple, what really makes this series so good are its characters. Saitama, for example, is one of my favourite characters out of all the animes I've seen so far, just because he's so unique. Some of the other characters are really interesting too. If there will be a second season, I'd really like to see a bit more development on their side.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -10: I honestly would have never expected to like this show so much, considering this isn't even one of my favourite genres.....But i guess I was wrong, so here I am, so hyped about it that I decided to write my first review.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10: I seriously think this show deserves all the success it has if not even more....I wholeheartedly recommend it to any anime fan out there. Surely enough, if you don't like comedy it might seem a little plain, but still, if you're looking for something not too demanding or you just want to relax after watching a really complex series then be sure to check it out.\\n\\n\r\n(sorry for my english, i'm italian, I tried my best)",

If all you have ever watched are shows with completely serious super heroes, then sure, you'll love OPM.\r\nThis wasn't more interesting than HxH, and neither was it more random and funny than Bobobo and Kinnikuman, it was just overall shallow. As I watched OPM, I felt as if had already seen it all before (and not that it was so great the first time that it was worth doing it again).\r\nSince you can never take seriously any of the characters,when they do stupid shit you are already expecting it. The jokes are not especially good, and the story is simple as can be.\\n\r\nThe art and sound were well done, but destroyed cities, fights and fire have been beaten to death for long.

Saitama's this bald, bored, and overpowered man who is constantly looking for an opponent that won't perish from his single punch. Tough luck for him. At Saitama's expense, it was soooo hilarious to see him get depressed because his opponents were too weak. \r\nWe are used to seeing anime MC'S strugglingto become strong and fighting the bad guys, getting all beaten up. But...In OPM Saitama never even got injured. The worst case for Saitama is...ending up naked. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's this straightforward cyborg named Genos who's Saitama's apprentice.\\n\\n\r\nThen Saitama registered to become an official hero and take on (weak) bad guys. \\n\\n\r\nThe end. \\n\\n\r\nThat's basically the story is about. Simple yet fun. I laughed so hard even just a few minutes watching the first episode.However, the story didn't get a 10 from me because it's plot is simplistic and there's no real tension there. But that's one of OPM's charms; simplicity and fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simple yet it suits the show, I dunno why. The background is not particularly breathtaking or anything but it's juuust right. The debris especially were also given detail. Battle scenes are done very nicely; it's smooth and entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department, the OP really suits the show! It's very catchy and full of hype. The ED is also nice, but it reminds me of Dragon Ball's Romantic no Ageru Yo. Somehow the ED brought a sense of nostalgia to me, and it's not a bad thing. The tracks used were in perfect sync with the events that happened, and the voice actors have done a really great job! I think Saitama's and Genos' VA really suits the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters of OPM are not really that developed nor do they change. However, almost all of the characters are lovable, and there was only one character that I felt was kinda annoying. Saitama is strong strong strong. Genos is strong but is the epitome of a normal (superpowered) anime MC; strong but not too strong. OPM definitely lacks some character-building, but the focus of OPM is not really on the character development. *winks winks* \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching OPM, and I can't wait for season 2! I think that those who especially enjoy watching comedy anime, or the likes of superheroes anime would love this fun-filled action show. Or if you're just wondering whether this show is worth watching for some comedic relief, this show is worth checking out.",

I mean there's also Genos who wants to become stronger so he take down a cyborg that destroyed his city and killed his family.

            "content": "One Punch Man features this crazy workout introduced by the main character Saitama. To prevent spoilers, I will not give details of the workout. Anyway, I tried the workout and now have rotator cuff tendonitis. So word of advice. Do not push yourself through his workout, unless you\u2019re physically able. If you decide to watch the anime, watch each episode through to the previews. There\u2019s a short scene after the credits. Now onto the review.\r\nBased on the famous webcomic by One (yes, his alias is One), One Punch Man has a simple plot: the protagonist defeating enemies with one hit. He is bored, looking forworthy opponents of being a challenge for him. As a fan of the manga, Madhouse met my expectations as they usually do with adaptations. The pacing was good, as they kept the story going by eliminating the side stories in the manga. It resembled a classic \u201890s superhero show consisting of monsters and heroes with phenomenal sakuga. \\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind before investing your time in this show that it is a parody. Do not expect seriousness throughout the 12 episodes. It is a silly gag comic about a superhero who always wins but is very unpopular among the community. If you had bad experiences with parodies, do not disregard One Punch Man. I disliked some parodies like Cromartie High School and had a fun time watching this show. Some parts, including the repetitive punchlines emphasizing on Saitama\u2019s superpower and foolishness, may not appeal to you. There are other comical fragments to look forward to, especially the characters\u2019 dialogue and side jokes. It may not make you laugh, but it is still entertaining and dynamic with its concept. To be quite honest, I can\u2019t imagine getting bored with this show. With that being said, it is easy to misplace your expectations.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do some people dislike One Punch Man? I had an opposite experience from those individuals. It is true some people will not find this funny or entertaining at all. I will admit that some jokes are introduced early on and become predictable. No amount of visuals or good animation can amount for that. One Punch Man also presents a general punchline throughout the show, emphasizing Saitama\u2019s superpower, foolishness, and psychological view of the world of superheroes and villains. Admittedly, this may not be the show for you, but I advise making it through at least the first 3-4 episodes. That tends to be the moment when people who are disinterested throw in the towel. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, there was more emphasis on comedy in the first half and action in the second half, especially with the arcs halfway through. The dialogue and actions of the characters are hilarious as they are meant as side jokes. The monsters are eliminated, not just by one punch, but from being in the middle of a fight that doesn't involve them. E.g. After inquiring his friend\u2019s condition, a creature was slashed immediately during Saitama and another creature\u2019s fight. It parodies a couple of shounen tropes. The fights do not last long, allowing more enemies with exponentially high levels of power to appear. Based on the ending, One Punch Man successfully parodied the absurdities of the superhero genre. The occurrence was obvious. The ending also reached a crescendo that led me to believe there is more to the story (I\u2019m not up-to-date on the manga). Superhero shows are hardly ever over, so I see a potential second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were distinct, but there was not much time for character development in all of the characters. The ending introduced some major flaws in characters\u2019 personalities that must be addressed or furthered. Saitama\u2019s personality and mindset brought ebullience to the story. Sometimes his actions may seem unusual, but it has meaning. The majority of the monsters gave a brief introduction to their life story. Every superhero was distinct in their powers, characteristics, and backstories. I was slightly disappointed in terms of the heroes. I wanted to see the powers of all the superheroes. There was an obese superhero stuffing his face with burgers, and I wonder what could he possibly accomplish. At first, it seemed like Saitama is the only superhero saving the day, but other heroes finally had their chances, too.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cTHE HERO\u201d by JAM Project really made One Punch Man sound like your classic superhero show. I couldn\u2019t think of a better way to get an episode started. I did not fathom the reasoning behind a love song by Hiroko Moriguchi. It did not suit the mood of the show at all. It has an assuaging sound though. Background noise (e.g. sound of rain) and music was constant and fit well with the action. I like that Madhouse knew when and when not to play background music. It made the show more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals were top notch. The fights have high levels of sakuga. However, the camera moved a little too much for me to fully grasp the choreography, but it still got my attention. The energy radiating from Saitama\u2019s body when he enters superhero mode was amazing. There is not any fanservice apart from censored nude guys flexing muscles. The monsters had crazy character designs (e.g. monster crab in a diaper), but it worked. I loved the two faces of Saitama (serious baldy vs. pacified baldy) drawn all cartoon-like. It gave the show distinctiveness. Saitama resembled a Peanuts comic character when he entered a frustrated or distressed mood. There are variations in the character designs, including a bishounen character. Sometimes the atmosphere didn\u2019t match the characters\u2019 movements. For example, the wind blows. Saitama\u2019s cape flows as the direction of the wind, but Genos\u2019s hair would be at a standstill. There were little still images. The prefecture of the city, the city\u2019s moments of destruction, and background images were well-done. \\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man knows exactly what it is and doesn\u2019t pretend to be something it\u2019s not. It makes full use of its potential as a lighthearted comedy parodying off the superhero genre. For that, I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t take itself too seriously. I honestly did not get the references to the parody element of One Punch Man (I found out Kamen Rider was one), but I still enjoyed watching it. Madhouse has done it again! \\n\\n\r\n*If you dislike jokes that drag on, I advise reading the manga. That tends to be everyone else's go-to.",

Well, for the most part anyway.\r\nI'm going to say right now:\r\nThe art and animation was great. Very nicely done.\r\nThe sound? also pretty decent.\r\nThe OP was well choreographed, and got me excited for whatever was about to be thrown my way.\r\nThe characters? also well done. I found that Genos became a favourite of mine from the series, and was fun to watch interact with the other characters from the show.\r\nSo where does my issue lie? well, it was with the comedy. The issue I had withthe show was that in total, it probably gave me about 3 light-hearted chuckles. Maybe this was just a personal preference thing, and the comedy just wasn't something that'd entertain me, but I just felt let down by what the show was offering. I understood the jokes it presented but, in the end, it wasn't something that I found as entertaining as something like Nichijou, or The Daily Lives of High-school Boys.\\n\\n\r\nBasically what i'm getting at is even though I respect One Punch Man for getting such a fan-base around it, don't go into this show expecting to laugh your ass off.

            "content": "One Punch Man tells the story of Saitama, a hero capable of defeating enemies in just one punch.\r\nStory:\r\nOne Punch Man starts out with a curious premise for its story. How can an anime about enemies dying in one punch be any good? Well, in the case of OPM, it simply is. The anime blends humour to its plot extremely well, making the initial premise be possible to achieve. Yet, when you go deeper than the funny surface, you will find the plot surrounding the heroes association high echelons to be full of mystery and intrigues. This mixture of fun plot, and good quality plot makesit so OPM has an above average story compared to its genre. But still, due the nature of the anime, the plot is still relatively simple. Overall, the story achieved its goal, and went a bit further beyond by introducing interesting intrigues inside the hero association. \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAnimes are first and foremost animations. Some animes simply can not explore the full potential of animation if they are without fights and conversation centric. This is not the case of OPM. OPM delivers the best the anime industry has to offer. Intricate fights full of magnificent special effects are present in OPM since the beginning to the end. There is simply only one rating I could give here.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nLikewise, the sound on this anime is on point. Visual special effects often come with sound effects. The soundtracks were also very good and catchy, and got us hyped whenever they needed to.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI highly rate characters when they are well developed, or when they are highly charismatic, or both for the highest ratings. I think it is not a mystery here that the characters of OPM are extremely charismatic. All main characters and S heroes have a unique feel to themselves. Which is precisely what characters of this genre of anime are supposed to achieve. However, some characters have extra depth added to them. Mainly Genos and some of the other heroes, and Saitama to a certain extend. All in all, the characters in OPM are extremely charismatic, while having some character development in some cases.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOPM is the anime I looked for each week. I liked its humor, all the fights, and story. The hype was real. I understand this is a personal preference, but OPM was the best anime I watched in awhile. \\n\r\n10/10  \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOPM brings the best of the anime industry. The best animation I've seen in anime is here, the fights are excellent, the story is funny with some complexity, and characters are memorable. Eventually, I will forget about most anime characters, but I will not forget about Saitama for awhile. One Punch Man delivered a memorable experiences, and is one of the best animes out there.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nI seriously hope they produce more seasons in the future.",

            "content": "This anime is by far one of the best of the year 2015. Convincing through story, characters, animation, music and comedy, Madhouse delivers with their adaptation of the manga once again.\r\nWhat can you expect of this anime? Great comedy, a parody of clich\u00e9s and a fitting animation style, that's similar to GTO and Prison School. What can you not expect going into this show? Balanced battles. But without further blabbering, I'm going to say some words about the story.\r\nSaitama, also known as the OPM, is our way too strong and bored main protagonist, who is looking for strong enemies. Unfortunately he doesn't find any inhis normal life. Soon after that he joins the Hero Association and is faced with additional problems and meets enemies worthy (or not) of his presence. While that sounds like an outright 0815 story, that anybody could think of, it isn't. The Hero Association has its own internal complexity. And society is also a pain in the ass like in real life. Most importantly, Saitama's strength also switches the focus from battle to story and comedy.\\n\r\nEven though the story is good, it's still not the best out there. But it has a lot of potential with more seasons, because there are a lot of topics, that could be covered, like the #1 hero or the origin of Saitama's strength.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the story a great set of characters is introduced, that have as much a potential as the story. Our main protagonist is not our \"work hard to win\" or \"you can do it, just train a bit more\" 0815 hero, but a lazy, unemployed one who doesn't even seem like he could defeat a B-class hero. He is more normal than you would think. Despite of that he has clear goals and a defined personality, that's shown in the 12 episodes. Genos, our good-for-nothing, is Saitama's self-proclaimed disciple. He seems more like a 0815 hero, but his personality luckily develops and isn't as 2D as in the beginning. The other characters, that are introduced, are either over-the-top or as 0815 as they could be. But nobody cares, because they're exploited for the comedic aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow a few words about the splendid animation and sound/music, for what Madhouse is known for.  They keep a constant level of animation throughout the story and attract the eyes with almost flawless animated scenes and well used special effects. And don't forget the comedy art style. It's so funny to watch Saitama's ridiculous faces and reminds you of other great comedy anime such as Prison School or GTO. It fits too well to the comedy aspect and thus it earned my respect.\\n\\n\r\nAs well as the animation the music also shines in this anime. The opening and ending is really catchy. While the opening prepares you for the magnificence of the anime, the ending sums up your feelings at the end of the episode: \"I want more!!!\". The music used in the episodes is also good, but not too noticeable. And don't forget the vocal actors. Without them the characters wouldn't have the voices, that totally hit the topic of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man does an outstanding job at using the clich\u00e9s, that are used in recent anime and manga, to create a great parody. Not only does the art style assort well with the comedy, but the story and the characters are used properly to complete this anime. I enjoyed every episode and would be happy about a second season.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are also flaws. The story is not very complex and original as it relies heavily on the entertainment. If you analyse it at deep levels, you could say, that it's pretty average. Fans of deep and thrilling stories aren't satisfied by this level.\\n\r\nThe battles are another downside. As tense as they may seem, you're able to predict the outcome right away. So battles with an unexpected outcome can't be found here. But they're flashy, so if you don't mind predictable fights and just want to enjoy the comedy, then you can ignore it.\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man may not be for everyone, especially not for those, who are bored after episode 2, but it's something new in the comedy genre (anime) and everyone, who wants to lighten up their day after a hard workday, won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 (has potential)\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 (great)\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 (great)\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 (great)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 (great, but something was missing for the 10)\\n\r\nOverall: 8.6",

            "content": "REUPLOADED: \r\nYou really have to watch the whole show to pass judgement on it. OP Man is an anime that goes from simply parodying Shounen to analyzing society and what it means to be a hero. This anime is not simply joke after joke, and those who are worth their anime mettle must check this show out.\r\nStory/Character:\r\nThese two are tied together, so I'm going to just throw my entire analysis here. \r\n**There will be spoilers, but only to pertinent things.**\r\nThe first thing we're gonna look at is the character of Saitama himself. He is basically the end-game of every Shounen protagonist, and a deconstruction ofShounen in general. He's become so powerful that he's bored with life. Nobody challenges him anymore. He's become apathetic with life. He's literally lost most of his ability to feel emotions. \\n\\n\r\nHe lets the villains rant and go to full power (typical shounen fashion) to see if they give him a challenge, and then ends it with one punch. He lets the villains rant on and on about how amazing their powers are (again, shounen) before telling them to shut it.\\n\\n\r\nHis character evolves through the series, and only becomes more and more likable. He goes from a jokingly overpowered to...well, he doesn't change there.\\n\\n\r\nHis initial motivation for registering as a hero is to gain recognition for what he's done for everybody. But as the series goes on, we see that he's happy to throw his popularity under the rug in favor of doing the right thing. He loudly disregards the crowd's opinion of him, finding it idiotic that they have all this time to hate him. He acts like a jerk to give credit to the other heroes who actively risked their lives to try and stop a monster.\\n\\n\r\nHe is one of few genuine heroes in this whole series, despite there being a whole organization of them.\\n\\n\r\nBut he doesn't get a happy ending. In the finale, he easily defeats an alien emperor named Boros who had conquered the universe until he was bored of it. Essentially, Boros is a weaker, evil mirror of Saitama himself. He had moved throughout galaxies to get to Saitama, just looking for a good fight. \\n\\n\r\nDuring their fight, there are numerous parallels between Boros and Saitama in his dream back in episode 1. In both situations, the person had finally found someone who they can go all out against. Boros is insanely happy at finally being able to do so, and you can hear his joy in his voice as he unloads all he has. Unfortunately, Saitama is bored and ends the fight with a punch that has some weight behind it.\\n\\n\r\nAs Boros lies on the ground dying, he lets Saitama know that he could tell that he still wasn't going all out. Boros never stood a chance, it wasn't even a battle. His parting words to Saitama were essentially \"you're too strong for your own good\". Saitama doesn't respond and just walks away. He'll probably never find an opponent strong enough to challenge him. He's never going to find the battle thrill that Boros managed to find at the end of his life. It was an incredibly powerful scene that highlights just how lonely Saitama really is at the top.\\n\\n\r\nThe next character we'll look at is Genos. He's basically the typical Shounen protagonist. He has a dark past that traumatizes him, and he vows revenge and wants more strength to exact said revenge. His design is also incredibly cool.\\n\\n\r\nHis character isn't only there as a foil to Saitama. It's also there as a commentary on public perception. When he and Saitama first register with the Hero Organization, he gets a ton of fan mail even though he literally hadn't done anything yet. Why?\\n\\n\r\nBecause he's an S-rank hero and he looks cool. Thus, the public assume he's an amazing hero regardless of accomplishments. \\n\\n\r\nHis character also evolves as the series goes on, going from being fixated on revenge to becoming more of a hero, thanks to him constantly witnessing Saitama's heroics. In the final episode, he sees a ruthless hero murdering a bunch of enemies who had surrendered already, and notes that he could have turned into that person if he hadn't met Saitama.\\n\\n\r\nThe third character we have to look at is Licenseless Rider. He's the embodiment of a real hero, and resembles Saitama pre-training personality wise. Saitama recognizes him as a real hero, because they're so damn similar. One key difference, however, is that Licenseless Rider actually gets recognition for his work, and has a decent fanbase despite being basically a dude on a bike, through sheer force of personality and will.\\n\\n\r\nHis role in the serious arc is a deconstruction of a typical anime trope: the one where the hero, through sheer determination and the \"strength of the people who believe in him\" can bridge a power gap and somehow beat the villain. It looks like it would happen here too somehow. He gives a speech that shows his pure heroic personality, and brings the people on his side. They start cheering for him, putting all their faith in him...and then he gets taken out of the fight instantly. Reality ensued.\\n\\n\r\nThe other heroes all get their moments as well. Every hero in the show is portrayed in a very human way. One shits his pants, literally, when he meets an opponent he can't win. Another hero tries to help, but realizes he's basically useless compared to another hero. A group of heroes refuse to fall back and find another strategy because they know their strengths, and they have nothing but brute force to rely on. Even the most hateable hero has a point that you can agree on despite him going about it in the most dickish way.\\n\\n\r\nNow we take a look at the themes. There are three I want to touch on.\\n\\n\r\nThe first theme is society's tendency to build people up to knock them down. This is true in real life as well. We make celebrities immensely famous, but still delight in secret gossip and scandalous happenings until eventually, the celebrity can't take the pressure of having his/her every move being watched and just fades away. We expect famous people to be perfect, and delight in proving that they aren't.\\n\\n\r\nThe same thing happens in One Punch Man. Slightly exaggerated like most animes, but still. The straightest example of this is when an S-rank Hero fails to stop a monster (the top rank), the media immediately denounces him as a failure the next day. You can see it affecting him immensely.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example would be after Saitama destroys a world threatening meteor, but the public instead blames him for property damage from the debris. However, Saitama challenges these views and calls them out for the BS selfish asses they are.\\n\\n\r\nA third example would be that one asshat in episode 9. Words cannot properly describe how angry I am with that sack of baboon shit. Watch for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe second major theme is a question: what is a hero? The vast majority of the heroes in this show are selfish. They became a hero to become popular and possibly hit it big. The higher rank a hero is, the more popular they become.\\n\\n\r\nThere are heroes in this show who will actively try to discredit another hero for publicity, heroes that don't care about other heroes unless they're a certain rank, heroes who even sneer at being heroic unless it suits them properly.\\n\\n\r\nYet, during the first serious arc of the show, we see just what being a hero means. There's a hero who tries to build his fanbase by giving his rank and name before going in for a fight, but gets demolished. There are other heroes who are high rank and try to fight the monsters off, but end up getting annihilated.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, though, it's the people who stand up and fight no matter what who are the heroes. As the amazing Licenseless Rider says, \"If the Heroes run and hide, who will fight?\".\\n\\n\r\nA third theme is public perception. The main reason Saitama isn't immensely popular and known for his deeds is because of his appearance. He's basically always slouched over with an 'idgaf' face on, and his lame costume certainly doesn't help. When he displays his power, people can't quite believe that he did it, and accuse him of being a cheat. He simply doesn't have the charisma or appearance to garner much respect from anyone.\\n\\n\r\nYet, when Genos became a hero, he instantly develops a fanbase. Lamewads like \"Tank Top Tiger\" end up being much better known just because he looks more the part. The public practically always sides against Saitama just because of his appearance.\\n\\n\r\nDoesn't this mirror our society in a way? The more attractive looking people get a warmer reception, while the uglier/plainer ones have to work harder. Say what you want, but this is basically a proven fact.\\n\\n\r\nTying into the public perception theme is how popularity affects said perception. The most successful heroes are the most popular ones. Nobody quite acknowledges the lower ranked ones as much, and they eventually fade into obscurity. It kind of mirrors the manga/comic industry. Only the popular ones will continue getting printed and milked to death, while the less popular ones will get cancelled no matter how quality they are.\\n\\n\r\nI doubt I've even managed to cover everything, and I don't think I even properly conveyed the things I did go over in the damn essay I just wrote. This show references so many things that it makes the head swim.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI have not had the fight scenes of an anime impress me this much since Kill la Kill. The other notable part of this show is the famous 'idgaf' Saitama face. It's hilariously poorly drawn compared to the rest of the show, and depicts his attitude towards life extremely well. His posture also noticeably changes along with the art style when he's pumped up/serious. The art will warp stylistically in the middle of a battle. And the way they depict Saitama's one-punches. Dear lord, they're amazing. Overall, just pretty damn amazing overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe music ramps up at the appropriate times, and the voice actors are pretty damn good. Genos's battle theme in particular is memorable. That's all I have on this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nEven if you don't dive into the crazy amount of themes in this show, you will find enjoyment on the very surface. This show has tons of heart and personality, enough to keep you engaged throughout the whole thing.\\n",

If you're watching One Punch Man, you're probably there for some amazing fight scenes, with a few laughs along the way.\r\nOne Punch Man knocks both of those out of the park.\r\nThey almost give a John Wick-esque (if John Wick were also a comedy, at least) feeling to Saitama from the very first episode, which sets the expectations very well for the series. This way, you already know the endresult of each fight - you just don't know how it's going to get there. But trust, the path to that inevitable ending will always look stellar. And it does - every single time.\\n\\n\r\nThe humour in this show may or may not land as well as the action does, depending on your taste in humour, but for me, it hit more than it missed.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of One Punch Man isn't anything to write home about.

            "content": "Hey Vegeta, what does the scouter say about his power level?\r\nStory:\r\nThis anime takes the shounen approach and completely twists it around. Saitama is already the strongest person in the world and there is no becoming stronger or overcoming the odds, just one punch and the enemy is done for. So, how do you make this premise interesting for more than two episodes? Making it so that nobody believes he is really that strong and have him climb the ranks of the hero association little by little. This is as simple as it is clever and manages to make One Punch Man an enjoyable watch, asit also features the other heroes and their fights (which are often more traditional shounen action).\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWhat can I say? The action scenes look pretty cool, the character designs are incredibly creative and the whole world is very colorful, like in a classic superhero comic. On top of that, the face faults are some of the most funny I've ever seen.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI like how Saitama always sounds enormously bored, while everybody else is getting pumped up screaming. I also think I found my favourite Aoi Yuuki performance (<3). The opening reminds me of over the top 80s metal acts, which fits nicely (also the song is great), the ending however is very cacophonic, which my ears didn't like at all.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe huge number of colorful, creative and mostly over the top characters reminded me of One Piece, which I think is the manga/anime that is the best in creating characters. I think I can still recall every single hero and villain in the show, which is pretty impressive, since I usually even have problems with a shows main characters name. If it wasn't for all these hilarious guys (and girl), OPM would have only been half as enjoyable.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nYou probably already guessed that I enjoyed watching One Punch Man and that it is a definite recommandation, so let's take a look at the little things I didn't enjoy so much. The beginning is somewhat slow, as the one punch-thing gets old really fast, but the hero association is only introduced after a couple of episodes. I also would have liked Genos to have more depth (which may or may not happen in a later season). And the fact that Saitama is bound to win every fight prevents any tension from building, sadly. Aside from that, OPM is a great anime, no doubt.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9.2/10",

Story was... Meh... It\u00b4s good but don\u00b4t center in any point, it doesn't go anywere. Nothing about the misterious saitama's powers. A little bit of the geno's past, but nothing of the other world , and the rest of the \"S-class superheroes\", we don't know nothing about them. In general it's all about the problems of the society to solvede kaijus problem with the Hero's Association, and how saitama saves the day every once, making the efforts of the rest of super hero's useless. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8). The art it's very good, a lot of details. It's a shame many of the art don't be used better, for example in locations like the alien spaceship or the Hero's HQ, the scenes are so empty, generic desings, poorly detailed compared with the cities of another places in the anime. The fights are the strong point of the art: frenetic battles and charged of massive destruction, visual effects, and a great demostration of movements and powers, this fights rember me to Dragon Ball Z.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9). Heavy guitars, excellent intro, and the ending... meh...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7). All the characters was great, good desings, variety of skins, i see black heros, white heros, red heads, blondes, etc. It\u00b4s very rich in that sense, but falied giving them life and personality, the story don't tell much about life and past of the cast, except for geno's and saitama. And the Saitama's story and past in general was poorly developed, and was so insipid.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9). I laught with some scenes, the comedy it's another strong point of the anime, the funny scenes and the script in each chapter makes very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8). Was funny to see, but it leaves open questions, and many character might be have more protagonism, the story have no direction in general, and i don't expect much for the sequel. It's regular in the script and waste the characters.\\n\\n\r\n*note: The scene of the Bike guy beated by the Lord of sea was patetic and innecesary, the bike guy it's consient that is useless against powerful kaijus, and he doesn't matter to fight, he's wasn't fight for make time, he wasn't fight for distract and let the people run away, he's was fight because \"he have to do it\" there are better ways for suicide, but well, probaly he wants to be a martyr. And the Hero association looks like a popularity contest: all the heroes wants to up in the rank, for the fame and respect.",

I highly recommend it to anyone, it's mix of creative character design and amazing visuals made me fall in live with the show yet again! From the first episode I knew it was going to be an action show, however this show completely redefined the genre, it was badass! It's a great watchand something that I could reccomend to any of my friends",

            "content": "Strap yourselves in for an honest review of One Punch Man! \r\nOne Punch Man is the kind of anime that anyone could watch, whether or not they have seen other anime before. I have recommended this to non-anime watchers before and most often, it gets them into liking anime and watching more. Now let\u2019s jump into the meat of this review.\r\nStory:       7.7 / 10\r\nThe story of One Punch Man (which I will from now abbreviate as OPM) has but one goal: to be entertaining and comedic. As such, you shouldn\u2019t expect anything mind-blowing. I classify this kind of storyas \u201cbrainless fun\u201d. And fun it is. In my opinion, lacking an intense story would normally make something boring to me, but in this case, OPM fulfills its purpose so well, that I didn\u2019t find it in the least bit boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\t   9.7 / 10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here, the animation is great. Even the fight scenes that have very jagged lines and harsh movement work brilliantly, as these effects put you as viewer in the middle of the action. The environment looks great, the color palette is used well and the action scenes are great to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\t     9.2 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI watched OPM both subbed and dubbed, so I can confess that the voices were well done in both. At first, I was worried that the main character\u2019s English voice would be bad, since the main character is such a peculiar one to portray, but to my surprise, the English dub handled the voices pretty well. The sound during the action scenes were also good and the music would energize the viewer appropriately. The opening of OPM is also fun and upbeat \u2013 fitting perfectly with the overall tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:    6.9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nYou shouldn\u2019t expect amazing character arcs in OPM. Really, the only character that has any kind of real depth is Genos, whose character arc isn\u2019t over yet. In reality, the entertainment comes from the strange character that is Saitama (the main character). There is no real character development for him. I don\u2019t, however, feel like this takes away much of my enjoyment of the series. The character designs are very unique and interesting (and mostly hilarious).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:    9.8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nAs enjoyable as they come. The visuals, fights and humor make it fun to watch, no matter how many times you have seen it before. It is also short enough that it doesn\u2019t take much from you to re-watch it. Really fun, but might not be so appealing to you if you desire majorly intricate storylines or deep, emotional character arcs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\t         8.7 / 10\\n\\n\r\nVery close to a masterpiece. The main thing it lacks is emotional or psychological impact, so do not expect to cry or contemplate life after watching it, but do expect to laugh and enjoy it all the way through.\\n",

            "content": "In a nutshell, One Punch Man is an anime about a bald guy that enjoys fisting clown looking monsters under the watchful eye of Michael Bay. This is an action enthusiast's wet dream and it does its job extremely well. However, what it does tremendously well in terms of action and stunning visuals & audio,  it lacks in terms of everything else. \r\nThe story is simple, the world is in danger from \"monsters\". As it happens a guy named Saitama trains for 3 years straight and acquires the physique of Bruce Lee , strength of Hulk on steroids, speed of an asteroid and thepunching power of Mount Everest shot out of a barrett sniper rifle .  Saitama nonchalantly tears the monsters apart regardless of the situation. Big muscular Lion looking \"monster\". No problem. You try to one up this guy with a projectile? He can catch it. You're trying to run away? Check your closet, Saitama is already there. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no actual limit to his power. Which can be fun seeing as no one in this anime seems to have a clue about it and the situations that arise are both comedic and bombastic in scope. However that's all there is to it. There's no character progression, no real story to speak of . No room for improvement. Just one immortal character in a sea of pi\u00f1atas. So take that for what it is and you'll enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nVisual and audio effects are spectacular. The fights will make you want to do a lot of push ups and sit ups and drink plenty of juice. Don't forget to shave your head. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, what we have here is a young Master Roshi in his hay day punching a few circus performers. Thoroughly enjoyable for what it is. \\n\\n\r\n7 points. \\n",

            "content": "First of all, there is no way OPM is a perfect 10 or a \"masterpiece\". Everything OPM does, a certain other anime with over 300 episodes does better and does it for a very very long time without getting boring. \r\nThe JOKE here in OPM is one of those jokes where it leaves you amazed for a long time but it cannot be repeated. You make that joke and you finish it there. It is extremely funny and everybody likes it crazy but yuo can't keep repeating it. The magic of that joke has a cooldown. Once in a blue moon we get Tatsuya, Alucard,Raizel but that's all. You remember that generic shounen MC gif, yeah that's what I am talking about. The craving for OP heroes is real. THE ULTIMATE STRONGEST HERO, we were waiting for that. However what happens once we get it? It doesn't get better than that so it starts to fade after a time. No matter how good the joke is, you can't keep telling it and that's the problem with OPM. Now do I want Saitama to be beaten? Absolutely not because that would defeat the whole purpose so that's also not an option. Then why the hell did I gave a 9 to that show.\\n\\n\r\n1- Saitama is OP and no matter how repetitive it is, I would rather have a repetitively OP hero instead of a repetitively lame hero we see in 99% of shounen genre.\\n\\n\r\n2- Side characters. In this case we are only interested in Genos. The way he is designed actually shows that even the creators of this show was aware of the repetition so they added Genos, the hero we know so well from any other shounen. He is the exact opposite of Saitama and having both of them actually does a damn good job at showing the contrast between the two. \\n\\n\r\nGenos is flashy as fck, from his hair color, hair design, eyes, his body to his combat style  and even his mentality. It screams the word flashy. Saitama on the other hand is made to be the most simple character. Genos lives that Ichigo syndrome being a generic shounen hero he is, and he gets stronger overtime and every battle he fights is always on even grounds, back and forth epic combats. Saitama on contrary is ONE PUNCH. Genos have that tragic past like every shounen hero while Saitama is just a dude who become a hero as a hobby. They fill the void Saitama leaves behind with Genos. Genos provides standart drama and eyecandy to the show and Saitama provides the epic feeling you rarely get. And please note that, epic things are epic because other things are ordinary. If all we saw was epic, it would get boring and thus NOT EPIC.  And that's why I gave it a 9. They somewhat keep the magic alive and doesn't overuse the EPIC feeling. Also anytime a character realizes Saitama's strength, I am watching for that reaction. So there is tons of material too.",

            "content": "one punch man is a journey a will never forget as i followed saitama an average guy who's a hero for fun who seems to have the ability to kill anything in one punch (Thus the title) but with the information given to us saitama is \"human\" and got his power by doing \"100 push-ups,100 sit-ups and a 10 kilometer run everyday\" but given saitama's power and how many times he has seem to save the world or cities a-z no one seems to acknowledge him nobody evens knows his name.\r\n So you follow saitama as this comedic journey of him simpily one punching everythingbut the series would get boring over time right, Wrong this is where the second main character genos who is a blonde cyborg seeking revenge for his parents death every typical shounen plot you know after trying to become hokage or looking for the legendary treasure when genos and saitama first meet when  genos was unable to kill an enemy and saitama one shots it genos is shocked by saitama power and insist on becoming his discple.\\n\\n\r\n So what i don't like is genos plays the role of the punching bag just to show you how strong these monsters are before saitama kills them in one punch that is my only overall problem and the fact that it ended given alot of manga material was left unadapted.  \\n\\n\r\nif you didn't know one punch man was origanlly a poorly drawn web comic before re-drawn into a manga but everyone is saying that one punch man is the saveur of anime when anime never needed to be saved just look at all the great series that came out this 2015 was outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: One punch man is a fun light hearted series but it can be serious when it wants to it goes funny to serious real quick but it's really a parody of every mainstream shounen if you watch this series there are references left and right this series really is amazing there nothing else i can say without spoiling so i highly recommend you check it out.",

            "content": "There's always that one show that comes out every year that gains a certain level of popularity within the anime community. A LARGE amount of popularity in some cases, that creates a certain level of conflict between viewers. One half sees it as the greatest thing ever made, and the other half sees it as overrated garbage. The hype gets so big that eventually its value gets misconstrued and people tend to join sides to just join sides. One such show happens to have aired this year, and it definitely has left a lasting impression on the community.\r\nHi, welcome to WattheWut. This is a reviewof the Fall 2015 anime series One Punch Man. Let's get it on!\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nNow, before we get into this, let me just address both sides of this show's viewership. We have the people who think of this show as one of the greatest action shows in existence, showing its brilliance of parody and satire by poking fun at typical shounen and superhero tropes while still managing to shine a new light on the genre. The other side views OPM as a horribly overrated failure of a parody or \"satire\" that relies solely on reused tropes and \"good animation\" because people sometimes shit on this show's animation just to shit on it. Well...Lord knows neither of you are...completely right. You're both only half right.\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to tell you where I stand on the issue. One Punch Man is good. It is a good show. That's it though. It is at best good and at worst good. So...\\n\\n\r\nNow, people were originally shitting on me for saying that OPM is just the Attack on Titan or Kill la Kill of 2015, because its hype is so overblown that it gets way too much praise than it deserves. That's not a false statement, because as of recently, One Punch Man has reached the #11 spot on MAL. People seem to think this show is better than Hajime no Ippo, Gurren Lagann, Cowboy Bebop, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, etc. That's sort of ridiculous, not gonna lie. \\n\\n\r\nEnough about that, let's get into it.\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man takes place in a world where monsters apparently appear on a whim out of nowhere and constantly threaten the safety of the people. So it's Florida. Please don't hurt me.\\n\r\nTo combat this, various heroes fight these monsters to defend the people, each with their own unique powers and skills. So it's New York.\\n\r\nOne hero in particular is so strong that he is able to defeat any individual with a single punch. The outwardly bland-looking Saitama has become so strong, in fact, that he has become bored with hero-ing and longs for an opponent who can actually give him a challenge.\\n\\n\r\nThe obvious question that comes up every time is \"if he defeats every opponent, doesn't that remove all tension?\" Well, yeah it kinda does. Knowing that he cannot be beaten and is stronger than any opponent kind of sets itself up to be predictable and boring and seems kind of pointless...though I believe that is the point.\\n\r\nLike, do you really walk into any superhero film expecting the hero to lose? Do you really think Iron Man's gonna lose to anyone he faces? Do you REALLY think Superman is going to lose to...well, anyone? I mean, for fuck's sake, the guy beat Goku in Death Battle twice, and the second time ScrewAttack had to make a huge event out of popular demand to tell you TO YOUR FACE that Superman cannot lose. Yet no one really complains about this.\\n\r\nOne Punch Man's purpose is to poke fun at this fact, ending almost every conflict abruptly and anticlimactically to comedic effect. Whether this actually works is up to debate.\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man, above anything else it is, is a comedy anime. Comedy is, in general, subjective and the enjoyment of it varies from person to person. Now, yes there IS a basis from how to write good comedy, but in general not everything is going to appeal to everyone. I personally don't find Monty Python funny. It's a type of humor that I just sort of don't care for, but people view it as comedic genius. Okay. That's opinion. It's subjective. I personally find Jo Koy funny because the comedy is relatable to me and I understand where he's coming from, but I'm assuming that other people don't find him funny. Who's right?\\n\r\nThe problem with One Punch Man's comedy is that it's a type of comedy that relies on an abrupt stop in tension. Constantly. Over and over again. I affectionately refer to this series as \"One Joke Man\" because it tends to use the same joke over and over again. The only other kind of humor is deadpan humor, wherein Saitama's reactions to certain situations as if they don't matter or taking small matters too seriously are the basis. THAT'S funny. Like, it's legitimately funny. Sort of. The problem becomes that you get desensitized to the comedy to the point where it just becomes white noise. \\n\r\nNow, while most of the comedy IS subjective, there ARE instances of where it's just poorly timed. I'll expand on this at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing people mention with this show is the characters. I've heard from people who love the manga that the show is all about the side characters, and that they are the more interesting ones. That's funny because while watching this series, it felt like Saitama was the most intriguing character in a sea of Mary Sues because these characters are not interesting.\\n\r\nSaitama is actually a VERY good character. In contrast with the world he lives in, he doesn't take anything seriously. His blatant lack of motivation and deadpan reactions are possibly the only comedic moments in the show. You also come to understand why he is the way he is. It's that feeling when you play like Pok\u00e9mon and you have all of your Pok\u00e9mon to level 100, and you just keep replaying over and over and you just mow down opponents at ease. It's not fun. And that's Saitama.\\n\r\nThe problem is the other characters. Genos, a cyborg with a vendetta who forces himself onto Saitama as his disciple, is introduced into the show, and in contrast with Saitama, is super serious about his job and constantly walks with a stick up his ass. He's apparently very strong, but you wouldn't know because every opponent he faces ends up being defeated by Saitama. You also don't get to know anything further about his backstory, and this wouldn't be a problem because the manga is ongoing...but this is a Madhouse anime, so there will most likely never be a second season...maybe...\\n\r\nThe only other character I feel stood out was Mumen Rider, a C-Class hero with the ability to ride a bike without a license, also apparently Japan requires you to have a license to ride a bike. What? We're there hit and runs being done on bikes? How many horrible bike crashes clogged up the highways of the Nippon? He has no powers whatsoever, yet consistently and without complaint rides into battle...and fails. This will be explained later in the review.\\n\r\nThe other characters in this show feel as if they're there to...be there. They don't serve a purpose other than showing how powerful Saitama is...but that would be easier if we actually had a definable level for how strong they are.\\n\r\nThere are all of these huge threats that exist, yet because we always see Saitama wreck them in an instant, we never get a sense of how powerful they are. We see the more powerful characters fight...but they mostly lose after a drawn out fight, a fight which Saitama ends in an instant. We DO get one scene of Tornado killing a huge threat, but she's the second most powerful person in the generic league of heroes, so it really doesn't matter. We don't have a basis for what constitutes as powerful, so we just assume that everyone is just shitty at their job. They feel...pointless.\\n\\n\r\nI will have to address all of these at the end of the review when I talk about theming.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, that's the main problem with this show. You leave with this sense of pointlessness after every episode. You essentially feel like you wasted your time...though again, that might be the point considering Saitama's character, but it's still inexcusable.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if all of that is what's wrong with One Punch Man, what's good about it?\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man was made under the Madhouse flag, but was mainly animated by a bunch of freelance animators who have done amazing work on other series. They were all invited into the project by Natsume Shingo, the director of the Bones comedy Space Dandy, which, I don't know about you, looks freaking amazing. As such, One Punch Man is one of the best looking anime in the past DECADE. It's fluid, it's well-directed, and you feel the scale of just how big and powerful everything feels.\\n\r\nWhat's also notable is that One Punch Man was made on a very tight budget. I find it funny that people will try to shit on this show's animation by saying it's inconsistent, but, again, tight budget. Evangelion fans will talk all day about how amazing the animation is, despite the fact that, because of the limited budget, several lapses in quality and LARGE AND ABSURD uses of still frames throughout its runtime. Just saying.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST for this show is pretty good as well, though it really is just used as a backdrop and an elevation tool for the hype. This show IS hype, and the music and animation ramp it up to this degree. Really, anyone who shits on the aesthetic value in this show just really does not like this show.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of hype, the opening for One Punch Man has been slowly gaining my respect. I originally was opposed to it, as I too was feeling the annoying hype that is the OPM fanbase, but you really get to appreciate it as you watch it more. The opening is the show incarnate, extreme levels of hype and Saitama being overpowered and the other characters being there just because they have to.\\n\\n\r\nOk, here is the section of the review where I shall discuss theming, problems involving adapting it from print to screen, and the difference between parody and satire.\\n\\n\r\nI have heard the terms \"parody\" and \"satire\" thrown around aimlessly when discussing One Punch Man. Most will point out that OPM is parodying superhero tropes, while some cynics will call it a failed satire... Allow good ol' WattheWut to educate you.\\n\\n\r\nParody refers to the humorous and exaggerated imitation of a certain style or work for the purpose of comedic effect. Satire refers to the use of humor to criticize or expose problems with a certain topic, mainly political. Satire is mainly used in the West, and is not nearly as prominent in anime.\\n\r\nPeople need to understand that parody and satire are not completely separate. Satire is actually derived from parody. A parody CAN include elements of satire within it, but satire, no matter what, includes elements of parody.\\n\r\nThat being said, I have heard people criticize this show for being a failure of a satire because it \"makes fun of the tropes but uses them anyway.\"\\n\r\nI direct you to the 2005 Kyoto Animation adaptation of the light novel series Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu, or The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Haruhi was a show which was created to parody the section of anime which features high schoolers who also secretly have some sort of supernatural, sci-fi superpower thing going on, such as Shakugan no Shana and the like. However, it not only subtly mocked these tropes but also WAS these tropes. Rather than simply make fun of them, it also made the point of BEING them in order to fully embody the feeling of what those shows were and still are. It makes fun of them...but also acknowledges that and is used to sort of grow an appreciation for them.\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is basically that but for the superhero and shounen action genres. The only way it could fully embody these tropes is to BE these tropes.\\n\r\nIt also helps that satire is not as prevalent in Japan as it is in the West.\\n\r\nAlso, if you are still wondering if OPM is a parody or a satire, I direct you towards the MAL genre tags, where you'll find that it FUCKING SAYS PARODY RIGHT THERE.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are certain things you can't excuse just by pinning \"parody\" on it.\\n\r\nFlat characters and horribly timed comedy are two things you cannot just throw under that umbrella. Why? Because the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya parodies a genre of anime FILLED TO THE FUCKING BRIM with generic characters and still manages to have a cast of deeply intriguing characters. One Punch Man has a whole cast of characters I can't care about because they are super flat. The comedy is poorly timed...but I suspect there's a reason behind that.\\n\r\nWhen adapting OPM from print to screen, it suffered from a couple of pacing issues. I heard it takes SEVERAL chapters for the House of Evolution arc to even end, and that takes place in two episodes. So, when considering the pacing of when Saitama punches a villain in one hit and how it feels like it happens all the time, that would help explain it but not fully excuse it. This would also help explain the flat characters, but, again, not fully excuse it. But you have to remember that Madhouse was on a super tight budget on this, so 12 episodes was the most they could do. The pacing of OPM is both a blessing and a curse. Condensing that much content helps the pacing of the story move forward...but not the pacing of the comedy and the characters. This brings me to theming.\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is at its weakest at its comedic moments...but surprisingly strong in its serious moments. Saitama's whole dilemma is that of a person who longs for a challenge. When a fighter eventually becomes the champion and easily defeats everyone...it's like a living hell. Having some NOT who they can't damage but RATHER who can damage THEM excites them, brings life back into them. The first episode of the show proves this, as Saitama dreams not of facing an opponent he cannot destroy, but of an opponent who can prove that he is still human. That he can still be hurt.\\n\r\nAnother theme heavily used in OPM is what it means to be a hero. For this, I will compare Saitama and Mumen Rider.\\n\r\nSaitama is the strongest man in the world. He can defeat everyone and often saves several lives doing so. But he is seen as a villain in the eyes of the public, ridiculed and ignored for what he does, yet he doesn't care, because he doesn't and has never wanted appreciation. He's doing this because he wants to.\\n\r\nMumen Rider is possibly the weakest character in the show. He never defeats anyone, yet he stood before the Deep Sea King unfazed. He gets the glory for the defeat of the Deep Sea King...but only after Saitama sacrifices his image for him.\\n\r\nBoth heroes embody the ideal hero...and they are in a world where popularity and power are how we determine the greatness of a hero in our society.\\n\\n\r\nBut...the timing of the show kills this.\\n\\n\r\nRight when a huge emotional moment happens, the show decides to make a fucking joke, removing any ounce of respect you had going for it. A huge emotional moment may happen at a climax...and then a joke is made...poorly timed to boot. This show has no idea what it wants to do, and it just keeps screwing itself over.\\n\\n\r\nNow, we must discuss the origins of One Punch Man. One Punch Man was developed by ONE, an individual who wrote the original web novel. FOR FUN.\\n\r\nOne Punch Man was literally written because someone was bored. \\n\r\nHowever, after adapting it to manga format, the artist behind Eyeshield 21 redrew the entire series, and from around the point of the Boros fight, ONE decided to actually take the series seriously.\\n\r\nIf OPM seems dumb to you, it's probably because it is. But, that does not mean there can be some meaning to it. Neon Genesis Evangelion was a show made by a down-on-his-luck Director who was struggling in his life that contained theming essentially included because it looked cool. It is now seen as some sort of symbolic icon in the anime industry and remains a landmark in Japanese animation. Because in art, you are meant to find your own meaning to it, and not everyone will get the same experience from it because art is THE most subjective construct on this planet. ONE may have written it for fun, but there was definitely some sort of meaning put in there, whether consciously or unconsciously, because every artist will put some aspect of themselves into the work they create. Am I implying that One Punch Man is this deep and symbolic piece of art? In some respects, yes. In some respects, no. I am simply implying that I can't exactly put it down for what it does well. Just saying. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nThis show is certainly neither amazing nor bad. One Punch Man is a very entertaining show. In fact, this is one of the only shows I would watch every week as it aired because of just how easy and instantly gratifying it was to watch every episode. Sure, you leave every episode with a feeling of pointlessness, but you're never bored. It's like eating a Twinkie. They're delicious as you eat it, but you always feel like you're wasting your calories and have this disgusting fatty taste in your mouth. And millions of strange people shit on you for not loving it or hating it and castrate you for doing so-wait...\\n\\n\r\nThis show is deserving of all of its praise and all of its criticisms, and would make a perfect gateway anime for new viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I have decided to award One Punch Man with a Medium Priority rating. Watch it if you feel like it, but it's certainly not a high priority.",

            "content": "Overview: Ahh, One Punch Man. With any show attaining this level of popularity, there are bound to be reviewers and people who deride the show, and are overly critical for the purpose of appearing \"different\". While I wouldn't consider myself a fanboy, I certainly cannot see the reason for many of the complaints that people have, and I read them as impartially as possible. I went into this show not expecting a lot. However, watching even the first few episodes with an open mind, I was blown away by just how good this anime truly is. I went from being skeptical based on its descriptionto a show that I would count among my favourites. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Initially, the show appears just to be a parody of shounen battle series. Had OPM just stuck to the formula of Saitama just annihilating everything in one punch, I would have been disappointed. The layering of the story with the introduction of Genos and the Hero Association and the sort of commentary it makes about the substance of heroes is where OPM truly shines. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art of this show is magnificent. The show is vibrant, and all the characters look great. Making Saitama go from MS Paint-tier to incredibly well drawn is a bit of a gag, but it isn't overused to the point that I found it irritating. The landscapes and the animation are phenomenal, and there really isn't anything I would want changed. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound gets the job done, but the OST is not phenomenal. There were no truly memorable tracks. The sound effects are done quite well, and the voice acting is great. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are beautifully drawn and animated, and I enjoyed the incredibly large and colourful cast of seemingly over-powered heroes. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show is fun to watch. The animation and art dazzle while the story is consistently funny and interesting to watch. Every week I would look forward to watching Saitama and Genos embark on their crazy exploits. There was nothing about this show that really annoyed me or raised any flags, it was enjoyable the whole way through. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: One Punch Man, although being incredibly divisive about the quality of its parody and many claims of it being \"overrated\" provided me with a show that I personally really enjoyed. If you're tired of filler and poor and repetitive cliches in shounen anime, I would highly recommend One Punch Man for an enjoyable and lighthearted watch. If you're craving a show that is funny yet still provides enough seriousness for hearty contemplation of its themes and issues, One Punch Man delivers on those fronts with ease and finesse. Overall: 10/10. \\n\\n\\n",

When the characters start to get serious, when they fight and all the explosions are just like \"WOW OH MY GOD AAAAAAAA\", great soundtrack and i've seen a lot of parodies of the OPM Opening, i sang it every time y listened to it (it made me yell, too powerful), the ending theme is amazing, i listen to it and its like to listed a soft song after an epic battle. If the characters voices can be here too, i'll say they were just amazing, great job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10): I and many people can identify themselfs with this one, i relate too much to saimata (many people can say the same lol), Genos is a great character and his purpose to fight is cool, Mumen Rider is the best, he is the average human, but he wants to be a hero and people know he may be weak but is putting 100% of his effort bringing peace to them, Sonic is great (the seiyuu did a good job on some phrases, quotes, etc). The first time i see variety of characters like Pri Pri Prisoner, me and my dad laughed to dead.\\n\\n\r\nPS: I wanted to see more Fubuki ;__;\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): I dont think i have much to say on this one, when i see Saitama or another character doing epic fights (Mumen Rider, Atomic Samurai, Bang, etc) gave to us. I literally jumped on my bed when i saw them fighting.\\n\\n\r\nI think everyone who liked it wants a 2nd season! (and waiting for the OVAS!!)\\n",

            "content": "The reason why One Punch Man stands out from other shounen action anime is that the story-telling is fast-paced.  It doesn't dwell on lengthy explanations through character dialogue and back story as it just goes straight to the point, which made the anime so much more enjoyable as you are always engaged throughout the show.  And to top it off, the comedy in this show especially between the main characters really adds to the enjoyment of the show. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story itself is just like your typical shounen action anime, no surprises there.  - Good fighting against evil.  However, as mentionedearlier, the pace of the story-telling is what makes this show stands out.  You are given enough backstory and explanation to understand why things are happening - the reasons and motives behind why the antagonists are attacking etc., but it's not lengthy where some viewers can easily get bored.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 \\n\r\nThe art is great considering that they were only given an average budget (so I heard).  One thing that especially stood out was the character art - both comedic and serious facial expressions of characters were drawn on point and really set the mood of the scene.  The actions scenes also had great flow to it as well and you the exaggeration of the art as certain points really makes you feel the 'impact' of the attacks (especially Saitama's one punch).\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe OP song really gets you excited and hyped, and really suits the ambience of the show - upbeat and fun.  The background music as well during battles and comedic scenes, sets the tone perfectly.  No complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nEach and every character has their own very unique and strong personality that are very extreme to one another, which makes the characters very likeable.  Especially with the two main protagonists, Saitama and Genos, whose personalities are very different, but their interactions with each other makes for very good comedy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nWith everything combined - the story, art, sound and character, it makes this show very enjoyable if you are after something light-hearted with action.",

            "content": "MAdhouse never ceases to fail us with great anime coming out every year and this title is no exception. One Punch Man is a series that is based on a Web Comic that is a parody of modern and old school Marvel and DC based superhero comics. \r\nThis anime tells the story about Saitama, the self-proclaimed average hero trying to find stronger evil to fight. His power the ability to defeat any opponent in, you guessed it....just One Punch. The main story line is very simple and easy to follow for every viewer, new or veteran and that what makes it great. No need forlong drawn out explanations for everything like in most Shounen/Seinen anime. However I find it a little too predictable in most fights so do not get your hopes up for any game changers or major plot twist. There is also a lot of characters which doesn't give the anime a ton of time to go into deep understanding of its characters, including it's MCs.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a great art style which captures the comic book style artwork most people are used to. The music is also on point as well. Everything but the Ed impressed me quite a bit and are extremely catchy. Its a great aesthetic viewing experience with audio and visuals.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a great anime for all types of viewers: newcomers casuals, elitist, etc. The action is very appealing and its also one of the funniest anime to be released this year. Its definitely a must watch for any superhero or comic book fans out there. \\n",

            "content": "ONE PUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNCH\r\nOne Punch Man is probably the pinnacle of shounen anime. And before Goku/Superman fanboys get on my butt by saying Goku or Superman is stronger, let's get this straight.\r\nSaitama is meant to be a parody character. He's suppose to be the embodiment of all the plot armor/ protag hacks that occur in all shounen anime. Trust me, if Goku wasn't the main character and becoming Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan, he probably would have died in like three episodes. The idea of Saitama is that he kills everything with one punch, so please, let's respect this idea and leave the fanboy argument.\r\nNow that that'sout of the way, One Punch Man is definitely a new addition to the shounen series. Yeah, it's pretty much full blown shounen from the get go, but the idea of a totally average human being with no enhancements and no dark back story becoming so overpowered is completely new. Saitama's just this guy who goes around in a yellow jump suit rescuing people as a hobby but get's completely annoyed when people start to idolize him. He just wants to live a quiet normal life catching villains. Then our cyborg hottie Genos pops into Saitama's life and they become hero buddies! Fighting crime and all that jazz.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you look a little under, you can see the author included aspects of social media and different types of people that exist in the world. Noob crushing, public shaming, hate letters, One Punch Man has got it all. Of course Saitama being Saitama, he just brushes them away like a fly, but it still doesn't change that those sort of people exist. It kind of comments on our society like that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd seeing as Mad House animated it, I was actually kind of scared to see how it would turn out. Honestly, Tokyo Ghoul didn't exactly have the best animated fight scenes and One Punch Man, which is all about fight scenes, wouldn't really seem like something Mad House would do. But I guess they got extra funding or what with the success of their recent animes, because the fight scenes were pretty good. There were little awkward moments and when the tension needed to be pumped, it was pumped in all the right places. Definitely a move forward for Mad House. I give it a thumbs up.\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is a must watch for old and new watchers. It's cynical comedy and action packed animation will definitely make you laugh and impressed. Can't wait for season two!",

            "content": "One Punch Man or OPM, was one of the most hyped anime's of 2015 and has not decline by that much in terms of overall rating from the general public. The story revolves around Saitama, a non-employed male who chooses to become a superhero for fun. This inspires many of children to become active and such in order to become like Saitama even though it's impossible. The anime takes on an unrealistic take on things. Nothing wrong with that, but sometimes logic provides to make a more exciting show. Many of people believe that the anime had and still has a lot of potential whichI agree with, but for now I would have to rate it an overall grade of 8. Story is developed well at the very beginning of the show, in which Saitama is searching for a strong opponent that will give him a challenge, but is hard to expand on because we know Saitama to be able to beat every villian with one punch, otherwise he wouldn't be OPM anymore. Art is good, action scenes were greatly produced and are very smooth. Sound is about average, but I gave it an 8 because the sound track fits the show nicely and are inputted during the scenes at the proper times. Character are still not too developed but that's because there are only 12 episodes and 1 OVA. There are many questions to the anime, but i do wish that they gave more insight on Geno's past for at least one episode. Enjoyment was a bit above average. I was never in too much of a rush to watch the next episode but I did enjoy them when I watched them. The comedy is satire, and the action scenes are great. This is my personal opinion of One Punch Man in which my overall rating is an 8.",

            "content": "The thing that stands out the most about One Punch Man is the uniqueness of its premise. A guy who can beat anything and anyone in a single punch. You'd think that would be boring. Yet the way it's done causes a chain reaction that makes this show completely and utterly enjoyable. This was the show that finally got me on my way to filling the show hole I had after finishing Hunter x Hunter (2011). I would still be wallowing in my pain if it wasn't for this show. It's fun, it's funny, and it's downright awesome.\r\nThe characters are fun and exciting. Saitama (OnePunch Man) is hilarious in his completely calm way he handles every threat, no matter how severe it actually is. Genos is a fun character to watch grow and change as he grows closer to Saitama and comes to admire him more and more. And the literal ARMY of supporting characters are basically all amazing. The bike hero, Mumen Rider, and all the villains and the S-classers are all great. Trust me.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is OUTSTANDING! Every single fight scene is like a work of art. The fluidity of the actions happening on screen is simply splendid and the way the show transitions from the fight scenes to the less detailed and fluid comedy or scenes with no real movement is spectacular. Still though. The fight scenes are AMAZING! And I would be hard pressed to find a flaw in the animation of them. The OP is also pretty outstanding. It makes the show seem awesome and gives you all these images of Saitama beating things to show you how truly awesome he is. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy as well is pretty great. There are a few moments when it feels slightly forced, but never to the point where it feels like they're begging you to laugh. Mostly the comedy is flowing and natural and feels effortless, like they didn't even think people would find it funny, but it's hilarious. For example, the FLY! THE FLY! THE FLY SCENE IS AMAZING! And it makes you laugh, even though it doesn't feel like they're TRYING to make you laugh.\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is awesome. If you have a show hole from a supreme action show (like Hunter x Hunter) it's the perfect thing to help fill it. The characters are awesome and the animation is impeccable. I highly recommend this awesome superhero parody thing of an anime!",

Many characters have fast paced story told for them, just to give flavor to the character, which works well. The main thing is humor which is very well executed.\r\nArt: Main thing. The art quality overall is ultra impressive. Animation is just the best I have ever seen. On fights they push animation fundamentals to the limit, very well executed. I don't think I need to say much else.\r\nSound: Cool music, and very suitable and detailed sound effect for all little things. And very good use of sounds, giving impact tothe action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There are a lot of superheroes, everyone with a well defined role and uniqueness, fitting very well with their appearance.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Certainly on my top 5 most enjoyed animes. For the first time on a shounnen I have seen fights dense enough to satisfy me. Less talking, less smoke fading out, faster actions. There is talking and padding out in the middle of fights, but in most cases the action sequences last at least 5 seconds. The fight on the last episode was really amazing. They have put a lot of work on the actions scenes and its really appreciable.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like to see action and fights amazingly animated, this is a must.",

            "content": "TLDR: The only people rating it low are those who are too \"indie\" or \"hipster\" to enjoy popular anime and are those who you'd probably find hate/underrate all of the following popular anime: Shingeki, No Game No Life, SAO (although that's actually bad) and etc.\r\nWhile One Punch Man isn't the groundbreaking savior of anime that some are claiming it to be, it is still very good, and extremely enjoyable.\r\nOne Punch Man excels at what it's there for, pure unadulterated action/fighting with unique and interesting characters, thematic soundtracks, and an EXCELLENT standard of quality for its animation. \r\nPros; \r\nExcellent fight animation quality. Like seriously that shitis goooooooooood, on par with anime such as UBW remake. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is fitting and adds to the spectacle, it accompanies the animation well and assists in delivering the message, making you hype when you're meant to be, making you sullen or sad when the scene dictates it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are unique and for an shonen anime, rather well developed and each have their own flavor/unique identity. Honestly the most plain and underdeveloped character is the protagonist Saitama, but that is deliberate and is part of how the show presents itself.\\n\\n\r\nCon (Honestly this is the only real con)\\n\r\nStoryline is as you would expect, near nonexistent. There's a couple plot points introduced that sort of don't go anywhere, but that's per course of what you signed up for, no one is watching OPM for its captivating story or dramatic plot twists. We watch OPM to see ridiculous fights with supreme animation quality and an epic soundtrack going off in the back. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is so simple, yet so compelling. It's about as stripped-down in terms of world building and characters as you can get without going too far. At least what you do get is exactly what the storyteller wants you to receive, which is a lot of funny and cool stuff.\r\nI don't feel like the story in One Punch-Man is necessarily amazing, but it works for what the message is meant to portray: Saitama, the protagonist, is so powerful, his superheroing is boring. He somehow got so overpowered, the joy of the fight, the struggle to survive and the \"kill-or-be-killed\" is utterly erased from hislife. Try to find a story about this sort of character elsewhere and you probably won't find it. Thus, we have a very original, unblemished premise.\\n\\n\r\nThis premise is born out of the cliched tropes used over and over again in your typical superhero storytelling in order to turn it on its head. Most of what happens is the opposite of what usually happens in a typical hero's journey. \\n\\n\r\nUsually, the hero is young, especially in anime/manga, and he starts out weak, but grows stronger and stronger as the story progresses through loads of training. He's usually not the most powerful character in his story world. His antagonist usually is. But, Saitama is 25-years-old and just IS the most powerful right from the beginning; there is nary an antagonist who can withstand being punched by him more than one time.\\n\\n\r\nWith a story premise like this, where do you go from there? It might seem like it would dead-end, but that's why this anime is so great. It actually goes into that territory to reveal that it doesn't have to be a dead-end, after all. We find that our hero is not the picture of perfection, thus we can have conflict, after all. He is very strong, but not a perfect human being. He's a good guy, but he has no job and he's not the smartest guy out there, nor is he the most handsome. Hardly. He even has a totally bald head, which is about as opposite the typical anime/manga hero as it gets, with their usually trademark crazy green/blue spiky weird hairstyles.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, his sidekick disciple, Genos, is younger, better-looking and cooler than he is! (Well, Genos is a cyborg, so....) Genos is so much more the hero-in-progress than Saitama, but he is the support role in the story, not the main character. Again, a typical trope turned upside-down. He is also one of the few characters that recognizes Saitama as the over-powered being that he is.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to the next interesting aspect of this story: Saitama, while being ridiculously strong and regularly saves people and the world from destruction, never really gets the recognition or praise he is due by other people. In fact, he is barely known by anyone and is even sometimes despised by others because he allows other heroes in the Registry to take credit for his accomplishments. (Talk about a humble guy.) And, because of this, he is often shown sporting some jealousy of Genos when he is opening up the packages of fan mail he regularly receives, full of gushing praise for how \"kakkouii\" he is. All Saitama gets is a thank you note from another hero in the Registry, if not some hate-mail.\\n\\n\r\nIn this world, there are hundreds of Registered \"heroes\" and they are all ranked according to video game standards, \"S\" being the highest, while \"C\" seems to be the lowest rank. A \"C\"-ranked hero is basically a regular human being who is just brave enough to intervene in stopping purse-snatchers and muggers as they are in the act of committing their crimes. There are hundreds of these guys, and we see how cut-throat it is being in the Registry. \\n\\n\r\nMumen (Licenceless) Rider, who is just a guy on a bicycle, stands as the Everyman. He is brave, but powerless, and will fight against his own anger at himself while trying to defeat a monster beyond his scope. You realize you relate to him the most because he is a metaphor for every human being whoever tried to live their life in this rat-race of a world we live in. It is merciless and we are powerless to control what happens, and to even do anything about it. Those few who are capable rise to the top (like the higher-ranked heroes with real superhuman abilities), whether they deserve it or not, and they usually do not. Neither do the higher-ranked heroes, as they are self-centered egomaniacs only concerned with how popular they are, just like real people who do well in life often are.\\n\\n\r\nI see a lot of Gintama in this anime. Gintama fans should totally dig this, but where Gintama parodies specific animes/mangas and Japanese culture, One Punch-Man parodies this one section of anime/manga/comics tropes, which results in a masterful parody of modern life itself. Check this out for the laughs, the turned-on-their-heads tropes and the fantastic characters who grow on you very quickly.",

            "content": "One punch man is a truly refreshing anime that has brought new life to ONE's original manga with incredible animation, while at the same time staying faithful to the manga's story with their adaptation. \r\nStory- 8\r\nOne Punch man has no point A to point B story. The show follows the daily life of Saitama and how he handles the countless disasters that pop up in the surrounding cities. One Punch Man is a show that tells a new story every one to two episodes, typically along the lines of: a new enemy appears, other heros try ,but fail, to stop the enemy, Saitama defeats theenemy with one punch. While this seemingly formulaic storytelling method might appear at first glance to get stale rather quickly I can tell you it does not. The reason for this is that One Punch Man is a very self aware show. They know when to use their punch line, pardon my pun, and they use it at the best possible moment to maximize the humor.\\n\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is one of the highlights of the show, Madhouse brought in some of the best animators in the business and it shows. The fight scenes look like they came straight out of Fate/zero or Bleach, with how much effort was put into them. The artstyle itself is appealing and really stands out in the character designs.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is great, especially Saitama, the VA can really flip a switch between serious and apathetic Saitama.The soundtrack fits well and doesn't seem to be just copy and paste background noise, also the opening is catchy\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are rather simple in design however, they are unique and relatable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is one of the best action/comedies I have seen in awhile, with humor reminiscent of gintama and action scenes as fluid as Bleach I look forward to seeing a second season in the making. I highly recommend watching OPM for a truly enjoyable experience.- 9/10.\\n",

            "content": "In a sea of absolute shit, One Punch Man stands alone as the ONLY worthwhile series this year (2015). This is not hyperbole.\r\nThe brilliance of OPM is it's ability to successfully parody every vapid shounen action anime that has flooded the market these past 20, 30 years.\r\nIt takes stale tropes, themes and character archetypes and hilariously mocks them with one seemingly simple character trait, or plot device.\r\nTo be clear about what I mean by stale trope, basically the excruciating DBZ/Bleach/etc anime trope is as follows. \r\nWeak hero gets beat-down. Recovers. Powers up. Battles bad guy in round 2. Wins. Season 2. Meets even more powerfulbad guy. Rinse. Repeat.... \\n\r\nBasically, you watch one, you watched them all. \\n\\n\r\nSo, what makes OPM different? With Saitama we get a hero who can literally destroy any enemy with one single punch. Fucking BRILLIANT. That sole premise throws the whole traditional action narrative structure out of whack and provides for some truly interesting scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I do see bumps in the road ahead. Hopefully OPM will end with a single season. The only reason I feel this way is because I've read the manga... Urgh. Unless they rework the story (and most of the recycled humour), I don't see much future for OPM.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, this is a review for this current season. Not the manga and not for some hypothetical 2nd season. As such, I can only give OPM my strongest of recommendations. Watch it!\\n\\n\r\nEdit: Upon reflection Sidonia no Kishi was actually fucking awesome too. And Ping Pong kept my attention (mainly for it's art).",

And Here a met a Cyborg called \"Genos\" Who was amazed by Saitama's power and became his disciple and he isthe only one now who truly knows Saitama's power (Except Bang Who is a Very Powerful Hero) other than them everyone call Saitama a \"Cheater\" , \"Bald Bastard\" and call his power a fluke . Because of this One Punch thing this anime and manga is called \"One Punch Man\" . To be honest I like anime with a Overpowered MC and Super Powers and this anime have them both so this a perfect anime for me . I hope they make a second season of this cause so many things are unsolved anyway I am pretty sure you will like it .\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:-\\n\\n\r\nThe story is good but is becomes kinda predictable after 3-4 episodes so some might not enjoy it but to me it is great and how he defeats his enemies with one punch is also very predictable but i enjoy it no matter how strong the enemy is he only needs one punch thats kind a boring so I give the story 7/10 .\\n\\n\r\nArt:-\\n\\n\r\nWell I am not a artist and not good with art and sound thing but as I am a human i have some like and dislike so I think the art is great so I give 9/10 .\\n\\n\r\nSound:-\\n\\n\r\nLike I said I am not good with art and sound but I think the sound is also great so 8/10 .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:-\\n\\n\r\nI love every character is has except some few but the design and everything about the character is very good and they are animated greatly so I think its great is characters so I give it a 9/10 .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:-\\n\\n\r\nLike I first said its a very enjoyable anime to be honest the comedies are simple but very enjoyable . This anime is One Of the most Funny anime I ever seen . After watching this I was just dreaming about it . \"Genos\" Who respect his master very seriously is also very funny . For Enjoyment I Give it a 10/10 .\\n\\n\r\nOverall:-\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is overall great except is predictable story I like it very much I think you should watch this . To be honest I like anime with a Overpowered Heroes so Overall I give it a 9/10 . now go and watch this if you didn't .",

Its like AT YOUR FACE BITCH! \\n\\n\r\nArt------------10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation is slick . Each frame feels to be drawn with perfection and heart , fluid movements with great details. The soundtrack is well composed which adds to the excitement and enjoyment of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-----------10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the strong point of this anime. Being a character heavy anime we get to see lots of different characters with distinct personalities which are absolutely loveable.Their interaction with Saitama and also their reactions afterwards.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall i will say that you give this anime a try and u will be sucked into its world and will have a wonderful ride with Saitama!!\\n\\n",

Not only is this particular anime executed well by the director but it really does shine a light about how absurd over powered characters are in some shows.\r\nLooking at the character development, the main character definetly has a funny backstory which really gets backed up well by the plot.\r\nArt and sound is great.\r\nThe only reason I'm not giving this a perfect 10 is because the characters one punch technique might become very repetitive and actually dull the plot. However if there's a second season, I'm pretty surethe writers/director will think of alternatives and additions to keep you on your seat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, it's time I wrote this.  Like most people did in 2015, I really enjoyed One Punch Man. \r\nStory(9/10) \r\nOne Punch Man is based originally on a web comic. Its story is fairly unique yet simple. Like the title says, One Punch Man is about Saitama, a guy who beat any character (or object) with one punch. The story sounds kind of boring and that's because it's supposed to be. Ironically, a man  with so much power finds very little fulfillment in life.  Saitama is unemployed at the beginning of the series and lives in a small apartment for the duration ofthe season. He is frequently seen doing groceries as well as other common chores.  Coincidentally, his attitude towards fighting villains is the same as small chores. Does his life matter? Okay, enough with the serious existentialism talk, OPM is a comedy more than anything else. Does it accomplish its goal of making the viewer laugh? Yes, the situational comedy is quite well done actually. \\n\r\nArt (9/10) \\n\r\nOPM looks like a mixture of modern anime and classic DBZ style anime. This unique style really adds to the show considering its superhero setting. Madhouse usually does a great job with having a unique animation style for every anime they animate.   \\n\r\nSound (9/10)  \\n\r\nThe opening to this anime is epic, so I watch it every time and the ED, by contrast, is much more chill. Where this show stands out is with its VAs. Makoto Furukawa who I have only seen in one other show does a great job voicing a character with little expression. He delivers Saitama's dry lines perfectly.  By contrast, Genos's VA, Kaito Ishikawa makes the character sound like he belongs in a serious anime. I have to give him props for delivering some of those lines without bursting into laughter. \\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)  \\n\r\nI have a soft spot for atypical protagonists. Saitama is bored for most of his screen time. He does fairly average things and yet accomplishes astronomical results. As this pokes fun at Shounen, where training can help you get past any obstacle, Saitama easily defeats god powered villains with his only training being basic strength. Genos, on the other hand, is a try hard. He is very strong, but not the strongest the universe has to offer. He overanalyzes every situation in his mechanical tone. Humorously,  he looks up to Saitama because of his wisdom and strength when only one of those things are there. \\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) \\n\r\nPeople call OPM overhyped, but I really enjoy it.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys or absolutely hates battle shounen, or Fist of the North Star-style anime. \\n\r\nOverall(9/10)\\n\\n",

            "content": "One Punch Man is what this masterpiece of a anime is called. This is one of the few animes that really hit the spot for me and where I just can't get enough of. This anime is filled with action and comedy and just who can't love Saitama with his goofy face.\nStory: 10/10. \nThe story is really good and it covers a lot in just 10 episodes. One Punch Man is about Saitama who is so strong that he defeats everyone in just one punch. Says it in the title. But since he is so overpowered, he gets bored of his own strength and thathe can't find a challenge in this world. Then a cyborg appears and he get Saitama to join the Hero Association so that he can become a certified hero. He then aims to climb up the ranks in the association (in order to be famous) and try to find someone that can take more than just one punch. \\n\\n\nArt: 10/10. \\n\nThe art is just amazing in this anime. Everything from the backgrounds to the characters feel natural and unique at the same time. But what really stands out is the fighting scenes. The flashy battles with the slow motions and the destruction is just amazing to watch. It is like you never want to see anything else than fighting scenes from this anime ever again. Truly a masterpiece.\\n\\n\nSound: 10/10.\\n\nThe sound of each punch, flight, landing, explosion, robotic sound and even Saitamas cape makes me hyped and just appreciate every second the anime has to offer. The One Punch Man's songs is also catching and gets me even more hyped every time I start on a new episode. Truly a great job done by Madhouse!\\n\\n\nCharacters: 10/10.\\n\nI just want to start by saying that I love Saitama and how he is so dumb. It really makes you love him even more. And of course we got Genos the cyborg. He is more a serious guy who really contrast against Saitama. We got the goofy guy and we go the serious guy and the duo is just hilarious. Can't get enough of these characters and no one knows what they might end up doing next.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment: 10/10.\\n\nThere is no way you can't smile or feel hyped watching One Punch Man. It is like a mix of emotions heating up inside you and you can't get enough. I have already watched this anime three times and when I am writing this review I want to see it again. That is just how much I enjoy this show!\\n\\n\nOverall: 10/10.\\n\nOverall... outstanding! There is nothing coming to mind when I think of something that could be done better. If you like action or/and comedy this anime is for you. Personally, everyone should watch it even though you like another genre better. You might end up enjoying it more than you think. But this is one of my \"MUST WATCH ANIME\" and btw suuuper hyped for season 2.",

There is no epic story line or grand quest to save the world. Just an average guy being a superhero. \r\nArt is amazing. Madhouse really went all out with this one. The fight scenes are glorious. The sheer impact and destruction of the attacks are the best I have ever seen. In stark contrast, the comedic scenes are so intentionally poorly drawn that it sucks the excitement away instantly. This is a very good thing. To be able to switch gearsfrom awesome battles to a dopey moron instantly is extremely hard to pull off. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is very good as well. The opening is suitably epic for the strongest hero and the battle effects really bring it together. The ending is a bit underwhelming however. I'm almost convinced it was purposefully boring. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are one dimensional. Saitama is a hero because he likes it. That's really it. There's not going to be any character growth. No gut-wrenching decisions or actions that shape his viewpoint. What you see is what you get. Minor characters see his actions and may start to reflect on how to improve themselves, but this is never highlighted and has no bearing on the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment varies for every viewer. Saitama is going to win every fight, without a doubt. There's no trace of tension or anxiety in the show. Some people will find this boring. Others will watch for the comedy reactions of the background characters. This isn't a show that's going to appeal to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall its a good show. With a better story and stronger characters it could achieve greatness. But for now it stays an impressive visual work that deserves a chance.\\n",

The main characters are lovable and relatable; despite Saitama being an incredible hero he is basically a typical poor twenty-something living in a small flat and obsessed with supermarket discounts. The comedy therefore centers around his deadpan nonchalant attitude to serious situations and the awkward struggle of everyday life, e.g. simply catching a mosquito, and works perfectly with the rest of the anime.\r\nThe animation is incredible, especially during the fight scenes. Madhouse has a great reputation for making action sequences look intense and they pulled it of spectacularly in this anime - especially for Genos.The sound is amazing, you'll be singing the theme tune after a few episodes. Sounds corny, but it really conveys the sheer awesomeness of the anime as a whole. The ending theme tune is a stark contrast to the opening, but reminds you that after all the action that has happened in the episode, after a long day of being a hero, the characters still have to go back to their regular lives just like everyone else. And that's basically the show.",

He finally got his dream in life, but it's nothing he can enjoy. He's too strong.\r\nGenos begs him to be his sensei, which is where the fun begins. In a town seemingly full of villains and fellow heroes, Saitama wants to find a fight that will excite him, while Genos wants to learn strength from the strongest man he's ever met.\r\nIt doesn't take itself seriously at all, which is part of it's charm.Saitama is so nonchalant about everything, he doesn't really care about things unless they're going to be a nuisance to him. \\n\r\nEverybody judges him for looking different and because of his poor results on the written exams, he's considered one of the lower classes of heroes. He's okay with that because he's not a hero for praise, he does it for his own happiness. \\n\\n\r\nIt is short, but it's enough episodes for a good first season. The fights, considering what they are, are pretty satisfying. They have enough action to keep you into it. The different animation style makes a great impression and the humor is nicely done. The different super powers are interesting, if they were to delve more into it there's some that aren't common which is nice to see, plus the hero names are pretty great too. It just adds to how it doesn't take itself seriously at all. But they suit their characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is awesome. It's a good thing to just lay around and watch casually or all at once. Overall I enjoyed it, it was certainly worth watching and I'm looking forward to the second season.",

            "content": "*Spoiler Free!!*\r\nIf you haven't been on any social media page in a while or talked to a person who likes anime, you may have not heard the one of the hottest animes of 2015! This anime may not look the best, but believe me when I say this show lives up to all the hype it\u2019s getting. This show did a perfect job in each genre it was representing, the action scenes had me on the edge of my seat while the comedy scenes had me laughing pretty hard. \r\nStory: 10 - The story is a masterpiece without a doubt. As the title says heis a man of One-Punch battle. The world building is also great. ONE has successfully imagined a world brimming with heroes and monsters that is very interesting and feels incredibly vast. There are all kinds of monsters in this show. We have monsters based on animals, monsters based off robots, monsters based off of rogue expert practitioners of martial arts, just to name a few. On the side of the heroes it's the same, we have here an incredibly diverse cast of heroes that all have very unique styles. The story pick offs from a very interesting development and the logic is crazy which makes it even better. A typical man becomes the world's strongest man in three years with only casual training and lost his hair because of it. The story\u2019s development is great and after each episode it will having you say \u201cOne more.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9- The art is simply amazing. The contrast between the fluid, high detailed battle scenes and the comical ones makes this show even funnier than it already is. The quality in the fight scenes are crazy and filled with colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 - Because it blends in perfectly with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 - The characters are beautifully drawn and animated, and I enjoyed the incredibly large and colourful cast of seemingly overpowered heroes. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10 - The fun is the maximum point of the series, where the blend of beautiful scenes of action, humor and music come together for the blockbuster that is the series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 10 - One punch man is a fun light hearted series but it can be serious when it wants to it goes funny to serious real quick but it's really a parody of every mainstream shounen if you watch this series there are references left and right this series really is amazing there nothing else i can say without spoiling so i highly recommend you check it out. \\n",

            "content": "One Punch Man is adapted from the manga by Yusuke Murata , which it self is adapt by the web-comic series by ONE (no one knows his name). \r\nWhen I had first heard about this anime and about how great it was and the hype was for it, I didn't want to watch it.\r\nI had been lured into the trap before, where something such as a show or game got more hype then it was actually worth and just left me feeling disappointed for having unrealistic expectations. And when you have those expectations, it just wrecks a show/game that you could have some what enjoyed,even if it wasn't a grand masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nBut then, I watched a little snip-it of one of the episodes, and how good the fighting animation was and I thought, why not? It was also done by MAD HOUSE, which I love there other work as well so I thought one episode couldn't hurt.\\n\r\nBoy, I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started watching it, the four episode had just come out, and I watched all of it in one sitting. It was then that I become the hype. I was literally dying every week just waiting for a new episode to come, discussing what had happen or could happen and just basically jumping the band-wagon.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I also learned one thing that I hate more than crushing disappointments, is waiting for a new episode.\\n\r\nIf your like me, you like to watch everything in one sitting or watch as mush as you can in what little time you have (and yes I do some what have a life other than anime).\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, this isn't the shows fault at all. Just fans showing how much they appreciate a show and not caring about any else's opinions or criticisms. But anyway on to the actually review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow the one thing you have to remember about One Punch Man, is that it's all a joke. Literally, ONE had made the comic purely for shits and giggles not expecting any one to actually like it or have a massive following. I mean it's just chock-a-block full of jokes, stereotypes and references to make fun at the superhero genre. Saitama's whole thing is \"being a hero for fun\", which is just another joke, showing him as a average looking no-body with a somewhat bland personality. But in the end you learn to like his blandness because its somewhat refreshing in a world where being a superhero you have to be the best at everything, it's all a competition. And there's Saitama, worrying that he's going to miss the shopping sales.\\n\\n\r\nSo I can understand people not liking it or not seeing the whole hype for it. It doesn't have much story depth, or much character development that you would normally see in an anime of today. You can also pretty much guess where it's going, it's not real hard to follow and it's pretty straight forward in it's plot, well whatever little plot it has.\\n\r\nBut it does have some parts that make you stop and think about the whole \"superhero\" image and what it really means at the end of the day. The anime is also spit into sagas, but they all somewhat go in chronicle order.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere is one thing that One Punch Man has going for it is the animation. It's smooth and flows effortless, with fight scenes almost gliding on the screen. Your eyes are literally glued, watching every move that the characters make.  The animation was pretty constant over the episodes,  and the environments were drawn good as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves were all somewhat unique in there on way, with colours and clothes matching their personality and powers. Even Saitama's simplistic costume, showed his averageness and bland outlook on life. But the animation made up for it in showing just how powerful Saitama really is.\\n\r\nBut overall, as said above the animation stood out when the fights rolled in, showing them to be big and explosive, which is just what you want.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also gold in it's self, with guitar riffs galore and some characters like Saitama, Genos and even Mumen Rider having their own theme. The music fitted the fights well, pumping you up and adding atmosphere to the scenes, just wanting for the next punch. The voices for the characters fitted them all pretty well, with even Tornado of Terror (Aoi Yuuki, there is no dub as of this review) high-pitched voice fitted her childlike personality brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you were to ask me, what got me to love this anime? the opening. To me, I think an opening should be eye catching, it should show what you are to expect and set the mood. \"The Hero!! Set Fire to the Furious Fist\" by JAM Project, did just that. By the end of the song , had already downloaded it on to my phone. The ending song was pretty good, not what you would expect in a comedy/action anime  and the lyrics didn't really seem to fit, but it wrap things up nicely.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters as whole were good. They all had their own personality with flaws and strengths, well some more strength then others. There were many characters that only got a few scene time, just for you to get a taste and then move on to the next scene. Because this is an action based show, this is bound to happen, so that monument can be kept.\\n\\n\r\nI generally liked all the characters, even the villains but specially Saitama and Genos who are the main ones, I loved the most. Not to spoil to much, but the contrast between Saitama and Genos is very interesting. One is your typically I-have-a-tragic-past-which-makes-me-stronger theme which is very over used in the superhero gene, but somewhat plays well here when paired with one that a superhero \"for fun\", and sits around all day watching T.V and reading manga, living your typical N.E.E.T life. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed it immensely, if you couldn't already tell from above. As I'm sure you know it's been a huge success, with a cult-following. It combines action-packed fights with jokes and a character that seems so boring, but surprises you with his amazing strength and stubbornness. \\n\r\nThis is a show I would definitely recommend to people who are new to anime and want to start with something not too complicated but fun or to anyone in general.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I went into One Punch Man expecting a show about a guy who's really strong taking out absurdly powerful enemies with a single punch, and that's what I got. \r\nThe story is pretty simple, but it doesn't really need to be that complex. There isn't much one could really say about the plot that hasn't already been stated in the synopsis, everything is supposed to be taken at face value.\r\nThe characters are the highlight of One Punch Man. Each character is an overdone trope but done in an extremely tongue-in-cheek way which really works with the satirical nature of OPM. My favorite parts of theshow are when the characters start making fun of cliches that characters using like villains having overly-long monologues or characters intentionally trying to sound cooler than they actually are, it provides great situational humor and makes OPM all the more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAs with most Madhouse anime, OPM has very refined animation. The art is phenomenal and I can confidently say it's one of the major highlights of the show. There's no comparison to be made between this and the webcomic.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the soundtrack isn't anything all that special the opening and ending themes are very good and even some of the regular tracks played during the show are pretty good, too. Overall it's an average soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nHow can I really describe the action sequences? They aren't out of this world balls to the walls amazing but you can't say they aren't pretty darn fun to watch. Anyone is sure to find one fight in this show that they loved, which is a pretty big feat for a show where the main character literally can punch away all of his obstacles. Overall the action very satisfying to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI could recommend this to anyone looking for a decent parody of common anime tropes, although I don't need to because I'm sure everyone under the su n has atleast heard about this show.",

            "content": "Before I start this review, let's just channel the epic \"ONE PUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNCHHHHH!!\" from the opening song because I am obviously not over the One Punch Man feels.\r\nI'll be completely honest and it took me a while to get started on this anime because of all the Tumblr posts that I've been bombarded with by OPM fans...I just see a bald guy with a ever-so-bored cartoon face wearing a yellow/red superhero suit with a cape. A CAPE. The ultimate cliche superhero outfit yet. \r\nI thought it was going to be a typical comedy, silly anime of a bald dude winning fights with just one punch. Butboy was I wrong.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a HILARIOUS, action-packed masterpiece of a bald dude winning fights by DESTROYING his opponents into a scattering bloody mess with just one punch. And I loved it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY; \\n\r\nYou have the life of your average Joe turned superhero after rigorous training to the point where he lost his hair and became bald before becoming the strongest man on earth. It can't get better than this right?\\n\\n\r\nI've heard plenty of OPM haters saying how typical and predictable the plot is which makes it 'boring' for them to continue watching. I understand their point for it is comparable to other action anime which are more drama-filled but to me, those additional plot-lines will become baggage if placed into an anime like this. It is because of it's simplicity that we can enjoy the crazy-awesomely animated battle scenes and indulge in the characters' hilarity. \\n\\n\r\nAs a spoiler-free description of the story by my personal opinion, I feel like I have been transported back to my childhood watching Ultraman + a lil bit of Naruto with a blast of Dragonball. If you don't feel the excitement of watching superheroes defeat monsters and bad guys that you may had as a child when you watch One Punch Man, boy...you must be a plain child. \\n\\n\\n\r\nART;\\n\r\nRight from the get-go, aka the first episode, I was overwhelmed with the amazing animation. I would highly recommend everyone to watch it in 1080p or you'd be missing out in all the crystal clear art that would put many other action-anime to shame. \\n\\n\r\nIt's clearer during battles or fights especially when we move through the scenery, following the flow of the destruction or attacks before we see the smooth movements of the characters even at a high-speed panning. I have to give credits to the animators for taking so much detail in every frame which would have been awfully exhausting but it resulted in a great animation for an action-anime and I 100% appreciate that passionate effort. Simply stunning.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND;\\n\r\nCome on....I started this review by mentioning the OP and I am going to repeat myself with the \"ONE PUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNCHHHHH!!!!!\"\\n\r\nMan that was epic! I love it when an opening song is able to grasp the actual feel and concept of the anime so well. It just puts it out there how detailed the staff members are to put together this anime piece-by-piece from taking care of the art all the way to its soundtrack. The ED is not an exception where I feel that instead of playing with the major epicness of the OP, it mellow down to remind us that Saitama is...human. He has a quaint little apartment and he returns home after kicking ass. I like that little aspect where even the strongest superheroes have their moments of normality.\\n\\n\r\nOh and don't get me started on the actual OST for it is flawless. Then again, if an anime does not have good sound, it is almost blasphemous as bad art. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER;\\n\r\nLet us all take a break and make a big applause to Murata Yusuke and ONE for creating such an epic yet, seemingly normal superhero; Saitama. This is probably the first time I find a bald anime character so damn attractive. Ehem~ Anyways... I honestly love how they created Saitama and Genos to balance each other out. The latter is introduced as the 'handsome' one who is prone to be more popular and attractive than Saitama and could have easily been the protagonist of his own story but nope: here, he is just the sidekick to the caped baldy. \\n\\n\r\nI have to say it is hard to find the characters' personalities overlapping with each other meaning that they are mundane and that is not the case. Predictable, yeah but they are all far from plain. We have a bald badass with a cyborg sidekick and later we get a slice of Naruto with a Ninja who gives me the Sasuke vibes except he is more...cheerful and smiley in a creepy way. What can I say...you got to have your Ninjas one way or another. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL;\\n\r\nThoroughly, I enjoyed this anime to the point where I devoured it in a single day. I've seen and heard plenty of anime fans trashing on this anime by saying it is 'trying to hard to be funny' or that it is predictable and boring but honestly, I can't see that at all. It is a wonderful series that I regretted not watching any sooner but since I've finished it, I can proudly say that I have not had such a refreshing action anime in a long time. After all the heavily-plotted anime, One Punch Man makes me feel like I have just opened my windows for the first time after being cramped in a dark dusty room; smelling the fresh air and freedom of an anime not conformed by super detailed plots and other baggage and just focusing on being badass. \\n\\n\r\nYou don't need tear-jerking scenes or flashbacks of hardships or huge character developments to create an epic show.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, you just need bald superheroes and ugly monsters destroying cities with their guts splashed onto the asphalt. \\n\r\nTwo thumbs up and a standing ovation for that!\\n\\n",

            "content": "One Punch Man is a hilarious and enjoyable anime. I'll be honest; I haven't had much exposure to this genre of anime (mainly action) but even a novice would be able to pick out the many hilarious puns that are sprinkled here and there.  But more precisely, it is the synergy between action, comedy and slice of life that really make One Punch Man (OPM) shine.\r\nI mean, who doesn't like an anime where the main character actually follows the name of the anime? Really the protagonist is front and center with all the other things ending up revolving around him. His hilarious sidekick, othersupporting characters, and the main governmental organisation in charge of most of the characters in the anime are really, in the end, foil for his one liners, his antics, his pearls of wisdom before he drops that punch.\\n\\n\r\nOn a technical note, there is nothing really cringeworthy to see or hear; everything feels about right, with the fight scenes rendered well and standard typical anime responses to hilarious dialogue. Whilst not particularly innovative, that isn't really the point; the point is to find it fun where evil is defeated with a single punch, and it really makes it so!\\n\\n\r\nYet I cannot help but feel that the entire premise, whist being so funny and interesting and engaging, is really just a one shot thing. There is nothing really engaging about it, nothing really visceral, nothing that tugs you at the strings of your heart, nothing that really makes you question anything important or relevant.\\n\\n\r\nAnd whilst it doesn't really affect the anime in itself, for an anime that feels set up for another season, OPM has yet to really ask the question: will there really be something challenging? Or will it just continue with the entire premise of OPM. It has yet to be answered and a failure to really hint at what path it would take is, to me, a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nThe producers are to be commended for creating an anime that is interesting, fresh and generally innovative for the genre. But in the end, OPM made me sit down for a few hours, enjoy some comedy, then stand up again. But better works make you sit down and never stand back up again.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 9/10",

The humour in anime is really smart and presented to the audience very efficently.  \r\nMain character of the story, Saitama, is the crucial element of the humour in anime. He is portrayed opposite of shounen anime protagonists literally in every aspect. He has a quite simple appereance, he is bald as aprotagonist! Can you believe that? He is the protagonist and he doesn't have that famous cool hair! Also he doesn't have those flashy anime costumes. He just have a simple yellow costume with red gloves and cape. He doesn't have a logo on his chest. \\n\\n\r\nAnother important thing is, unlike shounen protagonists, he doesn't have a meaningful, dramatic origin story. Simply, 3 years ago, he saved a boy from an evil crab man. Then he realized that he should be a super hero. Also, he didn't even have a job. So, he could have spared his time for training. By the way, his big secret behind his invincibleness is just an ordinary workout plan. Not an extraordinary, hard training like other anime characters do. It is just a workout. Then, after all these trainings(!), he beats his enemies with one single punch. Nothing else, just a single punch. No one ever made him to push his limits slightly not even once in the entire anime. Eventually, he got bored with his superhero career. He has reached his full potential in 3 years easily. It is another clever irony to shounen anime. It mockes with them in a great way. \\n\\n\\n\r\nExcept for Saitama himself, this fictional Japan is also designed perfectly for surreal humour. Names of cities are just alphabetical letters, you know, \"A City, B City\" etc. Villains just randomly show up and mess up with cities all the time. The villains are just all the same and they're all absurd characters, fits well with the atmosphere. If you think villains are awkwardly funny, they are nothing compared to heroes in this fictional Japan. Their attitudes, styles and names so wacky, they'll make you laugh. There is no logic behind them as it should be. For example Mumen Rider, a C class hero, is just a guy who rides bicycle. Even S class heroes(top class heroes) have some weird ones, they look like a joke such as Pri Pri Prisoner, Metal Bat, Child Emperor, Watchdog Man, Pig God and much more.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nTechnical elements such as visual effects and sound designs are executed amazingly. Action scenes are dynamic and gripping, flashy enough. The great thing about these scenes are, they are mosty hand-to-hand combats. They are much more gripping than weapon fights. Soundtracks are great and fit well. They're heavily metal music influenced.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I must say a couple of things about a common critique. People complain about how the story is repetitive and predictable. It is true. In fact, this is how should be. It is not a shounen anime, do not expect some \"twists\". That is the joke. Saitama will always be invincible, he will always beat the enemies. He has reached his full potential. He is not making progress like other protagonists, actually he does in terms of fame but that's another thing. All I am saying is, this anime is focused on it's humour, not to the plot. You should seek for good references and absurdity rather than an interesting plot. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I am looking forward to the next season. That's all...\\n\\n",

How many times has anime been saved again? Anime never really needed a savior in my opinion, but I digress.\r\nStory\r\n7/10\r\nThe story is nothing philosophical, but it does it's job. It gives you enough material to work with for 12 episodes, but not much more it seems to me. The whole \"everything dies in one punch\" gimmick can't stay funny forever, and near the end it felt anticlimactic. Although, I suppose that was the intended purpose.\r\nArt\r\n8/10\r\nThe fight scenes feelsmooth and well drawn, and the normal exposition/joke scenes are pretty decent as well. Except when the characters are drawn in the original webcomic style on purpose, which make up some of the funniest moments in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nThe only reason I give it a 7/10 is because the opening is one of the hypest openings I've ever seen/heard. I could listen to that all day. But the rest of the soundtrack is... forgettable. I can't recall a single song except the opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nThe characters were what made me watch more. Not because of serious development (although we see a little bit of that on Saitama's part) but because of the unbelievably hilarious dialog everyone had.

Throughout the 12 episodes the show will present the viewer countless nonsensical situations, where Saitama needs to defeat very powerful beings obsessed with destroying things. But since the hero can kill anything with just one punch, it completely negates any sense of tension or struggle.\r\nWhile the premise of this anime could lead oneto believe that this would be a parody of the super power shonen genre, 95% of all comedy bits fall completely flat. Just because a joke can be amusing once that doesn't mean it will be funny for the next 11 episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nBy far the best part, the art in this show is actually pretty decent, especially the fighting scenes.\\n\r\nThe drawings have a significant amount of detail and the animation is fluid.\\n\r\nBut that's where the art \"pro's\" end.\\n\\n\r\nDuring fight scenes there's a lot of shaky cam and most of them involve a gigantic amount of destruction right from the first episodes. This means the anime quickly becomes visually repetitive and annoying. And when it comes to the comedy bits it don't fare much better.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the show tries to be funny (and fails) the art goes from the very simplistic to the very detailed. But because the jokes don't work most of the time, it ends up looking lazy and pointless.\\n\\n\r\nA more visual consistent representation would work much better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nI can't remember a single track from the score so i have to say it's forgettable, but since i also  didn't find it to be annoying enough to remember that can only be a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the voice over i have nothing negative to say and i think most actors did a good job.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nIn a story where the main hero is invincible what role does the other heroes play?\\n\\n\r\nNone, they are completely irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nWhile i found some characters compelling (much more than Saitama) they serve no purpose other than to fill the enormous void that is the pathetic story. They have strengths and weaknesses and character flaws, but all that is pointless when their struggles are met with a invincible hero that can't die.\\n\\n\r\nIt really is too bad, since i they would be interesting characters in any other shonen story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\\n\r\nI'm glad to say that this show is slightly more amusing than watching grass grow, or maybe not i can't tell anymore.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall/ Conclusion: 4\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man has to be one of the most fascinating social experiments in anime form i have ever seen. It truly is the living proof, that you can turn a unbelievable mediocre show into a success, as long as you cater to the lowest common denominator.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite how incredibly dumb and lackluster it is, i can still recommend this show for the lovers of the brainless super power shonen genre. \\n\r\nJust keep in mind that if all you want is senseless explosions and destruction there are much better alternatives out there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is a review of One Punch Man.  There.  That's all the introduction you need.  (That right there is less than twenty words.  The review on the other hand won't be the same.)  \r\nOne Punch Man is a show that's very simple in concept.  We follow our main protagonist Saitama, a man who is a 'hero for fun', a man who can defeat everything, in just one punch.  And for our story basis, that's all we have to go off on.  \r\nAs a concept, OPM (I will call One Punch Man it's acronym OPM for this reviewfor ease) is vastly different take on the idea of a hero.  Historically, heroes are known as people who are well known for their courage and their achievements that help benefit society as a whole.  In pop culture, the idea of a hero takes the form of superheroes, beings who fight for justice and generally protect one city and fight the bad guys that would otherwise threaten society.  OPM satirizes that idea with Saitama and his ability to get rid of things with one punch.  He is a half-assed hero with an even more half-assed story, as he's not someone who endured great hardship or had to have life changing events in order to become the person he is, but rather just someone who decided to be a hero just because he thought it was fun.  This satirization is what takes up the majority of the screentime, which is Saitama going around and beating up bad guys with ease simply because he as a character is just too overpowered as a being.  They continue this idea by making these ridiculous villains with huge backstories, saying that it's just 'too long' since so many villains just go on and on and on (twenty words or less, goddamnit!) and making the world a bunch of lettered cities like City A, City B, which reflects the individual cities that a general superhero watches over.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the flipside of this, we have this more serious aspect of the hero, deconstructing what it means to be a person of justice and the expectations people have from you.  Personally, I found this part of the show to be the aspect that really made the show shine, because it not only showed us the impact that Saitama as a character has to the world because he's so OP, but it also really shows what it means to be a hero through Genos and Mumen Rider, and the sacrifices that one has to make since heroes can only save and/or do so much in any given problem.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd so, as a result of OPM tackling both satirical concepts and a deconstruction aspect of the idea of a hero, we in the end get a polarizing combination of the two that in the end, just doesn't work for the series.  For one thing, the part of Saitama being the overpowered One Punch Man that he is both a blessing and a curse.  The comedic aspect of Saitama beating everything in one hit takes up the majority of the show and only gives a little bit of the entire screentime to the more serious and deconstruction aspect of the series.  Not only that, but Saitama is a mcguffin for the series, a plot device that helps the show, but also has a severe and heavily unsolvable impact.  Because he exists in the series, a lot of the struggle that the show has in any situation with any of the other heroes doesn't really put me on the edge of my seat simply because Saitama exists.  We know he's going to arrive on the scene because he is the main protagonist (why wouldn't he?) and as such, doesn't really make me feel concerned about whether the good guys are gonna win because Saitama is there to fix up the problems that the show presented.  Now, after and event like that, we do get the more serious side of the show, but it really just feels like more of an effect rather than a core part that would make the show better thematically as a whole; it feels like more of an afterthought.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters for OPM also reflect the two aspects of the show.  Genos and Mumen Rider specifically show us what it means to be a hero, the deconstruction aspect, showing us that a true hero fights for good and does their best to help people in the best way possible.  Genos specifically grows as a character because being he learns that being a hero doesn't mean defeating evil, but helping the innocent and saving the ones who didn't do anything wrong from the looming threat at hand.  It's because of this growth that I find the serious aspect more interesting and better quality than its other more comedic half (or 3/4 in this case), that I'm sad to see it really only be a continuing subplot rather than the main story.  \\n\\n\r\nOther characters like Tornado, Atomic Samurai, and various other heroes while don't come into the story until much later still add to the story by being a good meld of the dual parts of the show, being the sort of ridiculous superheroes that we grow to love, but also as representations of other heroes that exist.  The fact that not everyone fights for good, and some really do it just to show off how great they are as a person; selfish reasons.  As such, while they have less appearance in the show, still make a large impact that helps the show in a big way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so you may be asking, why is Saitama, the title character of the series talked last?  Well, it's because Saitama isn't so much of a character, as he is an idea.  Hear me out here.  As a character, Saitama is very simple.  He wants to find a worthy opponent against his scarily immense strength, and spends the entire series doing that.  Any criticism towards how he does things in the show really doesn't bother him and adds in to that aspect of deconstruction that I've been mentioning.  While at the same time, he as the One Punch Man satirizes the idea of the hero by beating the shit out of everything in one hit, challenging the general struggle that superheroes face.  As a result, we have this polarizing character that adds to both aspects of the show, but doesn't change as a character.  Saitama is literally the same person from start to finish without really much change.  He wants to find that opponent that would give him a challenging fight and it's just very hollow to see that concept over and over again in the series without any change, thus making him feel like more of a plot device than an actual character.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of Madhouse, the animation for Saitama's Punching Show is nothing less than top notch.  OPM has a distinct style that can be both comedic and serious without changing the innate style.  As such, every bit of the show from start to end really ties in together, from Saitama's stoic and unimpressed face to the bulging muscles on every villain and/or character that looks like they've been taking massive, massive steroids.  There's nothing else to say about it aside from just how fluid and well done the animation is done, and for that, I applaud Madhouse.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack for OPM is something of an oddity from what I see.  First of all, we have its Opening, \"THE HERO!!!\" (yes, that's the actual title.  And it is far too fitting.)  I have no complaints about this OP.  It fully encompasses what we should and can expect from this show, which is epic punching and fight scenes that are very well done in quality.  It's a rock song that has a lot of motivational and epic notes and beats that really invigorates the spirit and creates that idea of HERO!!!!  And no, that is not an exaggeration.  It is a song that really doesn't need much more explanation.  (This is on my exercising playlist.  Somehow, I can run 1 mph faster when listening to this song and not feel more exhausted.)\\n\\n\r\nInversely, we have OPM's ED \"Hoshi yori Saki ni Mitsukete Ageru\", which...alright, I don't know what to say about this.  I'll be honest, it's a song that sounds like it belongs in a generic romance anime because it's sung with a lot of sparkly and 'pretty' bits that doesn't feel right in this series.  Honestly, who thought this was a good idea?  This is the one part of the soundtrack that just doesn't make sense to me.  \\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is a show that really looks at all aspects of the word \"hero.\"  By creating a character that challenges the idea of a hero by skipping the horrible backstory, intense training, and has no limits or weaknesses, it creates this innate flaw for itself that makes a lot of what the show tries to do by creating these deadly and/or world ending situations into something that doesn't seem like much of a threat in the end.  Which might be the point, but it doesn't really feel entertaining cause I know for a fact that Saitama is just going to come in a couple minutes later and beat the enemy to a pulp without breaking a sweat, or tearing up his rather...epic outfit.  It has this clash of comedy and seriousness that feels uneven and rough at times, and has a very hard time of finding a mix of between these two ideas simply because of Saitama's existence.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, OPM is a show that does deserve a lot of its praise because it has not only because it has great aesthetics, but also because it has characters and a story idea that while has some pretty major flaws, is still done in a way that is entertaining and well thought out.  Personally, I don't see OPM as being my favorite show or deserving its extremely high rating, but is a show that does is worth watching and the time to sit down and look at.  Now if you'll excuse me, I still haven't done my 100 squats and situps yet for the day.",

He mentions this a lot to people mainly attempting to say that 'I don't care what you think. I'm a hero for a HOBBY!'This is really amusing because the towns people are just standing there thinking to themselves 'what got into this guy?' Also, one punch man has a lot of monsters in it and Saitama [the main character] gets really excited when one comes around which gets pretty exciting.\r\nArt-10-I really like the art in one punchman because the main character usually has this really stupid expression on his face which makes you want to burst out laughing.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10-Because it blends in perfectly with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-10- Because the main character is so hilarious and has a great back story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10-This is mainly to do with the fact that Saitama is weird by choice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd rate this anime a 10",

            "content": "I literally just finished this anime and holy crap was it amazing. Now I originally did not want to watch this show, but since it was so hyped up I could not pass up the opportunity to see why it was so great.\r\nStory: The plot centers around Saitama who's just a super hero for fun and has trained intensely for 3 years and developed the Big Show's one punch KO. He later meets Genos, a cyborg who is seeking vengeance on the cyborg that destroyed his home and family, and the two later become master and disciple. It wasn't until Saitama found out there wasan organization for heroes that he started to become one as an occupation and starts out as a C rank hero as he did poorly on the written exam, while Genos became an S rank hero. But what made this show entertaining were the action scenes and its comedy. Like it makes fun of the way Shonen's would have long scenes of exposition and Saitama just wants Genos to get to the point. But talking about the action scenes won't do it justice it has to be seen to be believed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's MadHouse so you know the animation is going to be gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Saitama is just your average person who has incredible feats of strength and speed and his hands the the major draw to this show. Describing this character is hard to do but to try to sum it all up as best that I can he acts very nonchalantly when fighting and just the acts in situations can give anyone a good laugh. Next there is Genos who is Saitama's \"student\" and is second best character of this show in my opinion behind Saitama. Other than that he's just an awesome cyborg.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I cannot describe how much joy this show gave me. The final battle is hands down on the best I have seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: One Punch Man is a show about superheroes that has a hint of parody thrown into it. The characters a all enjoyable and you just get invested on what threat is going to come our main characters way. So I highly recommend this show if you are a fan of superhero shows and action anime.",

            "content": "Alright, so the premise of this anime is about a hero who is basically unstoppable, as he is able to defeat virtually all his enemies with one punch - hence the title. Now you may be thinking, \"Watching a show about Superman minus any known kryptonite sounds kinda dull\". Well, this show is rather like \"What if Superman walked around in his costume and people still thought he was Kent Clark?\". If that interests you, read on.\r\nOur protagonist, Saitama, is a self-described \"guy who's a hero just for fun\". As the story goes on, various characters are introduced who seem to take this hero businessmuch more seriously than Saitama, who really doesn't give a shit. While everyone is freaking out and obsessing over hero related things, Saitama is pretty nonchalant about the whole thing. The buildup to various conflicts is really entertaining, and you will often find yourself in anticipation for the usually laid back Saitama to arrive.  There is also more behind the scenes that isn't clear yet, paving the way for as of yet unannounced sequel. The story arc does feel a little too short, but that doesn't take away from the story. The premise of the show itself is much more entertaining in action.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are quite well done, it's not jaw dropping but is nice to look at and listen to. The fight scenes are the best part of it all and look great.\\n\\n\r\nMany characters are introduced and none of them feel particularly corny. Some have immeasurable power and others are your Average Joe trying to be a hero. All of them were entertaining, though all but the main characters and some of the villains have a deep backstory, which some other heroes could use. They are strong characters but it didn't really deliver on hearing about some of them as much as we would like to.  \\n\\n\r\nThat said, they help build and drive the world around Saitama. While he may not truly care about being a hero, there are plenty of others who do. This contrast is the driving force of the plot. It can easily turn from a bit intense to a bit more lighthearted and humorous, though it never feels dark or all that serious, largely due to Saitama.\\n\\n\r\nYou will likely not find yourself worrying about that too much about character development while watching the anime. It is gripping and you may find yourself binge watching it. With so little time we didn't have much of a chance to see many characters grow as people very much - except for Genos, Saitama's disciple - although they are very entertaining and already have interesting personalities.\\n\\n\r\nYou may enjoy this if you like action and a cast of characters that do a good job of supporting the plot and the main characters without overshadowing them or being little more than background noise, as well as lots of poking fun at silly tropes, and a mostly easygoing and fairly straightforward story.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: 9/10",

            "content": "Going into 2015 everyone and their mothers were hyped for One Punch Man. And to be fair, who wouldn\u2019t be excited for this comedy/action/parody animated by the venerable studio Madhouse? Even the animation staff considered One Punch Man to be a passion project, as they turned an otherwise average budget show into one of the best looking titles in recent memory. But was all this hype too much? Could One Punch Man possibly meet such high expectations? \r\nIn short: Yes. \r\nOne Punch Man rocketed to the top of both MAL and IMDB and cemented itself as a solid mainstream title. Whether or not you area fan of anime, you will find some value in this show. The simple yet elegant premise of the vastly overpowered main character, Saitama, captured our imaginations and asked the question: How can this show function? Afterall, since Saitama can defeat enemies with a single punch, what happens to the tension, the struggle for victory? \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s tackle that question in two parts. The first answer is that Saitama is part of a larger society of heroes, only this society does not recognize his talents. Whether it is by freak happenstance or sheer stubbornness, Saitama is unable to garner much respect among the hero elite. \\n\\n\r\nThe second answer is that it doesn\u2019t matter. This is a superhero parody that (literally) doesn\u2019t pull any punches: Saitama is so strong and so powerful that he actually gets frustrated with defeating enemies too easily. His deadpan look when a monstrous enemy attacked (The famous \u201cOkay\u201d face) was hilarious. Saitama is so fed up with his power that even demi-god level enemies no longer phase him. It\u2019s moments like these that make One Punch Man great:  Diffusing a catastrophic situation with nonchalance. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, with all this praise, then why only a 7/10 score? \\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man\u2019s action scenes are a glorious spectacle, to be sure, but it falls short in a few categories. The first is the soundtrack. Sure, the opening is exciting and catchy, but the in-show music is a bit lackluster. Perhaps this was intentional to highlight the comedic elements, but I feel that it could have been more impactful. As is, the soundtrack didn\u2019t really add much to the experience. \\n\\n\r\nThe second shortcoming is the repetitive nature of the series as a whole. Saitama kills bad guys with ease. His slightly less overpowered sidekick Genos looks on in awe. Nobody else notices or cares that Saitama just saved the city. Rinse and repeat. Now of course it isn\u2019t quite as simple as all that, since there are a plethora of other interesting heroes who fill the gaps and provide more character and worldbuilding. However, the basic formula stays the same. This show does not have any deep themes or provide greater insight into life as a whole. It\u2019s just a fun action comedy and nothing more. There\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with that, but for a show to receive top marks from me, it has to have multiple layers. One Punch Man, for better or worse, does not. \\n\\n\r\nThe third and final main flaw is that this show has some minor thematic identity issues. It seemed as if One Punch Man was going for a primarily comedic style, so whenever a character got teary and dramatic, it was a bit jarring and broke the immersion somewhat. Was the show a parody all along or was it just fooling us? Did OPM ironically fall into the traps of its own tropes? It\u2019s a bit hard to say, but on a couple of occasions it could have fooled me. \\n\\n\r\nThe final verdict on One Punch Man is still out for debate. Is it an instant classic or will it eventually be forgotten and supplanted by other great shows? Time will tell, but despite its flaws, I\u2019m leaning towards it becoming a new anime staple.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ever since I was a young kid I was into the idea of a superhero being the perfect example of an individual. This idea however is gone after watching and liking superhero series where the hero is not perfect but is actually the ideal such as Batman for not being perfect. One Punch Man puts the final nail on that coffin and doesn't hold back in using the hammer. \r\nIn relation the thing I liked about One Punch Man is its characters which include mainly Saitama the One Punch Man and Genos the Cyborg Sidekick.  Saitama is an example of the overpowered hero inthe final stages of long series of superhero stories and arcs who is so powerful that no one can beat him. unlike Superman or Dragonball  characters who enjoy having their power and have a ideal personality Saitama has a more realistic personality. He is like a person playing a MMO and gets to the highest possible level and the game is no longer fun anymore. This property is what makes Saitama a much more deeper character and makes the story more refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nGenos is a really strong character and represents the hero who is strong but can be easily beaten because he is not OP and is prone to heavy damage. Genos personality that develops is what makes him a strong character. The story mainly centers around the two characters I mentioned but everything else is not that strongly developed in my opinion which is why I think this series would need a season two.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of One Punch Man is top notch were fight scenes in each episode are done with amazing detail and quality. Some of the most epic scenes where amazing and had me watching the episode again and again. The music was pretty brilliant and made those scenes way better. I do wish they added more to the soundtrack as it seemed rather short.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment level of One Punch Man is good  I have a relative who is not really into anime but enjoyed watching this series with me. I think this was due to the superhero theme and some of the parodies that can be found among the heroes and villains.",

            "content": "The OPM anime is simple, more simple than 2+2=4. It revolves around your non-aesthetically pleasing character known as Saitama. He\u2019s an average guy who wants to be a hero for fun, and he wants to be acknowledged on all his good deeds. Sounds like your generic anime \u201chero\u201d trope, but believe when I say that ONE (creator) keeps this anime edgy and fun through use of satirical context and parodist elements. OPM takes from other big name anime and fuses them together for comedic relief and nostalgic familiarity. Let\u2019s begin on this review now that you have an idea of what OPM is like andhow it should be perceived\u2026\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIn a world where monsters and aliens are commonplace and have the same goal, to conquer earth, one man steps ups, now he may be a hero for fun, but he packs quite the punch (pun intended). Saitama is the main character in the series and he has quite the special ability, he destroys everything/everyone with a single punch, hence the name. That\u2019s really all there is to it. I\u2019m not kidding. Saitama wins every match with a single blow and that makes him perceive life in an apathetic view. With no one strong enough to face and match his abilities, he joins the hero Association and gains a disciple by the name, Genos. So, in order to bring forth light into his life, Genos convinces him to join the Hero\u2019s Association (Heroes contracted by the cities to serve and protect) and try to create a name for himself. As the story progresses Saitama builds a strong name and reputation for himself, but unfortunately, only the viewer (you) and Genos sees him doing all this. The people he is protecting are oblivious and stubborn. They do not accept Saiatama and thanks to other Heroes and their jealousy, Saitama is given a bad name and viewed as a freeloader, in terms of ranking up in the Hero Association. Talk about bad luck. This anime\u2019s story is obviously made to be enjoyed and not touch on the depth of integral dialogue and plot. So, those of you that are new to this genre, please do not expect seriousness to  a full extent of other big name anime.\\n\\n\r\n(7/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe artwork is truly phenomenal. Madhouse has revamped anime as a whole. The flow and beauty of artistic particles and movement will leave you breathless and hungry for more. It gives the anime justice. Regardless of knowing what will happen next with Saitama and his battles (which become predictable as it goes on), it\u2019s how it will happen which will significantly absorb you. It\u2019s fast-paced, uncensored, fluidity that will dilate your eyes and send you through a euphoric trip of pure ecstasy. \\n\\n\r\n(10/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe battle themes were on point and corresponded well with the fluxing battle scenes and emotional tantrums of the various characters. They each had their own background song to match every facial and body expression. The opening song, THE HERO!! \u2013 Jam Project, is perfect and you\u2019ll catch yourself by episode 2-3 singing alongside it, from start to finish. True forms of majestic sounds were definitely put into the series and nothing less, even at 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\n(10/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s):\\n\r\nIn regards to the character development of Saitama (MC), there really isn\u2019t much to see. He\u2019s literally the endgame for every MC in the anime-scratch that, manga/anime/comic universe. Instead, there seems to be a reverse in his development. He\u2019s already where he wants to be, but he must prove to the world the might he holds within his fists. It\u2019s enjoyable to watch him struggle to win over his audience. \\n\r\nGenos is another main character in the series and he\u2019s quite the catch. There seems to be a loving relationship between the two. Instant chemistry, you\u2019d think they have been friends for a lifetime. I feel they make the perfect duo and the development between the two is fascinating and enjoyable to watch, except for the fan fiction-fan service making its rounds on the internet, that\u2019s a little strange, but to each their own. If anything that adds to the strong foundation created by the two. Genos, however, is trapped with the shadow of his past, but it\u2019s thanks to Saitama\u2019s lenient attitude and strong persona that Genos\u2019 development is extremely expedited, in a perfect world.\\n\r\nOther heroes make their appearance as well, but the development isn\u2019t as great, but at the\\n\r\nmoment most of them are side characters. It isn\u2019t until the end where they are actually exploited in terms of power, personality, and role in the series; definitely a special and different unique of character in this, but very enjoyable with perfect, un-forced chemistry with one another.\\n\\n\r\nWE DON\u2019T SEE FUBUKI, BLIZZARD OF HELL!!! :[\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nThis anime is one for the books. It was so enjoyable it has gotten to the point where I am literally pre-ordering the English manga sets, and potential Blu-ray release of the anime. It\u2019s a definite GOAT for me; on the top 5 of my list. It had me laughing, crying, yelling, and pretending all at once while watching. It\u2019s been a while since I have seen an anime so great that I am out here praising it, unbiased of course.\\n\r\nThis is what real time action-comedy-sienen anime should be like. Take notes future releases!\\n\\n\r\n(10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn the end, reviews are professionally done opinions of something. I won\u2019t ask you to take my review seriously or my words to heart, but what I do want you to do with this is, consider the anime. Believe me, I wouldn\u2019t be here writing this as neat and coherent for anything or anyone, unless I 100% believe it is worth anyone\u2019s time. I hope you found this review helpful, and I hope it cleared out any haze of doubt you may have for the series. Don\u2019t listen to the masses, as I always say, just because an entire group of people hates it, don\u2019t mean you will to. Remember, everyone has different preferences! Give it out go! Thank you\u2026\\n\\n\r\nONE-PUUUUUNCH!!!\\n",

There are two reasons I love One Punch Man, First: it takes the concept of someone being able to beat enemies in one punch and gives me entertaining battles and a funny protagonist. Sure the the concept seems like, how can you make a story revolving around the concept, well...just check it out to see it. Second:The characters are the funniest badasses i've seen in recent years, as the voice actors fully give the characters life(Especially the villains). My overall enjoyment comes from theactions and the characters being so fluid when they are seen on screen. One punch man started off as a webcomic, then adapted into a Manga (which is how I found out about it), then there's the anime...which I feel is a great anime. I just wish it was longer...",

            "content": "I fearfully watched this series after a litany of recommendations. If you're a weeb like me (and you are, you're on myanimelist) you've been to anime cons, and there's a certain atmosphere that the extremely popular shows carry with them. The whole headband thing happened before I watched any Naruto, and after watching parts of it I was left with \"Yep, this seems like the kind of thing that a 26 year old man who rides the train wearing an anime gear would like\".\r\nBut, not so with One Punch Man. It's genuinely hilarious; a lot of parody is simple imitating something while being deliberately stupidbut One Punch Man is able to be an interesting action show while making fun of the format. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show is simple, a Mary Sue so powerful he can kill any enemy with a single punch. The show is able to be surprisingly non-procedural, and the plot noticeably advances every episode. Excessively violent, but tastefully, and somehow humorously. I'm surprised that as a 25 year old person I laughed so much at someone unexpectedly exploding, but there you go. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on, a few noticeable faults appear. Genos, the side kick, is pretty dull. It's unfortunate that the series whose entire premise (and resulting fame) is based on having a fresh take on the hero then uses such an off-the-shelf assistant. The same can be said for the hero's they meet along the way; the \"wise old man\", \"headstrong kid\", and so on. Both of these things result from parody aspect of the show; it's difficult when to draw he line from tasteful mockery to simple bad/lazy storytelling, but to me they crossed the line multiple times. \\n\\n\r\nAs well, there is a second season coming. Frankly, I'd be surprised if the series doesn't turn to garbage; there's a double-edged sword to having a unique premise, it intrinsically makes your show a little bit one dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nBut for now, it's probably my favorite comedy anime. Definitely worth a watch.",

            "content": "Who is the most powerful character in the anime universe? This is a question that has been raised countless times over the years, as anyone who watches action-packed anime is interested in seeing powerful characters on the screen. One of the brilliant qualities of shonen anime is the feeling you get when you see new characters who are quite strong, and you don't know how strong, or what they can do. One Punch Man delivered that facet, with its Hero Association allocated into several \"classes\" based on merit and power. It's a C-B-A-S system similar to that for gauging quests in Fairy Tail.\r\nThe answer? It'swithout a doubt Saitama from One Punch Man (OPM). In every other anime I've seen with ridiculously powerful characters, whenever they fight they are hurt to some degree -- but Saitama, my friend, is practically invulnerable. He's invulnerable and makes the title apt, as he typically defeats all enemies with one punch. Yeah, it makes the fights predictable, but the premise and background story of OPM and the other characters makes watching OPM still great. Saitama and Genos, the cyborg, are now in my top n favorite characters list. I say n favorite characters because each time I watch a new anime more characters are added to what would be a top 10 list but far more than 10 appear on that list.\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention Genos? Have you seen Iron Man? Take what Tony Stark can do in his suit and maximize its potential, jack it on steroids, and you get Genos, the cyborg whose array of built-in weapons and athletic ability just puts Stark and Marvel to shame. Hell, Saitama can take on all of the Avengers, Thanos, every hero and villain in the Marvel and DC universes and beat them all. Poor Saitama constantly faces an existential crisis, seeking a formidable opponent that won't blow up into smithereens after a single punch. Here's a quote from OPM about Saitama:\\n\\n\r\n\"This planet's finest warrior... I can sense no limit to his energy.\"\\n\\n\r\nSeeing OPM has further convinced me that Madhouse is one of the greatest anime studios of all time. The animation, in comparison to Parasyte especially, was refreshingly clear and aesthetically pleasing. The disarray of Saitama's bedroom, the various monsters he encounters, the fights, Genos's badass moves, everything else about the cities, was very well done. The soundtrack, too, was superb and matched the awesomeness of Saitama.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a reason why OPM is the third-highest rated anime series on IMDB. It provides a different look at power -- rather than watch a protagonist struggle and endure and train to grow stronger, why not see a protagonist with overwhelmingly superior capabilities that doesn't have to do all that?",

            "content": "\"Mosquitoes... suck!\"\r\nMost Shounen anime are riddled with cliches and the overall 'OP MC' trope. But what if you make the character too OP? That's where One Punch Man comes in, minus the cliches.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nRather than be a story focusing on one main goal, One Punch Man doesn't focus on any of this and rather focuses on single episode arcs or dual episode arcs (apart from the last arc which took 3 episodes). The comedy is greatly sustained and I found myself laughing t one moment then kind of serious in the next. I have a lot of praise for the last arc. Being a personfor whom the last arc and the ending is absolutely necessary for the overall enjoyment, the last arc totally satisfied me. I had a lot of fun watching it since it had the suspense in it, the comedy, the basic easygoing pace felt throughout the anime. Like I mentioned before, One Punch Man isn't your typical rushy type action anime where stuff happens left and right and there's no relaxing time, One Punch Man goes the extra mile and makes you feel relaxed DURING the serious moments. Nothing was rushed and I applaud Madhouse for excellently handling the pace of the anime, not too fast and a bit slow so everyone can enjoy, YET a lot is covered in terms of story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I'm guilty of giving out more 9s in art in my reviews, I've been quite stubborn in giving out full-on 10s and I feel One Punch Man definitely deserved it. It's action sequences were perfectly done and even in measly 480p you could sense the greatness going on. The choreography as well was nicely done and it seemed as the sky was the limit for the art section. Definitely a 10 from me. It was amazing how they balanced Saitama's serious face and his comic face so well that it made me think why other action comedies can't do so easily.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP. I think that's enough of a thing to mull over. It pumped and hyped you up so well and obviously it was perfect for One Punch Man. I liked the ED a lot but more than once felt as if it didn't suit the anime. With romantic lyrics I felt as if it's obviously more suited towards some high school romance anime and not an action one. Regardless it was still a great song with a good beat but in the end due to it's unrelated status to the anime and plot I had to cut one up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow I was first inclined to give it a 9 but a glaring issue made me cut one up again. Apart from a few outside characters (mainly the villains) the main characters didn't develop much, by who I mean Saitama and Genos. They were the main characters and they didn't improve much from the second episode till the last apart from a few minor developments. In spite of that, from the start they were brilliantly characterized which might explain why they weren't developed much over the course of the anime. Saitama was a person who wanted to be a hero for fun and it was literally fun seeing how his daily life went about. Even though he was a 'hero' he was very relatable as a character. Sadly that can't be said much of Genos, he felt........... Robotic... Ok jokes aside I seriously meant that, since this was a 12 episode anime Genos' backstory wasn't explored as deeply as Saitama's (heck, the only backstory Saitama had was his hair in episode 1) and though he was the second character still felt that he could have been more developed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was a blast watching One Punch Man. It was funny and it got serious when it had to be. I felt 12 episodes were less for the story but it was fun while it lasted. It's been a long time since I had fun watching an all-action anime since my last one Gintama isn't as action focused as you may think in contrast with One Punch Man and it felt awesome watching a guy stronger than SuperMan in such comedic situations. Definitely one of my favorites!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 (Averaged)\\n\\n\r\nOverall One Punch Man is an anime that's perfect for you if you love a bit of action with a huge dipping of Comedy as well. It makes you laugh, go \"woah\", put you into nail biting situations leaving you at the edge of your seat and certainly leaves you satisfied at the end. Not to mention that last arc was epic, if you like me find the ending the most important thing in an anime, you certainly won't be disappointed. With season 2 coming out next year I am hyped but am trying to keep expectations down because  staff has taken over the helm for the sequel and even though they're my favorite anime studio I'm kinda skeptical if they can succeed over such a great prequel at first since as far as I know J.C isn't cut out to be an action anime pro as how Madhouse was. But anyway, let's keep our chins up and hope the sequel is as great as this was, if not greater.\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Saitama with hair > Everything <3",

The downside to this is that the show will never be able to surprise you. \r\nThe upside to this is that it's *literally the only issue anyone should take with the show.* You're not here for a masterfully-crafted narrative or some deep character arc; you're here to see some of the best shounen character designs go through comically hyperbolic scenarios. \r\nOn the subject of character designs, One Punch Man's characters are so interesting that I could literallywatch them do anything and I would still find it entertaining. I could just watch a whole show of Saitama and Genos trying to catch good supermarket deals or clip coupons, or watch supporting cast fool around when they're not doing work for the Hero's association. Some of these side characters could have their own entire story arc on how they pay the bills and I still feel that it wouldn't be boring. Part of the charm of everyone in this show is that their greatest weakness seems to be real-life responsibilities, which only further supports the foundation of humor.\\n\\n\r\nHere's hoping that season 2 is just as silly and irreverent as season 1.",

It mostly focuses on this overpowered bald man who seeks the thrill and enjoyment of battles that he had lost due to his immense power. Not to say it's a bad thing, but it did leave me questioning 'Is there more to it?'. While the plot did progress halfway through, I think the idea of only revolving around battles diminishes the interestingaspects of the world of heroes, monsters and aliens. A lot of potential is out there and I believe that we'll get to see more of the other non-battle things. A stronger aspect that One Punch Man delivers is in the characters, especially the master-disciple relationship. Many of the other characters have their own cool power and personality so there's that boost of enjoyment. Seeing more of them is something I'll be looking for.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what about the battles? I can definitely say that Madhouse has the skills to make the word epic pop out. No arguments could be made about how eye catching, fluid and powerful the animations were. It was outstanding. The lighting and shakes made the scenes intense with all the explosions and power produced by the characters. All the more so, the sound effects amplified this even further. For the voice acting and OSTs, it was kind of average with the exceptions of a couple soundtracks. They did capture the personality of the characters, especially the main character.\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man begins as a story that fleshes out the world. We see all this powerful heroes and villains, but the story didn't really delve more into them except for the battles. I have hopes that their origins and goals will be introduced bit by bit in future seasons. In the meantime, this anime succeeds as being highly action-packed.",

The premise is amazing, a guy with an overpowered ability.\r\nThe show is an enjoyable ride throughout the entire series (currently 12 episodes), and every episode was filled with laughter. Not to mention the great animation, that create impactful scenes. I can't say too much without spoilers, but I can say the high octane (not to mention very brief) action,  the comedy, and the characters are the reason why I give this anime my seal of approval and  why I also recommend thatyou go watch it right now.

            "content": "One Punch Man is an awesomely-produced show that does a great job of subverting shounen tropes. The main premise of Saitama having the ultimate power and his life being completely devoid of joy and challenge because of that is very unique, giving it the potential of being much more than just a plain parody. Many of its specific ideas, like contrasting the protagonist's straightforwardness with hero association's egotism and petty politics, are absolutely brilliant and deserve a lot more exploring (which I think was done in the manga and quite likely will be in the coming seasons of the anime). \r\nThe problem is, the firstseason relies on its main gimmick (Saitama being absurdly overpowered, while also so unassuming that no one treats him seriously) so much, that it leaves very little space for genuine suprise or suspense within the plot. After it established the main \"ruleset\" of its world in the first few episodes, it didn't manage to surprise me with anything or introduce any real tension. It doesn't make the show unenjoyable by any means, but is a far cry from what I could consider \"legendary\" series. It's too much of a One-Trick Pony and while the second season might remedy that, expanding on the setting and characters, and putting Saitama through some more complex situations, the first one really left a bit to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the animation, visual gimmicks, sound and voice-acting are all at excellent levels. The artstyle is a bit peculiar of course, but I like it a lot and enjoyed even its more \"extreme\" applications in Mob Psycho 100 and compared to that show, One Punch Man is fairly conservative. And don't get me wrong, I think OPM is great fun and something thoroughly worth checking out. It's simply \"only\" a very good anime, and not a legendary one many people make it out to be.",

I agree that it is what it purports to parody, however, I found that it did the battles so well that I really enjoyed that aspect of it, all parody aside. The heroes have well-defined classes. If a hero in a class gets beat, you know whoever he fought will give another hero in the class a good fight, and possibly win.\r\nI found the soundtrack well-produced and pleasing, but understated and not very memorable. I feel like they reallycould've done more with it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the clarity and good construction just kind of absorbed me. I sort of found it like watching a sports match and really caring about the outcome. I didn't care about the characters so much that I really cared about their struggles, but I did care enough to feel connected to the action, which normally doesn't happen when I watch action shows.\\n\\n\r\nI had the same sort of feeling about Sword Art Online. I just enjoyed the show more than it seems I should when I analyze the individual component, so it comes out to more than the sum of its parts somehow.",

Sometimes I feel like the problems were too petty or unconvincing even for a joke but then I realized it was only 12 episodes 22~ minutes each. \r\nThe story had no arc, but they were building up towards something I believe will be in the second season. It's fair, each episode's theme was humorous and entertaining enough to view but not good enough to takeseriously, and that's what I suppose they aimed for. Well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were diverse, to muscle-beast masculinity to androgynous ninja, even a small girl. That's not to say they had any real depth in personality, what you see on the surface is what you get throughout.

If not, compromise) by having more awesomeness per unit time than the entirety of long-running shounen anime *AHEM* Naruto *AHEM*. Now while those anime have a plot to support whatever awesomeness they have, this show supports its awesomeness by, you guessed it, more awesomeness.\r\nNow I had read a bit of the manga (~5 episodes of anime) a while before I got my hands on the anime (IN 1080p THAT TOO) and when I started watching the show, I was immediately surprised by how fast it's going through the pages and just delivering somuch material on-screen. And then blown away, again and again and again.\\n\r\nYou've already probably heard the whole \"it's a superhero satire that manages to not be boring by being bloody awesome\" and I won't waste our time reinforcing on that. But if you say it's predictable, to you I say, \"OK\". Cause you're clearly missing the point of the show which is to bypass the whole suspense and just allow you to enjoy it. So if you're someone for whom logic or plot or any sense is paramount, I'd either have an open mind or stay away from this show. Just don't bitch about it.\\n\r\nI'll keep it short -\\n\r\nThe animation is Godly\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is awesome\\n\r\nThe characters are vividly different and all kinds of intentional cliches\\n\r\nThe plotlines are fucking ridiculous in increasing ridiculousnessity.\\n\r\nand our Hero is super-likeable (at least for me)\\n\\n\r\nIf you love Shounen - Watch it for how bloody awesome it is\\n\r\nIf you hate Shounen - Watch it to see how much fun and mockery it makes of Shounen.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few episodes that aren't as funny or eventful as the good ones and a couple of opened mysterious plot points that actually don't really bother you much if you don't care about it (like me ) and would rather just bask in the glory of everything that's going on so it's not actually enough for me to hold it against the show and decrease its score too influentially.\\n\\n\r\nThe closest comparison I can find to this show would be the movie Kingsman which takes all the cliches, injects steroids into them and turns the awesomeness level up to the max, which is pretty much this show.\\n\r\nDO NOT take this show seriously, just sit back (if you get time from preventing your balls/make-shift balls from falling) and enjoy the fuck out of it.",

            "content": "For all skeptics!! One Punch Man offers a brand new take on all shonen hero tropes and it WORKS. \r\nStory!! \r\nThe story itself during the anime is very Hunter x Hunter esque - initially episode by episode, very sporadic, with not a lot of explanation as to Why things Are the Way they Are. With the second season I think we'll see more of an overarching plot, but even so, each episode is rich with humour and Saitama's inexplicable strength, and really, that's the core of the series. \r\nArt!! \r\nThe art is fantastic. Don't let Saitama's plain character design fool you!! The fighting sequences inthis anime - and there are a lot of them! - are literally what I live for as an anime fan. They are fluid, demonstrative, exciting, and they drag the audience into the conflict effortlessly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter!! \\n\r\nThis is where One Punch Man shines as a shonen series breaking through in a genre dominated by One Piece and leftover echoes of Naruto and Bleach. Seitama is actually such a human - he's lazy, irresponsible, negligent - and the glory of the series is that we get to SKIP the Training Arc to the point where he's already so insanely damn strong that he's BORED. Only the thing is, no one realizes that he's powerful, and therefore he's drastically overlooked by the Hero Association and the public. \\n\r\nThis makes for a lot of built up tension - when is he going to meet his match? When is he going to be properly recognized? - and excitement, because we get to see asshole characters put in their place by this crazily strong, relatable bald guy who just wants to make the next sale at the supermarket. \\n\r\nThe secondary characters are mainly tropes, but in no way do they take away from the wonder of Saitama. They aren't at all exhausting or boring, they all add to the flow of the story/fight scenes/humour. \\n\\n\r\nOverall! \\n\r\nI recommend to fans of humour, shonen, who aren't looking for anything too serious but who want something with a renewed take on character archetypes.",

It's a subversion of the super hero genre by maxing the power of the hero to insane proportions. Having a character who's power is just destroying anyone with one punch does double duty. It provides excellent comedy because literally anything Saitama punches just dies but it also creates some interesting character building with Saitama. It's just not fulfilling for him to just end the fight so abruptly that it feels like Saitamais cheating. While everyone else has to fight for their lives and earns the victories they get whereas Saitama is left feeling kinda empty after every fight. One Punch Man that has a reputation for being a comedy, which it is don't get me wrong but below that there's a bit more complexity to the show.",

Tbh, I wasn't going to watch it at all, but my boyfriend swore by it and as a person into psychology/anthropology it would've felt hypocritical to write it off without a 2nd opinion.\r\nStory: So the title couldn't be anymore self-explanatory; a hero who defeats all his enemies with a PUNCH. For those who complained about Saitama being overpowered and the plot not being complex enough....I really don't know what to say to you!!! Oh wait, yes I do; DUH!!! I may haveover-read it, but I saw this anime as one giant heap of satire. Just kinda took all the things that people correlate in action, superhero shows and gave it one good punch!! Rather than watching it for a good story, I watched it because I like to laugh and I felt like channeling my inner tomboyish child who was very much into action and superhero shows that had little to no impressive plot, and it's felt nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Nothing stood out, nothing was too bad. But there were certain designs and animation I personally felt correlated well with the situation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: One Punch Man's soundtrack and opening are one of the most popular. I've heard people yell \"One Puuuuuuuunch!!\" at the top of their lungs but could not tell me what anime it came from. I don't think it's over-hyped, the soundtrack and opening go well with the anime's theme and makes me feel invigorated or bada*** whenever I listen to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Although many of the supporting characters are stereotypical or just goofy altogether, I didn't see a big problem in it since I wasn't expecting any masterpiece-like character development. My main attention was pointed towards Speed of Sound Sonic (for...biased and baseless purposes XD) and Saitama. Saitama wasn't your average hero which gave the anime its satirical demeanor.",

The characters were underdeveloped, even though they often had great first impressions. But my greatest critique is in how it advertised itself versus how it was actually presented. I love the concept of a superhero who is unsatisfied and unfulfilled because they are overpowered. Unfortunately, this theme was never explored in depth, and so the satire wasn't as much a satire as a bad guy of the week.\r\nBut there aresome truly hilarious moments (Saitama's explanation of his workout routine, for example), and the art was very well done. I also finished it. So there's that.",

You can see the result of its popularity by any age, I asked my mom (who thinks anime is for babies) to watch One Punch Man, and what? She love it, because the joke is mostly universal, comprehensive.\r\nCharacter(10/10): Great psychological development. I start stopping focusing on Saitama since he's powerful with the same \"oh ok i'll solve this\" behavior. And it dragged me to watch only to see villain's/rank .. heroes/victim's reactions.And besides Saitama's barely express himself, I felt loneliness and sadness after he defeat Boros. His silence over his victory seemed painful.\\n\\n\r\nSound(10/10): Impactful OST, addictive opening song that makes me want to sing everytime I hear.

            "content": "One Punch Man might be one of the hardest anime to review. This because it rejects some standard values by which we usually rate heroic animes or the Shonen genre in general by making fun of them. The excitement and the lust for battle typical of this genre is converted into boredom and this gives us interesting element to analyze which are usually bypassed by classic Shonens. What does it mean to be a hero and what is his relationship to the \"Other\"? Does he want to be acknowledged? If yes, how much does this need for social acknowledgment influence our understanding of his value?\r\nHowNietzsche already remarked, when you donate to others you don't do it for pure 'good' reasons, you wish to be acknowledged as 'good' thus making it for yourself. In this sense Saitama is a heroic figure because he refuses to reduce his heroic status by the judgment of the other. Like in Camus' \"The Stranger\", the protagonist is a heroic figure which isn't understand by society and avoid normal societal normative judgments of behavior. He firmly stands for himself.\\n\\n\r\nI believe One Punch Man is much more than witty commentaries and ironic mirrors of superhero trophes and motives: irony as a perspective through which watch our ideas of heroic identity and behavior. Why are we so obsessed by the hero and rhetorical myth of the savior? Which elements make the hero appealing and worth of praise?\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to dig deeper in one of the most repetitive and widespread archetypes of narration ever -- the superhero who saves us from the bad guy -- then One Punch Man is the anime for you. A dazzling picture of a normal man that doesn't have any real superpowers and yet is hero per antonomasia.",

            "content": "ONE PUNCHHHHHHHHHHH...Ok I'm good. Sorry that was a must do :). Let's get this review started.\r\nStory - 7: This is just my opinion, but the only story plot that I found in this anime is how Saitama and Genos are climbing up the rankings and aiming to become the strongest hero (although we already know who the strongest is....hue hue). Each episode seemed to be very episodic too with a new case brought up that would be solved in 1 episodes or 2-3 for a couple of the final few arcs. Hence, I didn't find this story line to be as interesting as it could'vebeen but I mean, I have no idea how the story could've been better too but what I'm saying is, the story line did not really hook me onto this anime and if it wasn't for the other aspects such as the characters, art, sound etc, I would not have rated this anime as highly.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9: Madhouse studios. What's there more to say? The art is absolutely spectacular, along with the animation and Madhouse studios living up to their name. Breathtaking animation and some scenes seriously worth pointing out such as the Genos vs Saitama practice fight and the final LORD BOROS vs Saitama fight. (I'm trying so hard not to spoil anything)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9: The background music, opening themes and ending themes were all wonderful. Opening theme, probably the most hyped opening I've ever heard. There is this specific main background music that has been played many times during fights and epic moments but I don't know what the name of that music is. Those that have finished watching should know which one I am referring to because it is quite obvious that one certain background music standed out from the rest (If someone is kind enough, would you please tell me the name of that BGM? Thanks ^.^). Anyways, that background music adds on to the epicness of those scenes so perfectly it leaves me speechless and with my jaws open so widely.\\n\\n\r\nCharatcer - 10: Saitama is probably among one of my favorite MCs of all time that brings humor to the audiences without fail. However, there is one character that I want to point out that stands out so much for me and made this series even better and that is Tatsumaki, or known as Tornado. (P.S.: Her outfit, mmhm.. Ladies out there, you might not want to walk out in the public with her outfit or even try to cosplay as her because uhh... You do realise that she doesn't wear any undergarments right?) With every second Tatsumaki had screen time, I enjoyed it so much because of the humor that she brings to the table, I love her so much. #waifumaterial, and of course, her sexiness...... I mean i just can't ignore that outfit of hers. The other characters were awesome as well but Tatsumaki standed out the most to me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9: As I have mentioned countless of times above, I enjoyed this anime so much and this anime brings a smile to my face with every episode because of the comedy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9: This anime is almost perfect and definitely stands out from all the anime this season. However, it is still a long shot for me to give this anime a 10/10  rating because it really takes quite a lot for an anime to be rated as a 10/10 masterpiece in my books. As mentioned above, the story line can be made a little more interesting although I have no idea how because I am not creative >< Also, this anime has to have more episodes because 12 episodes just isn't enough to tell the entire tale. Hopefully there will be a season 2. \\n\\n\r\nSorry I couldn't summarize this review into 15 or less words. Please forgive me Saitama-sensei :(",

            "content": "Many bad shows are a case of good ideas poorly executed. It\u2019s rare for a show to miss its target in the premise, but One Punch Man does. For a while, the series assumes that powerful characters are a problem in fiction.\r\nThey\u2019re not. Anyone who\u2019s concerned with how intelligent or strong or agile a character is should stop talking about fiction. These aren\u2019t role-playing characters. They don\u2019t have charcter stats and skill trees. If a character has a trait, it\u2019s supposed to be meaningful to his personality.\r\nA character isn\u2019t defined by how strong he is but by simply being strong. It\u2019s not hard to writeintelligent characters. Just have someone solve mathematical problems and put the answer in the character\u2019s brain. It doesn\u2019t matter that Max Cohen is a walking calculator. What\u2019s interesting is how his genius affects his worldview and isolate him.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first episodes, the series piledrives into the ground the idea that overpowered characters are silly. I don\u2019t think anyone thought otherwise, so we get something like Kill La Kill only with less charisma. Everyone looks like Arnold Schwarznegger. Everyone screams and every conflict is solved with one punch. Mr. Krabs also makes a cameo appearance in the first episode, but he\u2019s transformed into another bodybuilding loudmouth.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s only so much you can do with a character who solves everything with one punch. Thankfully, Saitama is not as bland as his skill. He\u2019s a great protagonist with a personality that\u2019s connected to his super-strength. It\u2019s almost psychological how bored he is of all the macho bullshit, but he\u2019s also vain and wants the attention. The anime remains satirical and exaggerated but the protagonist has a realistic psychology.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s Saitama\u2019s desire for stardom and everyone\u2019s megalomania that shapes the main arc. At this point the anime abandons making fun of obvious targets and starts creating actual absurd situations. The villains are rarely interesting. Their purpose is to always get knocked out by one punch. Rather, it\u2019s stardom that\u2019s being satirized.\\n\\n\r\nHow ironic it is to discuss the Bandwagon Fallacy in a review of a popular anime? Popularity doesn\u2019t prove quality. Just because you don\u2019t have a diploma from an Intelligence Institution doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re stupid. Yet we take these things very seriously. People are often more curious about whether my writing is popular instead of how good it is.\\n\\n\r\nDiplomas or popularity don\u2019t prove you\u2019re talented. They only prove someone thinks are you are. Popularity is even worse than diplomas, though. Diplomas are given by people of authority who take their topics seriously. People can be easily swayed.\\n\\n\r\nThe most popular people on earth aren\u2019t the hard workers or the life savers. The most popular people are those with the highest social value. They are the charismatic, the beautiful, the entertaining. Taylor Swift is more well-known than a person who saves a baby from a fire. That\u2019s because Taylor is charismatic, beautiful and writes catchy songs. Just because you save a person from a fire doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a desirable social presence. It gets even worse with peolpe who Famous Because They\u2019re Famous.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is wise enough not to pull that strawmen. There are these silly celebrities, but here the popularity of most heroes are justified. They\u2019re both charismatic and talented, but they\u2019re never as talented as Saitama.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s because, unlike them, he never worked on being popular. He became the strongest hero because he only put effort into being strong rather than being popular. That\u2019s the cost of talent. Sometimes you focus so much on it that you forget to make people notice you.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a major rise in quality once the series finds its satirical target. While it presents it well, pointing absurdities without resorting to strawmen it can never attain a sense of madness it aims for.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first episodes, it thinks it will get by having everyone scream and some stupid ideas like a muscular crab and a kabuto macho dude. I used different words but this is the same idea. It tones down later but the series never gives up on this.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some interesting visual ideas, but almost everything is given the macho look. It fits with themes, but after the 10th dude who looks like sirloin steak it becomes boring. When Tornado appears and we get a cute girl it\u2019s a shock.\\n\\n\r\nJust as they are all macho dudes, their personalities are all macho. Besides Saitama\u2019s everyman personality and Genos, who acts like he walked into the wrong anime, characters blur into each other. It makes for a consistent world. At least the anime tried to find variety in macho bullshit rather than pretend their kaleidoscopic. Still, it makes for a world that\u2019s always less exciting than how the characters perceive it.\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man isn\u2019t amazing and quickly stops acting like the Most Hyped Show of the Season. That\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s when it realizes its limitations (the world is monochrome and tame, overpowered characters aren\u2019t worth satirizing) and its strengths (satirizing celebrity culture, finding variety in macho bullshit) it becomes a worthwhile show that has enough personality to appeal to those outside the genre.\\n\\n\r\n3.5 one punches out of 5\\n",

            "content": "( NO SPOILERS, so feel free to read)\r\nNow that the anime finished airing, all anime fans are divided into 2 kinds. The first one is those who think that this anime is the best/one of the best ever, at least from what they've watched, and others who think that OPM anime is overrated. I belong to the second kind. I'm not a hater. I've completed watching it, and i enjoyed it a lot. I'm not saying that overrated means bad or mediocre. I personally think that it was a good anime.\r\nStory - 7 \r\nOPM plot is very simple. Saitama is so strong that he candefeat every villain with just one punch. The anime has a lot of action and awesome fights, but it lacks depth in the plot. It is just Saitama who meets other heroes, and they fight with the villains(or each other). The plot flaws decent. Of course, you can't have very deep plot for an anime with 12 episodes, but i've seen other anime with 12 or 10 episodes who had at least an interesting plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - 10\\n\r\nI don't have much to say  here. Yes, this was an incredible animation for an action anime. Detailed backrounds, awesome art on characters and unique special effects during the fights. Action scenes drawn fantastically and very fluid and diverse, what is to be expected of a Madhouse produced anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound -  8\\n\r\nNothing too good here, but that doesn't mean that it is bad. The voice acting and the backround music is very good and everything fits the atmosphere and the characters. Also, there is no narrator.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8 \\n\r\nVaried characters, but very one-dimensional  and stereotypical. It fits with the narrative and overall story that it is trying to convey. You have some awesome heroes(from cyborgs to ninjas) but nothing too good/special about them. And you get to see the typical villains.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9 \\n\r\nDespite considering this anime overrated, i can't say that i didn't enjoy it. Awesome fights and full of action. That's why i (mostly) enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOveral - 8 \\n\r\nHype destroys everything. Seriously. I got bored/tired by this huge hype. I understand why this anime was so hyped, but i can't understand why people think it's too good. For me, this DOES NOT deserve to be so high at the top anime list. The well executed action scenes alongside the top-notch animation quality, certainly makes it worth a watch on its own, yet is not suited for anyone who wants to see epic story/plot, characters with well rounded backstories etc...  As i said, i do not hate or dislike it, i liked it a lot, but to certain factors.\\n\r\n(English is not my native language, so sorry for my grammar and vocabulary mistakes)\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "I've been mulling over this show with my reviewer cap on for awhile, but my first  gut impression is still my strongest: This was the most fun I've had with a show in a long time.\r\nHow does one rate One Punch Man?  It has its flaws.  As a parody, it falls flat at times.  It reuses the same jokes, and not all of them are that funny.  The fight scenes are awesome but arguably suffer from their predictable outcome.  But even as I'm writing this, there's a very insistent voice at the back of my head saying \"I don'tcare, I loved it.\"\\n\\n\r\nI think the final judge of this show is just how gosh darn enjoyable it is to watch.  The animation is phenomenal, particularly during action; the characters are fun and lovable; and most importantly the show seems to smoosh everything I enjoy about shounen and fighting anime into one package (dare I say, one punch?) without taking itself seriously for a moment.  I'm reminded weirdly of a movie like Pacific Rim or Godzilla.  You can argue the craft of these movies all you like, but at the end of the day, people are coming for the giant monsters ok, and if there's giant monsters, the movie has delivered.  That's how I feel about One Punch Man.  You're coming here for fun and entertainment, and you're going to get that.  A lot of it.  It's gonna be awesome.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I think One Punch Man's greatest flaw is that there isn't enough of it.  Not only do I want more (I want so much more), but the show suffers from a lack of conclusion or overarching plot.  It probably made the right choice not trying to force in any arbitrary cohesiveness to bring its 12 episodes together, but I feel like it would have been much more suited for a longer running series.  I hope we see more animation for it in the future, as it really is perfectly suited for anime.\\n\\n\r\nI have to point out, though, that when a series' biggest flaw is that you want more, it's doing pretty darn good.  I loved One Punch Man.  There I said it.  I loved it so much that any nitpicking I could do won't even make a dent in how much I loved it.  Give it a shot.  It's definitely a great ride.",

            "content": "Story: 8\r\nThe story of One Punch Man is simply hilarious. It pokes a lot of fun of the traditional tropes of an shonen anime. You know a hero trains to get stronger, loses, finds out there is a big boss, loses, gets stronger, filler, gets stronger, and eventually beating the big boss for the grand happy ending leading to another big boss or season 2. This show does none of that. Instead our protagonist, Saitama, breaks all of those rules. He is a hero for fun who is extremely overpowered to the point he is bored of fighting. For a second, I thought Saitama wasstruggling with his humanity while exploring deeper ideas besides finding an opponent worthy of fighting.I guess that\u2019s just me. Saitama is joined by a cyborg named Genos who has a very decent story as well. It was quite shonen-ish, but great overall. I\u2019m not gonna go into too many details because who needs a long ass origin story or explanation. Just know when the adventure begins, be prepared to enjoy the journey because I did.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10\\n\r\nIT\u2019S A MADHOUSE! MADHOUSE is simply amazing, I don\u2019t know what else to say. I don\u2019t think I have ever seen a bad Madhouse show. The animation is flawless, crisp, and simple. The OK Saitama face is definitely a highlight along with just about every scene Tornado is in. I left it for you to laugh at. LAUGH WITH ME DAMN IT! LOOK IT IS MADHOUSE\u2026MADHOUSE IS NOT GONNA LET YOU DOWN. THE ANIMATION IS VERY PLEASING TO THE EYES BECAUSE IT IS MADHOUSE!\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10One Punch Man 5.jpg\\n\r\nONE PUNCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! Listen, yall this is one of the best opening theme songs I have ever heard in my life. I\u2019m not exaggerating it is as simple as that. \u201cThe Hero\u201d will get you so pumped, so hyped, so prepared to take on the world and punch stuff! I scream the One Punch part every time I hear it. Jam Project knocked it out of the park with this theme.\\n\\n\r\nJUST WATCH JAM PROJECT PERFORM IT LIVE! IT IS BEAUTIFUL.\\n\r\n[This is where the youtube link would be to see it live.]\\n\\n\r\nISN\u2019T THAT AMAZING?! This song alone gives the music score a ten! BTW the ending theme (\u201cHoshi yori Saki ni Mitsukete Ageru (\u661f\u3088\u308a\u5148\u306b\u898b\u3064\u3051\u3066\u3042\u3052\u308b)\u201d by Hiroko Moriguchi) is pretty awesome.\\n\\n\r\nHere is that theme for your listening pleasure.\\n\r\n[This is where the youtube link would be to see it live.]\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nMAIN CHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nSaitama \u2013 The strongest hero in the universe point blank, I am declaring Saitama the strongest human in the anime universe. In order to become a hero, Saitama went under an intense training & diet regiment to obtain his goal to the point he went bald. He has acheived that goal and you would think he would be an egomaniac. WRONG. Saitama is a laid back, care free, frugal, hero for fun that world doesn\u2019t seem to notice despite Saitama saving the city frequently. Saitama is the king of training and sales at the supermarket all at the age of 25.\\n\\n\r\nGenos \u2013 The lone cyborg willing to get stronger under the training of Saitama. Genos is very loyal, but he is extremely serious like most shonen characters. His origin story created the classic \u201c20 words or less\u201d rule which I find very amusing. I was thinking the show was gonna shift more towards his story at one point. If this show as about Genos, this would have been your typical anime about one character\u2019s journey to retribution.\\n\\n\r\nSUPPORTING CHARACTERS -NOW listen I am not gonna name every single supporting character because EVERY SINGLE SUPPORTING CHARACTER IS FREAKING AMAZING! THEY ALL ADD SOMETHING TO EACH EPISODE! IT may be a little moment or a one liner, but damn I gotta admit this show made each one of the supporting characters feel important when they were on the screen. I absolutely loved the way this show treated their supporting cast because each one of them could have an episode or an series or OVA about them. Mumen Rider is hilarious while Handsome Mask the other word for a male rooster! The heroes association alone could have an anime & I WOULD WATCH EVERY SINGLE EPISODE.\\n\\n\r\nAdditional Mentions\\n\r\n1. A huge thank you to Shingo Natsume for directing this anime and making One Punch Man everything it is supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\n2.  I had thought that left me a tad conflicted. While Saitama is extremely powerful\u2026ok over powered, would I be rooting for him if he was the villain of the anime? I think the answer would still be yes. Saitama is likable and I think that\u2019s what sets him apart from antagonist that are considered cheap (I\u2019m looking at you Aizen). What do you think?\\n\\n\r\n3. Second season please?! PLEASE?!\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is simply amazing. It was a wonderful ride that pokes fun at the shonen genre along with tropes of anime. The story isn\u2019t something too memorable, but it is hilarious. Everything else besides that is perfect. I can understand how some people may not like OPM since everything ends in 1 punch & the comedy may get a bit repetitive sometimes due to the punchline is the same despite a different setup. Besides that, One Punch Man is an amazing anime that I highly recommend you to watch!\\n\\n\r\nSaitama can beat just about anyone\u2026yep I said it. GET ON THE SAITAMA TRAIN\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9.5\\n",

An action-packed adrenaline rush. Within a few episodes though they slowed down (a tiny bit) to involve some backstory and plot which has been entertaining and kept me watching episode toepisode excited about what's coming next.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in this anime is second to none. It's brilliant and has a certain polish to it's look whether it's in the more comedic or full on action scenes. I can not fault this anime for it's aesthetics.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio in this show is fantastic from the sound effects, voice acting or music. I have really enjoyed it and it definitely adds to the overall quality of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show is faultless in many areas probably my favourite part so far has been the characters. From the villains, to the heroes, to our main protagonist Saitama they are all completely badass and are an absolute treat to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the best new anime I've watched in the last few years and I am truly loving it so far. I just wish season 2 was out already!!",

            "content": "One Punch Man is a story with a strong and loyal fanbase, and was the perfect candidate to become an anime. Did Madhouse deliver?\r\nStory:\r\nIt's different. As a parody of the usual superhero/shounen genre, it manages to go where you'd expect to some extent. Still, the personal struggles of the main characters are interesting and unique, without losing the almost cheesy superhero parody feel that they were intended to produce. The story isn't really the point as much as the overarching concept, which is done very well. 8/10\r\nArt & Sound:\r\nMadhouse gives what we've come to expect from them in terms of animation, and maybe even abit more. With plenty of guest animators working on the project, it still managed to carry a unique style from one episode to the next, and it goes without saying that the fight scenes are outstanding. Easily the best thing about this series would be the fight scenes, choreography and all... Art 10/10\\n\r\nAs for the sound, the opening song is an absolute perfect fit for the series, and I watched it every episode. The ending theme, however, wasn't the best fit for the series, and though it might be good in the right context, it just wasn't right for this show. The sounds of each punch, each hit, and all the destruction, are just a bit above average, and most of the voice acting is just a bit above average too... Sound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that there are some very distinct characters in this show. That being said, there was a noticeable lack of character development through the show. It's hard to call this a bad thing, as it fits the premise of the series (being a parody of superhero shows) perfectly. There was also a very strong divide between the main cast and supporting cast, and again, this was deliberate and added to the style of the show. All things considered, the characters didn't have much to add to the show, but they certainly didn't detract from it either. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe reason to watch this show is purely for the enjoyment factor. The show grabs you in episode 1, and sends you into a different world where wacky and funny battles unfold on a grand scale. If you sit and watch it without over-analyzing it, the show is very entertaining without a dull moment. This is the sole reason I gave this show such a high rating. To be clear, if you aren't a fan of the source material already, the series might be a bit forgettable, but you'll enjoy it thoroughly while it lasts. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series deserves an 8 at the lowest, and I'll give it a 9 for the constant enjoyment it delivers, and the surprising amount of emotion it manages to have nestled into 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10",

            "content": "'If you're looking for an action-packed anime with an unconventional main character, superb fight scenes, great soundtrack and well placed hilarity - one-punch-man is just right.  Saitama, the main character, is bald - and his nonchalant expressions can provide any situation with subtle humour that goes further than one would expect.  The gimmick here is that Saitama can defeat any foe with just one punch, and you might think that leaves very little room for a plot - well there is a plot, and it's quite fantastic. The brilliance of this story pivots not on Saitama's sheer power (which is way over 9000),but on how his power effects others and his interactions with those weaker than himself. Furthermore, the main character does not struggle with the infamous \"will of fire\", but rather he suffers from an insatiable thirst for an even fight, or to defeat an opponent stronger than he is.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, this is a parody, it feels more like an actual effort to write a well thought-out story than some other trivial animes out there.' -DeeAd\\n\\n\r\n+The visuals are spectacular, and a mix of vibrant explosive colours. Madhouse did a fantastic job on this production. The explosions are masterfully detailed. Movements are given great attention where fight scenes are actual fight scenes - not just a flurry of attacks (although that too can be found from time to time).\\n\\n\r\n+The OST fits perfectly with the thrilling action, with blaring heavy rock encapsulating the tempo of most fights. But, also at moments of captivating emotion violons can be heard, and are quite effective in producing an encouraging and warm sound that will capture your heart. Also, the opening and ending songs are quite nice.\\n\\n\r\n+The comedy hardly fails, and surprisingly is more mature than you'd expect in most cases.\\n\\n\r\n- The characters may in fact be the weakest aspect of the anime but are still interesting nonetheless. You'll find yourself wanting to know some backstory to much of the hero characters; their abilities are very well done, and quite unique. Unfortunately some are quite ridiculous, and not with any comedic effect. Furthermore, due to the lack of actual difference in the abilities of the villains themselves - the show somewhat suffers here. This is where the anime lacks in creativity and ingenuity.",

            "content": "If you're going to watch this show, my first advice to you, is to watch it with your brain turned off. If you go into this show analyzing it and looking for all the flaws, you better believe it's gonna have a lot of them. Why? BECAUSE IT'S A FREAKIN PARODY ANIME WITH A GUY SO OP HE CAN KILL ANY OPPONENT WITH JUST ONE PUNCH!!!! Do you really think this show is going to make sense? If you are the kinda person that enjoys analyzing all the shows you watch, chances are you won't like this show. But if you're the kinda person thatcan sit back, turn your brain off, and enjoy a show for what it's worth. Than I think you'll love One Punch Man.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnyway, despite all I said at the start, I'd honestly say the show made pretty good sense despite it's concept. The story was simple, but unique at the same time. Especially as far as anime is concerned. A Superhero organization that ranks their heroes.......sounds pretty familiar to something else over in the states.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnother thing I'd like to bring up. A character like Saitama, one that can kill any enemy with one punch...............you'd think that would actually make the show boring. Like there'd be no angst, because you just know that Saitama is going to come out on the top every time........but this show does it in such a way that it's just so entertaining to see. I was never bored for a second and I was constantly one the edge of my seat. So if you're one of the people that was avoiding this show due to that issue, believe me when I say that you won't be disappointed by the way they approached it. It was really well handled.\\n\\n\r\nCon: The only major issue I had with this show is they replayed the same plot over and over. A city get's attacked by a monster. Heroes are falling one by one trying to fight said monster. And the whole time were just waiting for Saitama to get their and take them out. It was all done to build up the anticipation once Saitama got their, BUT i can see why they did that. I mean, if you have a hero that can take anyone out with one hit...........they gotta find someway to put people on the edge of their seat. I just wish they had changed it up. Do something a little different each time. I think they replayed that plot at least 4 times. And in a 12 episode show, that takes up a good portion of it. BUT once again, I can't deny that I loved every second of each of those plots.\\n\\n\r\n\tBesides that, there's not much else I want to say. All the characters were really interesting and fun. The turmoils that this show has really got me choked up a few times. Not gonna lie. And the climax was FREAKIN AMAZING!!! I binge watched this show 3 days ago guys, so when I finally got to the end and I had to wait for the last episode.........I got pissed at myself for not having watched it when it was all out.\\n\\n\r\n\tSo overall, does this show have issues that could bring down it's score? Yes.  Do I give a crap about those issues? HECK NO!!! Going back through and trying to find the issues would only ruin the amazing experience I had with the show, and I don't want to do that. \\n\\n\r\n\tBut anyway, the fact that I know it had issues at all is the only reason why I'm not giving it a 10/10. Instead, my final score with One Punch Man is a 9/10. And I'd recommend this show to literally EVERYONE!!! Heck, I'm probably gonna even buy the series. I MIGHT EVEN START READING ONE PUNCH MAN ONE!!! That's how much I loved it :D\\n",

            "content": "He is strong, maybe even the strongest. And his name is Saitama. He and his faithful android sidekick, Genos, are the heroes City A deserves.\r\n1) Let's first talk about the atmosphere. First of all, the art is superb. Well drawn characters, buildings, effects and so on. There are a number of cities named after only a single letter - City A, B, C and so on. Each city is protected by the so-called \"Hero Organisation\": a powerful syndicate consisting of strong candidates for heroes, ranked in different hero classes (S, A, B, C). The sad part is that the cities happen to get smashed almostevery episode. Saitama and the rest of the heroes give their best to keep the cities and citizens safe from impending doom, which could be waiting from any direction. We have an interesting and simple story and also great animation by studio Madhouse. The result would be 10/10 for both the Art and the Story.\\n\\n\r\n2) Now comes the sound. The first thing that caught my eye was the flashy opening (The Hero by JAM project). The lyrics scream Power all over.\\n\r\nWe couldn't want more from the voice actors and music directors, everything fits perfectly, by my opinion. The only thing I disliked with the sound was the ending credits, but I guess I can ignore that in the final result of 10/10 for the sound.\\n\\n\r\n3) The characters. Without these amazing characters, there would be no show. The main characters are, of course, Saitama, the \"hero for fun\". Later in the show, we are introduced to Genos, a human cyborg sworn to become stronger, by any means. As he notices Saitama's strength, he immediately becomes his sidekick and disciple, hoping to become as strong as his master. Later in the show we are also introduced to more heroes, and also villains, let's not forget the hideous monsters and citizens. Look forward to the beach babe. Simply top, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\n4) Enjoyment 10/10 - The hype! I waited every week for this show and watched it the first chance I got. That's how big the hype is, I couldn't wait for a dose of pure awesomeness. This was one amazing experience, the fighting scenes are off the charts spectacular masterpieces to watch. It's so well animated that it's hard to track what the actual f is going on. Look forward to episode 12.\\n\\n\r\n5) Overall 10/10. No worries, everything was spectacular. I will be waiting for season 2 and I suspect that a lot of One Punch Man's viewers are, as well.\\n\\n\r\n(Please message me if I made any grammar mistakes or anything spoilish/offending/wrong in this review. Just trying to show my affection for the series in this Review.)\\n",

            "content": "There are no spoilers in this review. My rating system counts story for 30% of the total, characters as 30%, art as 20%, and 15% for the sound. \r\nI give One Punch Man a 6.2 and I'll tell you why.\r\nStory: 6 \r\nThe story in itself was not that great. Simply put, there are people who act as heroes and they protect the world from getting destroyed by monsters. The anime focuses on one of those heroes. The only thing that really makes this story slightly more creative is that the heroes have a rating system where the higher a hero is, the more respect he/shegets. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the quirks and personalities of most of the minor characters in this anime, but I found the main character quite boring. Making the main character overpowered is acceptable to me as long as there are redeeming qualities, but Saitama had none. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, the main character of Is It Wrong To Try To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon was insanely overpowered but at least he had an interesting personality and had to go through hardships before acquiring those powers. Saitama didn\u2019t earn his powers and the entire season never bothered to show why he deserved them.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art for One Punch Man was spot on for the anime. It didn\u2019t blow my mind, but the style fit the anime. When there was an intense fight the animation looked completely different from when there was comedy involved. The monsters looked pretty epic as well. Even though I wouldn\u2019t say the art was outstanding, it definitely carried the shallow story throughout the season. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe music for this anime, especially the theme song, was perfect. It really kept the anime interesting, and the sound, along with the art, is what kept me from dropping the anime all together. Without the timing of the music, the comedy of this anime would not have been nearly as good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.2\\n\\n\r\nAfter completing this anime, I honestly felt like I wasted my time. The driving force of this anime was humor but it couldn\u2019t quite carry the deadweight of the lackluster story and boring main character. If comedy is good enough to carry an anime for you then you\u2019ll probably enjoy this anime but it wasn\u2019t enough for me. \\n",

            "content": "Waring this review has spoilers.\r\nFirst Impressions\r\nSo we\u2019ve got parody of superheroes with a M.C. who takes out his enemy's with one punch and its apparently considered to be the savior of anime. What could possibly go wrong?  \r\nSide note, this has been edited on 3/3/16Story, 6/10\\n\r\nOne Punch Man is an okay parody on the super hero genre. it has this very bare bones \u201cmonster of the week\u201d kind of plot. \\n\r\nOne punch man basic plot  didn't really bother me that much because this is a parody show and when it comes to parody shows you really do not need the best story out there you just need something basic to keep the plot going. When it comes to a basic plot to keep the story going one punch man dose this very well.\\n\r\nAlso while watching this show I had to ask myself did I find this entertaining. Yes I did find it entertaining because at the end of the day that is what a parody show is supposed to do \\n\\n\r\n Now one negative I have to say about One Punch Man and this is probably me nit picking but \\n\r\nas a whole one punch man  runs on a singular joke, which can  make it loses its steam very fast . You might as well call it one pun.\\n\r\nSpeaking of it running on one joke which did bother me a bit because you would think that a parody show would have more jokes than just one joke. But what should I have expected from a title like one punch man. \\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                             Character's, 5/10 \\n\\n\r\n The M.C. is overpowered to the max. he just an average guy who want to be hero for fun and fight strong opposition.\\n\r\nThe side characters are quite lively and some what interesting. \\n\r\nThey are pretty much parodys of super hero type would see in comic books.  \\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Art, 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fanatic to say the least with its lovely backgrounds and well animated fights. \\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                            Sound, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt has a great op that matches the show and a good ost that fits the shows tone.\\n\r\nThe ost was made by makoto Miyazaki \\n\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nwhat I love about this show is the fact that it is doing a parody on super hero's. I also like the over the top fight scenes. but I did find it a little boreing after awhile. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n overall, 6/10 \\n\\n\r\none punch man is  an ok parody on the super hero. but its not the savoir of anime as people will say it is. now with you want a fun show to watch \\n\r\nthen you will love one punch man.",
