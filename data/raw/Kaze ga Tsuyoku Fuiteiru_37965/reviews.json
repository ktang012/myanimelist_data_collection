            "content": "Watching Welcome to the Ballroom throughout it\u2019s six month long two cour run was one of the most disheartening experiences I\u2019ve yet to endure in all of my years. I watched as the industry titan Production I.G. themselves, those who\u2019ve defined high-quality TV animation with the sports shows Kuroko no Basket and especially Haikyuu!, as they aired a similarly structured sports anime that panned over still frames and used basically constructed CG character models for background athletes like you\u2019d expect from any other garbage studio. No matter how attractive and sharp the male designs were and no matter how shapely and sexy the female designswere, no matter how lively the color palette popped and setting design shined, no matter how elegant the soundtrack nor how powerful the dialogue, the show simply could not inspire, grip, or elate it\u2019s audience in the same fashion it\u2019s predecessors could for the stain that was it\u2019s poor quality of animation. Call me a wishful thinker, but they\u2019re back. Production I.G. is back in a big way with Run with the Wind.\\n\\n\r\nRun with the Wind boasts such a splendidly lavish animation production which reminds you just how impressive this studio is at it\u2019s best of times. The character designs are as clean, sharp, and attractive as those of Haikyuu and Welcome to the Ballroom, and they\u2019re animated with a level of ornate detail which was incessantly impressive. The character designs of the main cast, as well as the voice actors chosen to play them, clearly had a lot of thinking behind them for you can see exactly why they dress the way they dress, why they walk the way they walk, why they accessorize they way they accessorize, and any other aspects of personality appearance you\u2019d expect to notice on human beings in real life, and as you learn more about them as the show progresses you\u2019ll slowly start noticing more and more of those little details that had been there the entire time. It\u2019s amazing, and with the animation production and art design put aside, I\u2019m just going to say it, Run with the Wind has hand-drawn backgrounds with Kyoto Animation\u2019s level of detail, color design, researched setting references, perfect balance of finesse and flair, naturalistic beauty yet realistic subtlety, and general quality. I would go back through the episodes and take screenshots of the gorgeous backgrounds to add to my desktop\u2019s background reel, because I felt it would be legitimately wasteful to let such beautiful pieces of artwork go unappreciated. On top of the impeccable visuals, the sound design and music stand just as tall and proud. The sound design is so detailed, nuanced, and ever-present, that when I notice it I become so absorbed and distracted as to miss entire lines of dialogue and have to rewind. The soundtrack is an easy nine out of ten, and I can say that without hesitation. The composer did the monumentally epic and blood pumping OST for Haikyuu, the emotionally gripping and stylized Studio Trigger OST for Kiznaiver, and the OST for Death Parade which reached the heights of both contemplative character pieces and exciting psychological thriller pieces. I simply cannot praise the production of Run with the Wind any more without it coming across as hyperbole. It\u2019s truly amazing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the narrative and writing itself, while not being as breathtakingly perfect as the production, is still pretty damn good in it\u2019s own right. The main cast of characters is one of the most realistic ensembles in all of anime, easily competing with shows like Durarara, Hajjime no Ippo, and Assassination Classroom who\u2019re known for their enormous yet somehow well developed ensemble casts. Not to put them down, for those examples are all quite good shows, but unlike those shows Run with the Wind manages to mete out character development in a realistic, grounded, subtle, and emotionally resonant manner. At no point in the show is there anything that could be described as an \u201carc.\u201d Never does the narrative take a break for drama, nor does it ever feel like one character in particular is being too overbearing or stealing the spotlight. The story sets itself up and goes, with any necessary character development or exploration sneaking it\u2019s way into the narrative naturally and in a very down to earth fashion. This sensible pacing also works wonders for the dramatic conflict in the story because you can really see the build up to all the happenings. Nothing ever comes out of nowhere and is usually spawned from within the main character, Kakeru, who you know well enough to both sympathize and empathize with. One thing I could very well see people having a problem with is the straight-man who brings all the character conflict to the table\u2026is Kakeru himself. I certainly didn\u2019t have a problem with it because, again, his motivations are so well written and deep-seated within his character that I totally get where he\u2019s coming from, but for someone who doesn\u2019t get it, I can see how the main character being the vehicle for ALL the conflict in the show could annoy some people, so fair warning. I mean, it\u2019s not just Kakeru, really. All the characters have insecurities and hangups which are so real and feel truly genuine. Most anime will have characters ranting and raving about a bunch of out-of-this-world garbage the viewer has no reason to care about, but Run with the Wind does nothing of the sort. The character Nico-chan (a play on the word \u201cnicotine\u201d) has difficulty running for his addiction to smoking and his unhealthy BMI. The character King has trouble being committed to the team because he has to find work to pay for college. The character Shindo has doubts about his involvement with the team because his girlfriend dumped him after feeling he had neglected her. All the characters are real, with real scripts, with real problems. It\u2019s a seriously wonderful cast that brings the relatively straightforward story to life, and there were a number of times I had tears in my eyes watching them cross the finish line.\\n\\n\r\nThe final point I wanted to discuss before concluding is the villains. Sports anime, simply put, NEVER have committed villains. Seriously, just take a second and think about it. It\u2019s ALL mutually understood competition wherein the opponents are never genuinely malicious and are only causing conflict for the sake of sportsmanship. The only time truly antagonist villains appear in sports anime is like Jabberwock from Kuroko no Basket, or Bryan Hawk from Hajime no Ippo, or the Blue Mars from One Outs, or any other two dimensional evil-for-the-sake-of-evil villains out there. Out of all the three thousand plus anime I\u2019ve seen, I\u2019ve yet to see a wholesale ill natured antagonists who truly wants to beat the protagonists solely out of hatred. Sakaki, the main villain in Run with the Wind, is the first character I\u2019ve seen in a sports anime who truly earned the title of \u201cvillain.\u201d His history with Kakeru makes for a heavy motivation for conflict, and his vindictive attitude comes across as being deserved. Again, Kakeru is a realistic flawed character, so the idea he has some skeletons in his closet isn\u2019t all that far fetched. As you learn more about their pasts, and you get both sides of the story, you\u2019re naturally emotionally invested. It\u2019s just another really, really good aspect of the show which I wanted to make a point wasn\u2019t under appreciated at all in my review.\\n\\n\r\nRun with the Wind is a great show I highly recommend for everything I\u2019ve mentioned and more I\u2019ve probably overlooked, but it also has a really resonant psychological core to it, at least for me, and I thought it nice to see such a moving and powerful message portrayed from an otherwise unassuming sports anime. As I\u2019ve said no shortage of times, the main character Kakeru is a really flawed person. He\u2019s impulsive, irritable, and outright violent, and it\u2019s not even anyone\u2019s fault. It\u2019s just who he is, thus he runs. He literally and metaphorically runs away from his problems and is constantly accused of doing so by many characters in the show. As said problems continue to pile up despite his speed, he realizes the problems are within and running simply won\u2019t escape them. When he finally stops and turns around to see all the people he\u2019s hurt along the way, all the mistakes he\u2019s made and regrets he has, and all the people still trying to support him in spite of all this, he really sits down and confronts reality in a poignantly human fashion, and it\u2019s this emotional courage that frees his spirt, so to speak, so he can truly move forward and run with the wind. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Production I.G is back with another excellent drama series that centers around the sport of running. It is highly character-driven and features one of the best group of characters for a sports shonen. Run with the Wind\u2019s main duo each ran away from the sport in the past when their own passion for running was broken by the cruelty of their strict coaches. Running became a burden to them, and a signal of their own inadequacy\u2014Haiji Kiyose through disappointing his father, and Kakeru Kurahara through lashing out at his coach, and thus ensuring his whole team suffered. \r\nWhen your choices are victory or shame, itcan be hard to take pride in your running. For Haiji, learning to find motivation outside of personal glory was forced upon him when he was crippled through injury, ensuring he\u2019d never triumph alone. Instead, he embraced running as a group effort and made his great strength into his ability to connect with and inspire all of his teammates. Though the concept of running a grueling ten-part relay seemed crazy to his reluctant dorm, he took the time to reach out to all of them, and help them find something worth running for while helping them with their personal issues in life. He was selfish and stubborn in the way he went about doing so, but he wouldn\u2019t have done any of it if he didn\u2019t genuinely believe in his team. One thing you can\u2019t take away from Haiji is he is a great motivator, the type you need, and a caring person. He\u2019s helped changed his friend's lives for the better. \\n\\n\r\nThe inspiration to run takes a variety of forms for the characters. Though it\u2019s thrilling as a sports narrative, the story\u2019s main appeal is how well it illustrates the lives and feelings of its runners from the start, and how convincingly it draws them together into a group with both strong individual motivations and mutual trust. Prince finds the courage to run from his manga heroes, while Nico discovers that running brings him mental clarity. Musa and Takashi find friends and a source of pride, while King rediscovers the confidence that perpetual job interviews stole from him. Run with the Wind\u2019s most central character conflict is Kakeru learning to rise above the trauma of the past, and see running not as a burden or source of shame, but an activity that actually brings people together. And as you\u2019d expect, many of the show\u2019s most rewarding moments come not when these characters simply win, but when they learn to better trust each other. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two things Run with the Wind does exceptionally well: its ability to convey the pace and tone of college dorm life, and having the incredible gift for sculpting sympathetic characters and rich, bitter relationships. Each character has their own stories to tell, much of this show\u2019s characterization comes through in its brilliantly observed incidental moments, as Haiji and the rest bicker about classes, divvy up chores, and generally live their college lives. Though I wouldn\u2019t call Run with the Wind a slice of life by no means, it\u2019s able to capture a lived experience and sense of mutual friendship with a grace characteristic of the best of them. With a ten-person team, it\u2019d be easy for half of the cast to get lost in the crowd, but each of them is given plentiful time to express themselves, find their own relationship with running, and ultimately contribute to a greater, loving team. Every member brings something unique and worthwhile to the team, making its insistence that running is a team effort feel utterly convincing. \\n\\n\r\nThere are fantastic character chemistry and dynamics along with great sly, subtle humor but doesn\u2019t rely on them alone. It is also slowly developing its overarching conflict alongside its cast. From the start it is clear that the challenges that await the club are immense, the relay race they intend to participate is an exceedingly competitive affair. But far from the usual framing of these sorts of zero to hero stories, the narrative is much more concerned with the outcomes and beliefs of its cast than the prospect of merely winning. The end goal offers a reason for these people to improve rather than just harping on the importance of victory, and the narrative is much more concerned with presenting their setbacks and growth than anything else. Run with the Wind's portrayal of these characters comes across as naturalistic, humanizing, and occasionally hilarious, the strength of its source material combining with a great adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nProduction I.G did an amazing job all around the board. Run with the Wind\u2019s character designs goes for the realistic body size/proportions but isn\u2019t afraid to bend and flex from that for the sake of expression and interesting visuals. Body language conveys much of the characters\u2019 personalities. Each one has a distinctive design and face, and fluid animation brings out their individual quirks and flaws. The color palette is well balanced that has a very wide range for the various type of moods. Backgrounds are well detailed, stellar scenery and good use of depicting the change of weather for each of the four seasons. The running scenes are animated superbly and mix well with the sound effects and exceptional and well-timed soundtrack. Without background music, the show emphasizes the rhythm of the characters breathing and measured footfalls. Facial expressions, movement of the body, arms, legs, correct body posture and hair swaying back and forth are all down with attention to detail, even the perspiration of the runners. A setback was definitely its usage of CG, which was mainly used for some of the background runners or crowds of people.\\n\\n\r\nVoice actors are perfect matches to their character and lots of credit to them, they absolutely nailed their roles, made conversations feel like the type that any normal person would have with their friends, having the ability to go through a wide range of tones and emotion. They treated the characters with care and brought them to life. Being able to pass off the banter as genuine as these voice actors did only go to show their expertise. The soundtrack is gorgeous, a matter of fact, it\u2019s a masterpiece and definitely a one to own. Once again, the music is all timed-well hitting all the emotional moments on cue, it just invokes a lot of feelings on its own and when you add it alongside the story being told visually, you\u2019re getting poetry in motion on your screen. A mesmerizing mix of synth-pop and orchestra goes to show just how Yuki Hayashi is one of the most promising composers in the industry right now, he\u2019s already amongst the best. The OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s are all excellent with \"Reset\" by Taichi Mukai being a favorite.\\n\\n\r\nIn this show, what is valued is human interaction; connecting with those around you in a deeper, richer level without wanting anything from them. It's about falling in love and re-connecting with something that materialism can't give you. And strangely enough, is about selflessness and community through introspection. Run with the Wind masterfully weaves all these concepts into a beautiful story that touches your heart from the start. Life, like running, is not all about time but about our experiences along the way. Your greatest runs are rarely measured by racing success. They are brief moments in time when running allows you to see how wonderful your life is. You have to drive yourself to overcome the obstacles. You might feel that you can't. But then you find your inner strength and realize you're capable of so much more than you thought. What Run with the Wind has taught me, perhaps more than anything else, that there's no reason to fear starting lines or other new beginnings.",

            "content": "Is it just me or does it seem like we don\u2019t get enough literature anime adaptations these days? Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru (also known as Run With the Wind) is an actual book adaptation and features competitive running as part of its plot. Like most competitive sports, the show delivers storytelling to feature the journey of characters to accomplish their goals. Thankfully, this show delivers a promise that won\u2019t leave you disappointed.\r\nTo check off the bucket list, you should probably ask yourself if you enjoy a story driven by drama with sports elements. Because make no mistake, this anime contains a great deal of realismwhile selling drama at every chance it gets. It will try to evoke emotions out of the viewers and between the storytelling, you\u2019ll experience a story with its insightful character cast.\\n\\n\r\nMeet Kakeru Kurahara, the 1st year former elite runner at Kansei University. The first episode shows his daredevil actions as he is caught stealing. Thankfully, he is saved by 4th year student Haiji Kiyose who has an ambitious dream of competing in the Hakone Ekiden. The Hakone Ekiden is considered an important relay race taking place btween Tokyo and Hakone in Japan. Kakeru seems like a perfect candidate to be on the team. Upon being invited to the Kanse University Dorm, he quickly discovers it\u2019s a place for the Track and Field team. The show sets up for huge amount of story and character development as we quickly realize how weak their team actually is.\\n\\n\r\nNow I\u2019ll say right off the bat that I am a sucker for an underdog story. It has potential to develop characters on many levels. The problem here is that Kakeru isn\u2019t a noob compared to the rest of the team. He already has experience in running but lacks the enthusiasm. This is explained through some very complicated and dark background storytelling. Apparently, an incident from his former Track & Field team caused him to doubt himself. Nonetheless, I believe Kakeru\u2019s personality to be one that people can understand after seeing what he\u2019s been through. This is a sharp contrast to Haiji, who is always enthusiastic about the team and his dream. The main problem is that the team requires a lot of training and commitment to compete at the Hakone Ekiden level. Still, I appreciate the character bond of the team. As the show progresses, Kakeru begins to realize that he\u2019s not running alone and that he has friends to run with. A main selling point about Kakeru\u2019s own journey is how he conquers his personal demon and move beyond his past.\\n\\n\r\nYou better get used to seeing a lot of Kakeru and Haiji\u2019s character bonding in this story. Interestingly, the rest of the cast get their spotlights too as they reinforce the show\u2019s themes. Characters such as Takashi and Akane (aka Prince) are inspirational for their dedication and realization to succeed. Remember, most of the guys in Haiji\u2019s team aren\u2019t experienced or very athletic. It takes a strong will, determination, and attitude to become succesful. The show carries character development as its team members strives to be the best they can be. It\u2019s a relatable concept that can be applied to real life with goals being accomplished through hard work. I personally find the show\u2019s attitude to be very inspirational with many of its character cast conquering their fears and running toward their dreams. \\n\\n\r\nAs dramatic as the show can be, do also expect a decent amount of lighthearted moments and comedy. The Jo twins are a prime example of this with their playful personalities. The man service also adds in some cheek humor when the team have bonding moments while discussing about their goals. When the drama picks up though, definitely be prepare to experience the real deal. Teams such as the Rikudo University is no pushover for their reputation. Haiji\u2019s push to get his team to succeed also comes at an immense amount of effort considering the requirements for this dream race. It\u2019s revealed in the show that the team must rank into the top 10 teams and meet personal records. So by all means, it comes to no surprise the amount of pressure the team can feel while training. This is where the main amount of drama drops in with characters feeling how difficult is to reach their goals. Nonetheless, I confess to say that a show like this meets the satisfaction of \u201cthe journey is more important than the destination\u201d. People may have hard this phrase many times before but as a driving force in the show, it suits for it perfectly. The amount of character development is expanded to most of the main character cast that you can easily recall their names and some of their memorable moments. No one is truly left out in favor of the main cast even as they seem featured more prominently at times. \\n\\n\r\nAs a Production I.G. show, this definitely reminds me a bit of their other sports projects. Haikyu especially comes to mind for its similar character designs and competitive atmosphere. More importantly, I felt the great deal of realism for its character designs. Throughout the show, the characters evolve physically and mentally. Their character expressions and reactions carries an emotional weight that can easily be felt throughout the show. It\u2019s the type of feeling when you finally earn a sense of pride and accomplishment after all the hard work. And don\u2019t forget, the team is consisted of cool guys so the man service can be a treat for the ladies.\\n\\n\r\nWith 23 episodes, I confess to say that it\u2019s the perfect amount for this particular anime. Why? That\u2019s because it managed to develop its character cast while staying consistent with the storytelling. The amount of realism made me realize how inspirational this show can be. With every episode, I felt compelled to see just how much the characters can succeed for their future. Honestly, we need more literature adaptations these days.",

MY OPINIONS MAY CHANGE OR NOT CHANGE IN THAT TIME.\r\nI usually sleep on my left side of my bed, while ya'll sleep on this show. But... seriously guys, this is probably the most underrated anime from this season. A hidden gem if you must. Which is surprising, with sports anime usually gathering the biggest fandoms in the anime community, such as \"Yuri!! On Ice!\", \"Free!!\" and \"Haikyuu!\". Maybe it's because this anime doesn't have a exclamation mark in its name? I'm just joking.But honestly though, if youre not watching this show I advise you to watch it, youre still not convinced allow me to give you my review on it.\\n\\n\r\nS T O R Y 7/10\\n\r\nOut of all the other scores, this is the lowest. Not because the plot is bad. It just that it's generic to any other sports anime. But at the same time, just because something is unorginal, it doesn't make it boring. It just means that if youve watched lots of sports anime you might be a bit disappointed. To sum it up, it follows the trend of one character being passionate about a sport, he wants to get the team to win a championship, team is unmovtiated/underdogs, another team member is really good at the sport but is not longer enjoying it because of past experiences or another reason, but they all find love for the sport eventually, Yeet. You get the spin. But although the plot flops with its slight unoriginality, the show isnt boring at all, due to its characters and animation, which I will talk about soon. \\n\\n\r\n A R T 9/10\\n\r\nSo far, the animation and art style have been consistently good. With most shows, with animation starts to struggle after the 6th episode, but so far it hasn't even had one poorly animated scene. Not only is it consistent, is its good, like really good. Especially the characters facial expressions\u2026 god I love them. The happiness, anger, fatigue, sometimes the facial expressions are on the level of \"A Silent Voice\"; which is basically god standards for emotion. The colours are bright and the colour palette isnt ugly at all. \\n\\n\r\nS O U N D 8/10\\n\r\nWhile the soundtrack isnt insanely amazing, it is pretty goddamn good and noticeable. Aka, it doesn't fade into the background it is used effectively. It being a mix of light electronic and your usually soundtrack stuff. The ED being very light electronic. Also the op is really good, not just the song but the visuals itself.\\n\\n\r\nC H A R A C T E R S 10/10\\n\r\nThis is the best bit about this show, easily. If the casts of characters wasn't this good, the scores wouldn't be so high. Period. It's hard to describe why, but you just fall in love with them! The show does have a slightly large cast, but they are all rememeberable and unique. Within the first episode they are all effectively introdouced perfectly and not only that, but we get a amazing taste of their personalities. They are all very fun to watch. Plus, their character designs are great, corresponding to their personalities, all looking different but not silly, like actual people. BUT! It isnt just the characters that are outstanding, its how they interact with each other. You can tell which characters get on with other characters, which characters don't talk to each other much, who looks up to who and who looks down on who, who has known each other the longest ect ect. Because of this, watching them walk to each other is extremely charming and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nE N J O Y M E N T / O V E R A L L 9/10\\n\r\nI love this series so much currently. I hope that it continues being this good and heck, even get better. If you can't tell, I recommend everyone to watch this show. Even if youre not a avid sports anime fan. This show is for practically everyone and the fact that its one of the least popular things from this season amazes me.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review. please upvote it if you've gotten this far... it took me a while to write because I deleted about two paragraphs by accident while I was writing this lol. I will edit this review whenever I feel I need to.\\n\r\nHave a nice day! uwu",

            "content": "This show is underrated and a true gem.\r\nStory: 9\r\nRun with the Wind is a really special show, it\u2019s been a long time since any story has quite impacted me this strongly. The story is actually quite simple, a bunch of college students decide to run a marathon, and their journey to reaching it. The execution is where the anime shines, there is never a wasted moment at all, every episode either focuses on the growth of a character, the growth of the team, or a major cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more. The anime outside of some unrealistic dramatic scenes, felt very relatable and refreshing,the college students felt mature, but not to mature, just the way people out of high school should feel. There weren\u2019t to many stupid scenes involving walking into a bathroom that was unlocked or getting into a fight with some rival school or team like you would see in a show set in a middle school or high school. The setting was executed effectively, the jokes were solid, the pacing was consistent, and the story did not ignore anything that was very important. \\n\\n\r\nThe last part is important because it allows the viewer to actually believe a team largely comprised of people who have never run competitively before could somehow actually qualify for the hardest college marathon in their country and perform well in it. The story focused on their training, on the amount of suffering they went through, on the support they had from their community and family, and most importantly on how each character overcame their obstacles one at a time instead of suddenly being a top tier runner.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a strong execution of a sports anime plot, it will keep you wanting more, it will make you feel excited for the team and their performance, and it will make you actually focus on all the subtle scenes that are thrown in and connected to the characters in the final race.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth and clean, there were no major problems with it, the running choreography was some of the best I seen in anime, especially during the final race. Character designs did feel a bit basic, like the characters were just remodels of other shows done by Production IG, specifically Haikyuu. There is not much else to say, it was a good production, but nothing super amazing, it gets an 8 just for the angle and animation quality for the running scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe second opening was a very fun song especially the last 30 seconds. Overall the music suited the series and was designed to get the viewer hyped up for major scenes, worried during dramatic scenes, and focused during training scenes. The sound could have been better yes, there wasn\u2019t any part of the OST I would listen to outside of watching the show, but for a sports anime this is good enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I thought the characters were just Haikyuu clones, with Kageyama as the main character, but I was totally wrong. The character development between the team started pretty slow however it was the right pace for a 24 episode show. The characters were funny, charming, interesting, well written, and extremely real, despite the very large cast by the end of the show you will know them all by name and know them as people. Although some of the characters did not get any real development until the very last episode outside of a few small scenes through the show, their final performance added up to so much more. \\n\\n\r\nWe had a character quit his addiction to smoking and got to watch it slowly build up in the background until he could run, we got an otaku who couldn\u2019t even jog run a marathon over time, we even a pair of twins each with very distinct personalities coming to terms with each other\u2019s talents and how they should chase separate goals. This was easily the best part of the series, the characters were absolutely amazing, they had good chemistry, great inside jokes, and they even managed to bring an African character in and not have him be 1 dimensional fast runner because he is from Africa. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also has a very strong MC who grew from a cold expressionless results-oriented person to someone who cared more about his team than his own performance. Overall the characters were simply the best part of the series and even if you don\u2019t like sports anime, I would recommend watching this just for their growth in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nBeing straight here, I never thought a show about running could be this exciting. I really enjoyed this series, it\u2019s so far, the best sports anime I seen in the last year, and one of the strongest I ever seen. The characters, the drama, the growth, struggles, the successes, all of it resonates with me and anyone else who has ever attempted pursuing any competitive goal before. This is a much watch if you seen any other Production IG sports anime and wanted more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI give this show an 8, it was really hard deciding whether or not to give this show an 8 or 9 since it was very close, however I will give it an 8 for 2 reasons. One because although the main characters were great, the ending did not tie up all the loose ends for their development, I really wanted to know what happened to some of them given that one had injuries, one had a thing for a girl in the cast, and one that was graduating soon.I also wanted to know more about the future of their running club however that was left unclear and open ended. \\n\\n\r\nThe second reason why I did not give this show a 9 was because the show required a bit much on unrealistic drama, for example a member is sick before the last race, another gets injured before the race, Kakeru\u2019s argument with his rival also seemed really stupid and I can\u2019t imagine anyone being angry for so long over something like that. But overall everything else was very good and this was one of my favorite recent shows, I still highly recommend it, and its definitely a high 8.\\n",

            "content": "Anyone who has ever run knows that it sucks. Why waterboarding is a thing when treadmills exist is a complete mystery to me. I guess even the KGB had its limit on how fucked up their torture methods were. Anyhoo, Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru --  Run with the Wind -- is a story about people who are literally the epitome of masochism and, as weird as it may sound, actually enjoy running. I was expecting a psychological series going in depth with this pain = pleasure thing, but turns out our series relies on fujobaiting instead.\r\nIt should be warned already on the title pagethat every factor from story progression, seiyuu choices, male casting and slice of life-like approach yells out one thing loud and clear: homo undertones. While great many sports series have chosen this approach (Haikyuu, Kuroko, Wind Up, Free -- just to name a few), Kaze ga has very little charm outside its naked ecchi boys / manservice factors. Just to specify to what extent this exist and why it is a problem: there are 4 scenes of our young boys being naked already shown in the first episode before we even know their names. I don't mind male ecchi or bros bathing together washing each others dicks when it is manly and #no_homo, but when it becomes the first thing that stands out in a sports series that was told be filled with drama and comedy, and executed with cute boys who don't, in any way, act like genuine humans, we are off to a terrible start.\\n\\n\r\nThe selling point of sports series tends to be their cast for their stories can never truly work if the person(s) going thru the story are not worth of being followed. Kaze ga's cast and approach I'd like to describe with a short meme: y Tho? Our \"club\" of 10 boys are, outside few expectations, the exact same people. They have nearly invisible personalities, all they have are things that are common between all of them for there aren't such things that would separate them from each others -- outside their outlooks. And even this isn't entirely true since there are even twins among them. As a whole, the cast is fake and empty to a point that I wonder if this is what feminists see when watching CGDCT or ecchi anime. The cast doesn't have much appeal to me. I couldn't find any way to care about any of them. They have nothing that would make relate to them, they offer no entertaining personality traits, their behavior is dull and mainly reminds me of cardboard. None of them have any interesting past stories or current stories. None of them even says anything mildly interesting at any point during the run. The more they talked the more I came to go meh over them. How awfully boring must ones life be to hang out with any of them? A question I found myself asking several times.\\n\\n\r\nOutside episode 16, the sports side is an absolute joke. Even tho I don't like running myself, I have seen series that focus on running and track&field and which I have liked. Kaze ga's take on this torture method is exactly as dull as the sports itself. Nothing stands out, nothing feels meaningful, there aren't even any fitting/atmospheric or agro songs used that could make these scenes better. Instead, same few songs are repeated over and over and none of them is very fitting. So often, there plays some supposedly emotional song whilst our cast members run and sweat, followed, for example, by a scene where they get scolded for being too slow. What the series is trying to deliver here never reached my end. And typically, these running scenes are very short and made in the exact same manner, only thing that differs is the aftermath. Watching the execution here feels like repeatedly hitting ones head in the wall with a force so light that you barely even feel the effect, but still know it is happening. There are even sports series centering around baseball and fighting sports which field work (AKA running) is more noteworthy than anything Kaze ga achieved. The best characters here are these one-dimensional 'evil' buttholes who just come around to mock our sports team for being a disgrace towards track'n field. Why? Because their phrases are truthful remarks. Especially towards the end, the melodrama Kaze ga mixes together with sports is nothing less than a disgrace towards all athletes.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of actual story, one of the driving motions here are our boys interest to girls.. Literally \"lets run for the are girls.. on the other side of the road.\" I am not sure who the writer is trying to fool with this since they only introduce one slightly relevant female cast member and she is more obviously filler than any other character. Also, she falls under the trope \"every food she prepares turns poison\" because apparently it is funny when women can't cook. She is totally adorable regardless. Yet it feels so unnecessary to insert such things here yet not deal with them accordingly. The outcome is just idiotic. The events itself are rather formulaic. Male x male interactions in fujobait manner, bathing together naked, and running. Some pseudo-psychological things going on since, apparently, running (for our mc) is the same as running away from problems, and the main dude seems to have some. Even so, there is no clear reason for the series to exist, story-wise. It's clear from early on that the mc's \"insecurities\" are just bullshit used as an excuse to work as some sort of ongoing cliffhanger to make people interested in what type of \"mysterious\" reasons he has for being such an angsty loner. Other sides of the \"drama\" are practically sitcom-tier since the cast acts like a bunch of drama queens instead of there being any \"real\" drama going on. Sometimes randomly asspulled and beyond fake event occurs, such as one character suddenly losing a consciousness at the end of an episode just to create a cliffhanger worth of 3 pennies. To talk more about these cliffhangers, they are used to some extent and every time they match the definition of \"horse shit\". False tension and not much more. \\n\\n\r\nThe production, outside the incredibly bland character models (their bodies look like spaghetti and have even weirder necks than people in Ballroom e (not exaggerating -- same studio, also) -- and worth-of-nothing sports scenes, is one more thing that is not making this thing any better. The naked men bathing -scenes seem to be the ones that have gone thru the most planning. Comedy moments are over-simplified to a point that it looks just cheap and it is practically the exact same execution every single time. Dude's doing 2 frame shaking when being cornered. Otherwise the series screams it is made by Production I.G with their modern standards (which have been going down and down rather consistently for years if someone hasn't noticed). The pacing is simply too slow during any part that is not related to running and too fast with anything that is. Obviously, because they wanted to save money when animating running masses. CGI is being used during track events and it's like 3fps when out zoomed. Often, people who run look like they are floating over the track rather than touching the ground with their feet. Looks so incredibly lame. Not that it couldn't be forgiven if there were some actually good things going on. Pros that out weighted the cons. To me, even the smallest of problems stood out for I couldn't achieve any level of immersion with the series, rather saw it as nothing but a soulless product.\\n\\n\r\nAll the criticism aside, I did quite enjoy moments around Akane \"Prince\" Kashiwazaki, who is the polar opposite of everyone else. Seems to hate running and is in really bad shape. His running form is so awkward and wrong that I managed to laugh at it few times, mainly reminding me of zombie movements from Resident Evil games. Even his posture while standing is advanced scoliosis, so I guess kudos for creating a dude like him. Other thing I have to drop here is the ending of episode 19 which was simply hilarious. If only there had been other good things I could praise than the rare few.",

            "content": "Are you exhausted of seeing sports anime set in a generic high school setting and want something different ? Are you a college student like me who wants a sports anime they can relate to ? If any of those describes you then I welcome you to the world of Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteru. As an athlete in college, this show has given me the motivation and strength to practice hard everyday and not slack off. Why is that you ask? Well here are the reasons why. \r\nStory : 9/10\r\nThe story like most people would say is pretty standard but what differs it from therest would be the charisma and passion exhibited from the main character. 11 episodes in, the story in general is the main character is passionate and dedicated to join an event but since it requires 10 members, he cunningly recruits 10 students by giving them a place to stay while offering them luxurious food . Each episode is amazingly well paced and shows how each character develops. By the time each episode ends, I am already looking forward to see how the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat i love about this anime is the fact that there is at least one character that anyone can relate to. Each character has their own quirky personality as well as their own personal issues to deal with. With each episode we get to know each character more personally, and empathize with their struggles in life. It teaches me that everyone is different in their own way and we should not judge a book by it's cover. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is the best part about the anime. Out of all the winter anime, this is one of the two OPS and EDS I cant skip apart from bunny girl senpai. The OP is played by one of my favourite bands, Unison Square Garden who has played other amazing songs like kekkai sensen ED and ballroom e youkoso OP. When the OP comes on, I immediately have a burst of motivation to run as much as possible till i am satisfied. On the other hand, the ED gives you a sense of nostalgia as you appreciate what youth is all about and makes me want to enjoy the most out of my youth. I can easily say that the ED is the best of 2018.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle reminds me so much of Haikyuu and it is not an over exaggeration when i say one of the characters is the literal copy of Tobio Kageyama. If you are a fan of Haikyuu, i would recommend watching this anime. The artstyle is highly realistic and makes me feel like I am a part of their world. The characters expressions and emotions are well shown and I can feel each character's motives and passion flowing out of the screen.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nEach episode is equally enjoyable and not even a second have I feel bored with the anime. Each episode I go through a roller coaster of emotions ranging from laughter to sadness all the way to anger. Even though it has a simplistic storyline, due to the team having 10 different personalities, it makes it fun to watch how each of them interact with one another and helping each other out while dealing with their personal problems. It is so good that I had to write a review to make sure people are not deprived of such an amazing anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI am only halfway through the show, but I can tell that this anime will be one for the history books as one of the best sports anime. Before that happens, watch the first 11 episodes and be amazed by how amazingly beautiful and motivational this show can get. It is not meant for a specific audience and anyone at any age can enjoy it equally. Don't let this masterpiece be left out as a hidden gem. Upvote this and spread the message.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The opening is chill and all good but nothing outstanding. \r\nED: The ending is pretty neat, the beat is really relaxing.\r\nOST: (the god) Yuuki Hayashi composed the soundtrack,so obviously it's gonna be amazing. With such inspiring, hype and beautiful OST every scene becomes better, making all replicas sounds significantly better. This is why I think a good soundtrack is really important, especially in sports animes like this which is more character-based than action-based. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8): The art and animation is fairly good.\\n\r\n*Fun-fact:  The Chief Animation Director is the same as that of Haikyuu and Ballroom e Youkoso, which is why the art style is so similar in these three animes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8): Although the story is pretty simplistic, the characters and sound easily outweigh this, making watching the anime a really enjoyable time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8): I'd definitely recommend this anime to anyone who likes to watch sport animes, but also to everyone in general because the combination of unique and interesting characters and a solid soundtrack make watching the anime a delight.",

Those answers are there.\r\nThis show is ensemble cast by various characters. Basically, Kakeru Kurahara and Haiji Kiyose are protagonists. No problem if you focus them.\r\nAt first, each characters development are completely well done. This is high point. Every characters are unique, attractive, likable. And cool.\r\nEspecially Haiji is my favorite character in this show. I love his looking and personality so much. He ispositive and cheerful.\\n\r\nOuji's bravery also wonderful. At the beginning, he is drained though, he grows gradually. This is the same goes for other teammate.\\n\r\nWhile almost characters have all sorts of situation, they's trying their very best. Sometimes enjoyable. Sometimes strictly. Part of the family.\\n\r\nOne more thing is this show has many good-looking guys because this show is sports genre. In other words, almost guys. Nevertheless, please don't avoid. It's a waste.\\n\r\nHanako Katsuta. She is manager who give grace to teammate. Her turn is less though, Her cuteness burst pivotal points. Joji and Jota brothers fall in love her!\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Kazuma Fujioka. He is Haiji's friend. Although his turn is less the same as Hanako, really manly and good person. He has presence and charisma.\\n\r\nArt and Animation are stunning and beautiful. Running animation is depicting finely. It has always sense of urgency. Background also wonderful.\\n\r\nMusic also very nice. OP songs of both cour are amazingly cool. ED songs are calm and quiet. In addition, voice acting is great. Satisfactory.\\n\r\nAs constitution of main story. Practice, Preliminary round, Actual play's repetitive. Seems repetition of the same thing, but the truth is different.\\n\r\nDrama, Conflict, Growth among them are include. Kakeru has most complex in the team. He is suffering from cruel past and unbearable current.\\n\r\nSometimes he let his feelings out. However, Haiji helps him. Because of he is very thoughtful of Kakeru more than anyone.\\n\r\nHaiji is leader of everyone. At the same time, he is companion with others equally. Since Haiji is thinking everyone like family, he lead the team.\\n\r\nHe hates lying against himself and people, and it has an effect in his past. Nevertheless, he don't look back. He just move forward. It is his motto.\\n\r\nOtherwise, life itself feels boring. He is thinking it. I've ever also did experience similar to life. I thought I don't want to regret.\\n\r\nResults aren't very fine though, I achieve sense of accomplishment. I agree with Kakeru and Haiji's way of life.\\n\r\nAlthough the same goes for every field, if you give up once, become unable to understand yourself's reason of being. How do you solve?\\n\r\nThis show is depicting things like them delicately. Is throwing away the dream your long-cherished ambition? Or while you see eternity, do you aim for your true dream?\\n\r\nOnly you isn't lead role. Speaking objectively, I can say that you should broaden yours horizons. Rewarding for the sake of the future.\\n\r\nIn short, no matter what you are to be discouraged...KEEP RUNNING!\\n\\n\r\nAs noted above, there are many characters in this show. So face and name don't match. Their case is many. Well, it can't be helped honestly.\\n\r\nIntroduction looks like repetitive over and over again. It may be get tired depending on the person. Pacing is improve from 2-cour. Endure until there.\\n\r\nI disagree with Kousuke Sakaki's behavior entirely. A lot of emotion theory. Or just bear a grudge. He isn't suitable as Kakeru's rival.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is hidden gem, and at the same time, make us think about philosophy of life. How it looks your present self? Is there something you want to do?\\n\r\nI got various inspiration from this show. Intense, Joyful, moved. More than anything, this show is very interesting. Close to masterpiece.\\n\r\nThat's a shame to buried. If you're interested in this show, worth watching. Really underrated.",

            "content": "There are various aspects which have to be considered and come into play if we are talking about how a good anime should generally be like. That said, values and priorities in regards to a story and technical features may differ dependent on whom you ask. Well thought out plot, compelling characters or perhaps a focus on visual storytelling-you name it, all of us have preferences whose omnipresence ultimatively dictates our viewing habits and the enjoyment we receive out of something. There's still one attribute I view  as vital in order to appeal to the audience, namely heart and even more so when itcomes to the sports anime. Kaze ga Tsuyuko Fuiteiru essentially embodies the spirit which made me such a big fan of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also a show that exceeded preexisting expectations. Expectations mainly based on a single name.  Brought to us by Production I.G a studio renowned for their outstanding record regarding anime that revolve around physical activities. Ok not quite tbh, but if we take a look at some big hit's from this decade like Kuroko no Basket, Diamond no Ace, Haikyuu, Ballroom e Youkoso then it shouldn't really surprise that I.G has earned a certain reputation in this field and everyone familiar with their sports adaptations of this decade might fully agree.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Kakeru and Haiji who met by chance. One is an ex competive runner and a prodigy, the other a guy desperate enough to trick his dormmates with the objective of letting Kansei University enter the  Hakone Ekiden. Sounds like a solid premise for this genre. Although there's a notable difference in direct comparison with the title I mentioned above.  The show's in question used a narrative that rather focussed on the sport and elemental technicalities, Kaze ga Tsuyuko Fuiteiru on the other hand went more for a character and drama oriented approach. Running in a club served more or less as a catalyst to induce conflicts, trials and self-exploration on the steep road to reach the \"top\". Then there's the fact that it's setted in university. Good, that doesn't  sound like a major change up at first , but it allowed to showcase harsh circumstances accompanied by sacrifices which can only occur if you're in one of the busiest stages of your life. Moreover, I thoroughly enjoyed the cosy ambience of a lively dorm and the seemingly deeper bond of the cast, similar to that of a family. Especially the first episodes capitalized on  that aspect and  it was easy to get warm with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of them, the easiest way to sum up the lot without spoiling much would be to describe them as a diverse bunch or if I take this a bit further maybe even as a group that consists of people whose personalities almost couldn't contrast more.  While this made up for engaging character dynamics it was at the same time also the ideal breeding ground for several disputes which put the common goal at risk. There were times where it was hard for some viewers not to get aggravated by some actions or attitudes that were displayed. This doesn't sound very appealing, but rest assured.  After a bit of patience you will get rewarded with amazing individual as well as collective development emotionally striking enough to wash away all unpleasant memories. However, conflicts weren't limited to be solely of external nature, each Kansei member had his own struggles to deal with and the show dedicated a decent amount of screen time on depicting those in a tangible manner. At this point I might fairly add that time spent on fleshing out characters wasn't alloted equally and this could've evoked the impression that some of them were lacking significant growth. Thankfully,  this most definitely wasn't  the case. The final batch of episodes in particular took care of that task. They presented a gratifying conclusion to each individual journey. The boys reflected on their past and the last months devoted to running . This ultimatively enabled them to become aware of  how running, an activity most of them were initially indifferent about brought a change to their lifes. These moments truly hit close to home as they were able to convey a wide array of emotions along with a level of relatableness that surpassed everything I had expected. All this made the already enjoyable ride more than just worthwhile. \\n\\n\r\nWhat struck me most besides the raw emotional impact I experienced while watching characters I've gotten fond of fight against the competiton and themselves was the technical finesse put to display. The running segments were beautifully composed, ranging from expressions of the runner, spectator reactions, inner monologue, animation and OST, everything was in tune.  Regarding the overall animation and art quality, well it was mostly conistent throughout the entire course of the show. Some CGI here, some minor inconsistencies when it comes to the faces ther, but nothing that warranted major criticism in that area or took me out of the experience. It fulfilled the standards you would expect of I.G.\\n\r\nOutstanding in that department was how realistic the running motions looked  and the effective use of imagery. The director did extremely well there and this became already apparent during the first episode. The first encounter of Kakeru and Haiji was without a doubt one of the strongest opening scenes I've ever scene and immediately captivated me.\\n\\n\r\nComing to the music department and I'm going to make this short. Fantastic! It always fitted to the scene, enhanced the mood and correspondingly the enjoyment by a large margin. The theme songs, especially the first ones, Catch up , latency and Reset were exceptionally good.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto something, many, especially those who care about accurate depiction and realism when it comes  to technical aspects would most likely take an issue with. Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru didn't put much emphasis on elaborating details of running nor did it provide a logical explanation how admittedly more or less fit novices were able to perform so well on a high level. Team Kansei surely put lots of effort into their training, but others must have done so as well. Potential viewers gotta ask themselves whether they can stomach a dose of idealism or not. Personally, I didn't have much trouble to overcome my disbelief  due to plenty of other merits. Foremost, the sheer endless energy the whole story and characters emitted. Then also the fact that an anime about a solo sports had some of the best team chemistry is nothing short of praiseworthy.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I'm gonna talk about my personal enjoyment. Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru was by far the most entertaining show I've seen from the last year and it turned out to be way more than I could've hoped for. I was totally invested in the characters, I laughed, I felt joy or cried with them. I even started to integrate running in my workout routine again.  On top of that it managed to recreate the exact feelings of the times when I've seen my first sports and I hope everyone who's going to check this marvellous work will experience a similar sensation.\\n\\n\r\nI gave it an overall rating of 9 due to the set rating system for reviews, but  in my heart it gets without a doubt a full score.",

            "content": "*Insert Stupid Quote\" Reviews nowadays are either filled with people having unpopular opinions and people liking them a lot, or some guy who writes an entire essay on why the show is a \"masterpiece.\" Personally, I try and watch for enjoyment instead of picking apart every little thing within an anime. Anime, in my opinion should be watched with enjoyment rather than be slammed down by little tiny flaws that lowers the overall \"score.\"\r\nNow I am going to tell you why I enjoyed this anime, instead of breaking down every detail. \r\nI must admit, the synopsis is bad. However, if the synopsis is holding youback from watching this anime, fear not. I feel as if they included some of the most irrelevant information possible. If you are even considering watching this anime, I hope that I give you the push to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime sort of follows a very \"sports\" arc where they train and hope to go to nationals. However, when watching the anime you find that instead of focusing on the \"sports\" aspect, you are more focused on the characters. That is what set it apart from any regular anime. I love each of the 10 main characters and their personalities make it easy to like them. They all are struggling with something in their life within the sport and outside. Although they don't like to show the weak side of them, each of them makes a commitment to change, especially our main character, Kakeru. When characters grow in anime, I think that has to be the most satisfying thing ever. Even though the anime After the Rain and Violet Evergarden have nothing to do with \"sports\" I still felt similar vibes from them.  \\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime tells you about who they are as individuals, seeing them succeed makes me happy/satisfied. Seeing things not go as smoothly as I thought was a nice change of pace. Within a race, anything can happen and if you aren't feeling 100% it won't change the fact that you are going to do the race still.\\n\\n\r\nIf you aren't sold at this point, this anime was developed by Production I.G. I am sure that you have watched other anime that have been made by them such as Attack on Titan, Kuroko no Basket and especially Haikyuu!! So why not watch this one as well? On top of that, this anime went from around a 7.4* rating from week one to 8.24* rating. \\n\\n\r\nThis is for the people who want individual marks on the aspects of things. \\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nArt - 9.5\\n\r\nNever gets in the way of things which is all I really care about. *It was beautiful*\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9 \\n\r\nOpening 1 was amazing and Opening 2 was forgettable. Either way, it enhanced my experience rather than ruining it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10 \\n\r\nAll of the characters I loved :)\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\r\nLoved each of the backgrounds and what they had to do in order to overcome obstacles within their live. Finally, something about college stuff instead of high school. Lets go!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nBasically the only thing that matters. The only reason this wasn't a 10 is because at times I felt the ending of an episode was a little bit lackluster. \\n\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nTo everyone. At least give this anime a try as I think it won't hurt. What is also kind of weird is that the main character looks a little like Kageyama from Haikyuu!! I also liked the little bit of comedy in there as well, made it an added bonus. The drama is also totally justifiable instead of just starting random fights with no reason behind it. Although I tend to find my opinions unpopular, I decided to write this review because I just like writing about things that I enjoy. I hope that you can at least give this anime a chance and feel free to let me know your opinions about this anime as well. \\n\\n\r\n*P.S*\\n\r\nIf you are a runner, I feel as if this is a must watch. Without spoiling too much, we find out early on that Haiji, one of the main characters is injured and goes through a phase in his life where he is completely unmotivated.  Any sports anime that has a character that I can relate to is always nice since I can feel as if I am not alone in the situation that I am in. Personally, since I have flat feet which can lead to a lot of problems, you always have to find a way to overcome and adapt. Prince is also relatable since we all used to be slow runners :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "I never really enjoyed any sports anime ever before watching this anime. The reason I never liked any sports show was simple, you see all any sports anime ever did was just putting so much effort on the sports itself that they forget to develop the characters who are the essential part of the anime(looking at Haikyuu, yuri on ice and free).\r\nI was really shocked to see a anime about running that does not show any character running until ep 5 or 6, I mean how sports anime do that these days. Rather then making us show the characters running from the start it takesthat time to develop the characters itself, because what good a shallow character is to the show. And mind you this anime has a lot of characters that need ample to develop and shine in limited amount of time, but damn not a single minute of any ep is wasted and its pure story-telling and good characters dynamics.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I had anything to complain about this anime but this anime does not let me do that because its that good, I really like how Haiji interacts with with other characters and how genuine he is. Also how kakeru goes from being a antisocial to just being friendly with everyone, its just  heartwarming. And akane is my soul animal, really he is so relatable and puts so much effort to come out of his comfort zone for something that only benefits other the most.\\n\\n\r\nThis is how a sports anime should be done and every other sports anime should take notes from this. If you want to know what a really good sports anime looks like then you need to watch anime.",

            "content": "Fall 2018 has been a pretty good season, some might even say it's great. Among all of the shows I've seen so far, Kaze ga has got to be one of my favorites. And I'm surprised at how underrated this show is right now, considering how enjoyable and good it is. I haven't watched a lot of sports shows AND I'm only writing this after watching 6 eps (I'll probably update this when I have more things to say), so of course take my opinion with a grain of salt.\r\nFirst, probably the weakest aspect of the show so far: the story. Now, I don't wantyou to think that the story is trash or anything like that. It's actually pretty good. The thing is that we're only getting started and taking things slowly, which is certainly not a bad decision since this show is gonna run (heh) for 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the art and animation, I gotta say that this is one of the better looking shows of the season. The art style is very similar to another show adapted by Production I.G.: Haikyuu!!, but what really stands out to me is some of the shots and little scenes, like at the end of episode 1 and one of the scenes with Kurahara in episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"sound\" aspect is also pretty good, the OST fits nicely with the tone of the shows and the scenes and it's generally very pretty and calm. The OP by Unison Square Garden is one of the best (in my opinion of course) of the season, with some nice visuals too. The ED is also really good, with it's nice, catchy electronic/modern vibe.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, probably my favorite aspect of the show: the characters. Usually if you're not going to have a super flashy or original story, then I'm hoping you're going to show some good characters. It's hard to describe what exactly makes these characters so good, but one of my favorite things is how they interact with each other, especially Haiji with the rest of the members. Their personalities are also pretty distinct and good, matching some of their designs and shit. Plus, it's refreshing to see a sports story with characters that are on college and not on high-school.\\n\\n\r\nThanks to the characters, the show is very enjoyable and actually doesn't have a lot of dull or boring moments. I had a good time watching them practicing or doing every day stuff. The animation and OST also help to make some of the scenes more enjoyable and interesting. I could see the lack of really important events turning off some people though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kaze ga is one of the better shows of the season so far, thanks to it's large cast of characters and good technical aspects. While there's not a lot of exciting running stuff happening, the story is building up and could end up being really good. If you haven't watched this show, please give it a chance because it's one of the most underrated shows in the season and deserves some attention.",

            "content": "\"Haiji... this isn\u2019t just your dream anymore... it\u2019s our dream. \r\nIt\u2019s a nice dream. So nice, I never want to wake up.\"\r\nI too would never like to wake up from the dream that has been Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, or Run with the wind. This is an anime that has touched my heart more than any other work of art I have ever experienced in my twenty years of life. I'm writing this review immediately after viewing the final episode, and I am truly grateful for this series.\r\nThe underlying theme of this series concerns youth. In college, we are pulled in so many directions, andhave to focus on our futures and our careers more than ever. This series has taught me that these are the years of my life that I cannot allow to slip by. I must take full advantage of my youth, and live it to the fullest alongside my friends and my family. I believe that any college student, or soon to be college student, can learn much from this series and these brilliant characters, and I sincerely hope that my words will reach at least one person in this world.\\n\r\nI was a runner in high school, I loved it and I hated it. I love to run, but I don't love to race. I quit after two years, and didn't run once my entire senior year of high school, and freshman year of college. This series reintroduced me to the joy of running. Since episode 1 aired last October, I run almost every morning with the show's beautiful OST on repeat.\\n\r\nI vehemently recommend this series, and rate it 10/10; a masterpiece.\\n\r\nThe Merriam- Webster dictionary defines a masterpiece as \"a work done with extraordinary skill\\n\r\nespecially : a supreme intellectual or artistic achievement.\u201d\\n\r\nI cannot express enough with words how truly this defines Run with the Wind, a series that showed me in just 23 episodes the most interesting and inspiring character development I have ever come into contact with.\\n\r\nI laughed, I cried, and after 23 episodes I feel that this series will stay with me as long as I live. When watching a weekly series, I always wait to let it stack, so that I am able to binge and more easily digest a show, but never could I do this for Run with the Wind. Never once could I wait even a second to watch the show that moves me more and more with each episode. The three week hiatus in the middle was so frustrating that when the series returned I cried uncontrollably, to my family's dismay and amusement.\\n\r\n\"I finally understand. Whether I run or I don\u2019t, it hurts just the same. Even if I fail, I want to do what my heart desires here.\"\\n\r\nHaiji, Kakeru, and the rest of the team feel like truly important people in my life, and amazingly I am able to deeply relate to all 10 of them. I think that any runner, that any college student, that any youth can relate to these masterfully written characters, and experience their triumphs and their misfortunes as one's own. Never have I enjoyed a cast of characters so much, and learned at least one valuable lesson from 10 individual characters in a work. Prince and Haiji will forever inspire me!\\n\\n\r\n\"This world is too beautiful.\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s okay.\\n\r\nMy love hasn\u2019t changed. Never has. Never will.\\n\r\nI like running.\\n\r\nI love it.\"\\n\r\nI like Run with the Wind, I love it, and I think both socially and philosophically it is one of the most important artworks of our generation. \\n\r\nDon't waste another second of your youth, get out there with your friends and strive for something greater than yourself. Never doubt yourself, and never act like someone you're not. These phrases are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the vital life lessons to be learned from Run with the Wind, but don't take my word for it. I insist that you view this series for yourself, and maybe, just maybe, you'll have the same beautiful experience as myself. \\n\r\nWhat is strength? What is running? What is living? Watch Run with the Wind and find out.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: I forgot to mention the two EDs are my ranked two favorite EDs of all time! So great to fall asleep to :)",

            "content": "I'm not gonna lie to you guys okay? The ending was a bit rushed. Like, they could've pumped it to 25 episodes instead of 23. But maybe I'm only saying that because THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ANIME I'VE EVER SEEN, AND I WANT MORE OF IT.\r\nOkay, where do I start? The soundtrack is absolutely amazing. Not just the openings and endings, but the background tracks are so, immensely good at setting the mood for this anime. The art is GORGEOUS. It's hard to explain what exactly I love about this art style, but I'm hoping to find something similar to it in thefuture.\\n\\n\r\nBut, that stuff's boring. Let's get into the good stuff. The story was... wow. It's such a simple premise, but wealth of meaning and inspiration found in it is remarkable. I will say that I would've loved to see a bit more character development for these boys beyond running, but all in all, the main story was very well paced, and it had such an impact. The story itself made me feel connected to it because of how well it was written. It sucked me in every episode. \\n\\n\r\nI'll tell you what, though: the characters are what's gonna hook you on this anime. Specifically their relationships with one another. I think there's something really powerful in the way that this anime has presented strong friendships between these guys. I loved seeing how different characters supported each other or how they changed over time. It felt like a camaraderie that's rare to find among people. These characters are funny, their complex, they cry, they laugh; they're everything they should be and more. They're special, and that made the anime special.\\n\\n\r\nI really cannot recommend this anime enough. It's something that I think a lot of people are going to come away from different than when they went in. It's very touching and inspiring story, and I'm really glad I took the chance to watch it. Excuse me while I go cry because it's over.",

Also, watching Kurahara gain confidence, take charge, and make friends was heartwarming to say the least. At the end of the currently aired 10 episodes i found myself wanting more and craving more as i did when catching up with other shows this season. even more so which surprised me because it doesn't seem to have the large critical backing that i would expect from a show of this quality. speaking of quality, the music is amazing and the only problem i have with the animation is the use of CG during the running sequences (but i have never been a fan of CG in any anime). Im excited to see what the rest of this show has to offer. I highly recommend this show to anybody who is looking to watch a show about college boys bonding and having fun.. oh, and also running... :)",

            "content": "Watching Welcome to the Ballroom throughout it\u2019s six month long two cour run was one of the most disheartening experiences I\u2019ve yet to endure in all of my years. I watched as the industry titan Production I.G. themselves, those who\u2019ve defined high-quality TV animation with the sports shows Kuroko no Basket and especially Haikyuu!, as they aired a similarly structured sports anime that panned over still frames and used basically constructed CG character models for background athletes like you\u2019d expect from any other garbage studio. No matter how attractive and sharp the male designs were and no matter how shapely and sexy the female designswere, no matter how lively the color palette popped and setting design shined, no matter how elegant the soundtrack nor how powerful the dialogue, the show simply could not inspire, grip, or elate it\u2019s audience in the same fashion it\u2019s predecessors could for the stain that was it\u2019s poor quality of animation. Call me a wishful thinker, but they\u2019re back. Production I.G. is back in a big way with Run with the Wind.\\n\\n\r\nRun with the Wind boasts such a splendidly lavish animation production which reminds you just how impressive this studio is at it\u2019s best of times. The character designs are as clean, sharp, and attractive as those of Haikyuu and Welcome to the Ballroom, and they\u2019re animated with a level of ornate detail which was incessantly impressive. The character designs of the main cast, as well as the voice actors chosen to play them, clearly had a lot of thinking behind them for you can see exactly why they dress the way they dress, why they walk the way they walk, why they accessorize they way they accessorize, and any other aspects of personality appearance you\u2019d expect to notice on human beings in real life, and as you learn more about them as the show progresses you\u2019ll slowly start noticing more and more of those little details that had been there the entire time. It\u2019s amazing, and with the animation production and art design put aside, I\u2019m just going to say it, Run with the Wind has hand-drawn backgrounds with Kyoto Animation\u2019s level of detail, color design, researched setting references, perfect balance of finesse and flair, naturalistic beauty yet realistic subtlety, and general quality. I would go back through the episodes and take screenshots of the gorgeous backgrounds to add to my desktop\u2019s background reel, because I felt it would be legitimately wasteful to let such beautiful pieces of artwork go unappreciated. On top of the impeccable visuals, the sound design and music stand just as tall and proud. The sound design is so detailed, nuanced, and ever-present, that when I notice it I become so absorbed and distracted as to miss entire lines of dialogue and have to rewind. The soundtrack is an easy nine out of ten, and I can say that without hesitation. The composer did the monumentally epic and blood pumping OST for Haikyuu, the emotionally gripping and stylized Studio Trigger OST for Kiznaiver, and the OST for Death Parade which reached the heights of both contemplative character pieces and exciting psychological thriller pieces. I simply cannot praise the production of Run with the Wind any more without it coming across as hyperbole. It\u2019s truly amazing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the narrative and writing itself, while not being as breathtakingly perfect as the production, is still pretty damn good in it\u2019s own right. The main cast of characters is one of the most realistic ensembles in all of anime, easily competing with shows like Durarara, Hajjime no Ippo, and Assassination Classroom who\u2019re known for their enormous yet somehow well developed ensemble casts. Not to put them down, for those examples are all quite good shows, but unlike those shows Run with the Wind manages to mete out character development in a realistic, grounded, subtle, and emotionally resonant manner. At no point in the show is there anything that could be described as an \u201carc.\u201d Never does the narrative take a break for drama, nor does it ever feel like one character in particular is being too overbearing or stealing the spotlight. The story sets itself up and goes, with any necessary character development or exploration sneaking it\u2019s way into the narrative naturally and in a very down to earth fashion. This sensible pacing also works wonders for the dramatic conflict in the story because you can really see the build up to all the happenings. Nothing ever comes out of nowhere and is usually spawned from within the main character, Kakeru, who you know well enough to both sympathize and empathize with. One thing I could very well see people having a problem with is the straight-man who brings all the character conflict to the table\u2026is Kakeru himself. I certainly didn\u2019t have a problem with it because, again, his motivations are so well written and deep-seated within his character that I totally get where he\u2019s coming from, but for someone who doesn\u2019t get it, I can see how the main character being the vehicle for ALL the conflict in the show could annoy some people, so fair warning. I mean, it\u2019s not just Kakeru, really. All the characters have insecurities and hangups which are so real and feel truly genuine. Most anime will have characters ranting and raving about a bunch of out-of-this-world garbage the viewer has no reason to care about, but Run with the Wind does nothing of the sort. The character Nico-chan (a play on the word \u201cnicotine\u201d) has difficulty running for his addiction to smoking and his unhealthy BMI. The character King has trouble being committed to the team because he has to find work to pay for college. The character Shindo has doubts about his involvement with the team because his girlfriend dumped him after feeling he had neglected her. All the characters are real, with real scripts, with real problems. It\u2019s a seriously wonderful cast that brings the relatively straightforward story to life, and there were a number of times I had tears in my eyes watching them cross the finish line.\\n\\n\r\nThe final point I wanted to discuss before concluding is the villains. Sports anime, simply put, NEVER have committed villains. Seriously, just take a second and think about it. It\u2019s ALL mutually understood competition wherein the opponents are never genuinely malicious and are only causing conflict for the sake of sportsmanship. The only time truly antagonist villains appear in sports anime is like Jabberwock from Kuroko no Basket, or Bryan Hawk from Hajime no Ippo, or the Blue Mars from One Outs, or any other two dimensional evil-for-the-sake-of-evil villains out there. Out of all the three thousand plus anime I\u2019ve seen, I\u2019ve yet to see a wholesale ill natured antagonists who truly wants to beat the protagonists solely out of hatred. Sakaki, the main villain in Run with the Wind, is the first character I\u2019ve seen in a sports anime who truly earned the title of \u201cvillain.\u201d His history with Kakeru makes for a heavy motivation for conflict, and his vindictive attitude comes across as being deserved. Again, Kakeru is a realistic flawed character, so the idea he has some skeletons in his closet isn\u2019t all that far fetched. As you learn more about their pasts, and you get both sides of the story, you\u2019re naturally emotionally invested. It\u2019s just another really, really good aspect of the show which I wanted to make a point wasn\u2019t under appreciated at all in my review.\\n\\n\r\nRun with the Wind is a great show I highly recommend for everything I\u2019ve mentioned and more I\u2019ve probably overlooked, but it also has a really resonant psychological core to it, at least for me, and I thought it nice to see such a moving and powerful message portrayed from an otherwise unassuming sports anime. As I\u2019ve said no shortage of times, the main character Kakeru is a really flawed person. He\u2019s impulsive, irritable, and outright violent, and it\u2019s not even anyone\u2019s fault. It\u2019s just who he is, thus he runs. He literally and metaphorically runs away from his problems and is constantly accused of doing so by many characters in the show. As said problems continue to pile up despite his speed, he realizes the problems are within and running simply won\u2019t escape them. When he finally stops and turns around to see all the people he\u2019s hurt along the way, all the mistakes he\u2019s made and regrets he has, and all the people still trying to support him in spite of all this, he really sits down and confronts reality in a poignantly human fashion, and it\u2019s this emotional courage that frees his spirt, so to speak, so he can truly move forward and run with the wind. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Production I.G is back with another excellent drama series that centers around the sport of running. It is highly character-driven and features one of the best group of characters for a sports shonen. Run with the Wind\u2019s main duo each ran away from the sport in the past when their own passion for running was broken by the cruelty of their strict coaches. Running became a burden to them, and a signal of their own inadequacy\u2014Haiji Kiyose through disappointing his father, and Kakeru Kurahara through lashing out at his coach, and thus ensuring his whole team suffered. \r\nWhen your choices are victory or shame, itcan be hard to take pride in your running. For Haiji, learning to find motivation outside of personal glory was forced upon him when he was crippled through injury, ensuring he\u2019d never triumph alone. Instead, he embraced running as a group effort and made his great strength into his ability to connect with and inspire all of his teammates. Though the concept of running a grueling ten-part relay seemed crazy to his reluctant dorm, he took the time to reach out to all of them, and help them find something worth running for while helping them with their personal issues in life. He was selfish and stubborn in the way he went about doing so, but he wouldn\u2019t have done any of it if he didn\u2019t genuinely believe in his team. One thing you can\u2019t take away from Haiji is he is a great motivator, the type you need, and a caring person. He\u2019s helped changed his friend's lives for the better. \\n\\n\r\nThe inspiration to run takes a variety of forms for the characters. Though it\u2019s thrilling as a sports narrative, the story\u2019s main appeal is how well it illustrates the lives and feelings of its runners from the start, and how convincingly it draws them together into a group with both strong individual motivations and mutual trust. Prince finds the courage to run from his manga heroes, while Nico discovers that running brings him mental clarity. Musa and Takashi find friends and a source of pride, while King rediscovers the confidence that perpetual job interviews stole from him. Run with the Wind\u2019s most central character conflict is Kakeru learning to rise above the trauma of the past, and see running not as a burden or source of shame, but an activity that actually brings people together. And as you\u2019d expect, many of the show\u2019s most rewarding moments come not when these characters simply win, but when they learn to better trust each other. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two things Run with the Wind does exceptionally well: its ability to convey the pace and tone of college dorm life, and having the incredible gift for sculpting sympathetic characters and rich, bitter relationships. Each character has their own stories to tell, much of this show\u2019s characterization comes through in its brilliantly observed incidental moments, as Haiji and the rest bicker about classes, divvy up chores, and generally live their college lives. Though I wouldn\u2019t call Run with the Wind a slice of life by no means, it\u2019s able to capture a lived experience and sense of mutual friendship with a grace characteristic of the best of them. With a ten-person team, it\u2019d be easy for half of the cast to get lost in the crowd, but each of them is given plentiful time to express themselves, find their own relationship with running, and ultimately contribute to a greater, loving team. Every member brings something unique and worthwhile to the team, making its insistence that running is a team effort feel utterly convincing. \\n\\n\r\nThere are fantastic character chemistry and dynamics along with great sly, subtle humor but doesn\u2019t rely on them alone. It is also slowly developing its overarching conflict alongside its cast. From the start it is clear that the challenges that await the club are immense, the relay race they intend to participate is an exceedingly competitive affair. But far from the usual framing of these sorts of zero to hero stories, the narrative is much more concerned with the outcomes and beliefs of its cast than the prospect of merely winning. The end goal offers a reason for these people to improve rather than just harping on the importance of victory, and the narrative is much more concerned with presenting their setbacks and growth than anything else. Run with the Wind's portrayal of these characters comes across as naturalistic, humanizing, and occasionally hilarious, the strength of its source material combining with a great adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nProduction I.G did an amazing job all around the board. Run with the Wind\u2019s character designs goes for the realistic body size/proportions but isn\u2019t afraid to bend and flex from that for the sake of expression and interesting visuals. Body language conveys much of the characters\u2019 personalities. Each one has a distinctive design and face, and fluid animation brings out their individual quirks and flaws. The color palette is well balanced that has a very wide range for the various type of moods. Backgrounds are well detailed, stellar scenery and good use of depicting the change of weather for each of the four seasons. The running scenes are animated superbly and mix well with the sound effects and exceptional and well-timed soundtrack. Without background music, the show emphasizes the rhythm of the characters breathing and measured footfalls. Facial expressions, movement of the body, arms, legs, correct body posture and hair swaying back and forth are all down with attention to detail, even the perspiration of the runners. A setback was definitely its usage of CG, which was mainly used for some of the background runners or crowds of people.\\n\\n\r\nVoice actors are perfect matches to their character and lots of credit to them, they absolutely nailed their roles, made conversations feel like the type that any normal person would have with their friends, having the ability to go through a wide range of tones and emotion. They treated the characters with care and brought them to life. Being able to pass off the banter as genuine as these voice actors did only go to show their expertise. The soundtrack is gorgeous, a matter of fact, it\u2019s a masterpiece and definitely a one to own. Once again, the music is all timed-well hitting all the emotional moments on cue, it just invokes a lot of feelings on its own and when you add it alongside the story being told visually, you\u2019re getting poetry in motion on your screen. A mesmerizing mix of synth-pop and orchestra goes to show just how Yuki Hayashi is one of the most promising composers in the industry right now, he\u2019s already amongst the best. The OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s are all excellent with \"Reset\" by Taichi Mukai being a favorite.\\n\\n\r\nIn this show, what is valued is human interaction; connecting with those around you in a deeper, richer level without wanting anything from them. It's about falling in love and re-connecting with something that materialism can't give you. And strangely enough, is about selflessness and community through introspection. Run with the Wind masterfully weaves all these concepts into a beautiful story that touches your heart from the start. Life, like running, is not all about time but about our experiences along the way. Your greatest runs are rarely measured by racing success. They are brief moments in time when running allows you to see how wonderful your life is. You have to drive yourself to overcome the obstacles. You might feel that you can't. But then you find your inner strength and realize you're capable of so much more than you thought. What Run with the Wind has taught me, perhaps more than anything else, that there's no reason to fear starting lines or other new beginnings.",

            "content": "Is it just me or does it seem like we don\u2019t get enough literature anime adaptations these days? Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru (also known as Run With the Wind) is an actual book adaptation and features competitive running as part of its plot. Like most competitive sports, the show delivers storytelling to feature the journey of characters to accomplish their goals. Thankfully, this show delivers a promise that won\u2019t leave you disappointed.\r\nTo check off the bucket list, you should probably ask yourself if you enjoy a story driven by drama with sports elements. Because make no mistake, this anime contains a great deal of realismwhile selling drama at every chance it gets. It will try to evoke emotions out of the viewers and between the storytelling, you\u2019ll experience a story with its insightful character cast.\\n\\n\r\nMeet Kakeru Kurahara, the 1st year former elite runner at Kansei University. The first episode shows his daredevil actions as he is caught stealing. Thankfully, he is saved by 4th year student Haiji Kiyose who has an ambitious dream of competing in the Hakone Ekiden. The Hakone Ekiden is considered an important relay race taking place btween Tokyo and Hakone in Japan. Kakeru seems like a perfect candidate to be on the team. Upon being invited to the Kanse University Dorm, he quickly discovers it\u2019s a place for the Track and Field team. The show sets up for huge amount of story and character development as we quickly realize how weak their team actually is.\\n\\n\r\nNow I\u2019ll say right off the bat that I am a sucker for an underdog story. It has potential to develop characters on many levels. The problem here is that Kakeru isn\u2019t a noob compared to the rest of the team. He already has experience in running but lacks the enthusiasm. This is explained through some very complicated and dark background storytelling. Apparently, an incident from his former Track & Field team caused him to doubt himself. Nonetheless, I believe Kakeru\u2019s personality to be one that people can understand after seeing what he\u2019s been through. This is a sharp contrast to Haiji, who is always enthusiastic about the team and his dream. The main problem is that the team requires a lot of training and commitment to compete at the Hakone Ekiden level. Still, I appreciate the character bond of the team. As the show progresses, Kakeru begins to realize that he\u2019s not running alone and that he has friends to run with. A main selling point about Kakeru\u2019s own journey is how he conquers his personal demon and move beyond his past.\\n\\n\r\nYou better get used to seeing a lot of Kakeru and Haiji\u2019s character bonding in this story. Interestingly, the rest of the cast get their spotlights too as they reinforce the show\u2019s themes. Characters such as Takashi and Akane (aka Prince) are inspirational for their dedication and realization to succeed. Remember, most of the guys in Haiji\u2019s team aren\u2019t experienced or very athletic. It takes a strong will, determination, and attitude to become succesful. The show carries character development as its team members strives to be the best they can be. It\u2019s a relatable concept that can be applied to real life with goals being accomplished through hard work. I personally find the show\u2019s attitude to be very inspirational with many of its character cast conquering their fears and running toward their dreams. \\n\\n\r\nAs dramatic as the show can be, do also expect a decent amount of lighthearted moments and comedy. The Jo twins are a prime example of this with their playful personalities. The man service also adds in some cheek humor when the team have bonding moments while discussing about their goals. When the drama picks up though, definitely be prepare to experience the real deal. Teams such as the Rikudo University is no pushover for their reputation. Haiji\u2019s push to get his team to succeed also comes at an immense amount of effort considering the requirements for this dream race. It\u2019s revealed in the show that the team must rank into the top 10 teams and meet personal records. So by all means, it comes to no surprise the amount of pressure the team can feel while training. This is where the main amount of drama drops in with characters feeling how difficult is to reach their goals. Nonetheless, I confess to say that a show like this meets the satisfaction of \u201cthe journey is more important than the destination\u201d. People may have hard this phrase many times before but as a driving force in the show, it suits for it perfectly. The amount of character development is expanded to most of the main character cast that you can easily recall their names and some of their memorable moments. No one is truly left out in favor of the main cast even as they seem featured more prominently at times. \\n\\n\r\nAs a Production I.G. show, this definitely reminds me a bit of their other sports projects. Haikyu especially comes to mind for its similar character designs and competitive atmosphere. More importantly, I felt the great deal of realism for its character designs. Throughout the show, the characters evolve physically and mentally. Their character expressions and reactions carries an emotional weight that can easily be felt throughout the show. It\u2019s the type of feeling when you finally earn a sense of pride and accomplishment after all the hard work. And don\u2019t forget, the team is consisted of cool guys so the man service can be a treat for the ladies.\\n\\n\r\nWith 23 episodes, I confess to say that it\u2019s the perfect amount for this particular anime. Why? That\u2019s because it managed to develop its character cast while staying consistent with the storytelling. The amount of realism made me realize how inspirational this show can be. With every episode, I felt compelled to see just how much the characters can succeed for their future. Honestly, we need more literature adaptations these days.",

            "content": "WARNING: SINCE THIS ANIME IS CURRENTLY AIRING, THIS IS NOT THE COMPLETED REVIEW, I WILL EDIT THIS REVIEW AS THE SHOW CONTINUES. MY OPINIONS MAY CHANGE OR NOT CHANGE IN THAT TIME.\r\nI usually sleep on my left side of my bed, while ya'll sleep on this show. But... seriously guys, this is probably the most underrated anime from this season. A hidden gem if you must. Which is surprising, with sports anime usually gathering the biggest fandoms in the anime community, such as \"Yuri!! On Ice!\", \"Free!!\" and \"Haikyuu!\". Maybe it's because this anime doesn't have a exclamation mark in its name? I'm just joking.But honestly though, if youre not watching this show I advise you to watch it, youre still not convinced allow me to give you my review on it.\\n\\n\r\nS T O R Y 7/10\\n\r\nOut of all the other scores, this is the lowest. Not because the plot is bad. It just that it's generic to any other sports anime. But at the same time, just because something is unorginal, it doesn't make it boring. It just means that if youve watched lots of sports anime you might be a bit disappointed. To sum it up, it follows the trend of one character being passionate about a sport, he wants to get the team to win a championship, team is unmovtiated/underdogs, another team member is really good at the sport but is not longer enjoying it because of past experiences or another reason, but they all find love for the sport eventually, Yeet. You get the spin. But although the plot flops with its slight unoriginality, the show isnt boring at all, due to its characters and animation, which I will talk about soon. \\n\\n\r\n A R T 9/10\\n\r\nSo far, the animation and art style have been consistently good. With most shows, with animation starts to struggle after the 6th episode, but so far it hasn't even had one poorly animated scene. Not only is it consistent, is its good, like really good. Especially the characters facial expressions\u2026 god I love them. The happiness, anger, fatigue, sometimes the facial expressions are on the level of \"A Silent Voice\"; which is basically god standards for emotion. The colours are bright and the colour palette isnt ugly at all. \\n\\n\r\nS O U N D 8/10\\n\r\nWhile the soundtrack isnt insanely amazing, it is pretty goddamn good and noticeable. Aka, it doesn't fade into the background it is used effectively. It being a mix of light electronic and your usually soundtrack stuff. The ED being very light electronic. Also the op is really good, not just the song but the visuals itself.\\n\\n\r\nC H A R A C T E R S 10/10\\n\r\nThis is the best bit about this show, easily. If the casts of characters wasn't this good, the scores wouldn't be so high. Period. It's hard to describe why, but you just fall in love with them! The show does have a slightly large cast, but they are all rememeberable and unique. Within the first episode they are all effectively introdouced perfectly and not only that, but we get a amazing taste of their personalities. They are all very fun to watch. Plus, their character designs are great, corresponding to their personalities, all looking different but not silly, like actual people. BUT! It isnt just the characters that are outstanding, its how they interact with each other. You can tell which characters get on with other characters, which characters don't talk to each other much, who looks up to who and who looks down on who, who has known each other the longest ect ect. Because of this, watching them walk to each other is extremely charming and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nE N J O Y M E N T / O V E R A L L 9/10\\n\r\nI love this series so much currently. I hope that it continues being this good and heck, even get better. If you can't tell, I recommend everyone to watch this show. Even if youre not a avid sports anime fan. This show is for practically everyone and the fact that its one of the least popular things from this season amazes me.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review. please upvote it if you've gotten this far... it took me a while to write because I deleted about two paragraphs by accident while I was writing this lol. I will edit this review whenever I feel I need to.\\n\r\nHave a nice day! uwu",

            "content": "This show is underrated and a true gem.\r\nStory: 9\r\nRun with the Wind is a really special show, it\u2019s been a long time since any story has quite impacted me this strongly. The story is actually quite simple, a bunch of college students decide to run a marathon, and their journey to reaching it. The execution is where the anime shines, there is never a wasted moment at all, every episode either focuses on the growth of a character, the growth of the team, or a major cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more. The anime outside of some unrealistic dramatic scenes, felt very relatable and refreshing,the college students felt mature, but not to mature, just the way people out of high school should feel. There weren\u2019t to many stupid scenes involving walking into a bathroom that was unlocked or getting into a fight with some rival school or team like you would see in a show set in a middle school or high school. The setting was executed effectively, the jokes were solid, the pacing was consistent, and the story did not ignore anything that was very important. \\n\\n\r\nThe last part is important because it allows the viewer to actually believe a team largely comprised of people who have never run competitively before could somehow actually qualify for the hardest college marathon in their country and perform well in it. The story focused on their training, on the amount of suffering they went through, on the support they had from their community and family, and most importantly on how each character overcame their obstacles one at a time instead of suddenly being a top tier runner.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a strong execution of a sports anime plot, it will keep you wanting more, it will make you feel excited for the team and their performance, and it will make you actually focus on all the subtle scenes that are thrown in and connected to the characters in the final race.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth and clean, there were no major problems with it, the running choreography was some of the best I seen in anime, especially during the final race. Character designs did feel a bit basic, like the characters were just remodels of other shows done by Production IG, specifically Haikyuu. There is not much else to say, it was a good production, but nothing super amazing, it gets an 8 just for the angle and animation quality for the running scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe second opening was a very fun song especially the last 30 seconds. Overall the music suited the series and was designed to get the viewer hyped up for major scenes, worried during dramatic scenes, and focused during training scenes. The sound could have been better yes, there wasn\u2019t any part of the OST I would listen to outside of watching the show, but for a sports anime this is good enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I thought the characters were just Haikyuu clones, with Kageyama as the main character, but I was totally wrong. The character development between the team started pretty slow however it was the right pace for a 24 episode show. The characters were funny, charming, interesting, well written, and extremely real, despite the very large cast by the end of the show you will know them all by name and know them as people. Although some of the characters did not get any real development until the very last episode outside of a few small scenes through the show, their final performance added up to so much more. \\n\\n\r\nWe had a character quit his addiction to smoking and got to watch it slowly build up in the background until he could run, we got an otaku who couldn\u2019t even jog run a marathon over time, we even a pair of twins each with very distinct personalities coming to terms with each other\u2019s talents and how they should chase separate goals. This was easily the best part of the series, the characters were absolutely amazing, they had good chemistry, great inside jokes, and they even managed to bring an African character in and not have him be 1 dimensional fast runner because he is from Africa. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also has a very strong MC who grew from a cold expressionless results-oriented person to someone who cared more about his team than his own performance. Overall the characters were simply the best part of the series and even if you don\u2019t like sports anime, I would recommend watching this just for their growth in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nBeing straight here, I never thought a show about running could be this exciting. I really enjoyed this series, it\u2019s so far, the best sports anime I seen in the last year, and one of the strongest I ever seen. The characters, the drama, the growth, struggles, the successes, all of it resonates with me and anyone else who has ever attempted pursuing any competitive goal before. This is a much watch if you seen any other Production IG sports anime and wanted more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI give this show an 8, it was really hard deciding whether or not to give this show an 8 or 9 since it was very close, however I will give it an 8 for 2 reasons. One because although the main characters were great, the ending did not tie up all the loose ends for their development, I really wanted to know what happened to some of them given that one had injuries, one had a thing for a girl in the cast, and one that was graduating soon.I also wanted to know more about the future of their running club however that was left unclear and open ended. \\n\\n\r\nThe second reason why I did not give this show a 9 was because the show required a bit much on unrealistic drama, for example a member is sick before the last race, another gets injured before the race, Kakeru\u2019s argument with his rival also seemed really stupid and I can\u2019t imagine anyone being angry for so long over something like that. But overall everything else was very good and this was one of my favorite recent shows, I still highly recommend it, and its definitely a high 8.\\n",

            "content": "Anyone who has ever run knows that it sucks. Why waterboarding is a thing when treadmills exist is a complete mystery to me. I guess even the KGB had its limit on how fucked up their torture methods were. Anyhoo, Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru --  Run with the Wind -- is a story about people who are literally the epitome of masochism and, as weird as it may sound, actually enjoy running. I was expecting a psychological series going in depth with this pain = pleasure thing, but turns out our series relies on fujobaiting instead.\r\nIt should be warned already on the title pagethat every factor from story progression, seiyuu choices, male casting and slice of life-like approach yells out one thing loud and clear: homo undertones. While great many sports series have chosen this approach (Haikyuu, Kuroko, Wind Up, Free -- just to name a few), Kaze ga has very little charm outside its naked ecchi boys / manservice factors. Just to specify to what extent this exist and why it is a problem: there are 4 scenes of our young boys being naked already shown in the first episode before we even know their names. I don't mind male ecchi or bros bathing together washing each others dicks when it is manly and #no_homo, but when it becomes the first thing that stands out in a sports series that was told be filled with drama and comedy, and executed with cute boys who don't, in any way, act like genuine humans, we are off to a terrible start.\\n\\n\r\nThe selling point of sports series tends to be their cast for their stories can never truly work if the person(s) going thru the story are not worth of being followed. Kaze ga's cast and approach I'd like to describe with a short meme: y Tho? Our \"club\" of 10 boys are, outside few expectations, the exact same people. They have nearly invisible personalities, all they have are things that are common between all of them for there aren't such things that would separate them from each others -- outside their outlooks. And even this isn't entirely true since there are even twins among them. As a whole, the cast is fake and empty to a point that I wonder if this is what feminists see when watching CGDCT or ecchi anime. The cast doesn't have much appeal to me. I couldn't find any way to care about any of them. They have nothing that would make relate to them, they offer no entertaining personality traits, their behavior is dull and mainly reminds me of cardboard. None of them have any interesting past stories or current stories. None of them even says anything mildly interesting at any point during the run. The more they talked the more I came to go meh over them. How awfully boring must ones life be to hang out with any of them? A question I found myself asking several times.\\n\\n\r\nOutside episode 16, the sports side is an absolute joke. Even tho I don't like running myself, I have seen series that focus on running and track&field and which I have liked. Kaze ga's take on this torture method is exactly as dull as the sports itself. Nothing stands out, nothing feels meaningful, there aren't even any fitting/atmospheric or agro songs used that could make these scenes better. Instead, same few songs are repeated over and over and none of them is very fitting. So often, there plays some supposedly emotional song whilst our cast members run and sweat, followed, for example, by a scene where they get scolded for being too slow. What the series is trying to deliver here never reached my end. And typically, these running scenes are very short and made in the exact same manner, only thing that differs is the aftermath. Watching the execution here feels like repeatedly hitting ones head in the wall with a force so light that you barely even feel the effect, but still know it is happening. There are even sports series centering around baseball and fighting sports which field work (AKA running) is more noteworthy than anything Kaze ga achieved. The best characters here are these one-dimensional 'evil' buttholes who just come around to mock our sports team for being a disgrace towards track'n field. Why? Because their phrases are truthful remarks. Especially towards the end, the melodrama Kaze ga mixes together with sports is nothing less than a disgrace towards all athletes.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of actual story, one of the driving motions here are our boys interest to girls.. Literally \"lets run for the are girls.. on the other side of the road.\" I am not sure who the writer is trying to fool with this since they only introduce one slightly relevant female cast member and she is more obviously filler than any other character. Also, she falls under the trope \"every food she prepares turns poison\" because apparently it is funny when women can't cook. She is totally adorable regardless. Yet it feels so unnecessary to insert such things here yet not deal with them accordingly. The outcome is just idiotic. The events itself are rather formulaic. Male x male interactions in fujobait manner, bathing together naked, and running. Some pseudo-psychological things going on since, apparently, running (for our mc) is the same as running away from problems, and the main dude seems to have some. Even so, there is no clear reason for the series to exist, story-wise. It's clear from early on that the mc's \"insecurities\" are just bullshit used as an excuse to work as some sort of ongoing cliffhanger to make people interested in what type of \"mysterious\" reasons he has for being such an angsty loner. Other sides of the \"drama\" are practically sitcom-tier since the cast acts like a bunch of drama queens instead of there being any \"real\" drama going on. Sometimes randomly asspulled and beyond fake event occurs, such as one character suddenly losing a consciousness at the end of an episode just to create a cliffhanger worth of 3 pennies. To talk more about these cliffhangers, they are used to some extent and every time they match the definition of \"horse shit\". False tension and not much more. \\n\\n\r\nThe production, outside the incredibly bland character models (their bodies look like spaghetti and have even weirder necks than people in Ballroom e (not exaggerating -- same studio, also) -- and worth-of-nothing sports scenes, is one more thing that is not making this thing any better. The naked men bathing -scenes seem to be the ones that have gone thru the most planning. Comedy moments are over-simplified to a point that it looks just cheap and it is practically the exact same execution every single time. Dude's doing 2 frame shaking when being cornered. Otherwise the series screams it is made by Production I.G with their modern standards (which have been going down and down rather consistently for years if someone hasn't noticed). The pacing is simply too slow during any part that is not related to running and too fast with anything that is. Obviously, because they wanted to save money when animating running masses. CGI is being used during track events and it's like 3fps when out zoomed. Often, people who run look like they are floating over the track rather than touching the ground with their feet. Looks so incredibly lame. Not that it couldn't be forgiven if there were some actually good things going on. Pros that out weighted the cons. To me, even the smallest of problems stood out for I couldn't achieve any level of immersion with the series, rather saw it as nothing but a soulless product.\\n\\n\r\nAll the criticism aside, I did quite enjoy moments around Akane \"Prince\" Kashiwazaki, who is the polar opposite of everyone else. Seems to hate running and is in really bad shape. His running form is so awkward and wrong that I managed to laugh at it few times, mainly reminding me of zombie movements from Resident Evil games. Even his posture while standing is advanced scoliosis, so I guess kudos for creating a dude like him. Other thing I have to drop here is the ending of episode 19 which was simply hilarious. If only there had been other good things I could praise than the rare few.",

            "content": "Are you exhausted of seeing sports anime set in a generic high school setting and want something different ? Are you a college student like me who wants a sports anime they can relate to ? If any of those describes you then I welcome you to the world of Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteru. As an athlete in college, this show has given me the motivation and strength to practice hard everyday and not slack off. Why is that you ask? Well here are the reasons why. \r\nStory : 9/10\r\nThe story like most people would say is pretty standard but what differs it from therest would be the charisma and passion exhibited from the main character. 11 episodes in, the story in general is the main character is passionate and dedicated to join an event but since it requires 10 members, he cunningly recruits 10 students by giving them a place to stay while offering them luxurious food . Each episode is amazingly well paced and shows how each character develops. By the time each episode ends, I am already looking forward to see how the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat i love about this anime is the fact that there is at least one character that anyone can relate to. Each character has their own quirky personality as well as their own personal issues to deal with. With each episode we get to know each character more personally, and empathize with their struggles in life. It teaches me that everyone is different in their own way and we should not judge a book by it's cover. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is the best part about the anime. Out of all the winter anime, this is one of the two OPS and EDS I cant skip apart from bunny girl senpai. The OP is played by one of my favourite bands, Unison Square Garden who has played other amazing songs like kekkai sensen ED and ballroom e youkoso OP. When the OP comes on, I immediately have a burst of motivation to run as much as possible till i am satisfied. On the other hand, the ED gives you a sense of nostalgia as you appreciate what youth is all about and makes me want to enjoy the most out of my youth. I can easily say that the ED is the best of 2018.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle reminds me so much of Haikyuu and it is not an over exaggeration when i say one of the characters is the literal copy of Tobio Kageyama. If you are a fan of Haikyuu, i would recommend watching this anime. The artstyle is highly realistic and makes me feel like I am a part of their world. The characters expressions and emotions are well shown and I can feel each character's motives and passion flowing out of the screen.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nEach episode is equally enjoyable and not even a second have I feel bored with the anime. Each episode I go through a roller coaster of emotions ranging from laughter to sadness all the way to anger. Even though it has a simplistic storyline, due to the team having 10 different personalities, it makes it fun to watch how each of them interact with one another and helping each other out while dealing with their personal problems. It is so good that I had to write a review to make sure people are not deprived of such an amazing anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI am only halfway through the show, but I can tell that this anime will be one for the history books as one of the best sports anime. Before that happens, watch the first 11 episodes and be amazed by how amazingly beautiful and motivational this show can get. It is not meant for a specific audience and anyone at any age can enjoy it equally. Don't let this masterpiece be left out as a hidden gem. Upvote this and spread the message.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story (7): The story is neither extremely unique nor really unoriginal, but it is pretty standard story for a sport anime. \r\nCharacter (10): \r\nThere are various unique, interesting and lovable characters in this anime, and we get a deep-dive in the personality and development of the most important characters, making it really easy to relate to and feel with the characters, as well as making them more likeable and real.\r\nSound (9): \r\nOP: Pretty fitting for the show. The opening is chill and all good but nothing outstanding. \r\nED: The ending is pretty neat, the beat is really relaxing.\r\nOST: (the god) Yuuki Hayashi composed the soundtrack,so obviously it's gonna be amazing. With such inspiring, hype and beautiful OST every scene becomes better, making all replicas sounds significantly better. This is why I think a good soundtrack is really important, especially in sports animes like this which is more character-based than action-based. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8): The art and animation is fairly good.\\n\r\n*Fun-fact:  The Chief Animation Director is the same as that of Haikyuu and Ballroom e Youkoso, which is why the art style is so similar in these three animes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8): Although the story is pretty simplistic, the characters and sound easily outweigh this, making watching the anime a really enjoyable time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8): I'd definitely recommend this anime to anyone who likes to watch sport animes, but also to everyone in general because the combination of unique and interesting characters and a solid soundtrack make watching the anime a delight.",

            "content": "Do you like running? So let's run together!\r\nRoad with the goal of Hakone is far. But aim for dream is good thing. They convinced it, and strive to practice training every day.\r\nWho is genuine runner? Where is college can reach the top? Those answers are there.\r\nThis show is ensemble cast by various characters. Basically, Kakeru Kurahara and Haiji Kiyose are protagonists. No problem if you focus them.\r\nAt first, each characters development are completely well done. This is high point. Every characters are unique, attractive, likable. And cool.\r\nEspecially Haiji is my favorite character in this show. I love his looking and personality so much. He ispositive and cheerful.\\n\r\nOuji's bravery also wonderful. At the beginning, he is drained though, he grows gradually. This is the same goes for other teammate.\\n\r\nWhile almost characters have all sorts of situation, they's trying their very best. Sometimes enjoyable. Sometimes strictly. Part of the family.\\n\r\nOne more thing is this show has many good-looking guys because this show is sports genre. In other words, almost guys. Nevertheless, please don't avoid. It's a waste.\\n\r\nHanako Katsuta. She is manager who give grace to teammate. Her turn is less though, Her cuteness burst pivotal points. Joji and Jota brothers fall in love her!\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Kazuma Fujioka. He is Haiji's friend. Although his turn is less the same as Hanako, really manly and good person. He has presence and charisma.\\n\r\nArt and Animation are stunning and beautiful. Running animation is depicting finely. It has always sense of urgency. Background also wonderful.\\n\r\nMusic also very nice. OP songs of both cour are amazingly cool. ED songs are calm and quiet. In addition, voice acting is great. Satisfactory.\\n\r\nAs constitution of main story. Practice, Preliminary round, Actual play's repetitive. Seems repetition of the same thing, but the truth is different.\\n\r\nDrama, Conflict, Growth among them are include. Kakeru has most complex in the team. He is suffering from cruel past and unbearable current.\\n\r\nSometimes he let his feelings out. However, Haiji helps him. Because of he is very thoughtful of Kakeru more than anyone.\\n\r\nHaiji is leader of everyone. At the same time, he is companion with others equally. Since Haiji is thinking everyone like family, he lead the team.\\n\r\nHe hates lying against himself and people, and it has an effect in his past. Nevertheless, he don't look back. He just move forward. It is his motto.\\n\r\nOtherwise, life itself feels boring. He is thinking it. I've ever also did experience similar to life. I thought I don't want to regret.\\n\r\nResults aren't very fine though, I achieve sense of accomplishment. I agree with Kakeru and Haiji's way of life.\\n\r\nAlthough the same goes for every field, if you give up once, become unable to understand yourself's reason of being. How do you solve?\\n\r\nThis show is depicting things like them delicately. Is throwing away the dream your long-cherished ambition? Or while you see eternity, do you aim for your true dream?\\n\r\nOnly you isn't lead role. Speaking objectively, I can say that you should broaden yours horizons. Rewarding for the sake of the future.\\n\r\nIn short, no matter what you are to be discouraged...KEEP RUNNING!\\n\\n\r\nAs noted above, there are many characters in this show. So face and name don't match. Their case is many. Well, it can't be helped honestly.\\n\r\nIntroduction looks like repetitive over and over again. It may be get tired depending on the person. Pacing is improve from 2-cour. Endure until there.\\n\r\nI disagree with Kousuke Sakaki's behavior entirely. A lot of emotion theory. Or just bear a grudge. He isn't suitable as Kakeru's rival.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is hidden gem, and at the same time, make us think about philosophy of life. How it looks your present self? Is there something you want to do?\\n\r\nI got various inspiration from this show. Intense, Joyful, moved. More than anything, this show is very interesting. Close to masterpiece.\\n\r\nThat's a shame to buried. If you're interested in this show, worth watching. Really underrated.",

            "content": "There are various aspects which have to be considered and come into play if we are talking about how a good anime should generally be like. That said, values and priorities in regards to a story and technical features may differ dependent on whom you ask. Well thought out plot, compelling characters or perhaps a focus on visual storytelling-you name it, all of us have preferences whose omnipresence ultimatively dictates our viewing habits and the enjoyment we receive out of something. There's still one attribute I view  as vital in order to appeal to the audience, namely heart and even more so when itcomes to the sports anime. Kaze ga Tsuyuko Fuiteiru essentially embodies the spirit which made me such a big fan of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also a show that exceeded preexisting expectations. Expectations mainly based on a single name.  Brought to us by Production I.G a studio renowned for their outstanding record regarding anime that revolve around physical activities. Ok not quite tbh, but if we take a look at some big hit's from this decade like Kuroko no Basket, Diamond no Ace, Haikyuu, Ballroom e Youkoso then it shouldn't really surprise that I.G has earned a certain reputation in this field and everyone familiar with their sports adaptations of this decade might fully agree.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Kakeru and Haiji who met by chance. One is an ex competive runner and a prodigy, the other a guy desperate enough to trick his dormmates with the objective of letting Kansei University enter the  Hakone Ekiden. Sounds like a solid premise for this genre. Although there's a notable difference in direct comparison with the title I mentioned above.  The show's in question used a narrative that rather focussed on the sport and elemental technicalities, Kaze ga Tsuyuko Fuiteiru on the other hand went more for a character and drama oriented approach. Running in a club served more or less as a catalyst to induce conflicts, trials and self-exploration on the steep road to reach the \"top\". Then there's the fact that it's setted in university. Good, that doesn't  sound like a major change up at first , but it allowed to showcase harsh circumstances accompanied by sacrifices which can only occur if you're in one of the busiest stages of your life. Moreover, I thoroughly enjoyed the cosy ambience of a lively dorm and the seemingly deeper bond of the cast, similar to that of a family. Especially the first episodes capitalized on  that aspect and  it was easy to get warm with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of them, the easiest way to sum up the lot without spoiling much would be to describe them as a diverse bunch or if I take this a bit further maybe even as a group that consists of people whose personalities almost couldn't contrast more.  While this made up for engaging character dynamics it was at the same time also the ideal breeding ground for several disputes which put the common goal at risk. There were times where it was hard for some viewers not to get aggravated by some actions or attitudes that were displayed. This doesn't sound very appealing, but rest assured.  After a bit of patience you will get rewarded with amazing individual as well as collective development emotionally striking enough to wash away all unpleasant memories. However, conflicts weren't limited to be solely of external nature, each Kansei member had his own struggles to deal with and the show dedicated a decent amount of screen time on depicting those in a tangible manner. At this point I might fairly add that time spent on fleshing out characters wasn't alloted equally and this could've evoked the impression that some of them were lacking significant growth. Thankfully,  this most definitely wasn't  the case. The final batch of episodes in particular took care of that task. They presented a gratifying conclusion to each individual journey. The boys reflected on their past and the last months devoted to running . This ultimatively enabled them to become aware of  how running, an activity most of them were initially indifferent about brought a change to their lifes. These moments truly hit close to home as they were able to convey a wide array of emotions along with a level of relatableness that surpassed everything I had expected. All this made the already enjoyable ride more than just worthwhile. \\n\\n\r\nWhat struck me most besides the raw emotional impact I experienced while watching characters I've gotten fond of fight against the competiton and themselves was the technical finesse put to display. The running segments were beautifully composed, ranging from expressions of the runner, spectator reactions, inner monologue, animation and OST, everything was in tune.  Regarding the overall animation and art quality, well it was mostly conistent throughout the entire course of the show. Some CGI here, some minor inconsistencies when it comes to the faces ther, but nothing that warranted major criticism in that area or took me out of the experience. It fulfilled the standards you would expect of I.G.\\n\r\nOutstanding in that department was how realistic the running motions looked  and the effective use of imagery. The director did extremely well there and this became already apparent during the first episode. The first encounter of Kakeru and Haiji was without a doubt one of the strongest opening scenes I've ever scene and immediately captivated me.\\n\\n\r\nComing to the music department and I'm going to make this short. Fantastic! It always fitted to the scene, enhanced the mood and correspondingly the enjoyment by a large margin. The theme songs, especially the first ones, Catch up , latency and Reset were exceptionally good.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto something, many, especially those who care about accurate depiction and realism when it comes  to technical aspects would most likely take an issue with. Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru didn't put much emphasis on elaborating details of running nor did it provide a logical explanation how admittedly more or less fit novices were able to perform so well on a high level. Team Kansei surely put lots of effort into their training, but others must have done so as well. Potential viewers gotta ask themselves whether they can stomach a dose of idealism or not. Personally, I didn't have much trouble to overcome my disbelief  due to plenty of other merits. Foremost, the sheer endless energy the whole story and characters emitted. Then also the fact that an anime about a solo sports had some of the best team chemistry is nothing short of praiseworthy.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I'm gonna talk about my personal enjoyment. Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru was by far the most entertaining show I've seen from the last year and it turned out to be way more than I could've hoped for. I was totally invested in the characters, I laughed, I felt joy or cried with them. I even started to integrate running in my workout routine again.  On top of that it managed to recreate the exact feelings of the times when I've seen my first sports and I hope everyone who's going to check this marvellous work will experience a similar sensation.\\n\\n\r\nI gave it an overall rating of 9 due to the set rating system for reviews, but  in my heart it gets without a doubt a full score.",

            "content": "*Insert Stupid Quote\" Reviews nowadays are either filled with people having unpopular opinions and people liking them a lot, or some guy who writes an entire essay on why the show is a \"masterpiece.\" Personally, I try and watch for enjoyment instead of picking apart every little thing within an anime. Anime, in my opinion should be watched with enjoyment rather than be slammed down by little tiny flaws that lowers the overall \"score.\"\r\nNow I am going to tell you why I enjoyed this anime, instead of breaking down every detail. \r\nI must admit, the synopsis is bad. However, if the synopsis is holding youback from watching this anime, fear not. I feel as if they included some of the most irrelevant information possible. If you are even considering watching this anime, I hope that I give you the push to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime sort of follows a very \"sports\" arc where they train and hope to go to nationals. However, when watching the anime you find that instead of focusing on the \"sports\" aspect, you are more focused on the characters. That is what set it apart from any regular anime. I love each of the 10 main characters and their personalities make it easy to like them. They all are struggling with something in their life within the sport and outside. Although they don't like to show the weak side of them, each of them makes a commitment to change, especially our main character, Kakeru. When characters grow in anime, I think that has to be the most satisfying thing ever. Even though the anime After the Rain and Violet Evergarden have nothing to do with \"sports\" I still felt similar vibes from them.  \\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime tells you about who they are as individuals, seeing them succeed makes me happy/satisfied. Seeing things not go as smoothly as I thought was a nice change of pace. Within a race, anything can happen and if you aren't feeling 100% it won't change the fact that you are going to do the race still.\\n\\n\r\nIf you aren't sold at this point, this anime was developed by Production I.G. I am sure that you have watched other anime that have been made by them such as Attack on Titan, Kuroko no Basket and especially Haikyuu!! So why not watch this one as well? On top of that, this anime went from around a 7.4* rating from week one to 8.24* rating. \\n\\n\r\nThis is for the people who want individual marks on the aspects of things. \\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nArt - 9.5\\n\r\nNever gets in the way of things which is all I really care about. *It was beautiful*\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9 \\n\r\nOpening 1 was amazing and Opening 2 was forgettable. Either way, it enhanced my experience rather than ruining it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10 \\n\r\nAll of the characters I loved :)\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\r\nLoved each of the backgrounds and what they had to do in order to overcome obstacles within their live. Finally, something about college stuff instead of high school. Lets go!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nBasically the only thing that matters. The only reason this wasn't a 10 is because at times I felt the ending of an episode was a little bit lackluster. \\n\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nTo everyone. At least give this anime a try as I think it won't hurt. What is also kind of weird is that the main character looks a little like Kageyama from Haikyuu!! I also liked the little bit of comedy in there as well, made it an added bonus. The drama is also totally justifiable instead of just starting random fights with no reason behind it. Although I tend to find my opinions unpopular, I decided to write this review because I just like writing about things that I enjoy. I hope that you can at least give this anime a chance and feel free to let me know your opinions about this anime as well. \\n\\n\r\n*P.S*\\n\r\nIf you are a runner, I feel as if this is a must watch. Without spoiling too much, we find out early on that Haiji, one of the main characters is injured and goes through a phase in his life where he is completely unmotivated.  Any sports anime that has a character that I can relate to is always nice since I can feel as if I am not alone in the situation that I am in. Personally, since I have flat feet which can lead to a lot of problems, you always have to find a way to overcome and adapt. Prince is also relatable since we all used to be slow runners :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "I never really enjoyed any sports anime ever before watching this anime. The reason I never liked any sports show was simple, you see all any sports anime ever did was just putting so much effort on the sports itself that they forget to develop the characters who are the essential part of the anime(looking at Haikyuu, yuri on ice and free).\r\nI was really shocked to see a anime about running that does not show any character running until ep 5 or 6, I mean how sports anime do that these days. Rather then making us show the characters running from the start it takesthat time to develop the characters itself, because what good a shallow character is to the show. And mind you this anime has a lot of characters that need ample to develop and shine in limited amount of time, but damn not a single minute of any ep is wasted and its pure story-telling and good characters dynamics.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I had anything to complain about this anime but this anime does not let me do that because its that good, I really like how Haiji interacts with with other characters and how genuine he is. Also how kakeru goes from being a antisocial to just being friendly with everyone, its just  heartwarming. And akane is my soul animal, really he is so relatable and puts so much effort to come out of his comfort zone for something that only benefits other the most.\\n\\n\r\nThis is how a sports anime should be done and every other sports anime should take notes from this. If you want to know what a really good sports anime looks like then you need to watch anime.",

            "content": "Fall 2018 has been a pretty good season, some might even say it's great. Among all of the shows I've seen so far, Kaze ga has got to be one of my favorites. And I'm surprised at how underrated this show is right now, considering how enjoyable and good it is. I haven't watched a lot of sports shows AND I'm only writing this after watching 6 eps (I'll probably update this when I have more things to say), so of course take my opinion with a grain of salt.\r\nFirst, probably the weakest aspect of the show so far: the story. Now, I don't wantyou to think that the story is trash or anything like that. It's actually pretty good. The thing is that we're only getting started and taking things slowly, which is certainly not a bad decision since this show is gonna run (heh) for 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the art and animation, I gotta say that this is one of the better looking shows of the season. The art style is very similar to another show adapted by Production I.G.: Haikyuu!!, but what really stands out to me is some of the shots and little scenes, like at the end of episode 1 and one of the scenes with Kurahara in episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"sound\" aspect is also pretty good, the OST fits nicely with the tone of the shows and the scenes and it's generally very pretty and calm. The OP by Unison Square Garden is one of the best (in my opinion of course) of the season, with some nice visuals too. The ED is also really good, with it's nice, catchy electronic/modern vibe.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, probably my favorite aspect of the show: the characters. Usually if you're not going to have a super flashy or original story, then I'm hoping you're going to show some good characters. It's hard to describe what exactly makes these characters so good, but one of my favorite things is how they interact with each other, especially Haiji with the rest of the members. Their personalities are also pretty distinct and good, matching some of their designs and shit. Plus, it's refreshing to see a sports story with characters that are on college and not on high-school.\\n\\n\r\nThanks to the characters, the show is very enjoyable and actually doesn't have a lot of dull or boring moments. I had a good time watching them practicing or doing every day stuff. The animation and OST also help to make some of the scenes more enjoyable and interesting. I could see the lack of really important events turning off some people though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kaze ga is one of the better shows of the season so far, thanks to it's large cast of characters and good technical aspects. While there's not a lot of exciting running stuff happening, the story is building up and could end up being really good. If you haven't watched this show, please give it a chance because it's one of the most underrated shows in the season and deserves some attention.",

            "content": "\"Haiji... this isn\u2019t just your dream anymore... it\u2019s our dream. \r\nIt\u2019s a nice dream. So nice, I never want to wake up.\"\r\nI too would never like to wake up from the dream that has been Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, or Run with the wind. This is an anime that has touched my heart more than any other work of art I have ever experienced in my twenty years of life. I'm writing this review immediately after viewing the final episode, and I am truly grateful for this series.\r\nThe underlying theme of this series concerns youth. In college, we are pulled in so many directions, andhave to focus on our futures and our careers more than ever. This series has taught me that these are the years of my life that I cannot allow to slip by. I must take full advantage of my youth, and live it to the fullest alongside my friends and my family. I believe that any college student, or soon to be college student, can learn much from this series and these brilliant characters, and I sincerely hope that my words will reach at least one person in this world.\\n\r\nI was a runner in high school, I loved it and I hated it. I love to run, but I don't love to race. I quit after two years, and didn't run once my entire senior year of high school, and freshman year of college. This series reintroduced me to the joy of running. Since episode 1 aired last October, I run almost every morning with the show's beautiful OST on repeat.\\n\r\nI vehemently recommend this series, and rate it 10/10; a masterpiece.\\n\r\nThe Merriam- Webster dictionary defines a masterpiece as \"a work done with extraordinary skill\\n\r\nespecially : a supreme intellectual or artistic achievement.\u201d\\n\r\nI cannot express enough with words how truly this defines Run with the Wind, a series that showed me in just 23 episodes the most interesting and inspiring character development I have ever come into contact with.\\n\r\nI laughed, I cried, and after 23 episodes I feel that this series will stay with me as long as I live. When watching a weekly series, I always wait to let it stack, so that I am able to binge and more easily digest a show, but never could I do this for Run with the Wind. Never once could I wait even a second to watch the show that moves me more and more with each episode. The three week hiatus in the middle was so frustrating that when the series returned I cried uncontrollably, to my family's dismay and amusement.\\n\r\n\"I finally understand. Whether I run or I don\u2019t, it hurts just the same. Even if I fail, I want to do what my heart desires here.\"\\n\r\nHaiji, Kakeru, and the rest of the team feel like truly important people in my life, and amazingly I am able to deeply relate to all 10 of them. I think that any runner, that any college student, that any youth can relate to these masterfully written characters, and experience their triumphs and their misfortunes as one's own. Never have I enjoyed a cast of characters so much, and learned at least one valuable lesson from 10 individual characters in a work. Prince and Haiji will forever inspire me!\\n\\n\r\n\"This world is too beautiful.\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s okay.\\n\r\nMy love hasn\u2019t changed. Never has. Never will.\\n\r\nI like running.\\n\r\nI love it.\"\\n\r\nI like Run with the Wind, I love it, and I think both socially and philosophically it is one of the most important artworks of our generation. \\n\r\nDon't waste another second of your youth, get out there with your friends and strive for something greater than yourself. Never doubt yourself, and never act like someone you're not. These phrases are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the vital life lessons to be learned from Run with the Wind, but don't take my word for it. I insist that you view this series for yourself, and maybe, just maybe, you'll have the same beautiful experience as myself. \\n\r\nWhat is strength? What is running? What is living? Watch Run with the Wind and find out.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: I forgot to mention the two EDs are my ranked two favorite EDs of all time! So great to fall asleep to :)",

            "content": "I'm not gonna lie to you guys okay? The ending was a bit rushed. Like, they could've pumped it to 25 episodes instead of 23. But maybe I'm only saying that because THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ANIME I'VE EVER SEEN, AND I WANT MORE OF IT.\r\nOkay, where do I start? The soundtrack is absolutely amazing. Not just the openings and endings, but the background tracks are so, immensely good at setting the mood for this anime. The art is GORGEOUS. It's hard to explain what exactly I love about this art style, but I'm hoping to find something similar to it in thefuture.\\n\\n\r\nBut, that stuff's boring. Let's get into the good stuff. The story was... wow. It's such a simple premise, but wealth of meaning and inspiration found in it is remarkable. I will say that I would've loved to see a bit more character development for these boys beyond running, but all in all, the main story was very well paced, and it had such an impact. The story itself made me feel connected to it because of how well it was written. It sucked me in every episode. \\n\\n\r\nI'll tell you what, though: the characters are what's gonna hook you on this anime. Specifically their relationships with one another. I think there's something really powerful in the way that this anime has presented strong friendships between these guys. I loved seeing how different characters supported each other or how they changed over time. It felt like a camaraderie that's rare to find among people. These characters are funny, their complex, they cry, they laugh; they're everything they should be and more. They're special, and that made the anime special.\\n\\n\r\nI really cannot recommend this anime enough. It's something that I think a lot of people are going to come away from different than when they went in. It's very touching and inspiring story, and I'm really glad I took the chance to watch it. Excuse me while I go cry because it's over.",

            "content": "My favorite kinds of sports anime are those which are not sports anime, but more of a character drama. this show was one of those shows that i couldn't stop watching. i marathoned the first 8 episodes in one sitting. i then decided to go to sleep but the show invaded my thoughts to the point where i couldn't, and i needed to catch up fully and watch the other 2 released episodes at 4am :D\r\nproduction I.G. always does such a good job with \"sports\" anime so it makes me upset that people are ignoring this show.\r\nthe character development in the first 10 episodes ishonestly a lot better that some character development in 40 episode long or ongoing anime. i genuinely enjoyed seeing Haiji soften everyone around the edges and making the 10 boys seem more like a family than a band of misfits like they seemed at first. Also, watching Kurahara gain confidence, take charge, and make friends was heartwarming to say the least. At the end of the currently aired 10 episodes i found myself wanting more and craving more as i did when catching up with other shows this season. even more so which surprised me because it doesn't seem to have the large critical backing that i would expect from a show of this quality. speaking of quality, the music is amazing and the only problem i have with the animation is the use of CG during the running sequences (but i have never been a fan of CG in any anime). Im excited to see what the rest of this show has to offer. I highly recommend this show to anybody who is looking to watch a show about college boys bonding and having fun.. oh, and also running... :)",

            "content": "The season is over and with that I have to write a ton of reviews..sigh.\r\nSo let's begin with a bang. This review is about the anime 'Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru'. It is animated by the studio Production I. G., a studio that exceeds in making great sports anime. And this is one of them. The anime consists of 23 episodes and now that that's all out of the way, to the review!\r\nPlot/Story: The story revolves around a group of 10 guys who follow a goal of running in the Hakone Ekiden, a running spectacle only the best runners can get qualified for. It all startswith Kiyose Haiji witnessing a guy running away from a convenient store after he stole something from there. Haiji immediately follows the guy with his bicycle and asks him right away if he likes running. This thief is Kurahara Kakeru, one of the key plot points in this show. After some events Haiji who wants to run in the Hakone Ekiden manages to get together 9 other guys to complete the minimum number of team members for a track field club. With those 9 Haiji goes into training in order to get the participation.\\n\r\nSo the plot doesn't sound very amazing but that's okay. A goal doesn't have to be incredibly amazing. It is the journey to that goal that is of importance, that forms you into the human being that you are going to be at the end when you reach your goal. Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, or with its English title 'Run with the Wind' is about that journey, about the commitment to a goal. While the core plot isn't anything masterful the anime thrives from its rich characters and their story, their reason. On the other spectrum one needs to have good writing skills to construct a story with a simple concept but with a build of characters (or other aspects) that are strong enough to support the simple story and and make it into what it becomes in the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: There are two reasons why this anime looks so good. 1st. It's done by Production I. G. and 2nd. It's a sports anime done by Production I. G. This studio is very well known for another great sports anime called 'Haikyuu'. They also were responsible for the sports anime 'Ballroom e Youkoso', both shows being great sports anime. I. G. is the king of anime when it comes to sports anime. Honestly they should animated all sports anime, period. Because of them the animation and artstyle is the same as Haikyuu and Ballroom, so if you like that style and you probably are then you will like this show's artstyle as well. Because it's the same. Production I. G. as they are in their regular fashion don't lower down on the quaility of animation or artstyle. There isn't a single drop in quality that I could find. That's not something that's a given in the anime industry, especially when nowadays it's more quantity over quality. There is CGI involved in the show but only for cars or background runners. This makes it easier on the animation and drawing board team. Thankfully they didn't settle for bad CGI and they don't feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound is great, honestly. Both openings and endings are greatly chosen and the BGM is equally as good. Talking about the sound in an anime is often not as easy as the others because the only things you can say about Run with the Wind is that it has good musical compositions and all that, but after watching the show it did not stick out in that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is the best part of the show and I feel it's one the points I can talk least about. All 10 teammates and even other charcaters would deserve to be talked about big style. But that would just increase the length of this review needlessly. Therefore I will try to limit it as much as I can. All characters are rich in personality and ambitions. In favor of the plot all the charcaters are in college which is a very refreshing change for once. Haiji is a man with a big but small dream. And for that dream he looked for people he could achieve that with. The sport is  the main center of the anime and the characters do that sport. Around and during all this each of the characters has to come to terms with their own inner conflicts. Obstacles they have to overcome. It didn't feel at all that any of the teammates got less screen time than the others. Each one was highlighted at at times where it was needed. Everyone was important for the story, for the team. Kakeru, one of the more central points in the show. A great runner with a love for running. But his love comes into conflict with himself. At times like these it is to lean on others for help. The characters are all equally as strong.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & verdict: One of the best sports anime I have ever seen and possibly one of the best sports anime out there. I was deeply motivated by the show, I even started to run a bit myself. And when the sports anime manages to make you interested in the sport itself then it achieved exactly what it wanted to. I thoroughly enjoyed every episode of this show and I am quite sad it's already over. A truly great show. I highly recommend everyone to watch this show. It is one of the best things to have come out in the last year, maybe even last two.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that I will excuse myself. There are other reviews waiting on the shelf. Until the next time!",

            "content": "This review only applies for the first 6 episodes of the series, it does not constitute for the overall experience of the anime itself and it will be comprised of what has caused me to drop the show and what could cause other people to do the same, as well as which people would find the show a positive experience and attempt to help you choose whether or not to attempt watching this series.\r\nThere are a bunch of of reasons as to why I dropped Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fujiteiru, and all of them relate to the execution of the series due to its highly idealisticapproach which has spiraled into the series lacking a lot of the elements that I find interesting in anime from the \"Sports\" genre.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I say it takes a highly idealistic approach, what I mean is that the series seeks to explore how the characters value \"running\" rather than explore how marathon running works or is interesting. Questions such as \"What is running?\" and how characters use the activity to solve their emotional problems is something that is presented in the series, which is not necessarily something bad, as any series about \"Sports\" that is worth its salt, comes in with well defined motivations for its characters. But the sport is just as important to me as are the characters participating in it, and the activity needs to be interesting to keep me engaged. And running is simply just not interesting to watch and the show puts in very little effort to make it such. I am very intrigued by how a sport works as a competitive endeavor, and all I consider running is a good exercise for endurance and the show does nothing to expand my knowledge on it. I'm not holding the series accountable for not making one of the most basic actions humans are capable of interesting or not having something worthwhile to present that would blow my mind on it, but all I am saying is that I need the sport to actually be a sport. If the characters partake into an activity, I need to understand the activity and find it interesting. It's the driving factor for how much fun I have with a \"Sports\" series and that is missing here.\\n\\n\r\n\"Then you are wrong and you should shift your perspective. As you said, the series seeks to explore what the characters value. You should treat it as a drama.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat's a fair thing to say. If the series doesn't focus on the sport, perhaps it focuses on characterization and story. Which is true for this series. Its merits are not gonna lie within the sport because its large focus is on the characters and how the group is being formed to participate in this marathon. And with the theme of the show being able to move forward and find motivation and running is merely its tool, I shouldn't criticize running for having that function. The problem is that I am not interested in the series as a drama, and I have seen shows that use the very same theme, while also engaging me with whatever activity they present. As a result, I cannot forgive any writing shortcomings that the series has because there's nothing to distract me from any flaws or anything else I might dislike or feel is lacking.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what I do feel is lacking is an element of individualism and that is because the group itself is more valued than the individual characters, because this is a story about how a group forms and moves forward. And I hate that approach when someone attempts to explore what the characters value. Regardless of whether you want or not or like it or not, if the group complies, you also do, and that is a very lazy start. And that's what happens to most of the characters within the episodes I watched. They roll over, accept and participate regardless of how they feel and what they actually want. And that's my issue. The series maintains too much stability and despite the characters being against the idea, they barely put any fight, because it is more convenient for them not to, and perhaps having their emotions and motivations explored on the way or at a later time. As long as the team keeps moving forward, we can accept showing some individuality piece by piece.\\n\\n\r\nI do get that this is a series about finding motivation, so having motivation from the start to do any of what the series requires for its endgoal is counterintutive. But the way they accept running doesn't feel natural. They simply seem to be stuck doing the activity until they will feel like \"I guess this can be useful to me.\". With proper characterization and good individual focus, I would be able to immediately accept them and how they act. And I don't think that even currently the way they act is not understandable, I simply dislike that the characters are forced to it and they eventually just decide that it motivates them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I can see how this series can be very appealing if you are interested in the dynamics of a group, rather than individual people. One benefit the show has from this approach is that you see how the group is being formed and what the group collectively values and how they interact with each other. This is not the story of a single protagonist, but rather the team he is stuck with, his pack, and who they will become moving forward. How he and everyone will move forward through a healthy activity in a healthy way, and how their lives will become better. A group can be a lot more interesting than a few characters that are well developed but the others get the short end of the stick. It is not the case here because to me, every character seemed to get equal treatment. While I do think that the series overrides the identities of the characters by forcing them to run essentially, I won't deny that I am disliking this series for its strengths, rather than weaknesses. I personally would enjoy if the show was more character-driven, but its approach to be group-driven has its own merits for other people I am sure. And I can see its highly optimistic approach be very endearing to many. Other people might also enjoy the controlled pace of the series and how each character finds their own motivation to participate in the marathon as the series goes on.  \\n\\n\r\nTo people like me, the lack of a well defined sport will make the series feel preachy, and as if there is nothing worthwhile to explore due to the fact that the characters were not built to achieve something, but rather to find something they want to achieve. But to other people, the slowly directed pace and focus on the collective put on the entire group might make them feel comfortable while watching the series and keep them around for more, giving the series a big enough shot for each character to be built for the marathon. The series has a deeper meaning and it is not made for sheer entertainment value. Unfortunately I don't seek that deeper meaning and I needed that sheer entertainment value to be interested. I recommend this series if you want to watch a group of people move forward, and find meaning in their lives. Do not watch this if you seek what I seek from this genre: what will people do to achieve their goals and through what difficulties they will go in the process. Also the show has a lot of manservice. Lots of naked boys that seem to have a sensitive softer side. Have fun with that piece of information.",

            "content": "Spokon is one of my least favorite genres in anime, but I heard good things about this one so I decided to give it a try. I will compare Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru with Haikyuu so it doesnt matter if you have not seen the show, as you will understand my review if you know whats Haikyuu about.\r\nOne of the most important things a spokon anime has to succeed at is to convince the viewer that the sport they are watching is interesting, to show the appeal of that sport. When I watched Haikyuu I was amazed of how enyojable volleyball seemed to be, butthis show had a more difficult task. \\n\r\nUnlike football or basketball, athletics is a sport which lacks of excitement in some of its modalities, specially in long duration ones, as they consist of a person running for hours. Thats why, while the most important part of other spokons is the action and the games, this anime relies more on the characters, exchanging the electric scenes for internal speeches.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis show starts as every other spokon I know does. It has a promising protagonist, an underdog team and some cliche main cast. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my main issues with Haikyuu (and spokon in general), is that the characters only have their respective sport in mind. If you are not told that they are high school students, how would you know? They spend every minute in the court, training for several hours everyday. So, where are they examns? And their problems? Where are the injuries? There are no family issues, they dont think about love relationships, they dont care about exams, they are just there for the sake of playing volley. \\n\r\nHowever, Kaze ga tsuyoku fuiteiru is about college students, about adults. These guys are worried because they wont find a job, because they cant stop smoking or because they are gaining weight. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone who has practiced sports in their life know that it encompasses a wide series of concepts so training isnt everything that concerns a sporty.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you have seen some spokons, you will be used to the \"I want to be better\" plot device to develop characters. Well, you wont see that in this anime. Every character has his own arc to question themselves \"why am I running?\", and the show portrays the personalities and problems of every character in a perfect way. There are a lot of enyojable characters in this show but the most remarkable one is Kiyose Haiji. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough we see the story from the perspective of Kurahara Kakeru, the protagonist is Haiji. He inspires Kurahara and the whole team, he moves the plot forward, he helps every character to surpass their problems while recuperating of a knee injury. In case you dont know, knee injuries are the most dangerous in almost every aerobic sport and depending on what type of structural damage you have, the recovery and  rehabilitation can last for several months or even years. I relate a lot to this guy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen I saw the first race and I noticed the CGI animation I was disappointed. Production IG always have great animation, but I guess that hundreds of athletes running was too much. Anyway, the CGI wasnt that bad (Im not an expert, but if it does not make me want to stop watching the show as Overlord or Re Zero did, I dont consider it bad). \\n\r\nCharacter designs are detailed, sharp and pretty well done overall and I bet some anime movies would like to have such detailed backgrounds. In the summer vacation arc, the scenes where they are running around the lake are so fucking precious.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe best tool for a spokon anime to hook the viewer is music. When you are watching Haikyuu and \"Battle of concepts\" starts to play, you know something big is coming and you start getting chills through the spine. This show doesnt have that great soundtrack, but it has pretty good songs too. The first opening is catchy and I love the first ed because it reflects PERFECTLY what injuries feel like. The seiyuus did a great job expressing how the characters felt (Haiji almost make me cry with his last speech) and for 20 episodes, I thought the twin's VA was the same lol.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclussion, it doesnt matter if you are a spokon fan or not, as the perfect balance between action and character development this anime offers will satisfy you anyway. One of the underrated shows of Fall 2018.",

            "content": "This is a highly recommended, 23 episode beautiful series about running/slice of life of college students. Well, the first factor that draws me in this show at first was it\u2019s produced by I.G. production. And since I am a big fan of Haikyuu (produced by I.G. production as well) I gave it a shot. And throughout my viewing experience every week, I have to say that it was totally worth it. The studio delivered in expressing the main point of the story\u2019s journey and if I was the author of this novel, I will be so proud of this adaptation. \r\nIt even came to apoint where I can\u2019t wait to watch the next episode for next week so I keep on re-watching the previous episodes. Surprisingly, it never gets boring for me although it might still boils down to a person\u2019s own preference considering that when I recommended it to a female friend of mine, she did not finish it since she find it boring. I was glad though since another friend of mine (male this time and a runner to boot), was really hooked to it. \\n\\n\r\nWell, my point is this gem is not a mainstream anime that can please everybody but having experienced the bliss and inspiration from watching it makes me want to share it to anybody who is feeling down from losing a dream, uncertain with what their future entails, unmotivated or even just stuck with just the simple daily norm of life. The characters interactions are very dynamic as well that somehow it makes wish I am resident of \u201cChikuseisou\u201d drinking with these fellas. I have to commend the soundtrack/bgms used in every episode as well since they really fit the atmosphere of each scene; be it emotional, joyous, triumphant and at the same time, sad. It's a perfect mix of those different elements that for me added to the appeal of this show.\\n\\n\r\nThere can be some flaws or \u201cunrealistic\u201d achievement of the goal in their running time as what others say but I don\u2019t really mind since in my opinion, the show was still able to portray a clear message of what it want the viewers to feel and understand. They say it\u2019s not the destination but it\u2019s the journey that matters and this series definitely lived up to that. \\n\\n\r\nI hope more people will watch this anime and appreciate its true meaning and beauty \uf04a\\n",

For stubbornness and pride?\r\nI don\u2019t know. I doubt anyone knows.\r\nThat's why we can\u2019t stop looking.\r\nThat's why our hearts break\u00bb.\r\n \u2013\u2013  Episode 20.\r\n(\u00a1Disponible en espa\u00f1ol!)\r\nA dream. A yearning. One last chance. A capricious goal.\r\nBefore doing this review I was thinking, I thought, I thought and thought, I was really trying to find something bad or deficient in Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, but you know what? I could not.\r\nThe story is simple, direct, they present you to a boy (Haiji) with a goal thathe cannot fulfill alone, and he\u2019s willing to do whatever is needed to fulfill it, even to \"force\" others. We aren\u2019t bored with the seclusion of all the members, we simply go for Kakeru (the little star) and we begin an important journey in the life of all the members.\\n\\n\\n\r\n \u2192  Tell me, do you like to run?\\n\\n\r\nThis reminded me of Tsurune. Of course, they use different concepts and running is not the same as doing Kyudo, but if you want to know more about this, you can go to my review of that anime.\\n\\n\r\n\u27a4 Art 9/10.\\n\r\nWhy 9? The CG. Simply unnecessary, but it seems that latterly it's almost a rule to use it to give the audience in the face, haha.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest, beautiful. If you want a sample of the animation, look at the expressions and design of Hanako, it's adorable.\\n\\n\r\n\u27a4 Sound 10/10\\n\r\nWithout any complaint.\\n\\n\r\n\u300e Catch up, latency - Reset \u300f   \u300e Kaze Tsuyoku, Kimi Atsuku - Michi \u300f\\n\r\nTwo perfect pairs that harmonize the story in an ideal way.\\n\\n\r\n\u27a4 Characters 10/10.\\n\r\nNobody is left behind, all well defined, from Hanako's father to the last of the 10 runners, each one has his personality, his problems, his life, which in some way ends up being monotonous until Haiji decides to change it (being a little selfish, but it does not matter, who is not that?).\\n\\n\r\nYou can enjoy a friendly personality that while trying to fulfill your desire, helps your partners overcome their fears and become stronger in all aspects. This shows that, when you -run- into the right people, you get the best out of you.\\n\\n\r\n\u27a4 Overall 10/10\\n\r\nYou will enjoy it. You'll have an enjoyable experience, and if by chance you like athletics... You'll love it even more.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you're going to run.\\n\r\nSee ya!\\n\\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n\u00ab\u00bfQu\u00e9 nos impulsa a seguir corriendo?\\n\r\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no dejamos de hacer algo tan duro y doloroso?\\n\r\n\u00bfPor nuestros amigos? \u00bfPor nuestras metas? \u00bfPor nosotros? \u00bfPor terquedad y orgullo?\\n\r\nNo lo s\u00e9. Dudo que alguien lo sepa.\\n\r\nPor eso no podemos dejar de mirar.\\n\r\nPor eso nos parte el coraz\u00f3n\u00bb. \\n\r\n\u2013\u2013 Episodio 20.\\n\\n\r\nUn sue\u00f1o. Un anhelo. Una \u00faltima oportunidad. Una meta caprichosa.\\n\\n\r\nAntes de hacer esta review estuve pensando, pens\u00e9, pens\u00e9 y pens\u00e9, intentaba realmente encontrarle algo malo o deficiente a Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, pero \u00bfsaben qu\u00e9? No pude. \\n\\n\r\nLa historia es simple, directa, te presentan a un chico (Haiji) con una meta que no puede cumplir solo, y est\u00e1 dispuesto a hacer lo necesario para poder cumplirla, incluso \u201cobligar\u201d a los dem\u00e1s. No nos aburren con la reclusi\u00f3n de todos los miembros, simplemente vamos a por Kakeru (la peque\u00f1a estrella) y comenzamos una traves\u00eda importante en la vida de todos los miembros. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2192 \u00bfTe gusta correr?\\n\\n\r\nEsto me record\u00f3 a Tsurune. Por supuesto, usan conceptos diferentes y correr no es lo mismo que hacer Kyudo, pero si quieren saber m\u00e1s sobre esto, pueden ir a mi review de dicho anime.\\n\\n\r\n\u27a4 Arte 9/10.\\n\r\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 9? El CGI. Simplemente innecesario, pero parece que \u00faltimamente es casi una regla usarlo para darle al p\u00fablico en la cara, haha.\\n\\n\r\nLo dem\u00e1s, hermoso. Si quieren una muestra de la animaci\u00f3n, vean las expresiones y el dise\u00f1o de Hanako, es adorable.\\n\\n\r\n\u27a4 Sound 10/10\\n\r\nSin ninguna queja.\\n\\n\r\n\u300e Catch up, latency - Reset \u300f   \u300e Kaze Tsuyoku, Kimi Atsuku - Michi \u300f\\n\r\nDos duplas perfectas, que armonizan la historia de una manera ideal.\\n\\n\r\n\u27a4 Personajes 10/10.\\n\r\nNinguno se queda atr\u00e1s, todo bien definido, desde el padre de Hanako hasta el \u00faltimo de los 10 corredores, cada uno tiene su personalidad, sus problemas, su vida, que de alguna u otra manera termina siendo mon\u00f3tona hasta que Haiji decide cambiarlo (siendo un poco ego\u00edsta, pero da igual, \u00bfqui\u00e9n no lo es?). \\n\\n\r\nPodr\u00e1s disfrutar de una personalidad amigable que mientras intenta cumplir su deseo, ayuda a sus compa\u00f1eros a superar sus miedos y a volverse m\u00e1s fuertes en todos los aspectos. Esto demuestra que, cuando te topas con las personas correctas, sacan lo mejor de ti.\\n\\n\r\n\u27a4 Overall 10/10\\n\r\nLo disfrutar\u00e1s. Tendr\u00e1s una experiencia amena, y si por casualidad te gusta el atletismo... Lo amar\u00e1s a\u00fan m\u00e1s.\\n\\n\r\nEspero salgan a correr pronto.\\n\r\n\u00a1Nos leemos! \\n\\n",

            "content": "Spoilers\r\nI've watched plenty of sports anime in my life. To name a few, there's Haikyuu, Kuroko no Basket, Diamond No Ace, All Out, and Eyeshield 21. With every sports anime that comes, there was always the same sort of formula. Unrealistic \"superpowers\", a character talking in his head for a solid 20 seconds that add up to 2 seconds in \"real time\", and a main character with one overpowered ability that came in clutch. Coming into Kaze ga Tsuyoku, I expected more or less the same. An anime that would not, in any way, represent how it's like to actually play the sport, and somesort of impossible win where the small fry school somehow ends up beating the number one team for 20 years or something like that. \\n\\n\r\nWell, I was presently surprised. \\n\\n\r\nIn Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, you start off with what appears to be your main character, Kakeru. Kakeru seems to have been an extreme track athlete in the past, but stopped running due to some traumatic experience. This sort of character isn't unheard of in sports anime, and they usually end up regaining their will to play the sport after their teammates call out his name really loudly or something like that. \\n\\n\r\nInstead, we see Kakeru stagnating. We see the true struggle of an already proven athlete, which was the feeling that you couldn't get any better than you already were. We go through his struggles in trying to get better at running, and his dilemma where no matter how hard he practices, he always gets the same time over and over again. We see him develop not only as a runner, but also as a character, person, and teammate. Watching Kakeru grow was something special, something that no other sports anime managed to show. \\n\\n\r\nThe real beauty of this anime, however, is the fact that it never focuses solely on Kakeru. While Kakeru was the best runner, the star on the team, the man under the spotlight, the anime chooses to give his nine other teammates the exact same attention that they gave him. \\n\\n\r\nWe see Musa's struggle, being an African exchange student as an Engineering student, despite most African exchange students being runners and the adversity he faces. We see Prince's unwillingness to grow and become a runner, and eventually growing the most as a runner from everyone in the group. We see the twin's struggle in figuring out what the purpose of running was if they couldn't even beat the other top colleges. We see Akihiro's desperate pleas to get his weight down, to even resorting to outright skipping daily meals to make sure he isn't the anchor dragging down the team. We see King, probably the most relatable character, who's just trying to get by while also wondering what the purpose of his life was. Shindo, the guy who gave up his girlfriend for running, the guy who always seemed to be the most constant and reliable teammate, and how in all irony it would be him that would put the team in most jeopardy. And finally we see Haiji, who despite not knowing what his purpose in running was, banded a team of 10 misfits, most who have never ran in their lives, and brought out the goal to reach the biggest college marathon in Japan. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had any regrets with this anime, it would be how little attention they gave to Yukihiko. It was apparent that he had problems with his family and was apprehensive on why he had to run, but the anime scarcely talked about it besides a couple of scenes, and the last part during his section. \\n\\n\r\nKaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru is the first sports anime I've ever watched where the main character's team didn't get first, and weren't disappointed. They had received 10th place out of 20, and the team celebrated like they had gotten first. Hell, them getting 10th was probably more of an achievement then to whoever got first. \\n\\n\r\nI never thought that a sports anime could be a masterpiece. Before this, a sports anime was at most, slightly memorable and at worst, completely forgettable. This anime, however, is gonna stick in my heart for a pretty long time. \\n",

            "content": "\"Do you like running?\"\r\nRun with the wind is a sports anime about a group of University students forming a team to enter the Hakone Ekiden. I'm going to keep this review short  and as spoiler free as possible.\r\nStory- (7/10):\r\nIt's a simple story, nothing special. It's offers a nice change of pace from your typical sports anime considering the characters are college students and their goal isn't to be the number 1 school team, but simply run in Hakone. \r\nCharacters- (8/10):\r\nThe crux of this show is the characters. If you're not connected to the characters then this show probably won't be for you. We spenda lot of time with our main cast watching them grow as runners while deal with their own personal issues e.g. Kakeru's traumatic past, King's struggle to find a job, Nico rediscovering his love for running. A lot of the character stories are relatable and makes you want to root for them, especially Prince. The character interactions are great and everyone gets an ample of screen time. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I think some of the characters could have been better developed e.g. Sasaki, who's Kakeru's old team mate is a dick with no redeeming qualities. Fujiwara who's the top runner is pretty bland as a character. There's no focus on anyone else in their school teams aside from those two characters. The coach does next to nothing for most of the show. Hina is kinda of the manager, but doesn't really have any depth besides being the supportive cute girl. Also, the twins comedic relief is a bit annoying. \\n\\n\r\nThe drama and conflicts could have been handled better too e.g. Haiji gets away easily for persauding everyone to join the team. Kakeru's rivalry with Sasaki and  the reason Sasaki acts like a dick is petty. King having no other option to get a job so he runs with the team is unrealistic. One of the members of the getting sick right before the race had no foreshadowing. However, my main problem with the show is you need to suspend disbelief at times. Aside from Kakeru and Haiji, the team consists of a group of rookies trying to enter Hakone in a couple of months compared to elite runners who have probably been running their whole lives. I can suspend disbelief for most of the team because it\u2019s a sports anime despite it being illogical for them being able to compete, however Prince throws logic out the window. Prince is a otaku who reads manga and can't run to save his life. I like him, but under no circumstances would he realistically be able to qualify, let alone run in Hakone. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Sound- (7/10):\\n\r\nThe animation is fine for the most part, though it does get derpy at times. The opening and ending is great.\\n\\n\r\nOveral- (8/10);\\n\r\nRun with wind is a good sports anime. It's motivational and has beautiful messages. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys running.",

            "content": "Ahh, I finally get to review one of my favourites of the season. My mate and I loved watching this weekly and discussing it at university, the quick message of: 'it's out!' honestly brought joy to my Tuesday! \r\nStory, 7: The story is your standard underdog sports anime. 10 people from different backgrounds and different interests are roped into joining the running club. The story is nothing special... but it also does nothing wrong either; it simply enjoyable. The pacing is fantastic with potentially too much backstory, but with 23 episodes, I think it gets away with it. \r\nFor once, the anime is set ina university, so the themes and issues dealt with tend to be more mature and allowed me to sympathise with it more as I am in university.\\n\\n\r\nArt, 7: Again, the art is your standard sports anime, there is nothing distinctly different about the art style. In parts, the running animation is a bit janky, but this rarely detracts from the actual races. The crowds and backgrounds are all drawn to a high standard. \\n\\n\r\nSounds, 7: I liked both the ops and ending songs from each season. The ost is nothing special but serves it's purpose well. The sound design for the races and voice acting is faultless but not amazing either. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter, 10: The most special attribute of this anime is definitely the characters. They are the reason I continued to watch every week. Each character feels real, they are not archetypes stuffed into a 2 dimension drawing. Each character has their own merits and personality, some quite surprising to see in anime. The character design is flawless. I will say the typical antagonist, and rival runner could have been developed more, but it was very cool to see an African character be portrayed in a very positive light. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 8: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, sure it is not the best sports anime I have ever watched, but is does the fundamentals well. It is just a sweet and endearing anime, with a nice overall message. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.",

Then, when this anime aired, after watching the first few episodes, i straight away started running again as I was inspired by this anime and that it teaches us to never give up (and to also run with friends cuz its more fun). I would definitely recommend this anime to people who'd want to change theirlife by running cuz it will make you want to go for a run when ur lazy like me ;p",

            "content": "Running has been one of my favourite hobbys, since i know myself as a person. It's excelent to see an anime like this, with excelent opinions from people, even from those who don't like running, or any kind of sports...Btw, this is the first review that i do. Please don't judge me...\r\n--- Story - 9/10 ---\r\nSince i started my journey in this anime and manga world, i have to admit that this is my first running genre anime/manga that i see... It's curious, because an hobby or sport that millions of people like, doesn't have too much works on this industry. So, it's great tosee this type of innovation. I don't think that this anime has a 10/10 story yet, because some characters aren't developed enough (at least until epsiode 9.\\n\\n\r\n--- Art - 10/10 ---\\n\\n\r\nEven if you hate this anime, you have to admit that it's art is just outstanding, or perfect ! The Fall 2018 season has a severall of animes that have beautiful arts, but this, in my opinion, is on of the bests, or even the best in this topic, specialy when they are running ! They're movements are sweet, and we can see how much work the designers have putten in this animation, even if some moments they're design is super simple...\\n\\n\r\n--- Sound - 9/10 ---\\n\\n\r\nWell, i don't have much to say about this topic, so i won't take much long talking about it. The Ending it's just beautiful, with an simple song and animation, that combines to a super 1:30 min of pure enjoyment. The transition it's simple, and the Opening is beautiful aswell...\\n\\n\r\n--- Character - 9/10 ---\\n\\n\r\nThe reason that i gave a 9 to the character topic is because, at least until Ep.9, some characters haven't yet been developed, as much as Akihiro, Kurahara or Haiji, that we already know their past problems, present issues and future projects. King, the twins and Yukihiro are characters that haven't been much developed, but we already know their present situation, aswell some problems. But, we haven't seen nothing from some characters, like Musa, Takashi or Akane, and that's a problem that i believe will be resolved, soon enough. \\n\\n\r\n--- Enjoyment - 10/10 ---\\n\\n\r\nIn this topic, i will talk about my enjoyment, as a person who runs 4-5 times a week, and just loves this sports, even if i don't compet. As the story develops more and more, we get to know the athletes' issues, such as physical problems, or social problems. We can see aswell they're routine, specially in they're hardest moments, like Akane' issues with his new life, King's problem with getting or not getting a job, and the most recent one, Haiji's health, that looks weak. With all of this topics that the anime shows us, we can get into this new running world, and even enter ''their'' world, getting worried(at least me), with this new Haiji's health problem.\\n\\n\r\n--- Overall - 9/10 ---\\n\\n\r\nWell, with 3 9/10, and 2 10/10 evaluations, i guess it is fair to give a 9/10 in the overall, but that doesn't meen that is going to be 9/10 until the final episode. The anime can solve all the minor problems that i presented in this review, but can aswell ruin the anime with nonsense moments, or bad animation... I speak this because i haven't read the manga, thing that i will do when the anime end, so if you already have read it, please don't give spoilers for me, or for anyone else.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat's it guys, maybe this review it's not big thing, but, as i was writting this review, i was kinda developing even more knowledge about Kaze Ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, and developing aswell my english vocabulary. This is my first review, i hope that i didn't messed up on it :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There will be light spoilers in the review, so if you haven't finished the series yet do take care.\r\nSTORY\r\nRun With The Wind is adapted from a novel rather than a manga, and as a result the overall story writing is on a different level to pretty much every other sports anime - the only sports series that competes out of the ones I've seen is Haikyuu. Every detail, both major and minor, that is introduced is addressed within the show's duration, meaning that when we reach the ending, we aren't sitting there thinking \"But what about that thing that happened to [character]?\". Each plot pointis neatly wrapped up with enough detail for us to be satisfied, but not so much that we're overloaded or even bored with information. The story progression is very character-centric (more on characters later), and the overall mood of the series develops and grows alongside our main character, Kakeru. Early on in the series, while he's still tense and warming up to everyone, that tension is transferred to us as viewers, who just want the gang to get along. As Kakeru's relationships with both his teammates and himself improve and he opens up, that tension gradually dissipates. That build and release of tension isn't just with Kakeru either; each character has their moments, whether it's on the race track or back at Aotake. By the time we reach the Ekiden, all that tension is released, and all that's left is for them to enjoy the fruits of the hard work we've seen them putting in. Just by reaching the Ekiden, they've already won regardless of finishing position. This freedom allows us to see the conclusion of each character's arc during their section of the marathon, and these were by far the best episodes of the show's run - we go from seeing the ten of them as one big unit to ten individuals, all running their own paths.\\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe character art was actually what got me to try the first episode of this - as a big Haikyuu fan, the familiar art style is what hooked me in. The character designs are very Haikyuu, but that's to be expected since it's Production I.G. in charge. The similarity isn't a bad thing, though, as the designs are genuinely reflective of each member's personality, and those personalities are unique enough that you completely forget about the Haikyuu lookalike thing. The backdrops and scene designs were all very good as well, with some stunning scenery in the \"woodlands training arc\" section. The running animations were all very well done too, but the most outstanding work on this front was the \"Zone\" style running, where we see vivid visualisations of a runner's high. Episode 22, which was probably the best of the series, made use of this runner's high to great effect and produced some stunning visuals. Other than that, everything was clean without being outstanding, and the facial expressions were very fluid and well animated. There was also a fantastic scene in Episode 4, where Kakeru is reliving tough situations in his recent past, literally running from one scene to another. The cuts and transitions in this scene were smooth, and the mixture of foggy and clear visuals evoked the feeling of being inside Kakeru's memories.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST was good without being outstanding, too - it served its most basic function as a tool for adding emotion in the right places. Openings and endings were also well done, with the second OP/ED combo being the stronger of the two - the second ending theme was probably the strongest piece of music on the soundtrack. Visually and sonically, the show falls into the \"very good\" category, with no noticeable declines in quality.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nRun With The Wind's strongest point, however, was its main cast. All ten of the main cast were well-developed, distinctive and unique characters that had magnificent chemistry. Each member had their own clear, complete arc through the series, and none of them felt neglected at any point. Whilst Kakeru and Haiji's arcs were the core which the plot revolved around, the subplots for each of the other members were given the proper time and space to breathe and develop, and ended up feeling equal in importance to the central arcs. The highlight of the show's stunning character work was re-iterated in the Ekiden \"arc\", which has considerably raised the show's MyAnimeList rating, where each character gets their moment in the spotlight as they run their section of the marathon. We spend a bit of time with each of them, finding out how running has changed them, and their reason for seeing this Ekiden thing through to the end. Each member wants to do their best for the team, but at the same time, each of them has their own motivations, and their own \"finish line\" that they're striving to reach. Whilst they're running alone, each and every one of them knows that they couldn't have got to where they are without the hard work of the other nine members of the team.\\n\r\nBut most importantly, each member of our main cast feels \"real\" - like someone that you'd actually meet at university/college. There's nothing outrageous or unrealistic about any of their personalities, struggles or motivations, and that makes them that much easier to relate with. By having a group of identifiable characters, the themes that the story presents through their struggles resonate with us that little bit more. Most of us have been through King's struggle of not being able to land a job. Most of us have been in Shindo's situation where we try and please everyone, only to lose someone important in the process. And I'd say that almost all of us have been through Kakeru's struggle of regretting something we did in the past to the point that all we want to do is run away.\\n\\n\r\nThe small supporting cast is also used to good effect, ticking all the sports anime trope boxes excellently. The most notable character of the support group is Fujioka, the captain of the running team that have won the Ekiden three years running and is Haiji's old highschool friend. Both incredibly strong and wonderfully eloquent, he provides a benchmark for Kakeru in terms of running standards, but is also somewhat of a mentor for him - his earnest support of Haiji's dream catalyses Kakeru's change in heart.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Run With the Wind is a show that starts off well without being noticeably outstanding, but improves with each episode until it delivers a finale that's one of the most gratifying of any anime across any genre - the Ekiden episodes are genuinely masterpiece quality. The show tugs on the emotions at all the right moments, and whilst it doesn't over-rely on funny moments, it knows when to use them to good effect - we don't have any major emotional moments ruined by an awkward joke (even Your Lie in April got that wrong once or twice and I consider that the \"gold standard\" for \"feelsy\" anime). There's a likeable main cast that are easy to get behind and invest in, and the problems they face and their eventual solutions to them are ones that any one of us watching can achieve.\\n\\n\r\nIt took me a while to decide on the score for this - watching a show almost weekly for 23 episodes means that events in earlier episodes can be forgotten and their quality forgotten. However, re-watching a few of those episodes re-affirmed what I'd felt at the end of the series, which is that this show is one of the standouts of its genre, and sets itself apart from its more well-known peers. Sure, it uses tropes that we now see as \"generic\", but it executes them that little bit better than the rest. After watching a few early episodes, I watched the last 2 episodes again and those confirmed what score I'd give it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I feel that Run With the Wind is a real sleeper hit from its season, and is thoroughly deserving of a 10/10.",

On the other hand, you get captivated by Haiji\u2019s hunger for running and his way of seeing people. He genuinely wants to be there with that team mates and more importantly what his own dreams are made of. Also, is interesting how Haiji sees so much potential and inspiration in Kakeru in a realistic way. It was really fun to watch how this both characters grow and change throughout the story.\r\nIt is lovelyhow you get to get attached to the personalities. I personally loved Oji and Masa besides the protagonists. The team has a good dinamic and jokes are all about real deals they are passing as they face running together and individually. The reflection of keep running as keep fighting at life is really interesting.\\n\\n\r\nKaze ga talks about motivation in different levels: when is envolving people, the past and even hope, in a light way.

The character design is so unique, and there is so many moments that have this beautiful surreal animation. \r\n - Amazing music. The music in this show is super inspiring and a lot of the time also really fun. I've listened to thisOST a bunch of times and highly recommend.\\n\\n\r\n - Interesting characters.

            "content": "In this world there are two types of sports anime. The first is the one in which the main character is a genius who excels in all aspects of the game and the rest of the cast is just there trying not to become a liability. The second type is when the main character is a complete and utter noob who just crawled out from underneath their rock trying their best not to be a liability to their more experienced upperclassmen. However there also exists a little known third type in the sports anime world. This rare third type is called Run With The Wind.\\n\\n\r\nRun With The Wind certainly came as a surprise to me. All I knew was that it was being made by Production IG, a studio known for making good sports anime. This was the only reason why I decided to watch this. Soon I had another reason to watch it, the story. As I explained above the thing that makes Run With The Wind a rarity is that it\u2019s realistic. When you try a sport for the first time, you are not going to be a master at it. If you want to get good, you have to work hard and practice repetitively. What I like about Run With The Wind is it takes an accessible sport like running which pretty much anyone can do and gives our characters a realistic yet seemingly unattainable goal. Run a marathon. Naturally our characters laugh it off as impossible, but through determination and consistent practice, they build their bodies and minds to get to that point where they are race ready. Now this is where the third type is relevant again. Normally when characters go through a training arc they exude this dominance as if they could take on the world and win. Run With The Wind gets our characters to their first goal but then throws reality in their face. They must compete with other athletes who have dedicated their lives to running. Naturally they perform as expected. This sets the stage for even more grueling hard work and physical exertion getting them ready to face their ultimate test. When they get there it delivers. That\u2019s all I will say on that so as to not head down spoiler alley. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show is something I have to mention as this show features a large cast of at least a dozen or so relevant characters. Not uncommon for a sports anime yet the way Run With The Wind goes about developing them is something I have to applaud. First off, they are in college. Bravo to a non high school setting. Second I found all of them to be pretty like able. Everyone plays off of each other really well. When it comes to running, naturally not everyone is going to be good at it, and it takes a while for them to even get passable. What I like about them though is as I said before, they are realistic. Every character has some sort of baggage slowing them down whether it be mental or physical and they must work with each other to overcome it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is pretty good. Once again this was made by Production IG who are known for some good looking sports anime and Run With The Wind continues that trend. There is some cgi used during the races but it doesn\u2019t look bad nor does it detract from the viewing experience. All of the openings and endings are good with the openings setting the pace nicely no pun intended and the endings calming down our excitement levels giving us a chance to breathe. Together the animation and sound create some breathtakingly beautiful scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed Run With The Wind. It was probably the most realistic sports anime that I have ever seen. It was an absolute joy to watch and I highly recommend checking it out.",

If you want to feel those emotions again, definitely watch this.\r\nStory -- 8/10\r\nRight, it's an alright story. There's nothing really that outstanding or special from it but I enjoyed it. However, I do like the fact that it builds up overtime, as in where people don't improve dramatically over just one episode. If you like the slow building of motivation, this story has definitely got you hooked.\r\nArt -- 9/10\r\nPretty good art overall, the drawers really did one. This one is prettyrelevant to other animes, but really everything is consistent and there's never something bugging you. \\n\\n\r\nSound -- 10/10\\n\r\nThe music during this anime was amazing, it was a really chill-laxed music that gave motivation to me. Especially during the build up parts, it really did its job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -- 9/10\\n\r\nThere's a few weak links in their \"team\" but overall you get the gist of the characters. They're not weakly developed, it's pretty solid overall. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -- 10/10\\n\r\nThis may come to change as it's still ongoing, but I really enjoyed this ongoing anime. I laughed, felt motivated, and really got in the feels for this one. \\n\\n\r\nPretty good overall, give it a try.",

He is talented but troubled and one day meets the injured yet earnest Haiji. The two make up a team of 10 quirky/lovable individuals who in a twist of fate decide to band together in an attempt to qualify for a relay marathon.\r\nArt: 9  \r\nis sharp and clean from thehouse of Production IG (Haikyu!!) \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nearly on I was especially drawn to its soundtrack. Yuki Hayashi of My Hero Academia scored it. i want to get my hands on it! also for voice actors, they are all great. Haku's VA from spirited away voices!! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 \\n\\n\r\nhonestly never felt so bonded to a group so quick, just watch you'll see. akane, the manga fanboi, will steal your heart!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\\n\r\nlets just say I caught up on all 10 episodes in lighting time so I could start watching the simulcasts. thoroughly enjoying my time with this anime!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nI would perhaps offer up a 10 but Kaze ga is only half way through its season and 10s are not to be taken lightly.\\n\\n\r\nSide note: Kaze ga is adapted from the novel \"Feel the Wind\" by acclaimed Japanese female author Shion Miura. She also wrote \"The Great Passage\" and a collection of essays about how Yaoi Manga is not just a hobby.\\n\\n\r\nNow go watch it friends!!!! <33",

            "content": "WARNING: As this anime currently is still airing, my opinion might change later on.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\n\"A guy who has experienced some trauma suddenly saved by a group of friends.\" \r\nCliche, right?\r\nWell, I don't think main plot is the strongest point of this series, anyway. \r\nBut I have to admit the college setting instead of the usual high school setting is refreshing. That, and the end-goal of the club members that isn't winning the competition (like usual sport anime), instead they just aim to be able to enter competition together, as a whole team. I think it's interesting to see if this series will focus more onthe slow developing of friendship or the improvements of the club members trainings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is probably one of very FEW anime that I love for its characterization instead of its plot story. As I've said, (in my opinion) the plot isn't the strongest point. But its characterization IS.\\n\r\nOne of the two MCs, Haiji, isn't your usual optimistic naive lead character. Though outwardly appear quite optimistic, he still has his doubts, but doing his best to not dwelling on it in order to keep moving forward towards his goal. As you've expected, he's quite the persistent character. Not only in his training, but also in getting (and manipulating) every person that he needs in order to make his goal a reality.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Kakeru, as the guy with traumatic past here, is quite stubborn and not easily swayed by sweet words from caring friends. BUT what I love most about this character is that he doesn't try to run (no pun intended) from his problems, but instead acknowledge it as a bitter experience. He still can't forgive his past and he's made it known, but despite everything he's still doing what he loves because he simply loves it, and doesn't try to hide that fact.\\n\r\nThe other club members has their own interesting personalities. From the manga-obsessed, physically-weak Ouji, that somehow got roped into running, to the nicotine addict, seemingly unmotivated guy, Nico-chan, this series gave its side characters a time to shine on their own and a chance for the viewers to understand the side characters' point of views. And that, in my opinion, is the most AWESOME part of this series. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nNothing great, nothing bad either. The art-style isn't exactly what I preferred, but if you like realistic-looking anime then you'll like this one.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe voice of each character fits their personality. The soundtracks suit the moods. The opening theme's good, the ending's lovely. Yep. I've got no complaint about the sound.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm going to give it 8 for now. It's an enjoyable ride up until now. And as I've said at the beginning, my opinion might change as time goes.",

The first 4 episodes are fairly repetitive as the plot is just running, but after episode 4 they start to actually race versus others. The main plot is to get a team of random college kids to be able to qualify for the Hakone Ekiden race. None of them were runners but 3. It's fairly interesting.\r\nArt 10\r\nVery good and consistant art. It works well with the running aspect. The styles are very simple, but work well.\r\nSound 8\r\nThe sound is fine, but nothing really special that setsit apart from other animes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\r\nThey use basic tropes for characters, but actually managed to seperate their characters. The main character is really relatable because of how they portray him. He usually isn't the one doing the talking and sits in the back, but is the fastest runner of their group. You can tell he always has something he wants to say, but doesn't want to hurt others.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nI'm bias towards sports animes, and I went into this thinking it'd be \"decent\", but it's one of my favorite animes I've seen in years.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10\\n\r\nI'm bias and I love it.",

By watching this anime I've opened my mind by understanding how people can love it. \r\nIt starts off slow paste, and takes a while before we get to see any competition. A lot of scenes are light hearted, nothing emotionally draining, which is partly why I continued watching it. \r\nI ended up really appreciating the anime for it's lightness and it's depth of meaning. Later on, it got really good. When they run, we get to hear their internal dialogue as theytalk about what running means to them, why they do it in the first place. The protagonist's character develops well in both maturity and changing his mindset on running. And the ending itself, was a very satisfying one. It touches on what people go through when they have to leave their sport for whatever reason. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the message is that nothing lasts forever, but the time you have with your teammates chasing a goal is priceless.",

            "content": "\"Do you like running?\" And so begins Kaze Ga, I could easily compare this show with Haikyuu !! But I think it would be unfair, after all Kaze has a brilliance of his own, the characters are as diverse in so many ways, but at the same time as the Prince (Ouji) presents sleeves to Kakeru, until that time they were people who form some would get along. Not only do they, but like all the other characters are iconic, it's easy to like everyone, even the twins who seemed to be just comic relief manage to bring in questioning and content for the anime.Personally, my favorite character is undoubtedly Haiji, the guy who managed to gather so many different characters and made them run in the marathon with persuasion and light threats. Production I.G did not disappoint in the anime look, it is so beautiful and fluid. Another important point is the development of all the characters, I repeat, from everyone, from quitting smoking, the job you want to follow, an improvement in family relationships to a life goal. If you have not already watched Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru is missing a great anime. So I'll ask you again: Do you like to running? (I apologize for my spelling mistakes)\\n\\n\r\n(PT-Br) \"Voc\u00ea gosta de correr?\" E assim come\u00e7a Kaze Ga, eu podia facilmente comparar esse show com Haikyuu!! Mas acho que estaria sendo injusto, afinal Kaze tem um brilho pr\u00f3prio, os personagens s\u00e3o divergentes de tantas formas, mas ao mesmo tempo t\u00e3o iguais, como quando o Pr\u00edncipe (Ouji) apresenta mangas ao Kakeru, at\u00e9 aquele momento eles eram pessoas que de forma alguma se dariam bem. N\u00e3o s\u00f3 eles, mas como todos os outros personagens s\u00e3o ic\u00f4nicos, \u00e9 f\u00e1cil gostar de todos, at\u00e9 o s g\u00eameos que pareciam ser s\u00f3 alivio c\u00f4mico conseguem trazer questionamentos e conte\u00fado para o anime. Pessoalmente, minha personagem favorito \u00e9 sem d\u00favidas, Haiji, o cara o qual conseguiu reunir tantas personagens diferentes e os fez correr na maratona com persuas\u00e3o e leves amea\u00e7as. Production I.G n\u00e3o decepcionou no visual do anime, \u00e9 t\u00e3o bonito e fluido. Outro ponto importante \u00e9 o desenvolvimento de todos os personagens, repito, de todos, desde parar de fumar, o emprego que quer seguir, uma melhora no relacionamento familiar at\u00e9 um objetivo de vida. Se voc\u00ea ainda n\u00e3o assistiu Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru est\u00e1 perdendo um grande anime. Ent\u00e3o vou te perguntar de novo: Voc\u00ea gosta de correr?",

The final race had me welling up for the last three episodes, and the ending set 3 years later is a beautiful ending to a beautiful story.\\n\\n\r\nThe best show of 2019 so far me, and most likely 2018 as well, even if you aren't a fan of sports anime (i certainly wasn't) please give this a try, and hopefully feel the same enjoyment that i did.",

            "content": "This show was something special. It even me me want to run.\r\nStory 10 -- The story was overall pretty predictable, but it was executed so well. The stakes were always clear and I cared about it because the characters cared about it. I think this story finally had an interesting take on the classic sports anime question of nature v nurture or more specifically natural talent v practice. This and Ping Pong are the only shows I can think of that actually engage with that idea in a satisfying and interesting way. The story fulfills all the goals it sets out to at the beginningand completes them all well. Luckily, this show doesn't feel the need to take an episode to solve every single problem it introduces like Yuki's home situation and King's job hunt. Both of these problems are dealt with to different degrees, but the solution is brief and in King's case off-screen, providing time to work with the most important story elements. This is apparently characteristic of Shion Miura who also authored \"The Great Passage,\" but the adaptation is also to be praised for putting the story into this format.\\n\r\nArt 8 -- This show lived in its backgrounds. The beautiful vistas really sold the appeal of running every time they showed up. That said, the animation itself was generally excellent considering the monotonous kinds of movements the characters were producing. There were a few moments of awesome character movement which really paid off emotionally and visually like Haiji's biking scene at the very beginning of the show. The character designs were awesome and expressive, showing exactly who the characters were before they delivered any lines. I believe that the character designer Takahiro Chiba was influenced quite heavily by his work as animation director on both \"Haikyuu!!\" and \"Welcome to the Ballroom\" which also have great character designs. The only reason this category is losing points is because of some strange animation errors in the last third of the show. I remember in particular Musa going far off model for a good part of Ep. 20.\\n\r\nSound 10 -- The music being excellent should be no surprise considering Yuuki Hayashi's previous work, including works like \"Kiznaiver,\" \"Death Parade,\" and the \"My Hero Academia\" franchise. The score did everything it needed to and helped the payoffs hit even harder. The voice acting throughout was excellent. Ootsuka Takeo led the cast as Kakeru and provided an amazing performance which developed with the character in beautiful form. Worth noting is the fact that Ootsuka is nearly brand new to the VA industry and it is not noticeable in the least. Another interesting fact that I never realized while watching is that the seiyuus for Jota and Joji are two people, Enoki Junya and Uemura Yuuto respectively, but I couldn't tell them apart. \\n\r\nCharacter 10 -- The characters were the story and since the story was strong, so were they. A good percentage of this show was a character study and each of the cast was fleshed out a great deal and were realistic, grounded people. The whole cast had real motivations that fed directly into their actions and this agreement of ideas really helped both parties. The attention to making characters real came out in spades with Sakaki. He was a very difficult to like character for the entirety of the series, but even though I didn't want to see him succeed, I understood why he was the pain the neck he was. Finally, these characters interacted so well. They were thrown into different kinds of situations and every time they related in a way that was true to themselves and was entertaining to watch. I especially loved how the character dynamics changed as the series progressed. The best example of this is Kurahara and Prince's relationship. Watching their first interactions v their final episodes is night and day. All that said, Nira is such a good girl and her midcards give me life.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10 -- This show worked for me in every way. All the things it promised at the beginning of the show were delivered and I was always invested in whatever my boys were doing. The show knew how to deliver a payoff and while the journey matters more than the destination, the destination was pretty darn beautiful as well.\\n\r\nOverall 10 -- I cannot recommend this show enough. The only reason I would steer you away is if you have a hard time empathizing with animated characters as this show is never about the spectacle, but the people who are part of it. This came from a director(Kazuya Nomura) with few things I like and a script writer(Kohei Kiyasu) who is new to the market, but they pulled together a story that I loved for every second.",

            "content": "Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru is a strange and lovely creature, always moving elegantly forward, never missing a step or faltering in its pace. Its best attribute is its maturity compared to the shonen screaming of most other sports anime, but I feel like that also takes from it a certain energy or je ne sais quois (compared to, for example, Prod. IG's own Haikyuu), which is maybe its only real flaw.\r\nKazeTsuyo starts with one of the best first episodes I've seen, unafraid to play around with nonlinear narrative and doing so effectively, but the rest of the series refuses to take risks in terms ofnarrative and cliche. KazeTsuyo sucks at creating tension from competition itself, but really isn't trying to do so -- long-distance running, of course, is not the most exciting of sports, a fact that probably turned many fans away from the series. But what KazeTsuyo understands better than most sports anime is that drama and emotion need to be inculcated during the non-sport moments to make the competitions meaningful, that the context and milieu of the team's races is the best tool in a sports anime's arsenal and not, as so many other series have opted for, weaponized backstories delivered just before the finish line. This lets races be mercifully short -- an episode long at most. The actual backbone of the series is fairly cliche: underdog sports team blah blah blah training hard blah blah rival blah success. If you want an original story, look elsewhere; sports isn't really where you'll ever find that anyway. But KazeTsuyo does atypical things within that typical story, and that is where its strength lies.\\n\\n\r\nThe real surprise was the animation quality. Production IG have always been capable of great things visually, but are inconsistent at times. I've always felt that too few of their titles actually get the TLC they need and end up looking fairly samey as a result. Not so with this one. Among anime that aren't going for distinctive styles or art direction (and weren't made by KyoAni), Kazetsuyo is among prettiest ever made. This is especially apparent in the forest in eps 12 & 13 and with the qualifier in ep 16; you have to see this stuff to believe it. Sound quality is good but the music is outstanding. Each track balances well with the scene it serves, and if any song repeated during the entire series, I didn't notice it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is extremely important in sports anime, and KazeTsuyo realizes this, giving us ten-plus characters, each with a fair quantity of depth and with none (save perhaps the twins) falling into cliche territory. Haiji is one of the most deeply original and intriguing characters in recent memory; I can't think of another character in any anime that I watched as intently as I watched him whenever he was on screen. Toyonaga Toshiyuki did an amazing job bringing this character such a unique blend of vigor, mischief, and general hardassery. Our protag Kakeru starts out generically angsty (a la Haru or Kageyama), but the gradual revelation of his backstory slowly builds him into something significantly better. His flashback in episode 13 is the most shockingly good moment in the entire series -- masterfully handled, with audiovisual static and color that fades as it progresses, only to shock back to reality at the pivotal moment.\\n\\n\r\nKazeTsuyo is a series a lot of people slept on these past two seasons, and to their detriment. It lies on the border between very good anime and art, and fully deserves its current spot on MAL as one of the best sports anime in recent memory. In fact, it's somewhat restored my faith in the genre itself, after several years of forgettable series since the debut of Haikyuu and YowaPeda. If you're even tangentially interested in sports, or just want a good character-driven story, give this one a chance -- it's a series that will give you a run for your money.",

            "content": "In summary, a character-driven sports drama about runners. I'm a runner myself so I'm probably more biased than other reviewers in my \r\nThis anime's primary strength is managing to balance the solitary aspects of running by using the Hakone Ekiden to justify the formation of a team. Yet, within that team, are 10 distinct and developed characters that feel real and genuine. While most of the focus is on running prodigy Kakeru and master-of-psychology Haiji, every member of the running team is given sufficient screentime to explore their motivations and what drives them all to do something as crazy as running the Hakone Ekiden.\r\nAlong thejourney, the show explores such questions as \"What is running as a sport?\", \"Do runners compete for themselves or for the prize?\", \"Should sports be limited to only the elite?\" and \"Why the hell do runners do this to themselves?\" It never answers them fully, but it does provide possible answers that gave me something to ponder.\\n\\n\r\nThis show's other major strength is in creating dramatic tension. By investing me in the characters, it made me care about their journey. The small human-scale stakes of whether or not the running team will get anywhere are more understandable than world-shaking fantasy battles where civilization itself is on the line. I found myself white-knuckled in more than one episode wondering if a quirk of fate or just being out-classed was going to end this team's dreams forever.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a great anime for anyone who's ever had a dumb idea that someone told you was impossible or for any runner questioning why the hell they put themselves through training when they could be taking a nap.",

            "content": "\"You can't go back in time... Sometimes it makes me sad, but that's...\" - Episode 23*\r\nSTORY\r\nI have a pleasant relationship with Kaze ga. It reminds me of coming home from school as a kid and turning on the TV to watch the latest episode of an afternoon cartoon. Only this time, it's coming home from work on a Tuesday evening and opening up Crunchyroll to watch a bunch of cute boys running around in jerseys. And this time, you see part of yourself in some of the cute boys as well (even though you're actually not a cute boy). There are only a couple seriesthat I can say I'll genuinely miss. And in the case of Kaze ga, you do emerge with the realization that your Tuesday evenings will now be noticeably emptier.\\n\\n\r\nWhat sets Kaze ga apart from anime like Free!, and puts it in the same realm as Cross Game, is its characters. More specifically, it's in the patience and calm surrounding these characters. Yeah you have cute boys doing cute things, like living together and bathing together and sweating in unison together, but the anime spends less time focusing on the sheer physicality and athleticism required in running, and more time on the subtle, but earnest improvements in each character's attitude and lifestyle. The college town the story takes place in is pleasant, idyllic; there's not too much exposition in the script; and the focus of the story, beyond the Haikyuu-esque art style, is in the quiet way each character pursues their individual goals, while wrestling with the important role that running eventually assumes in their life. At the root of all sports anime is the power of friendship and teamwork, and Kaze ga doesn't reject this. But its narrative surrounding friendship is pretty refreshing, though it is romanticized to a certain degree.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\\n\r\nSpectating a marathon can only get so exciting, so Kaze ga is very much character focused. But the show takes advantage of that; some of the most memorable scenes are of the characters spending time together outside of running, and conversing with each other over topics that have nothing to do with sports to the backdrop of beautiful golden hour scenery. The characters themselves steer clear from sports anime tropes. They're all cute boys, but not overly quirky and blatantly written to be fujoshi/fanfic material. They live fulfilling lives outside of running and outside of each other. You quietly support Prince and his manga addiction, and King as he job hunts and gingerly navigates through college life, Nico-senpai as he goes cold turkey, and Haiji in the kitchen as he carefully cooks the most well-balanced meals ever. Much of the show focuses on these scenes of solitude and wholesome as fuck, slice of life tasks.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the best-written character of all is Musa, an African exchange student who becomes the kindest and most supportive wingman for all the other characters. He may also be the only one with a truly fleshed out personality, while subverting typical Eastern stereotypes surrounding dark-skinned people. Which is cool. The only thing I'm still iffy about is Kakeru himself, as well his relationship with Haiji. Both fall flat, and Kakeru's character development relies too much on cheese. There was a bit of cheese towards the end of the last episode that sort of ruined the ending for me a bit...? The romanticized nature of the series can be too much at times, but only briefly.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nI have no complaints. Yuuki Hayashi composed the score, so you know it's real good, and the score plays such a huge role. It makes up, like, 80% of the emotional weight of each emotionally charged scene. The main theme, \"We Must Go,\" is surprisingly ambient and melodic, sort of like a more orchestral version of \"You Can Become a Hero\" from MHA (and better imo), and he builds on it throughout the entire OST. The style is truly quiet and soothing, something that encourages self-reflection and such--something I wasn't really expecting at all in a sports anime. This, along with the beyond soothing voice of Toshi Toyonaga as Haiji, rounds out Kaze ga's ability to steer you away from focusing on cute boys sweating in unison (at least all the time) to the main themes surrounding running & life that the show sets out to communicate. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished the last season of Kuroko no Basuke, I teared up because I'd binged all the episodes in the span of 2 weeks and therefore felt emotionally attached in some way. I'd spent literally, like, 100+ continuous hours with them (it was winter break of college, so like), so I teared up out of happiness for them as a team and their achievements, and nothing else. The characters of Kaze ga strike more of a chord. At the end, you realize you're not only leaving behind the world of Kansei and the Hakone Ekiden, but also a group of characters who can exist outside of the sport that they are a part of. So...you know, it's almost like you're saying goodbye to a friend. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n*My fave quote from the anime, and also super relatable. Kakeru will never experience what he experienced throughout the course of the series ever again, and it IS sad, but it's not something to linger on because it was an experience that needed to have occurred in order to propel everyone forward in life in a positive direction, BECAUSE RUNNING",

            "content": "After watching the first episode of this anime, I knew that I was likely to enjoy it for my own personal reasons, however, I did not expect it to be truly one of the most inspiring, heartbreaking, motivational and beautiful anime I have seen up until this day. Being the sports-anime loving fanatic that I am, I was excited for this anime to air because it involved the sport that I have dedicated my life to: running (long-distance running, specifically). I am a long-distance runner who ran cross country, indoor/outdoor track throughout high school and am currently continuing my running career at college. Needless tosay, I love it, and this anime captures the pain, confusion, and desire to run perfectly all together in one place. My relatability to the character\u2019s emotions, thought processes, and competitive spirit was all too real. Not only did the show capture beautifully the mystery behind \u201cwhy we run\u201d, it succeeds in telling a heart warming, moving story about ten characters, all fighting with their own personal struggles and coming together to run the Hakone Ekiden, finding their own reasons as to why they run in the process.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOriginal and executed with hardly any flaws. The story was unique in comparison to other sports anime I\u2019ve seen. For instance, it takes place at university while a majority of sports anime takes place in highschool. This is interesting in the sense that you get to see characters throughout the anime deal with more serious and relatable life issues (for example, King\u2019s struggle to obtain a job) or characters dealing with the lack of communication they have with their parents. Other than this, the story flowed and never felt awkwardly or oddly paced. The gradual development from a team of characters who mostly have never ran before to running at the highly esteemed Hakone Ekiden was remarkable to watch. I was brought to tears, laughed, felt anger, and every emotion at several different points. This anime takes the concept of running and makes it complex and admirable simultaneously. Memorable and well-written, this is a story that you want to invest in.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are all unique from one another and I feel that the art is really well done. With this, the animation is fluid, I loved watching the characters race, the way every member had their own running form and the different angles they showed made it interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this anime is lovely. The music emphasizes certain scenes and pokes at your emotions as you watch certain moments. The soundtrack definitely has an impact in heightening every type of scene in the anime you could imagine whether it be intense, sad, anger, excitement, or even humorous. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of if not the highlight of this anime. Every single character is incredibly unique and diverse. Even the twins, who may seem to be indistinguishable, have different desires and wants as revealed later on within the anime. I love how this anime made sure to showcase every character and their backstory. At first, you find yourself questioning why certain characters act in a certain way, but the anime makes sure to reveal the character's motivations in a seamless, beautiful way. Every character is likeable and I am able to empathize/sympathize with them. Seeing the character development, especially in the main character, Kakeru, made this anime all the more wonderful. With this, the characters are realistic, and this is especially noted in each of their backstories. Every character had a reason to run, and finding that reason lead to them confront their flaws and insecurities \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI was always at the edge of my seat by the end of every episode as it aired, wanting more and awaiting for Tuesday to come. I never felt bored or disinterested, the characters and plot line always kept the anime moving and I always found myself craving more. The excitement from watching the characters race and interact with one another brought a great deal of enjoyment to me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nOne of if not the best anime I have watched. As mentioned beforehand, being a runner myself really connected me to this anime. I always ask myself the same questions: \u201cwhy do I run?\u201d \u201cwhy am I making myself go through this pain when I don\u2019t have to?\u201d As Haji says within the anime \u201cI\u2019m still looking for that answer.\u201d Running has changed my life for so many reasons, and in the anime, running does the same for the characters. Even if you despise running, Kaze Ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru will tear at your heart strings and make you want to experience and find your own reason as to why you may \"run\" too. Truly, I wish more people knew about this anime and how captivating it is, it is definitely worth watching.\\n",

            "content": "Being a part of something greater can bring purpose to your own life, or at least change your perspective on life in some way. When the residents of Chikuseisou initially starting living at the run-down dorm for cheap a majority of them were aimless college students, but through their begrudging acceptance of running with the ultimate goal of running the Haikoden in mind they all began to change for the better. \r\nThe first two thirds of Run with the Wind builds the bonds between the members of the team, and really pushed them to their limits. It was a long and tiring buildup but theway it pays off with each character getting their own arcs wrapped up one by one is like an emotional rollercoaster. You get to experience their runner\u2019s high from the comfort of your home, what could be better than that?\\n\\n\r\nThe show does a fine enough job in the animation department, but I would say that some of the visual choices are used a bit too often, like when Kakeru becomes one with ...running?, but while the visual choice can be a little off putting it didn\u2019t really negatively impact the enjoyment you get from watching him destroy the competition. Some of the landscapes are pretty noticeable as photos that had a few filters put over them, but they mesh well enough with the 2D characters. The music for the most part helps to amplify the emotions of each scene, but doesn\u2019t stand out enough to either take you out of the viewing experience or really capture your attention with its excellence. I would however say that the second opening is a bit too shounen sounding, and wasn\u2019t really the best choice for setting the mood for the episode to follow.\\n\\n\r\nWhile, I\u2019m not head over heels for the technical aspects of Run with the Wind, I do love the characters, and the bond that they were able to forge through the 23 episodes. Run with the Wind isn\u2019t the typical hype sports anime with teeth clenching tournament matches, but it\u2019s slow burn pace with great character development pays off in spades during the show\u2019s final arc. I feel like some would be turned off by the show\u2019s pace, but it\u2019s what necessary for the incredible catharsis it will eventually deliver. Run with the Wind ran away with the title of best anime of the Fall 2018 season in my book, and it definitely shouldn\u2019t be flying under so many viewers\u2019 radar.\\n",

            "content": "Some shows just can't be described by what it is, instead it should be described by how it makes you feel. In essence, this is simply a show about some amateurs running and somehow ending in a top national competition, it isn't all that special, and not that believable either. However, the feeling the show gives is just special. Running doesn't sound like such an interesting sport, but this show makes you feel as if it's truly a spiritual path, and this is the only anime that has convinced me to actually practice the sport . I hope to one day be able to lookback at this show, and to finally realize the overlying question asked in it: \u201dwhat does it mean to run?\u201d\\n\r\nThat said, the main strongs of this show aren't the sport or hype of it, it's mainly the characters and their wonderful relationship to one another, and the way they had such great realistic character progression. Just like this show convinced me to run, it also made me feel kinda jealous I don't live in such a dorm as theirs, because the way they lived together felt so realistic and true.\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are a solid 10/10\\n\r\nThe show itself lies somewhere between an 8 or 9/10, but I'll give it a 9, since it was truly enjoyable.",

            "content": "Few things to start with;\r\nMy overall rating in this review and rating for the show on my list differ, that is due to MAL not having unified rating. 10/10 on the site is described as \"masterpiece\" while 10/10 in reviews is described as \"outstanding\", while the show is indeed outstanding I don't like to throw word \"masterpiece\" around.\r\nEpisode 11 has aired as of writing this review. Art, sound and enjoyment aspects of my rating are not going to change but story and character might depending on how the story develops and on how it concludes (since the source is completed & it's a two courseshow I do expect that what we are getting is completed story i.e. no s2). \\n\\n\r\nI will talk about story & characters last since they are  the variables and are arguably the most important parts;\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10;\\n\\n\r\nWhile I do admittedly have fetish for most of I.G.'s art styles the art/animation fit the show very well. There is no part of the animation that would seem out of place and there are some seriously gorgeous scenes. The reason it's not a ten is the fact that there are anime series/movies that set the bar extremely high. So again and in conclusion, the art fits and does what it needs to while making the show look nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10;\\n\\n\r\nSound&soundtrack fit the show and there is not a piece of the sound design within the show that I could point out and call bad or/and out of place. Both OP and ED are memorable. The soundtrack is enjoyable even out of context i.e. on it's own.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10;\\n\\n\r\nI sat through 11 episodes without a stop and didn't even notice it which is very rare thing for me. \\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10 & Characters 9/10 (spoiler free)\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast is on the outside very nice and fairly diverse. I've noticed that the show has 2 characters marked as \"main\" and rest as \"supporting\" which I'd have to disagree with, while the show does have two distinctive MCs the entire group of characters should be taken as a main cast. All of the characters have seemingly distinctive personalities, ways and interests which actually do make them feel human what's more, they (their personalities and actions) do react to what's happening around them all of that together makes it very easy for you to actually sympathize with them & what they go through during the show.There are some weird \"blunders\" when it comes to it but it's all within reason. As it is, I am torn between 8 and 9, I can't give the cast a 10 because while atm. it's all coming nicely together it heavily depends on how they move&change with and throughout the rest of the story since there will be very little time to \"give\" to the individual cast members (that said, it might end up being a 10 ^-^).\\n\\n\r\nThe story while being surprisingly good is at the moment the weakest part of the show. The setting is extremely fresh which is weird considering it takes place at a college but it does seem to be a rare specimen ^-^. The story itself feels believable which is without a doubt partially thanks to the cast but it's overall very realistic It's hard to put into words because while the show is more or less \"sports anime\" it's not exactly about the sport itself, rather than that it's about people living their lives with the sport being a part (bigger and bigger part as the story goes on) of it. As mentioned before, the characters have different interests and while all being college students they are at different points in their lives, the show manages to highlight their differences and how they deal with them, their problems and each other extremely well, there are moments of both happiness and sadness but it all comes as heartwarming. The show also manages to shift  between comedy and drama smoothly which makes the \"process\" feel natural. The story has a rating of 8 mainly because there are some dull moments and the story does focus on some \"uninteresting\" things from time to time which becomes an issue when you have fairly limited amount of episodes while having wide repertoire of themes and moments you could be showing the viewer. The story might end on a 9 but it could also be a 7 or a 6 depending on how it continues and ends, the final arc of the show and it's conclusion will be vital for both the story and the character cast.\\n\\n\r\nTo add little something to the \"sports anime\" thingy I abruptly ended, the anime isn't about people coming out of nowhere trying to be the best and whatnot, rather it's about people who have their own lives to live and the sport itself is becoming a part of that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I would suggest the show to pretty much anyone. It's hard to pinpoint how much time you should give the show before deciding to either drop or watch it all (since it's a 2 course and thus a fairly large time investment) so watch an episode or two and if you find yourself enjoying it stick with it. While the show needs few episodes to show you what it really has to offer if you find out that you are forcing yourself half-way through the second episode it's not very likely that the show is for you.",

            "content": "What is the most important part of a story? Would it be worldbuilding? The overall plot? I believe that it's the characters and how they interact with not only themselves but the world itself. Kaze ga Tsuyoko Fuiteiru is the prime example, the shining image, of true character development. \r\nTL;DR \r\nOverall impression: 8.4 \r\nI feel like the focus of the show is on the character and character growth more than it is about pushing the narrative of the story. I\u2019d recommend it but I\u2019ve found that several people have problems with certain aspects that I\u2019ll go into detail later.\r\nTrue Review:\r\nStory: 7 \r\nAt face value thestory is probably a 5, it gives what its supposed to for a narrative, nothing more nothing less. However, in practice with all the great characters the story feels \u201cbetter\u201d but still not AMAZING. The story follows a group of University students who, for some reason or another, was suddenly part of a track team. They then train for a really important race that\u2019s coming up and\u2026 that\u2019s actually it. The story isn\u2019t complex in the slightest but since all that characters are so different and interactive the story feels like a really long training montage that takes up the entire runtime of the show. Not bad, but people might not like it\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\r\nAs I said in my other reviews, I\u2019m not an artist, I have almost NO experience with art except for a couple high school and college classes. That being said even though I can\u2019t tell you exactly how hard it is to produce such a masterpiece I can tell you\u2026 that well\u2026 I think it\u2019s a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nEvery movement: seamless, every character: expressive. Even Prince changed facial expressions more than some of the best anime I\u2019ve seen. Every scene feels a notch above the rest in terms of animation, even in some scenes where an ordinary studio might just animate the mouth and nothing else Production I.D. said: \u201cwell screw that! let\u2019s just animate EVERY SINGLE PART of the character!\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Hmm\u2026 7 \\n\r\nTop notch intro, but that\u2019s really all that stood out to me unlike Made In Abyss with 100 different sounds, each deserving of some type of award. I had originally planned on giving the sound a 6 since it really didn\u2019t stand out BUT it didn\u2019t ruin the experience, however, it didn\u2019t seem to fair to give it that low of a score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nOutstanding, REALLY outstanding. There are few characters out there in anime with the amount of character depth EVERY single character in this show has. While at the time of writing this review I\u2019ve only seen 11 episodes and only a couple of characters have had the pleasure of getting an arc I already feel like I know them. Not a lot of shows, both animated and real, can say that kind of thing.  Even though this is by far the greatest part of the show, I can\u2019t really say enough that\u2019ll do it justice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis really makes my day worth it to be honest. Not much to say but this is one of the most enjoyable series I\u2019ve seen in a while.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8-9\\n\r\nNow here comes the hard part: In my review, it seemed like I\u2019d give this show a 10/10 and I really do believe that it comes close, however in order for a show to get full points I believe it needs a 10/10 in all 5 categories and I don\u2019t believe there is a show like that in existence (apart from Hunter X Hunter of course).\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the show as much as I am right now, The End\\n",

A good sports anime has an exciting plot, lovable characters, twists and turns, and heartwarming themes of \"friendship\" (Jk Jk I'm sorry) Run with the wind has all of these and more.\r\nMost sports anime I have seen take place in high school, thus, giving Run With The Wind (which takes place in college) an added edge. It takes sports into the real world, where jobs, money and cost of living, are obstacles as much as the opposing teams are. Another difference is the variety of characters. Unlike mostsports animes, Run with the wind has characters of varying ages, appearances, and attributes. With the added bonus of an excellent ending theme, an amazing main character (whom I adore), and decent animation, it certainly meets my personal expectations for a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Im not saying this makes Run with the wind the best sports anime ever, but it certainly brings something new and exciting to the genre. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what this anime has in store for us.",

            "content": "How this anime manages to get so much character development into it when there are 10 characters but only 23 episodes is quite frankly baffling. As well as providing these superb character arcs throughout the course of this series the story is also fantastically compelling and makes sense. It provides rivals from other running teams and a race format that allows the characters to internally and externally challenge and reflect on their own ideas to the outrageous plan Haiji imposed on these normal people.\r\nThis isn't a perfect anime though, aside from a few cosmically spellbinding scenes the general art style is pretty average, and Ihonestly can't remember a single second of the music over the 23 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nBut does this matter? Did I enjoy this anime any less because of those flaws?\\n\\n\r\nOf course not",

            "content": "Run With the Wind is an anime that takes a while to hit its stride, but once it does, it becomes an engaging show with a lovable cast of running boys. It is unique in many aspects, making it a breath of fresh air to the sports anime genre. Those looking for a strong, character driven show will enjoy this one.\r\nLet\u2019s start with what I think immediately sets this apart from other sports anime - the setting. Most sports anime are set in high school, but this one is set in college. This allows for story avenues not possible in a typical shounen setting, suchas looking for a job or just trying to figure out what to do with your life in general. I do wish we saw more of the young adult life overall, since it\u2019s something we don\u2019t get to see in anime that much. Still, these college aged boys are going through things that are fresh to me in my mind, since I\u2019ve only graduated college recently. Perhaps in that way I am biased, but to me it makes these characters more relatable, and it sets this anime apart from others in a very clear way.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the show starts off a bit slow. You don\u2019t really get a good feeling for what the show is gonna be about until several episodes in. Those who waive off shows within the first three or four episodes might be missing out on something special. It doesn\u2019t start getting good until we really get to know the cast.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to the team. 70% of this team have no experience with track and field at all. Most teams of sports anime have members that are at least somewhat experienced and have to deal with maybe one or two newbies at a time. It is through these characters that we learn about the intricacies of the sport. But since running is so straightforward, Run With the Wind takes advantage of this by comprising the team of mostly unathletic scrubs. This leads to a viewing experience where you get to see several people experiencing the sport from level 0 all the way to like level 5 or something. I was, however, skeptical of how the show was gonna be able to balance all of these characters and give them sufficient time to grow. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the cast is introduced, they each have a defining quirk - one guy is a lawyer, one guy is the smoker, you\u2019ve got some twins over here, one is an otaku, etc. etc. I was worried that they would be forever associated with these stereotypical character traits, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the show is able to add layers to each and every single character. Each of them gets their time in the sun, and we learn about what they\u2019re really like underneath these shallow introductions. By the end of the show, I was rooting for each and every one of them. It was like I knew them all personally, like I was on the team too. My highest compliment I can give is that I remembered all of the team members\u2019 names, which is unusual for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I think puts a stain on the entire show is how the team itself is formed. Let\u2019s just say that pretty much nobody voluntarily joins the team at first. The team captain manipulates the others, practically forcing them to join. This small fact, to me, gives the entire show a bit of a shaky foundation. After all, how can I believe in a team that didn\u2019t really want to do their sport in the first place? If it weren\u2019t for the show\u2019s other strengths, I think this show could have easily toppled under the weight of this flaw. It still bugs me, even after completing the show. I think this aspect could have been handled better.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the antagonists, there aren\u2019t really any, which is fitting for this show. The show\u2019s theme is all about answering the questions, \u201cWhy do you run? What does running mean for you?\u201d It\u2019s a very introspective show, and is less about super-hype sports moments and more about growing as a person. Thus, the lack of any hard hitting villains is appropriate. The self-reflective nature of the anime is another unique selling point.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and the soundtrack are also pleasant surprises to be had. The background art of this show is quite lovely, and the attention to detail to the characters as they run is respectable. Each person runs in a slightly different way than the other, adding another dimension to who they are as a person and as a runner. This show does have CG, but it is wise enough to use it with restraint. It is mostly limited to large group shots where there is a bunch of people running at the same time. Everything else is classically animated. The soundtrack fits the very thoughtful mood of the show. It has some pretty chill-sounding beats overall, but is still able to amp up the mood when it needs to. \\n\\n\r\nThe last bit of praise I can give this show is a bit of a personal one but I think it\u2019s worth mentioning. This show made me want to run again. And in fact, I did! I used to run a bit of track and field/cross country back in the day, and this anime reminded me of how simple, yet powerful, the act of running can be.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its slow start, Run With the Wind is a special anime. It is very good in pretty much all aspects, such as characters, animation, and story. I think those that like shows with big, lovable casts should check this one out, as well as those who are fans of sports anime in general. This is one that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll forget soon.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I will be honest, I don't like that there's are black characters that are central to the story, yet are voiced by Japanese people.  There was one joke, in particular, that was really obnoxious, more towards the beginning.  That being said, I think a lot of people make excuses for it without addressing the main question: Is there really a need to bring up race like this if he doesn't really struggle or overcome many racial tensions in Japan?  \r\nThe issue in doing an anime about a team of people, especially in a series that only has 23 episodes to do it,is that you have to flesh out every character.  Unfortunately, there just isn't enough given to Musa for them to justify having a black character.  Maybe one or two comments are thrown at him, and this pureness of his character handles the initial reaction, but he's already done running and quite honestly they didn't make any progressive comments on race in Japan at all.  That's not what this anime was about, and really it just feels slightly more offensive than it should.  Not that I was expecting a Japanese company about Japanese college students to really handle any racial tension with any sort of grace, I can't say that I will let this anime really pass on a great score.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I think that overall they did try to make a good series and I have enjoyed watching it.  It gave me something to do, and I wasn't turned off from the first few episodes with a promise of something better.  And I won't lie, I did tear up at a few of the bigger moments towards the end.  I like seeing the more central characters grow, but I think that just maybe because I'm in college myself and I can relate to a lot of these characters.  There's potential with exploring this idea that I would love to see more, and hopefully, there's a much larger step towards creating a more progressive storyline that I think anime severely lacks.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't like sporty anime about groups of men doing things with the token girl character that stands as a goal of desire rather than be of much substance, then this might not be for you.  I regretfully can look past most of these underlying themes to still get a lot out of the more sentimental moments, but what does that really say about me?",
