            "content": "Mod Edit: This review contains spoilers.\r\n-----\r\nIt\u2019s not very often that an anime comes out that has its main protagonist be the villain and does it so well. Overlord is a popular show that explores this idea and Youjo Senki would be a highly recommended for those who enjoy certain aspects of it. It follows Tanya Degurechaff, a Japanese salaryman reincarnated into a female child soldier, in a reality where magic coexists alongside an alternate timeline of World War One. The twist is that she fights for Germanian Empire and behaves far differently than a stereotypical heroine. \r\nCharacters\r\nYoujo Senki is defined by the main female leadof Tanya as she ascends the ranks of the Imperial Army though bloodshed and maneuvering within its bureaucracy. What makes her character and story so interesting is that she provides a fascinating case study on villainy. Far from the cliche ambitions of world domination, fame or riches, her ultimate objective is to live out a comfortable life by following the rules to an dogmatic degree and being competent. It is a mundane goal, but it does ground her character in becoming relatable.   \\n\\n\r\nBeing a sociopathic salaryman in her former life, Tanya runs afoul of God due to her lack of empathy and atheism, which then causes her to be reborn into a grim world in order to unlock her faith in a higher power. The crux of the series is for Tanya to physically survive the ever expanding conflict that will become the First World War in this alternate timeline challenge for Tanya become twofold as she is to survive in this new world while not succumbing to the spiritual whims of God\u2019s conversion efforts.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Tanya does have access to quite a bit of power in the form of retaining full knowledge of her previous life, extremely high magical potential, ruthless work ethic and state of the art equipment. Despite ending up in the body of a ten year old blonde girl, there is very little pandering to when it comes to her loli physicality, and those who underestimate her quickly find themselves outclassed and outmaneuvered. Tanya is completely ruthless and brutal when it comes to waging warfare as her tactics are to swiftly end the fight with clever tactics and overwhelming firepower. Off the battlefield and with the knowledge of World War One, she can sweet talk her way to the command staff with groundbreaking military doctrine and instill a sense of reverence in her troops.   \\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the greatest downfall to her is the incompatibility of her final goals, ideology and actions within the military environment resulting in the various schemes that she cooks up to ensure a comfortable position ends up with the opposite effect. Her adherence to rules, regulations and orders does not offer any alternate route in spite of Tanya\u2019s being the villain in her own story. While the civilian business world can be far more accommodating to the desires of talented individuals, the military values competency by rewarding those specific individuals like Tanya, with greater responsibility. There was no way that the Imperial Army was letting a brilliant tactician and ace mage with unmatched strength or leadership ability, be sidelined in the greatest war to end all war. As smart and cunning as Tanya is, for her to not realize that simple face seems like an oversight to me. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters of the show don\u2019t even come close to holding a candle to the flamethrower that is Tanya, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they are poorly designed or constructed. Her subordinate, Viktoriya Serebryakova, a female conscripted into the German Empire Army, acts as the foil to Tanya\u2019s cold efficiency and utilitarian worldview. With nationalistic ideals, a strong sense of duty, concerns about her comrades and a belief in a higher power, she is far more akin to your standard anime female heroine. It is this juxtaposition of their attitudes that makes their interactions so peculiar as Viktoriya is slowly smitten by her superior officer. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, there is Being X himself, a singular god-like entity as opposed to the myriad of deities in the source material. Studio Nut took liberties with the light novel and made him a far more sinister character by setting up Tanya in situations where she has no choice but to praise his name in exchange for the usage of the very powerful Type-95 magical orb. Appearing through proxies at certains encounter, his involvement in the plot goes to the point of altering the source material and cumlnate in an explosive climax which gives Tanya a real challenge and face to fight against. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\\n\r\nFrom the limited information available, Youjo Senki is the first main animation production from Studio Nut, a newfound company is made up of former Studio Madhouse employees. There is obviously some talent behind this anime production as the action sequences looks quite good and convey a sense of ferociousness as Tanya effortlessly butchers her way through any and all enemies standing between her and a peaceful life. The backgrounds also looks great with the landscape and skybox being highly detailed while having this drab color palette that fits Youjo Senki\u2019s interpretation of World War One\u2019s bleak tone. My only real complaint is the use of some rather dodgy CGI that clashes against the 2D\u2019s frame rate and fidelity. Others may take up issue with the the character design differences between the source material and the anime as Tanya and Viktoriya looks leagues apart when compared to their Soujo-like appearance in the manga and light novel. Personally, I think that sociopathic nature of Tanya and the wide-eyed look of the optimistic and duty-bound Viktoriya meshes well with their respective trollish and dopey animated appearances. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\\n\r\nYoujo Senki is a textbook case on exactly how anime adaptions should done by having the strong source material as its base, and layering it with amazing animations, an epic soundtrack and a fitting bleak tone. The World War One setting is worth the admission alone as portrayal of the various weapons and military doctrine is spot on. Tanya, being one of the most understandable psychopathic loli that anime has to offer, only adds to its uniqueness and enjoyment.   \\n",

            "content": "My first encounter with the anime \"The Saga of Tanya the Not Particularly Evil\" intrigued me greatly. I walked in on my roommate watching some anime with a little girl and, as per tradition, I casually called him a pedophile. But then something strange happened. Rather than the usual \"ACKSHUALLY, she's a 500 year old demon,\" he said \"ACKSHUALLY, she's a middle aged man.\" Now, I was horrified by this. I slapped him and began to shout. \"Why?? Hasn't this trap shit gone on long enough??? It\u2019s too far!\u201c I said. But he explained the plot to me, so I told him it sounded stupid.\"No,\u201d he said \u201cActually, it's really good.\"  And that is where our sad story begins. (It was not, dear readers, actually really good.)\\n\\n\r\nAn essential problem here is that the whole premise feels pointless. Some dude dies and God doesn\u2019t like him so he turns him into a badass loli mage. Because that\u2019s a punishment now. Why is it important that this girl used to be a man when we know basically nothing about her previous life? This reincarnation seems to give her knowledge that battle-hardened generals envy, but there's no reason why some salaryman who\u2019s read a few wikipedia articles would be a genius at military strategy. And did he have to be some fedora tipper's wet dream? Libertarian, atheist\u2026\u2026I guarantee this man dabbles in bestiality just based on this combination, and this makes him a really unsympathetic character. Couldn\u2019t we have had an anime where a loli becomes Hitler, without this whole thing where it\u2019s actually some reincarnated old dude? That sounds like a much more interesting character. As it is, they keep telling us she\u2019s a monster or evil every episode, but she\u2019s mostly just dull, which is why they have to keep telling us\u2026..we would have never guessed if we were left to our own devices.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, I care more about the actual plot than this weird backstory. Or I would, if the AU was not so vague and dull. One alternate option would have been to create a whole new universe, with only slight similarities to our own, but that would have required world building and work. Another would have been to have it take place in a universe more similar to our own, but the points at which the anime departs from history often seem to be more out of ignorance than creativity, suggesting that this choice was never really an option. As such, we\u2019re stuck in this uncanny middle ground where the viewer knows next to nothing about the setting, despite how similar it is to his own world\u2019s history. The lack of clarification on points of departure is jarring and it destroys immersion.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u2018Characters' section must be put at 1/10, to represent that there is only one character. (And she\u2019s not that good!) I can\u2019t say I remember anyone else\u2019s name, or anything about them. It seems as if the creators genuinely did not put any effort into creating unique, compelling, or creative characters. I don\u2019t care about any of these people, or what happens to them. And every time I start to feel invested in Tanya I\u2019m reminded she\u2019s actually just some weird old dude, and the whole orphan backstory means nothing. Most character interactions are very shallow, and we don\u2019t know anyone\u2019s motivations other than the absolute basics. Where are the meaningful character interactions? Where is the development? It\u2019s ridiculous and shallow. \\n\\n\r\nThe ED was probably the best part of every episode. Not only because it meant the episode was over, but because it was actually not too bad. No complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thought most of this anime\u2019s potential was squandered. It wasn\u2019t an atrocity but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it, nor do I plan to watch the next season. There wasn't really enough tension or depth to keep me going and it became difficult to watch towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nOverall: Let's just call it a 4 or something",

            "content": "Mod Edit: This review contains spoilers.\r\n----\r\nThis anime, compressed into one long ass sentence: \u201cAn intelligent, asshole, soldier loli is actually a reincarnated, sociopathic, atheist, former salaryman, who occasionally gets forced by a stalker, god-like entity to pray to it in order for him-now-her to survive in a world-war setting and wreck his/her war enemies... with a magic gun.\u201d \r\nYoujo Senki was a pretty interesting show. It successfully presents an uncommon perspective in anime, where the main character is borderline villainous. I personally found it very entertaining and would recommend it to you.\r\nTL;DR at the end\r\nStory: 8/10 \r\nTanya Degurachaff (the main character) starts off in ouruniverse as an atheist, sociopathic, efficiency-valuing salaryman with many personality disorders and complexes. Some normal everyday shit happens at work, but the guy that he just cold-heartedly fired at work that day overreacts and murders Tanya by pushing him onto the train tracks. A god-like entity claims to be God, has a philosophical discussion with him before he dies, Tanya names it \"Being X\" since he's a non-believer, and then he gets told that he this will be his last reincarnation cycle (basically because he\u2019s a sociopathic atheist). He consequently gets sent to be reborn in a different, more war-torn world that contains magic and is reminiscent of the early 1900s in our world.\\n\\n\r\nHe-now-she is reborn as a girl and we become increasingly aware that she remembers her previous life as she reaches the age of nine. Now that she's a fully fledged nine-year-old, she chooses to join the military and rises through the military ranks in order to obtain enough achievements to live comfortably in the safety of the city. However, \u201cBeing X\u201d maliciously interferes at very critical points in Tanya's life, and so she often ends up continuously fighting in life-threatening magical gun battles. The reason why being \u201cBeing X\u201d interferes is basically in order to try to convert her evil, sociopathic, loli ass into a devout believer. However, instead of choosing to believe in God, Tanya angrily continues to reject the existence of God through ominous displays of smug insanity. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows him-now-her as she rises through the army ranks and becomes an overpowered, super strict, crazy, monster-like commanding officer. The story also gives some interesting perspective on the human nature of war, and the geopolitical strategy that goes into it\\n\\n\r\n- Will he-now-she ever get his-now-her happy ending? \\n\r\n- Who or what is \"Being X?\" \\n\r\n- How does Tanya, a sociopath, act in a military environment? \\n\r\n~Find out more by watching the show!~\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was great; nothing felt like it was too slow or too fast, but some watchers were initially thrown off because the first episode since it started in the middle of a war scene. The purpose of it was to build interest in the series by showing that there was going to be tons of action, but they consequently chose to present Tanya\u2019s backstory in the second episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is very unique, but it feels like the show is missing something to me. I think that it may be because there is no ambitious \u201cgoal(s)\u201d that the main protagonist has, other than just defying \u201cBeing X\u201d and trying to live comfortably in life. The story was also very interesting, having enough character development for all of the essential characters. Overall, I feel the story is worth an 8/10. I ranked it down mainly because it\u2019s nearly void of profound or meaningful qualities, and also because the show wasn\u2019t exactly \u201ccomplex\u201d or relatable in any way (except for perhaps the intelligence of the main character). I thought that the story was \u201cvery interesting\u201d, but never once called it \u201cgreat\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nReally, the only interesting characters in this anime were Tanya, Being X, and some random ass enemy-dad from the suburbs. However, to be honest, Tanya was really all this anime needed anyways. Tanya is interesting because she\u2019s an excellent strategist that prioritizes logic and efficiency as a soldier, which allows her to often make more effective decisions than even the highest commanding strategy officers. She's also pretty overpowered and crazy, so she wrecks her enemies while having some of the craziest facial expressions that I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, Tanya\u2019s thoughts and actions somewhat remind me of the main protagonists from Saiki Kusuo no Psi nan (10/10 best comedy) and Jinrui wa Shimashita (8/10 hidden gem). In these anime, the main character\u2019s words/actions and internal commentary are often hilariously in opposition to each other, as they reluctantly conform to others\u2019 expectations to achieve some sort of objective or conceal their true nature. This mainly presents itself when she must show respect for her superior officers, often becoming extremely enraged internally when things don\u2019t go her way.  \\n\\n\r\nThey only briefly built the personalities of the other characters that surround Tanya throughout the anime. The highest ranking officers showed up pretty often and got a decent amount of development, as did Tanya\u2019s main assistant Viktoriya Ivanovna. Viktoriya Avnovna is a very kind and tender woman, who is unexpectedly dedicated to her job as a soldier. She's supposed to be a main character, but I don\u2019t recall getting any of her background story. It must\u2019ve either been very insignificant or they may have just never told her story. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe background art is objectively amazing--- actually, they are some of the best backgrounds that I have ever seen in the anime genre. Additionally, the animation and action are great, the dramatic angles are top quality, the facial expressions are very expressive, special effects are good enough, all 3DCG objects blend perfectly and are barely detectable--- overall the art is quite great in general. However, they REALLY fucked up the female characters' head designs from the manga. In fact, it\u2019s so different, that I am literally at a loss for words. \\n\\n\r\nThe female characters look almost unrecognizably different when compared to their manga counterparts. Tanya and Viktoriya Ivanovna (actually, the women in general) were supposed to look like very beautiful characters/people. In the manga, she looked similar to how a beautiful shoujo anime\u2019s main character would look (the ED art is the manga art, in case you were wondering). Comparing the two... left me at a loss for words because in the anime they looked like some weird ass toddlers with weird-looking eyes. \\n\\n\r\nThe men look perfectly fine. This slightly ticked me off because they spent all of this time and money drawing these hella top quality backgrounds, but they deliberately chose to fuck up both Tanya\u2019s and Viktoriya Ivanovna\u2019s character designs. The new design makes them both appear less attractive and more scary and evil in Tanya\u2019s case, which may have been what the art director was going for. I don\u2019t like it, but I wouldn\u2019t have noticed if I didn\u2019t check out the manga.  Everything else is absolutely fantastic, so I feel compelled to give this category a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending were pretty unique, fun, intense, and catchy songs 9/10. The opening is an intense dark-sounding j-rock piece, while the ending is a bit more emotional, but still intense. Unfortunately, I feel that the background OSTs were pretty lackluster in general, but the main battle OST was pretty good. I think that they should have had a composer create a heavier, more fluid sounding main melody for the battles in order to convey the heaviness of fighting and taking a life, but it sounded pretty good and definitely got the job done. The remaining themes were relatively average instrumental background music. \\n\\n\r\nI feel that Tanya's voice sounded a bit off. It definitely fit her evil personality and was pretty intimidating, but I think it would sound better if she had a more softer voice that maintains the same level of intensity. Her voice didn\u2019t really seem to fit the character from the manga, in my opinion. It definitely fits the character from the anime, however. To be quite frank, Yuuki Aoi is an amazing VA and always does a spectacular job in her VA roles, so I\u2019m guessing it was somebody else\u2019s \u201cartistic\u201d interference that caused all of these changes. All of the other characters were voiced pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nAll things considered, I feel that this was a very enjoyable series. This was the series that I looked forward to watching the most during the winter 2017 season. This anime's title picture is what drew me in, but I mainly stayed for the asshole, intelligent, soldier loli, who is actually a reincarnated, sociopathic, atheist, former salaryman. I actually really enjoyed his-now-her personality; it essentially MADE this show. This show would not be anywhere near as interesting without Tanya. Without her, it would probably look something like a shittier version of \u201cAlderamin in the Sky (8/10)\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nWhat to Take away:  8/10 \\n\r\nThe story is very good, I enjoyed it and you probably will too (8/10). It was paced quite well; nothing feeling too slow or too fast. Tanya was really the only character that received development, but she\u2019s really all that the series needed anyways (7/10). The art is absolutely great, having some of the best background art that I\u2019ve seen in the anime genre, but they screwed up the female characters\u2019 beauty from the manga in order to make them look scarier (9/10). The OP and ED were great, but the background OSTs would\u2019ve been better if they sounded heavier to suit the war vibe, like something Sawano Hiroyuki would compose(7/10). Tanya\u2019s voice was great, but she occasionally sounded relatively squeaky. I would definitely recommend this anime to you personally.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it? \\n\\n\r\nIf you like:\\n\r\n- unique plots, \\n\r\n- intelligent/calculating main characters, \\n\r\n- war anime, military anime, magic anime, \\n\r\n- intense action scenes, \\n\r\n- strategy-based plots, \\n\r\n- great background art, \\n\r\n- and/or evil lolis *hears sirens in the distance* \\n\\n\r\nThen this anime is definitely for you. Otherwise, you probably shouldn\u2019t watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this helps you make your decision on whether or not to watch this anime~",

            "content": "My opinion: \r\nYoujo Senki is a series that succeeds in portraying the \u201creincarnated and transported to a different world\u201d scenario while having a unique approach on the \u201cmilitary\u201d genre. \r\nThe story is well executed and approaches the military genre from a new and unique perspective that I found really entertaining. The character cast is a \u201cone man army\u201d composed of Tanya, aside from her character there really aren\u2019t any other good characters.  \r\nThe animation works in harmony with the sound department, resulting in a great watching experience that really allows the viewer to enter the show\u2019s world.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nFor having insulted \u201cGod\u201d, an atheist andarrogant Japanese salaryman in the moment of his death is sentenced to be reborn in an alternate universe similar to 1910's Europe mixed with early aspects of World\u2005War\u2005II, in an empire torn apart by countless wars with all nearby countries.\\n\r\nThe salaryman is reborn as a girl who will be known as Second Lieutenant Tanya Degurechaff of the Imperial Army, a 9-year-old soldier girl. As God stated, if Tanya doesn\u2019t meet her end through a natural death or she refuses to have faith in Him, her soul will be sent to hell for all eternity. In order to avoid going to hell, Tanya decides to enter the Empire\u2019s Mages Division and fight in the \u201cworld war\u201d hoping to climb the ladder to the top ranks as fast as possible to remain away from the battlefield as a way to avoid the risk of being killed and at the same time \u201clive the good life\u201d.\\n\r\nEven if the arrogant salaryman is now forced to have the body of a young girl, he soon adapts to the situation and turns into a merciless soldier who prioritizes efficiency above all. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, in the beginning of the series, and even before I started watching it, I found the \u201cman in loli body\u201d to be ridiculous and it actually bothered me for the duration of the first 3 episodes but I soon got over it and got intrigued by Tanya\u2019s character instead of being bothered by her appearance.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in quite a normal world, except for the existence of \u201cmagic\u201d. The show does a good job at portraying how differing countries can act when they are disagreeing, just skipping the political talks and jumping to war, and the way it employs real war tactics such as trench warfare was really nice to see.\\n\r\nAlso, the \u201cEmpire\u201d can be compared to WW1 Germany, the Republic can be compared to France and the enemy alliance can be compared to the Triple Entente (and a few more comparisons I won\u2019t bother mentioning), I found all these similarities to be a great addition to the show by giving it veracity.\\n\\n\r\nThe story unfolds at a satisfying pace, nothing felt like it was developing too fast or too slow, but the first episode could have been done better and used to explain things such as why the Empire is fighting against so many countries, how the magic-based weapons work, how magic came to be, etc. With that in mind, the first episode did its job well, its purpose was to display an interesting scene that will compel the viewer to watch the series by showing that there is gonna be a ton of action, and it did that very well.\\n\\n\r\nI consider Youjo Senki to be quite the unique \u201cmilitary\u201d show that approaches things from a different and interesting perspective, compared to what I am used to. On the other hand, it lacks the complex story and meaningful messages it would take for me to consider it a \u201cvery good\u201d series.\\n\r\nThere aren\u2019t many \u201cclever\u201d moments or twists that left me pondering, just a straightforward story that although it is a tad bit ridiculous at times, I found it good.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWar does not decide who is right, but who is left\u201d. What really separated Youjo Senki from other generic war series (like Izetta:The Last Witch) was the fact that there are no real \u201cbad guys\u201d, or in this case bad countries, only patriots blindly believing their country\u2019s propaganda and soldiers following orders which is very true and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what I found very dumb: People, that studied and experienced war for 20-30 years can\u2019t come up with a good strategy but the businessman Tanya (because that is what she/he really is, a businessman) was able to do so without any effort. Even if I was to take into account the possibility that Tanya studied war and had a natural talent for it, that still wouldn\u2019t explain the veteran\u2019s incompetence nor Tanya\u2019s success, it\u2019s just ludicrous.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThis is where Youjo Senki fails. Except for Tanya and \u201cBeing X\u201d there really is no one that is worth mentioning, the support characters are just bland tropes used for decor, having the banal purpose of being plot tools, sacrifices or just to fill up the void.\\n\\n\r\nTanya Degurechaff, the protagonist, is a young blonde, blue-eyed 10 years old girl who is the reincarnation of a cold-hearted atheist and social-darwinist Japanese salaryman who was sent to another world because \u201che\u201d who is now a \u201cshe\u201d insulted God. Compared to others, Tanya has a high latent magical ability and is the only one capable of using an experimental \u201cType-95 operation orb\u201d due to Being X's interference. She controls a battalion of elite mages whose main purpose is to overwhelm enemy forces while also remaining highly mobile and relatively small. \\n\r\nTanya is quite ruthless and intolerant towards the mistakes and failures of others, much the same as in her previous life, and employs several extreme punishments and training methods. \\n\r\nWhat makes her characters interesting is that she is similar to an \u201canti-hero\u201d, she is merciless, cunning, egoistic, arrogant and shows sociopathic tendencies through the fa\u00e7ades she uses and monologues that explain the logic and reasonings behind her actions. Tanya doesn\u2019t wish for riches, world fame, world domination or other generic motives, she only has the mundane goal of living a comfortable life that ends by a natural death, which I found a bit hilarious but also original and made me relate to her character a bit.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBeing X\u201d is a self-centered and villainous god-like entity, more like a self-proclaimed God, and throughout the series it forces Tanya to praise his name by putting her in situations where she has no other choice than doing so. His form is unknown, he only appears through proxies but we know he has absolute power since he altered the fundamentals of the world on multiple occasions. \\n\r\nWhat bugged me was his unknown reason for being so obsessed with Tanya. Out of millions of non-believers he chose particularly that salaryman and then invested quite a lot of time (since this \u201cgod\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to be omnipotent and omnipresent) in trying to make that salaryman a believer. It just seems odd.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation has a well-suited color palette, it is fluid with well-done CGI and the background art is beautiful, but the character design is\u2026 let\u2019s just say the character design leaves to be desired. \\n\r\nThe action scenes have such a natural flow that it\u2019s mesmerizing, it offers a very good and immersive watching experience, and the animation, without a doubt, is one of the best this season.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI liked the opening theme but I found the ending theme to be great and I almost never skipped it, that says quite a lot. The OST is very good and gives one hell of an immersive experience because you can feel the impact behind every explosion, gunshot, etc. Most of the voice actors interpret the characters very well (loved whenever Being X made an appearance) but there are actors who could have done their job better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI highly enjoyed this series, which was a surprise to me. \\n\r\nThe action scenes were great and the show didn\u2019t have any moments I found obscenely ludicrous or any other irritating factors. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10\\n\r\nYoujo no Senki is a good show that employs a unique and well done plot accompanied by decently constructed characters, coming in a package with very good animation and sound. I recommend giving this show a try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(Review of first 5 eps)\r\nI had no interest in Tanya when it first aired. Its preview on ANN was poor and the story sounded bizarre to me. However, after the first few episodes I noticed this anime was recieving more and more good reviews and generating some buzz, so I decided to check it out. And I'm very glad I did. \r\n-Story- \r\nTanya is an original take on the now well-tred Isekai/AU genre. Firstly, the character is born (with a different gender) into the new world instead of merely being transported, as an adult, into it. Secondly, Tanya's goal is to survive in this newworld and make a success of her life there, not to go on an adventure or defeat some bad guy. \\n\\n\r\nTanya is evil in a sense, but not in the typical villain way. Being a salaryman in the previous life, she has a drive towards success and self-preservation, no matter the cost to others. She does occasionally demonstrate a more truly malevolent streak, which is always fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe strength of the lead's character means that Saga of Tanya the Evil is highly enjoyable both in war scenes and long dialogue sequences between Tanya and military higherups - it is a rare anime of any sort that can claim that. \\n\\n\r\n-Technical-\\n\\n\r\nTanya was animated by a new studio called NUT, and they have done an excellent job. The art is detailed, backgrounds are often beautiful, and most importantly Tanya looks like no other anime char I've ever seen. She can look both adorably cute, and terrifyingly evil, in the same episode. \\n\\n\r\nTanya's voice actor has a difficult job portraying such an original MC. It took a while to get used to the way her voice sounds but now I'm of the opinion that both her voice and performance is perfect for the role. It's also worth noting the OP song which is a catchy techno beat. \\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\\n\r\nTanya is what last season's Izetta should have been. This anime could have been a failure with worse writing, less competent production, or a lack of a unique and highly watchable main character. Instead, Tanya has all 3 and more. It is already a frontrunner for most surprisingly good anime of the year. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "To the people who finally expected a negative review on this show, sorry for being late; Being X gave me trouble. Also, expect lots of religion puns; have a problem, then you'd probably have a hell of a time with this damn review.\r\nYoujo Senki is a pathetic waste that doesn't know what the hell it's talking about, stuck in its own incompetence and stupidity of vengefulness and craziness that it completely ruins a potentially good war story in the name of edge and sacrilege. From its ridiculous premise that's a sloppy combination of the premises of Drifters and Izetta (both mediocre and bad war showsfrom the previous year respectively), to its laughable and generic attempts at emotion, this anime has less depth and intelligence than a Michael Bay movie; at least those have nice Megan Fox fan service and CGI that isn't fugly as hell. So, why did this train wreck of an anime bomb harder than a pack of fighter planes? Let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSo, a psychopathic businessman gets killed, but in the midst of death, encounters a pissed off God that reincarnates him as a mage girl in an alternate world and torments him. Again, just like Drifters, with a bit of Izetta. From there, we learn of the poorly defined magic that has multiple unexplained spells and bullets because the anime doesn't sit down and tell us about the many variations of spells and bullets shown throughout the anime. Plus, the hover system our protagonist's side uses makes no sense, with it being a 1-legged booster with nothing to help give them horizontal support. From there, we plunge into the two main plot lines: Tanya rises through the tanks in the name of self-preservation and hates the damn deity known as God, or Being X. Both of these are handled horribly, especially the latter since the anime doesn't have faith in us, meaning that it has to remind us about it at least 4 times per episode. I mean, dissing God and making him cruel is a good and compelling plot point, especially if we constantly remind the audience at nauseam, right?\\n\\n\r\nAs for the war itself, well, this show keeps skipping giant chunks of this World War that would really be beneficial to know, like the assembling of multiple companies under Tanya\u2019s rule, seeing Tanya become major, establishing just who is currently in the war without resorting to \u201cwho are we fighting this episode\u201d, etc. and it's quite upsetting since it basically sacrifices the real soul of the war just for the sake of fueling the awful plot of Tanya Vs God. It all feels arbitrary for the sake of a singular character\u2019s plot, which is a major sin in and of itself, especially in execution. Plus, in the later episodes where major war-ending schemes are launched, we get little insight on them (or sometimes are just thrusted into them without knowing what the hell they are), and with no sense of transition whatsoever. They literally gutted this war just for the sake of 12 episode pacing because god forbid we actually get character development, proper play-by-play on the events of the war, or anything that could help make a decent war story. Plus, some of these events, like Tanya stabbing a dude in the heart before dropping him alone in a huge body of water and them him somehow being alive and a mage ready to end her, raise major plot holes that really damn this script. Needless to say, this ain\u2019t no Saving Private Ryan, or even Pearl Harbor. By the final act, it gave up trying and just opted for pathetic deaths and displays of emotion, and a worthless cliffhanger. The show finally accepted defeat by the finale, surrendering any pretense of knowing what it was talking about, as I said it did earlier. What a waste of potential. Not even gonna touch any more of the ludicrous plot holes or moments of forced drama; this is already SEED Destiny levels of hellishly stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe crux of your enjoyment (or lack thereof) comes down to whether or not you like and/or tolerate Tanya as a character. Suffice it to say, I did not. She's only characterized as an unreasonably psychotic warrior who knows some decent military stuff (more than many experienced generals who have been doing this longer than Tanya has been alive in her current reincarnation), and almost nothing else into the final act, where she shows a teensy bit of compassion and turmoil. She doesn't develop or even get fleshed out despite her hogging the spotlight for 95% of this anime; can't go three minutes without her, making it an even bigger shame. People like to say that she is a villain protagonist, and that is just plain untrue. Villain protagonists are the people in which while we get to see them the most and what they go through to reach their eventual demise, the point of the story is to see them fail. Tanya is supposed to succeed against the adversity of war and the dickishness of God, therefore, she is a protagonist who isn't a villain, just overly brutal and unpleasant; a byronic hero, if you will.\\n\\n\r\nLet's compare her to two other military badass protagonists, Lelouch vi Britannia from Code Geass, and Char Aznabe from Gundam (I know he is usually an antagonist, but he's the protagonist of Origin and Zeta, so I win). Like Tanya, Lelouch vi Britannia is also arrogant and brutal, and suffers turmoil the more he goes on in his war,. However, we get to see many sides of him, from his charismatic side, to his lazy side, to his dorky side that proves how physically weak he is. We see him in a variety of perspectives and how he mostly deteriorates in the just causes he believes in. Unlike Tanya, we get to know a lot about him from his past to the many different demeanors he expresses around different people, aside from bloodlust and calmness. As for Char Aznable, he is a psychopath, just like Tanya, except portrayed in a realistic manner instead of an eccentric cartoon interpretation of a psycho. Tanya is a dick to people, willing to kill many of them for disobeying her, and is not a pleasant person to be around, especially when bloodthirsty; she's a simple anime crazy person, or what is basically what uninformed people deem as psychopathic characters. Char, on the other hand, is a true psychopath. He cuts of close relationships with people for his own goals, sets up people for death just to survive and not get his cover blown, or just because he has no use for them anymore, and does it all with one goal in mind. He seems approachable, but he is cold, twisted, and calculated, and has become a perfect soldier who isn't in need of compassion, especially after the first person he has romantic feelings for died in front of him. Now, is it a bit dickish to compare a new character like Tanya to two of the most well-written and recognizable anime characters in history? Maybe, but it sets things into perspective. \\n\\n\r\nPeople sometimes joke about how Tanya is the only actual character in the show, and barring a few minor exceptions, this holds some actual water. We have Viktoriya, who I can only describe as a discount Akane Tsunemori (from Psycho-Pass) with no development or fleshing-out, and the other characters aren't worth remembering, like Weiss. There's this one decent dude Tanya stabs, and he becomes a useless and crazy person who no longer speaks, there's his daughter who only gets two scenes of screen time, there are Tanya's other soldiers who are largely the same character, there's a generic mad scientist...what a riveting cast, right, ladies and gentlemen? Plus, all of the generals barring one are basically the exact same except one is old, one had blue hair, and one cracks occasional jokes. None of these guys develop or are fleshed out, and when some do go through turmoil, it's usually in the stupidest, most emotionally manipulative, and contrived ways imaginable. Talk about a ungodly cast; best of the year, right everyone?\\n\\n\r\nYou know how people stress making a good first impression? Well, Studio NUT did the exact opposite with how they handled the animation of this series. There is so much ugly CGU that is is grating, especially when it is CGI Tanya, CGI soldiers, or a CGI rotating landscape show that would only look acceptable in a WWII PS3/XBOX 360 game. It is absurd how much of it there is, and it almost never looks good. I also counted 5 moments where the rate rate went straight to hell; one in episodes 4, 7, 10, 11, and 12 respectively, with the first two being ugly rotating shot surrounded by ugly CGI books and battleships respectively.  The directing can be pretty awful too for some of these reasons. Sure, the magic (discounting when the magic barriers break and become ugly CGI fragments) looks pretty, and so do the bullets, but that doesn't help when it comes to poorly done action scenes (where dodging is a rarity) and awful CGI and cinematography. At least the interior design looks ice, but man do some of the characters look awful at times. I also hate Viktoriya's facial design, which is weird since one of the only good things about this anime's aesthetic is how different everyone's faces are, and how detailed and decently shiny theirs can look at times. I could go on and on about the awful CGI and everything else, but you get the point. For Studio NUT's first production, it doesn't look pretty, which is a shame when you compare that to the first anime done by Trigger, WIT, and MAPPA (Kill la Kill, many parts of Attack on Titan since they worked on it with Production I.G., and Terror in Resonance).\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, barring the horrible sound effects that look like there sometimes recorded from a broken boom box, this show sounds pleasing. The OP, \"JINGO JUNGLE\" by MYTH & ROID, is an addicting watch that perfectly encapsulates the crazed tone of this series, but this band makes amazing music anyway if their contributions to Re:Zero are anything to speak of. The ED, \"Los! Los! Los!\" by Tanya Degurechaff (Aoi Yuuki), is a decent ED that somewhat accomplishes the same goal, except this one is just passable whereas the OP is awesome. The music is also decent at what it tried to do, but isn't very memorable despite being actually kinda good.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the dub, it's alright. Most of the background and named character voices are pretty alright. However, I have issue with the voice of Tanya. To be fair to Monica Rial (the VA for Tanya), I don't really think any english voice actor could've really nailed the role of Tanya' and she does do the best she can while being one of the better possible picks for that character. Unfortunately, some moments fall noticeably flat and the character doesn't really lend itself to any english voice actor aside from a 10-12 year-old girl who's willing to sound really deranged and composed at the same time, sort of like a little-girl DBZ KAI Frieza. All in all, not a bad dub.\\n\\n\r\nLook, can't we just all admit that this was a terrible season of anime? Whether you agree or not, what a coincidence that the last anime I tackle this season manages to represent everything wrong about Winter Anime 2017, from awful frame rate hiccups, to god-awful and overused CGI, to a dearth of memorable characters that get properly fleshed out, to asinine plot twists and writing that abandons all cohesion. These were surprisingly popular trends for this infernal anime season in particular. When I first heard of this show, I had hoped it would be Shuumatsu no Izetta done right after that show turned from  promising series into a pathetic mess, but after the first episode, I lost faith. Said faith died even more the more this show kept going on. With all that said, before I find myself court-martialed for hating this popular war anime, I shall bid you adieu.",

            "content": "How would a modern day salaryman from Japan, an especially ruthless and career-focused one too, manage to survive as a little orphan girl in a war ridden world where magic exists and a being that calls himself God tries his best to make things harder for said girl?\r\nThe synopsis might sound a little messy. And honestly, Youjo Senki is an anime that I didn't plan to watch but tempted by the pretty amazing opening song, I decided to give it a try when it started airing. And I'm very glad I did. \r\nThe aforementioned salaryman was in his original life a cold person that onlyfocused on his job. He didn't feel any sympathy towards those he had to fire. His goal was to climb the steps of his career and to live an easy and peaceful life. And it was all going according to his plan, until the day a man he had fired took revenge on him and pushed him in front of a train. In the moment of his death, he is faced by a being that claims to be God. Believing that modern people don't need God, the protagonist denies his existence until the very end. And as a result of their conversation, he is reborn in a world of dire straits, where he needs to live on as a little orphan girl in the harsh reality of war. And in spite of the bad situation around, our protagonist - now known as Tanya Degurechaff - doesn't plan on giving up on living a proper life.\\n\r\nThe overall concept is pretty unusual. I was skeptical at first, but in the end it works fine. The show tells not only a story of a very young girl progressing with her military career, but also a fight between her and said Being X who tries to make Tanya recognize him as God. The story is very interesting and engaging, mostly thanks to the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nTanya is a character that is very nice to follow. She's dead set against Being X and manages to live on and be successful in spite of all the hardships he puts her in. It's fun to watch her accomplish new things and it's fun to watch her struggle. She's a strong character and, since her personality remains the same as in her previous life, she is still focused on pursuing an easy life and avoiding unnecessary mess. But if everything goes wrong, she puts her mind to it to overcome the obstacles.\\n\r\nHer experiences in the previous life weren't fruitless either. Not only does she have some knowledge of the war which in her original life had already happened, but her cold and career minded personality is perfectly suited for a soldier. But there's more - she's also progressing as a character in her new life. In the end, we can see she is a little different - she has gotten to know more about the human nature and its unpredictability. And she uses this knowledge. I loved Tanya and now she is one of my favorite characters in general. She fuels the story and is perfect fit for a main character, if you're not looking for perfectly moral warriors of justice. It's not that she's complete villain either. In spite of her being called evil, she's not essentially a bad person. She avoids unnecessary conflict and likes to have things peaceful. But at the same time, she doesn't hesitate to do everything to wipe out her enemies and she shows no mercy for the disobedient comrades either. And to top it off, she's genuinely enjoyng the battlefield.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, it's only Tanya that shines so brightly in this show. There aren't many memorable characters. There are many bland personalities and her soldiers don't have much to them either. There was only a little more focus on a small group of them, especially on Viktoriya. But unfortunately, the story hasn't progressed enough to put her or any other side character in the spotlight yet. Also, the main villain of the story only appears in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it's decent. The not so pretty CGI is used here and there but it's something I'm able to forgive - it didn't hurt my eyes that badly. No major animation problems spotted either. The character design may be disappointing for some, since it was changed quite a lot in comparison with the LN/manga designs. But honestly, I didn't mind. It's not a show where I'd like to see a cutie that ran away from some shoujo show and put a military uniform on. Which is yet another good point of the show! Tanya is not your average cute loli, and she's even less cute if you remember who she originally is. The characters in Youjo Senki aren't supposed to be some eyecandy, and I got used to the way they look quickly. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was very good. The background music was remarkable, but at the same time a little repetitive. It wasn't that big a problem though. It sounded good. The opening song - Jingo Jungle by Myth & Roid - is a pretty amazing song and actually the thing that made me give the show a try. The song fits the show very well. And the same thing can be said about the ending song - Los! Los! Los! sung by Tanya (Yuuki Aoi). Her VA did an EXCELLENT job not only with said song but with her voice as Tanya in general. The voice acting was generally good in this show, but it's Yuuki Aoi that shines very, very brightly this time. Her monologues are really something else. There's also another ending song (episode 8) which is Sensen no Realism by Niina Mako. The song is just about perfect, I'd say.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that is worth mentioning is the fact that this show is very detailed. More than you could think at first. I'm not gonna lie, I'm not very good at history. But there were some pretty neat details here and there. There are other details that aren't related to history, but also nice to see. Like Tanya's change of voice throughout the series, her problems with carrying the rifle (explained in the Youjo Shenki mini anime), the way conversation and fight scenes are choreographed (where camera movements tell us who is on the advantage at the moment). \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, in spite of its flaws (like there being no other particularly important character aside from Tanya or the last episode ending on a cliffhanger), Youjo Senki is an extremely enjoyable show that is far from being generic. And it's mostly this enjoyment, my love for Tanya and the excitement I felt waiting for each episode that make me give it a 9. It's not perfect but it's definitely solid (putting away the very personal feelings, I'd say it deserves a 7 or so) and it depends on the viewers tastes how much they are going to enjoy this anime because like I said - it's mostly Tanya that fuels the show and not everyone likes her and the overall idea of this anime. I enjoyed it A LOT and I hope with all my heart that it wasn't just an ad for the LN and that there wil be another season. Which would make sense, considering it's NUT's first anime and a pretty successful one.",

            "content": "I'm writing this review based on my impressions of the first few episodes, and what I know about the manga and LN. Its unfortunate, but this anime is probably already hopeless.\r\nIn a NUTshell (NUT is the apparently new studio responsible for this), this anime has failed. The art is crap, the animation is crap, the screenplay is crap, the sound is crap, and the voice acting is crap. No amount or quality of plot could possibly make up for this.\r\nArt: 3\r\nCan be said as simply as this: \"What the hell did they do to the main characters' faces?\" The art is extremely basic and lackingin detail; take a quick look at the art from the LN or manga, and you should instantly see the massive downgrade in quality. Even without that comparison, it's some of the lazies and shittiest art you can find in any commercial anime.\\n\r\nMy complaints that you should probably skip:\\n\r\nSingle lines as eyebrows, no textures, no details, maybe 6 different shades of color per character (2 for hair, 3 for uniform, 1 for skin. Complete shit), and a full color palatte that I can probably count on my fingers. The backgrounds look pretty much all the same, and in the few minimalistic action scenes, there aren't any backgrounds at all; just solid blocks of monocolored shit. And what the hell is with Serebryakov's diseased dinnerplate eyes with spines sticking out the side? Her face looks completely f***ed up.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nAs if the art wasn't bad enough by itself; the anime boasts tons of simple panning, still-frames and frames with just mouth movement, tons of recycling the same animation (For example: portrait of person A's mouth moving, switches to portrait of person B's mouth moving, then to the same previous portrait of person A's mouth moving); overall, it's some lazily-ass garbage; a pathetic excuse for animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is mediocre, the sound effects (such as guns or cannons) are completely off and have garbag depth and quality, and the voice acting is predominantly shit; about as bad as your average English dub. Every single character aside from Tanya sound slow, stupid, and retarded, and the idiotic dialogue doesn't help either.\\n\r\nTanya herself is supposed to be intimidating despite her age, but it comes out as flat and childish in the voice acting (Maaybe I'm being a bit harash with Tanya's voice, but the rest are truly horrific).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nNone of these people act or sound like they've ever been in a battle in the entire lifetime. Dumb narration monologues that state the obvious are common (Like \"He's doing that? But that should be impossible!\" or \"What? He just used an explosive shell!). Moreover, they sound like carefree, blind idiots, as if they were from some slife of life anime, not a war anime.\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\r\nIt's obviously too early to begin judging the plot, but all other aspects heavily swing this anime into the \"complete shit\" rating.\\n\r\nIf you were wondering, the anime is based in an alternate setting of WWI that includes mages, set from Germany's (The Empire's) perspective. Not particularly innovative so far, since much of the anime follows real history.",

            "content": "Let's start off strong: I hate Youjo Senki. I hate what it aims to be, I hate what it is, I hate that it tries to do things it clearly can't do. I'm an incredibly positive guy, always searching for the enjoyment in any type of series, and yet Youjo Senki cannot achieve the simplest of goals I could have set for it: help me with finding those positives.\r\nI will refer to Tanya as \"she\" instead of \"he\" throughout this review and hope that doesn't bother anybody. \r\n*Spoilers included* \r\nStory: 3 \r\nThe Saga of Tanya the Evil is first and foremost an isekaianime. A very grounded businessman dies after a worker he previously fired throws him under a speeding train. Just before he dies, God, or Being X as the show refers to it, approaches him to talk about his lack of faith and his life lacking values that a human should have. As an atheist, the businessman tries to disprove his existence (Uh, how?), which leads God to reincarnate him into an alternate world as a little girl. This world is one in which war is the main topic, strongest army units are mages: flying soldiers that are able to power up their shots through the use of crystals, and one where EVERYONE IS STUPID AND FAILS AT DECISION MAKING SO BAD THAT IT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE. \\n\r\nMy number one gripe with the series are the enemy soldiers and how they compare to Tanya and her squad. Episode one was enough to make me angry. Just to point a couple of horrendous, illogical moments in those 24 minute episode: \\n\r\n- a scout went straight up to the air instead of moving left or right and got sniped instantly. \\n\r\n- Ground units cannot dodge. \\n\r\n- Neither can air units AKA mages \\n\r\n- Tanya's the only character that can dodge \\n\r\n- All that Tanya needs to do in order to win a battle is fire off a couple of her magic attacks \\n\r\n- A squad leader decides to waste a ton of magic energy of all his men just to kill a couple of scouts, not caring about a counterattack that could happen (Spoiler: it happens) \\n\r\n- Soldiers are too often insubordinate towards their superiors \\n\r\n- People can go on an important mission, despite their squad leaders saying no, if they ask hard enough \\n\r\nLet me remind you, that this is a serious war, where people die probably every couple of seconds. \\n\r\nAt that point I had hoped that this would maybe be addressed, that some actually reasonable decisions are going to be made, that the threat would grow bigger. Nope. Tanya and her team attacked people by aiming at the enemy and flying towards them as they stare into the barrels of their guns and die like flies. The first dodge that an enemy performed happened in episode 6. When that took place, one of Tanya's subordinates said \"Wow, those guys are good!\" \\n\r\nAre. You. Kidding. Me. \\n\r\nThe standard for an enemy is either one that stays in one place or moves in a straight line. It's not hard to see why, this is the first anime of studio NUT, their budget was limited, they couldn't animate all the movement they wanted, but this is not an excuse at all. The camera could be placed and moved differently to give the illusion of a more living battlefield, they could use less close ups of the kills and instead focused on the shooting soldiers, Tanya or someone else could get hit from time to time and so on. I would even prefer more CGI over the lack of any sort of dangerous atmosphere in this show. \\n\r\nThe second big problem I had was the inconsistent intelligence of certain characters. Tanya, who is actually a businessmen on the inside, after reading a lot of books through her young life, is apparently more capable of creating strategies than the HQ is, which is full of people that probably studied war for 30-40 years. Even if I took into account the facts that Tanya came from a world where wars already took place, or she's just naturally talented in those type of things, that would still mean that everyone else is inferior to that one, little human being. And yet, the HQ finally get their shit together and make a proper plan that ends up being a very good one. I am not able to imagine how they were able to do that though, considering that they weren't able to push back the enemy until one person came along. \\n\r\nThirdly: What really is Being X? He clearly isn't omnipotent, he would easily achieve his goal if he was, he can't predict the future, his actions tend to have very little affect on Tanya or even fail miserably, he gets outsmarted by a mere human, so there's no way his plans are something that he came up with on the go and so on. Also, why would he prioritise this one being over any other? Giving no real rules to what is the God figure and how can it function isn't a problem on its own, that stuff may get explained later, but it becomes one when he is a rather active part of the conflict. It becomes even worse when some of his plans have nearly no effect. For example, in one of the last episodes, another person gets a similar power to Tanya's. The thing is, he doesn't kill a single person, even when he shot one in the back by surprise. Nice power you got there buddy. Tanya killed a small group with her first shot after receiving that power and she was seen flying around before she did that. \\n\r\nBut I can forgive anything, absolutely anything, if the show can still be interesting and/or entertaining to me despite its flaws. That's the main reason for why I watch anime. But this anime wasn't able to get to me. The reason being, as soon as Tanya receives her powers, she was able to annihilate almost anything in her way. When you know that there's a really strong weapon that a character can use at any time without consequences or any particular preparation, it makes the fights feel less exciting and repetitive. Was it interesting then? Not really. With everything depending on a God's whim and interference, it was rather random and very sudden. For Tanya to face a serious obstacle, Being X had to interfere or one of her subordinates had to pull something off, but I can't have any idea that it will happen, it just does and I'm supposed to go with that plot point. I don't want to do that though, I want to know what triggered that reaction at that exact point or why would that specific moment go the way it did. It just doesn't leave a lot in the back of my mind, or when it does, it uses that randomly once again. That's not always a bad thing, there were a couple of moments where that paid off and I was genuinely surprised while also understanding how that plot twist works. There were instances of decent writing and it sucks because the quality is so inconsistent, ranging from good to awful. \\n\r\nAs for the other strong points of the series, I have to say that it's a pretty solid deviation from the isekai genre. Unlike most other series where the main character is pretty wimpy and doesn't know what's going on, Tanya comes in with a mission. She's gonna beat God at his own game. That part of the story definitely works well, it pushes it far enough to make me interested in the ending alone. It's just a very good concept and I'm sure it will sell many people tired of the usual isekai scheme in some series nowadays. \\n\r\nAnd that's about it. \\n\r\nAll other themes and motives are completely pushed aside for the sake of getting from point A to point B, but what's the point when you left the important things behind? This show doesn't evolve, it just switches rapidly for the sake of convenience. I'm just done. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4 \\n\r\nDear God, I don't know who came up with the idea of putting a grumpy, atheist businessman into a child with magic abilities that later becomes a soldier but I gotta give him this one. Tanya is really well stylized as a character and grows throughout the series. She starts off as a psycho that desperately tries to cling to survival by using any means into a caring leader of a group that could follow her to the pits of hell, not losing her ideals at the same time. She's smart and collected, but when something doesn't go her way she gets angry and annoyed. She is stylized to contrast her appearance, she keeps on putting masks in front of different people but is still the same on the inside. She fits the tone of the show and thrives in the setting. When the entire focus is set on her alone, it becomes rather captivating. Her goal and way of living is compelling, maybe even silly, in a positive way. Can't really blame her character for the rest of the cast not getting treated the same way. That's because they all get very little detailing compared to Tanya. Once again, she tilts the balance too much. \\n\r\nLet me explain how do I see the cast of the show. Essentially, you could take any character from a specific group, like Tanya's squad or generals back at the HQ, and replace it by another one from that same group, and you'll get the exact same set of characteristics. Their reactions, dialogue, way of thinking would still be the exact same. I can't find a point to this, so the way I see it, it simply has none. While they made a good choice on focusing on Tanya, it makes it so she's the only complicated, convoluted character in the entire show. \\n\r\nThere were two other attempts at creating characters. One of them was Serebryakova, another girl that was the second in command in Tanya's group. She spent the most time with Tanya on the battlefield. At first she was a clumsy soldier that acted suddenly and impulsively, but by the end, it's almost like she got rid of her emotions. She grows into a cold killer that's able to sleep despite the hardest of tasks ahead of her and the most brutal things behind her. But.... why? How did that happen? Was it just the fact that she spent time with Tanya? Then why didn't anyone else become this way? Her only defining characteristic in her group is the fact that she's a girl, is that it? At one point, without me even realising, she randomly changed into a different person on the battlefield. \\n\r\nRandom.... sudden... where did I hear that before? \\n\r\nThe second attempt at making a distinctive character was Erich von Rerugen. He was one of the only people to notice how brutal and demonic Tanya's behaviour is. He simply didn't trust her. He tried to convince the rest of the generals that giving her more power is wrong, but nobody listened to him. This is where his character importance ends. He provides nothing more to the series. \\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are as replaceable as they could be. I like using the world \"blob\" recently, so I'll use it again, because that's exactly what they are. It's like all their lines could be said by just one of them, like someone created only one character and thought it's okay to stretch him onto multiple people. I don't think I can go any more precise about how I feel. \\n\r\nConcluding this part, the cast is clearly created to serve the purpose of surrounding Tanya rather than being their own people. I can see that, but I don't like it at all. At least Tanya was mostly entertaining to follow, having exactly her as an MC is probably the best selling point. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 4 \\n\r\nYou better thank the sakuga or I'll be all over this. \\n\r\nThe lowest point, as expected. Studio NUT's first project with little budget simply had to include serious amount of CGI and other tricks to save up some money for the important moments. While I could get behind making ground troops CGI, they're going to die in a matter of seconds anyway, but using it so much on mages as they soar and maneuver through the air looks uncomfortably different compared to the rest of the show. Even some key characters can't escape the harsh treatment, we get to see quite a few shots of CGI Tanya. Another thing was the mouth movement, most of the time it's simply the same mouth copied and pasted onto a different character. Perhaps it's not noticeable on the regular, because there are close ups that indeed differ, but at times it's silly seeing so many characters having the same mouth movement. \\n\r\nDespite that, there ARE moments where cutting corners paid off. Some specific battles look much better than others. Considering how important those were, I'm pretty sure that they saved the money to pay the animators for those scenes alone. Most notable one would be the fight in episode 11, where movement is very smooth and energetic. \\n\r\nBesides that, the directing is nothing to write home about. There are way too many still or reused shots, lack of interesting ideas that could help with the heavy usage of CGI, camera placement is very plain so the shots often lack depth they require and such.  \\n\r\nThe art style looks okay, lot of gray, brown and dark green. Those colors complement the militaristic setting well. The character designs are a bit off, Tanya and Serebryakova look completely different from the male characters. They're drawn differently, have totally different face outlines and shapes. Male characters look much harsher and they have more details. On paper this works, but visually the women stand out more than Necessary. Their gender should be enough to make them stand out amongst all those men flying around them, but with this choice it makes it feel awkward. On their own though, the designs are okay. \\n\r\nThe OP and ED were poorly directed and animated, just like the rest of the show they use a lot of still shots, some artwork or backgrounds, sometimes random shots from the show. There is absolutely nothing more to write about here. \\n\r\nYoujo Senki is not the most visually impressing show to say the least... \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\r\nI will give credit where credit is due: The sound design is great. Before I even get to the music, I have to mention how well implemented the sound effects are. \\n\r\nFirstly, great choice in sounds. They're definitely trying to help the utter lack of dangerous atmosphere simply by sounding dangerous. Everything is very loud, often overtaking the other sounds like voices. This really gives off the feeling of how much chaos is going on around the battlefield. The sounds of magic items actually fit pretty well with the rest of the show. They sound a bit mechanical, which works really well with the time period and setting (alternative World War I). Not like it came off as a surprise, the sound director for the show was the great Iwanami Yoshikazu, who previously worked on famous anime such as Fate/Zero, Unlimited Blade Works, Baccano, Psycho Pass and Sword Art Online. He's been around for a while now, he knows what he's doing. \\n\r\nThe voices were expertly picked. I usually don't talk about this too much, I watch series in sub and I don't feel comfortable judging Japanese voices, but Tanya's voice sounds exactly like she is an angry, annoyed child who got access to some insane power. simply put: she sounds crazy and mad, like she should. Miki Schinichiro makes an appearance as Erich, his voice is always great. The other ones do their job well, can't really \\n\r\nThe music isn't falling behind too far. It captures the very dynamic feel of the show, but doesn't really make it reach new heights. Accompanies the atmosphere, but doesn't go past being the sidekick. I'd say it's the minimum quality it had to perform at to make it qualify as \"good\" for me. I have found myself thinking about the OST in between episodes, so that's a good sign. \\n\r\nWhile the openings weren't well directed, the songs themselves are very catchy and energetic. They feel a bit off when you put the alongside the atmosphere of the show, but they're good enough to overcome that issue for me. JINGO JUNGLE by MYTH & ROID is simply a very good song with very strong lyrics and \"Los! Los! Los!\" sang by Tanya's seiyuu also feels good on the ears. Those are the kind of openings where you want them going on in the background so you can prepare a sandwich or something. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4 \\n\r\nRather than focusing on its mistakes, Youjo Senki moved forward with a pace that at least kept things enticing. With a couple of interesting takes on war and the isekai genre, this should have turned into my highlight of the winter season. While it wasn't per say boring, but my experience with Youjo Senki was rather annoying, not interesting, filled to the brim with mistakes and holes that were never covered. Having only a couple of smiles on my face throughout its runtime, I would say I had a pretty bad time with it. It tumbled down in every aspect, but never made a comeback that could save it in my eyes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4 \\n\r\nTanya simply isn't that good. No matter at what angle I looked at it, it never was good. It struggled to find its own direction and truly making the most of what it had to offer. Numerous other studios were able to find ways to cover for their lack of budget numerous times before studio NUT came along, but it didn't really try to follow those footsteps. They made an attempt to do what they wanted to do with the money and time they had, which could be commendable if not for the fact that most of my issues depend on the skills of the people writing the show. If that's lacking, no amount of money can save the project. That's how I look at the show - a failed trial run, a miserable attempt at doing things \"their own way\". Unfortunately, this turned out to be a serious disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nIs it only me, or does every time that Tanya gets annoyed at Being X, she sounds like the villains from Scooby Doo? \\n\r\n\"And I would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for you Being X!\" \\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion, but I can't really recommend you to develop your own.",

            "content": "Youjo Senki\u2019s protagonist Tanya quickly rose to become my personal favorite character of the winter 2017 season. I guess psychotic loli nazis make for exquisite characters.\r\n________________________________\r\nPlot: 6/10\r\nSet in an alternate universe that is similar to the era of the first World War, Youjo Senki follows Tanya Degurechaff as she fights in the Empire\u2019s army. This empire is essentially the world\u2019s version of Germany. In fact, every territory mentioned in the anime shares a geographic resemblance to actual European countries in our world. The major difference between reality and this fantasy realm is that magic exists in this parallel universe while it obviously (though unfortunately) doesn\u2019texist in our society. It is revealed that Tanya has an abnormally high affinity with magic, which is the predominating reason why she is able to quickly rise through the Empire\u2019s ranks along with her cunning and manipulation skills. Youjo Senki\u2019s story follows Tanya as she fights for the Empire and steadily rises to become their most notorious soldier.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of execution, Youjo Senki has both positives and negatives. It does an excellent job at introducing Tanya and providing background on her sadistic personality and distorted mentality. The anime quickly delves into her backstory, giving viewers valuable information on Tanya that helps them to better understand her goals and actions. However, at around the midpoint of the amine, it feels like the detail put into the plot dissipated. It seemed like Tanya\u2019s motivations and goals evaporated and were replaced with her blindingly following the orders that were given to her by her superior officers. In the initial episodes, viewers were given insight on Tanya\u2019s reluctance to follow the commands bestowed upon her and were showed the ways in which she planed to worm her way out of undesirable situations. Yet later on in the anime it feels like she just blatantly accepts whatever the higher ups tell her to do or just complains about the orders but then executes them without question, which results in blandness that could have been avoided if Tanya had simply acted like she did in the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story, the anime did a fairly decent job at portraying how differing countries can end up disagreeing and fighting to a point that culminates in a world war. My problem was that there wasn\u2019t much information given on why the Empire was fighting on so many different fronts in the first place. I believe that the first episode might have quickly explained this, but it was so poorly done that I can\u2019t even recollect what that reason might have been. Was it for territory? Power? Could it have ben out of desperation? Were they attacked first? Whatever the reason might have been, it was so indeterminately established that it made the warring seem somewhat pointless. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I\u2019d like to mention is how useless trench warfare is in the world of Youjo Senki. Just think about it. In this universe, magic exists, and individuals who posses magic, known as mages, are given flying devices and enhanced weaponry. If technology is advanced enough to create these flying contraptions, then why even bother to waste time and funding on ground forces? The mages can literally decimate them with an aerial assault as shown in the first episode. While it was an important battle tactic in the first World War, trench warfare and grounded units in general just seem like an utter waste in this anime. It takes so much time and effort to dig trenches, yet soldiers in them get wiped out at a laughably swift pace by the mages. Shouldn\u2019t the government and military of these nations focus on building up their mage forces since they can literally wipe out entire battalions without taking a single loss as shown with Tanya and her squadron? \\n\\n\r\n________________________________\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about this section. On one hand, the backgrounds and scenery can look very vivacious and detailed at times. When it comes to the battles, dark colors and imagery are used to emphasize the tense atmosphere that a battlefield is meant to have. However, I find that watching simplistically animated individuals flying around in the sky while randomly shooting at each other gets boring rather fast. The only character that keeps these scenes fresh and interesting is Tanya, whose insane facial expressions alone make the fight scenes much more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI start to have problems when it comes to the character designs. Excluding Tanya, they are all rather plain, but there is nothing particularly wrong with most of them. However, the appearance of secondary protagonist Viktoriya is quite lackluster. I think the animators were trying to make her look cute and innocent, but her design is just sloppy. I have mixed feelings on Tanya\u2019s design. Sometimes she looks perfectly fine, however in some cases (usually when her lips are drawn in an overinflated manner or her eyes look weird), I\u2019m not that fond of her appearance. There just seems to be an inconsistency with the art regarding Tanya.\\n\r\n________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTanya\u2019s voice actress, Aoi Yuuki, does an exceptional job at making her character sound both adorable as well as insane when necessary. She really brings life to Tanya, and I just loved listening to her voice. The opening theme song is performed by one of my favorite groups, Myth & Roid, and is definitely an above average composition. The ending theme song, Los! Los! Los!, is an addictingly catchy tune, and it has become one of my personal favorite anime songs. It is sung by Aoi Yuuki, so more props to her. The sound quality in Youjo Senki is easily one of its stronger points. \\n\\n\r\n________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTanya Degurechaff is one of the most entertaining characters that I\u2019ve seen in awhile. As I stated in the beginning, Tanya is essentially a psychotic loli nazi (yes, I know that nazis are from WW2 and not WW1, meaning that its inaccurate to label Tanya as a nazi since Youjo Senki is set in a period similar to that of the first World War, but I find the title \u2018nazi\u2019 to be very befitting of Tanya) who derives pleasure from the suffering and annihilation of her enemies and is stimulated by the carnage effectuated from battle. This is honestly enough to certify Tanya as a rather good character, but does she accomplish enough to be considered a great character? In all honesty, I don\u2019t think so. The latter episodes don\u2019t really develop her much, and the enjoyment derived from watching her slowly decreases as the anime progresses. Nonetheless, Tanya is still a detailed and intriguing character, and its refreshing to watch her in action.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to dedicate much time discussing the supporting cast since they really aren\u2019t worth mentioning. They\u2019re all there to either advance the plot, fill up space, or be sacrifices to Tanya. Oh, and there\u2019s also Viktoriya. I really don\u2019t see what her purpose is.\\n\\n\r\n________________________________\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nYoujo Senki starts off strong by showcasing its leading character completing epic feats throughout the first couple of episodes. Unfortunately, with each passing episode, especially after episode four or five, my interest in the show steadily dropped. It was still good, but I felt like the plot started to drag on at a slow pace without much happening outside of Tanya and her squad killing enemies who would just sort of appear without any significant explanation on their goals and/or purpose. All the anime let us know was that they were all vastly inferior to Tanya, which always meant that the outcome of these skirmishes would be the same. This resulted in some boring episodes that honestly weren\u2019t very entertaining viewing experiences. The only thing that remained consistently enjoyable to watch was the sadistic nature of our leading lady Tanya, and quite honestly, that was enough to keep me interested in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n________________________________\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the overall plot left more to be desired and the animation took away from the general presentation of the anime, Youjo Senki was still able to be a good series due to its entertaining protagonist as well as its great sound quality and the general enjoyment derived from watching it. If you\u2019re looking for a strong and/or insane female lead, I\u2019d suggest watching this anime. If you\u2019re into vaguely historical anime integrated with fantasy, then I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend Youjo Senki. \\n",

            "content": "Before Youjo Senki even aired, I had preconceived notions about it. Based on its ridiculous main character and overall premise, I was sharpening my literary claws in preparation to critically rip it to shreds in this eventual review. Lollis, reincarnation, magic and the tedious politics of war were all aspects I roll my eyes at individually, so naturally I didn\u2019t have my hopes up very high after the first episode. After concluding the final segment of Youjo Senki, I can say without doubt that my initial impressions couldn\u2019t have been farther from my analysis of the finished product. It\u2019s an anime I wanted to hate,but in the end surprised the hell out of me. \\n\\n\r\nThe Saga of Tanya the Evil starts out on a battlefield. The fog of war is palpable and laden with smells of gunpowder and blood. Screams of agony and despair resonate from friend and foe alike, causing your bones to shake with an uncontrollable fear. This is war. The first thing I noticed about the anime was the expert level of sound design. Each explosion and gunshot echoed in my brain, causing my focus to increase with each passing moment. \\n\\n\r\nThen, as if transported from the wrong anime\u2026 Tanya appeared.\\n\\n\r\nThe stark juxtaposition of the cute, Aryan 9 year old against the malevolence of a gruesome battlefield was hard to swallow. I just couldn\u2019t grasp how she was written into the anime at all. To add to her perplexing position, appearing beside Tanya was another glassy-eyed damsel, who clumsily trudged through the combat zone, narrowly evading enemy fire. Adding to the gunfire and merciless killings was the boom and crack of magical attacks from certain individuals. Mages, who could harness supernatural forms of energy contributed to the battle, a clear reminder that I was watching an anime and not a literal historical account. I paused the episode to digest what I was seeing. I know anime in general has its fair share of nonsensical moments, but the contrast of these characters and abilities with the haunting atmosphere was jarring. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series continued, I became less fixated on Tanya\u2019s chibi appearance, and more focused on the personality she exhibited, or the precarious situations she found herself in. Without spoiling, her backstory and purpose is explained, though not in the most sensical way. This disclosure causes most of the \u201cwhat the hell?\u201d moments to dissipate, and triggers the viewer to really hone in on the finer aspects of what Youjo Senki has to offer. The magic abilities some characters possessed were also loosely explained, as anime often does. Though I\u2019m not sure how I expected these powers to be any bit of believable.\\n\\n\r\nThe main story itself is nothing special. We get dropped into an ongoing war between nations (presumably during World War I), both at each other\u2019s throats trying to gain the upper hand in the theatre of battle. Tanya is a captain of a small battalion, relatively insignificant to the grand scheme of things. Through willpower and a stern leadership style, Tanya excels through the ranks in order to gain supreme power and ultimately defy her maker, God himself. There aren\u2019t many \u201caha\u201d moments or intellectual pondering to be had, just a straightforward war story with the added twist of a cutthroat preteen at the helm. I will also admit that while entrancing to look at, the magic elements weren\u2019t entirely necessary, as the series had enough occult moments to go around.\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously people, we don\u2019t need a recap FOR A TWELVE EPISODE SERIES.\\n\\n\r\nIf you care for historical fiction or war jargon, this anime is chock-full of it. After the noisy, action-packed battle scenes fade out, they are followed by debriefs, strategery and political patois to ignite the interest of any history buff. Very little of the past or present parallels our world technically, but the rhetoric and red tape of fighting a war are synonymous with some of the battles fought in the 1900\u2019s. Many risks are taken, with some paying dividends while others blowing up in the commander\u2019s faces. It can be pretty engrossing if you can get past Tanya\u2019s childish appearance.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Youjo Senki are irrelevant with the sole exception of Tanya. She\u2019s cute, ruthless and has a severe case of Napoleon syndrome. At first, I was so nearsighted that I assumed any other main protagonist would\u2019ve been a better fit for the story, but as the anime went on I actually began to think the opposite. Having such a unique character as Tanya for the lead gave Youjo Senki the propensity to stand out from the crowd of its genre. I could appreciate the route the writers went with her backstory and who she really was, but I think her past life should\u2019ve been elaborated on a bit more. In the end, Tanya grew on me as a character, and I eventually even began to empathize with her situations, something inconceivable to comprehend when she was introduced. One complaint I have about the characters is the trouble I had differentiating between friend and foe at various points in the show. Although Tanya and Serebryakova stood out due to their arresting appearance, the others disappeared into a muddled mess of similar faces.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and action scenes in Youjo Senki are some of the stronger points of the anime. No pixel lag or framing issues at all. Definitely one of the strongest showing in visuals this season, and the animators should be patting themselves on the back. The art style is grim and uninviting, utilizing a blend of muted dark colors. This style accentuates the vibe of each scene, and adds to the militant structure of the strategic scenes. The character models for Tanya and her female right hand are vibrant and contrast the battlefield well, and their facial expressions all flowed accurately.\\n\\n\r\nThere hasn\u2019t been an anime I\u2019ve pointed out solely due to sound quality since I watched the 2015 release of Knights of Sidonia. Anyone who\u2019s seen that show knows how much realism and feeling was put into each sound effect, and how satisfying they were to listen to. Youjo Senki\u2019s sound engineers emulate the harsh conditions of a war setting meticulously and with a level of finesse barely rivaled. I was quite impressed. The OP, though not always there worked to get the viewers pumped for some intense action scenes, while the epic, pulsing ED was my favorite of the season. Aoi Yuuki did a bang-up job portraying the adolescent tyrant, and from what I\u2019ve read she had a lot of fun playing her as well. The rest of the OST flowed together beautifully, with each track transitioning seamlessly into the next, and adding a level of believability to the accompanied scene.\\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, should you watch Youjo Senki? I was ultimately impressed with how much my mood shifted through the 12 episodes, and can give the anime a solid recommendation. The story won\u2019t blow you away, and the characters (sans Tanya) are uninspiring, but the action scenes and strategic nature of the battles will offer plenty of incentive to stick around. Plus, if you\u2019re all about reincarnation and fighting \u201cGod\u201d, there\u2019s plenty of goodies for you to indulge yourself with. I\u2019d recommend this series to fans of action shows or large scale battle shows like Attack on Titan, or Overlord, though the historical elements could relate its fans to Joker Game or others. Surprise of the season? Possibly, but I was certainly glad I watched it, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like it too! Thanks, as always for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my Winter \u201817 reviews!",

            "content": "Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, then it\u2019s probably recognized that the idea of a main character being killed and reincarnated as a totally new person in a new world is a recent new trope. Youjo Senki (Saga of Tanya the Evil) jumps right into the story like pouring rice. It gets more complex as we\u2019ll learn more about the political affairs, wars, and characters. If you fancy fantasy war stories, then Youjo Senki welcomes you with open arms.\r\nTo be honest, Youjo Senki can be an intimidating title. The promotional image alone can provoke some thoughts for viewers as they will wonder what kindof person Tanya really is. The show label her as one of the most dangerous individuals among the Imperial army. However, the truth is that this seemingly deadly girl was once a salaryman but was reincarnated after angering a mysterious entity (Being X). The show chronicles Tanya and her dangerous adventure as a fighter on the battlefield.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the setting takes place in alternate world, it\u2019s noticeable that it doesn\u2019t look much different from our very own. It has the look of the 20th century in Europe although magic exists in particular with weapon warfare. The troops involved in war doesn\u2019t look different either with their very human traits and besides magic, there really isn\u2019t anything abnormal. However, Tanya is a complex character that I would label as very different compared to a lot of the other characters. She is sadistic and self-serving based on her tactics and actions. Anyone that is part of her battalion can expected to be humiliated or trained in ways they can\u2019t begin to imagine. The constant mind games she engages with Being X brings a lot of psychology to her character and we learn about her personality. Throughout the series, we see that she constantly stands up against Being X and defies it while the latter tries to break her resolve. In ways, she can even be seen more as an anti-hero. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, if you fancy fantasy war stories, then this will be your cup of tea. Just do note that the show isn\u2019t really just about action but also a lot of internal affairs and military politics. It\u2019s also comparable in ways to World War I on the Europe Theater. Germany can be compared to as the Empire, while the Republic resembles France. The Legedonia Federation can be referenced to a united Scandinavia. The story itself may be somewhat confusing to understand as some characters\u2019 motives are not entirely clear. Being X is probably the guiltiest of this example. However, the war itself has a lot of reasons whether it\u2019s related to imperialism, political, or personal reasons. It still draws out the cruelty of war though with the violence, bloodshed, and causalities. It\u2019s also not uncommon to see trench warfare similar to those used in World War I and bombing of cities. The essence of magic brings the fantasy element to the war with flying devices and powerhouse spells. I can\u2019t imagine if our World War I would be fought with these new gadgets.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast of Youjo Senki isn\u2019t too dynamic. As the main female protagonist, Tanya steals the most highlight from this show thanks to her personality and skills. One other noticeable female character is Visha. As part of the Imperal Army, her personality is much kinder although still tough and vigilant. She also seems to understand Tanya and even believes that the way Tanya treats her subordinates is to ensure their survival in actual war. Unfortunately, the show doesn\u2019t really highlight many other characters from the Imperial Army as they stand behind the scenes. On the opposition of the Imperial Army, one character that stood out could be Anson Sioux, a man who develops a vendetta against Tanya. Despite some of these characters being given spotlight, Tanya is still the main event running the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow as a manga and light novel reader, I have not read too far into this series but the story still expands from where the anime left off. It\u2019s an incomplete adaptation and with just 12 episodes, I didn\u2019t expect that they can cover everything. However, I am satisfied with the overall portrayal of the anime as it captures the mood of the war. Even the comedy and humor are thrown in right with proper timing. Some episodes will also have cliffhangers that will get viewers to speculate future events. It\u2019s basically structured in a way that makes the show more thrilling.\\n\\n\r\nAs a series about war, you can definitely expect a lot of action. I am actually quite impressed by the way is animated by NUT, a studio that probably not a lot of people are familiar with. Nonetheless, the action is captured with fast paced movement and choreography. War elements are incorporated with realistic looking guns, uniforms, and its general setting. (war academies, shelters, trenches, etc) The part about magic is portrayed as crueler than what you can expect with aerial dogfights being a main attraction. Still, the most noticeable part about the show is still Tanya. She\u2019s like an angel with the heart of a demon. It\u2019s hard to take her seriously with the way she looks until you see her fight in battle. A running gag in the show made by older man often alludes that she looks like their daughter. What does impress me about the art expression is how it\u2019s able to bring Tanya\u2019s personality to its fullest to make the biggest impact. Sadistic expressions are not uncommon especially when she goes on a rampage. While the series has violence though, it does keep it less tame on television (maybe BD will leave them uncensored?). It still makes its point that the war is anything but a safe haven as bodies drop to the floor.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack wise, I think the show made it worthy of being a war story. I can\u2019t imagine how many times I have felt intimidated by Tanya just based on her voice alone when she\u2019s on a rampage. Not only that, the show brings in an impressive feel of psychology whenever Being X makes its presence. That sinister voice and god complex is hard to ignore. The OP and ED theme songs has a heavy metal-like instrumental sound although they both sound pretty similar. \\n\\n\r\nYoujo Senki is a show that I probably won\u2019t forget for a while and not easily recommendable for anyone. It has the ingredients to cook up a story that can intimidate any viewer on first sight. The first episode felt like it drops you into the middle of the story but once you get into the hang of it, it can be quite a ride. Tanya is probably a character that many people will remember from Winter 2017. A loli fighting on the battlefield while giving on demonic face expressions? How often do you see that?\\n",

            "content": "**No Spoilers\r\nYoujo Senki's concept is kind of risky, it is hard to understand what teh fok is going on  at first glance but can easily catch up if the plot is well executed by having good dialogues and decent narration. Youjo Senki is probably the best Anime of Winter 2017 ( all sequels aside ) It is the only series from start to finish delivered and surpasses my expectations, with episode 11 being all well-directed originally by Studio NUT is freaking amazing for a brandnew studio.\r\nStory 9/10 \r\nThe story is about a salaryman who was accidentally run down by a train and was rebornas a little blonde girl back in WW1( Tanya ). That concept alone is very interesting but a mysterious being calling himself a God just made the story more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nExplaining system / strategies of the military part is complicated but in this series, they tend to rely on heavy dialogues to explain complicated things such as new experiments, device and weapons which I must admit really worked for the series. But the most intriguing part is that Studio NUT  added some major events that is not part of the original light novel. yes it is major because 1. it can destroy the whole series easily if its direction is really bad and 2. putting such event makes the series more interesting if it's executed very well. A very risky decision coming from a new studio is really really bad but dude they manage to reach my expectations and with producing such great series. The plot of the series never dropped some direction from start to finish and putting such great work that is very interesting & entertaining with good dialogues and decent execution.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nA lot of viewers were criticizing the art style of the series. I think the studio made a good decision putting less detailed style to easily put great animation sequences if needed.\\n\\n\r\nThe series relies on good cinematography and well polished backgrounds when characters having interactions. The studio only animating the interaction / heavy dialogue scenes by 3 frames per second which is enough for that. They put more effort on their battle scenes and they reusing their explosion 2d animation from the entire series which is less time consuming and works perfectly. They manage to make new explosion animation on the 11th episode and really just add more quality to the production quality of the series. Having reused animation is not bad but the NUT manage to put of their reused animation in different ways. Action scenes are well directed by putting military strategies and it is not your typical shounen that only randomly fighting each other, putting decent choreography on the action scene is very enlightening. The fights also shows the character's attitude/emotions and every character differs, from very passive but very well strategic person to very aggressive but with bad coordination. It simply shows that Youjo Senki not only relies on Raw 2d animation but they also put some details to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe CGI is really bad on the early stages but manage to improve on the later stages. The studio's CGI was either used to put massive amount of people to cover up some time or put some CGI backgrounds to use when air fights are needed. They know that their CGI was kind of a low quality but they manage to pull that out by having quick paneling & point blank transitions and sometimes very far shot and cannot be distinguish even by zooming in. CGI backgrounds are freaking impressive tho, episode 6 was brilliant and ep 11 sky battle was also stellar. Putting good camera movements on the CGI works and by mixing up the Traditional 2d animation was amazing.Their 3d backgrounds are very well rendered and with such good details.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound is very very stellar, from Myth & Roid's Jingo Jungle to Mako Niina's Sensen no Realism. the soundtrack is well done, it puts some fight scenes into more good/aggressive sequence and builds up some excitement through out the action scenes. But the one really impresses me is that they never bothered getting a 2nd Ending theme and that was done by Mako Niina and it was perfect and fits very well on the series. Episode 8 were everyone is like is the series going an anime original and everybody having their doubts of the series bu then suddenly the 2nd ending started playing and it was fokin amazing. The 2nd Ending theme is the best of winter I must admit, It puts the viewer into some excitement and yet emotionally watching the sequence. The series ending theme really differs from all the music themes from all anime this winter, you can almost compare the ending to Rakugo's ending, they both well done and the sound is just amazing. Overall great soundtrack, great opening and topnotch 2nd ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTanya's development is nothing special but her characterization is insane, yes she is overpowered but her weakness is very noticeable. She was abandoned and its like she was very alone, only managing things all by herself.She has the knowledge but it seems like everyone doesn't understand her. Being X is a great villain, the character is very interesting and mysterious only having him on the series by saying some strange yet offensive lines that triggers Tanya.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters are the same, no massive developments but their characterization from the whole series is very strong, putting the plot more interesting and managing to put great interactions through out the whole series is just really good. No character developments on a series is bad to be honest but the series just progresses very well even without huge developments. The only development I know is when tanya being reincarnated and the other one where studio NUT originally directed ( not being part of the light novel )\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHaving Izetta The Last Witch dropped the whole plot on the 2nd half and became a disaster and also Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress with great concept but failed to impress on the 2nd half as an anime original. Studio NUT not only accomplished an amazing adaptation but also by putting their own original events on the later stage of the series just put the series on the top. Never dropped quality, stayed true to its plot and very well executed story. Overall an amazing military/magic series and very entertaining one. The series ended perfectly for a 2nd season but idk if we can get one in teh future.",

            "content": "Let's make it really basic and simple.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nI would've loved if they explained some things such as how this war started, the origin of the \"mages\", or even the story of the salaryman. That aside, you cannot just deny this is a hell of a story, how the salaryman(Tanya) doesn't believe in God(Mr.X) and this last refuses the fact that she/he doesn't believe in religion. You get to see some stuff that happened in the war, as well as some fiction, which is phenomenal. You get to see how anger can lead to anything in this world, which is pretty much true. IMO, i seriouslyloved it, but felt confused at the beginning, obviously understood most of the story at episode 2. Also, that ending though, the tease for a second season is too much.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10/10\\n\r\nThe art is just beautiful, pleasing to watch/see, backgrounds and landscapes were exquisite, the desings of the characters were so good, althought they were not as close as the LN or the manga, but the resemble was still there and it was beautifully made. Sometimes they used CGI, but barely noticeable and acceptable in any way.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10/10\\n\r\nThis is what i loved the most to be honest. The background music, the sounds of the guns and everything related to the war, the voice acting, the opening, the ending, everything was spectacular. But the complain i have, is that they seemed to not have that many people for voice acting as the person doing the \"Radio Command\" was also used in a lot of filler people.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat can i say. Character development for lots, for every single character. How they behave, how do they get angry or happy, their likings, their emotions and expressions. Althought the story centers on Tanya, they did take the time to show the development of all the characters. (This excluding the deity called Mr.X)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nFirst 7 episodes, i gave the show a 8 for enjoyment, it was missing some points here and there but nothing from the other world. But these last episodes have been more than fantastic and i really enjoyed every single second of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10\\n\r\nAs you see, i quite loved the show. You are free to disagree or agree, i don't really care. As always, pardon me for being redundant at times or any grammar error.",

            "content": "Forward: As of writing this review, I am roughly 5 episodes in, and I'm fresh from watching it, ergo I haven't had all the time necessary for all of the \"Refrigerator Logic\" to make itself apparent yet.  This is also my first review on MAL.  Keep this in mind.\r\nYoujo Senki has to be one of the biggest surprises of the season, coming from an entirely new studio and having one of the most idiotic-sounding concepts in recent memory.  However, Studio NUT has come out swinging with some fine work, and the story itself becomes far more impressive with context.  \r\nStory: 9/ Characters: 7\\n\r\nPerhaps the most surprising thing about this show so far is how strong its story has been, especially in the second and third episodes.  As is often the case, however, the plot summary does it no justice, and is especially bad, considering the show's outlandish concept.  The actual story is somewhat reminiscent of Odysseus's struggles with Poseidon, with a god putting the main character through trial after trial to prove the value a god has to a man.  It's quite an interesting argument, and one that hasn't reared its head in a while, as far as I'm aware.  \\n\\n\r\nTanya's character is far from the sympathetic protagonist, however.  She's cold, calculating, manipulative, and absolutely ruthless.  Not only that, but it becomes clear that her one-track mind has led her to a state of somewhat questionable sanity, without care for human suffering or emotion, and much less anything resembling mercy.  Everything is a means to an end.\\n\\n\r\nThe deity she so offended, the looming presence that is \"Being X,\" is, interestingly enough, much more the sympathetic entity.  While it's unclear whether X is a male, female, singular entity, or even possibly a collective, it appears to be an ultimately benign existence, happily handing out miracles and asking for nothing more than belief in it.  For those interested in the religious aspects of the story, it takes a fairly neutral stance, incorporating aspects of several major religions.  Agnostics probably won't be bothered, but I could see this being a potential turn-off for a hardcore atheist.  \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters, though, were rather lackluster.  This may be due to the fact that the story is still going, and they just haven't had time to develop yet, but very few of them seem to be relevant, and I'd even go so far as to say that many of those who are exist mainly as a foil for Tanya.  While this has built her character exceptionally well, and she's certainly interesting enough to hold the spotlight by herself, the presently weak supporting cast is one of the few things I feel is holding this show back.\\n\\n\r\nI do really like how the rest of the world responds to Tanya, however, albeit I do find a few encounters to be excessive or over-dramatic.  I definitely like how, for the most part, everyone just rolls with it after she shows her worth, which really speaks for itself.  But, the thing this show really lacks is a peer for Tanya, someone near her level.  Being X sorta fills this role, but its participation is limited, and Viktoriya, while she may be a good counterweight, really can't do more than be the audience's surrogate.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 / Sound: 7\\n\r\nI'm not going to say it's perfect, but it blows all reasonable expectations out of the water.  At first glance, it may look unbalanced and garish, but it's an easily acquired taste, and one that fits the story very, very well.  Studio Nut also does exceptionally well with the good old Crazy Face.  I haven't been this impressed with the animation of a single body part since the creepy hand movements in Konosuba.  The eyes, the mouth, the brows, they all move so well and contort in such beautifully horrifying ways that it's hard to fault it here.  At all.  The combat could be more fluid, and there are a few scenes that had a bit of noticeable weirdness.  That said, the animation looked far better than I expected, and some aspects, particularly the eyes, were nothing short of amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, meanwhile, performed exactly on-par with expectation.  There are some nice bits, like the sounds of the artillery, but even they could be a good bit better.  The voice work sounded rather good while I was reading the subtitles, but, well, that says about all it should.  It's hard to say much, good or bad, about voice acting if you don't know the language it's in.  Emotion was conveyed well enough to pick up on, but that's really all I can say.  Some might find Tanya's voice annoying, I suppose, but it doesn't bother me.  Altogether, in the sound department, there's nothing bad to say, but there's not much to write home about, either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyability: 10\\n\r\nThis show gave me what I wanted and then about a truckload more.  What else can I say?  It has its faults, but they don't have much presence, and almost none of them distract from the story.  There's really not higher praise you can give to a show in this area.  Nothing is flawless, and flaws really don't matter in the first place insofar as the audience is given enough reason to overlook them.  Youjo Senki definitely does that.  This is one of the most unique stories I've every reason to say that I am beyond impressed with it.  This show really is something special, and so far it's only getting better.",

But this show is completely different. From the first episode, you are treated with a psychotic smile, from the one and only loli--Tanya. Tanya is certainly one of the more interesting characters I have seen from this season. As you are watching this series, you travel through the trials and tribulations of a god denying girl, and her wish for a better life. I say it's really an enjoyableride. The show really gets into the Tanya's thoughts, her motivations and reasons. I also like how the show handles it's tone: it's dark and horrid, but there's also these short breaks where it allows the viewers to experience light-hearted humor. This makes the characters feel really human. I have watched 4 episodes so far and I think that this is a must-watch of this season.",

I already loved history and specially WWII and I've played for more than 200 hours to Hearts of Iron IV, so this anime was just perfect for me. I love how they tell two stories at once, one about the protagonist (who is the villain and ofc perfectly done) and the story about the world where the protagonist is. Both are interesting and the one about the world is kinda based in our history, it's like an alternative WWIIwith magic. Art is a little strange, but as we all know strange doesnt mean bad, it is a great way to get those expressions of pure insanity the protagonist has. The music is brilliant too, I prefer the ending song over the opening one but still, both are great. Animation in fights is great (and epic af).\\n\r\nThis was a pretty pleasant surprise, I usually think even the best animes often have a down side that I don't like that much, but this anime doesn't, it's just perfect.

            "content": "Mod Edit: This review contains spoilers.\r\n-----\r\nIt\u2019s not very often that an anime comes out that has its main protagonist be the villain and does it so well. Overlord is a popular show that explores this idea and Youjo Senki would be a highly recommended for those who enjoy certain aspects of it. It follows Tanya Degurechaff, a Japanese salaryman reincarnated into a female child soldier, in a reality where magic coexists alongside an alternate timeline of World War One. The twist is that she fights for Germanian Empire and behaves far differently than a stereotypical heroine. \r\nCharacters\r\nYoujo Senki is defined by the main female leadof Tanya as she ascends the ranks of the Imperial Army though bloodshed and maneuvering within its bureaucracy. What makes her character and story so interesting is that she provides a fascinating case study on villainy. Far from the cliche ambitions of world domination, fame or riches, her ultimate objective is to live out a comfortable life by following the rules to an dogmatic degree and being competent. It is a mundane goal, but it does ground her character in becoming relatable.   \\n\\n\r\nBeing a sociopathic salaryman in her former life, Tanya runs afoul of God due to her lack of empathy and atheism, which then causes her to be reborn into a grim world in order to unlock her faith in a higher power. The crux of the series is for Tanya to physically survive the ever expanding conflict that will become the First World War in this alternate timeline challenge for Tanya become twofold as she is to survive in this new world while not succumbing to the spiritual whims of God\u2019s conversion efforts.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Tanya does have access to quite a bit of power in the form of retaining full knowledge of her previous life, extremely high magical potential, ruthless work ethic and state of the art equipment. Despite ending up in the body of a ten year old blonde girl, there is very little pandering to when it comes to her loli physicality, and those who underestimate her quickly find themselves outclassed and outmaneuvered. Tanya is completely ruthless and brutal when it comes to waging warfare as her tactics are to swiftly end the fight with clever tactics and overwhelming firepower. Off the battlefield and with the knowledge of World War One, she can sweet talk her way to the command staff with groundbreaking military doctrine and instill a sense of reverence in her troops.   \\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the greatest downfall to her is the incompatibility of her final goals, ideology and actions within the military environment resulting in the various schemes that she cooks up to ensure a comfortable position ends up with the opposite effect. Her adherence to rules, regulations and orders does not offer any alternate route in spite of Tanya\u2019s being the villain in her own story. While the civilian business world can be far more accommodating to the desires of talented individuals, the military values competency by rewarding those specific individuals like Tanya, with greater responsibility. There was no way that the Imperial Army was letting a brilliant tactician and ace mage with unmatched strength or leadership ability, be sidelined in the greatest war to end all war. As smart and cunning as Tanya is, for her to not realize that simple face seems like an oversight to me. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters of the show don\u2019t even come close to holding a candle to the flamethrower that is Tanya, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they are poorly designed or constructed. Her subordinate, Viktoriya Serebryakova, a female conscripted into the German Empire Army, acts as the foil to Tanya\u2019s cold efficiency and utilitarian worldview. With nationalistic ideals, a strong sense of duty, concerns about her comrades and a belief in a higher power, she is far more akin to your standard anime female heroine. It is this juxtaposition of their attitudes that makes their interactions so peculiar as Viktoriya is slowly smitten by her superior officer. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, there is Being X himself, a singular god-like entity as opposed to the myriad of deities in the source material. Studio Nut took liberties with the light novel and made him a far more sinister character by setting up Tanya in situations where she has no choice but to praise his name in exchange for the usage of the very powerful Type-95 magical orb. Appearing through proxies at certains encounter, his involvement in the plot goes to the point of altering the source material and cumlnate in an explosive climax which gives Tanya a real challenge and face to fight against. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\\n\r\nFrom the limited information available, Youjo Senki is the first main animation production from Studio Nut, a newfound company is made up of former Studio Madhouse employees. There is obviously some talent behind this anime production as the action sequences looks quite good and convey a sense of ferociousness as Tanya effortlessly butchers her way through any and all enemies standing between her and a peaceful life. The backgrounds also looks great with the landscape and skybox being highly detailed while having this drab color palette that fits Youjo Senki\u2019s interpretation of World War One\u2019s bleak tone. My only real complaint is the use of some rather dodgy CGI that clashes against the 2D\u2019s frame rate and fidelity. Others may take up issue with the the character design differences between the source material and the anime as Tanya and Viktoriya looks leagues apart when compared to their Soujo-like appearance in the manga and light novel. Personally, I think that sociopathic nature of Tanya and the wide-eyed look of the optimistic and duty-bound Viktoriya meshes well with their respective trollish and dopey animated appearances. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\\n\r\nYoujo Senki is a textbook case on exactly how anime adaptions should done by having the strong source material as its base, and layering it with amazing animations, an epic soundtrack and a fitting bleak tone. The World War One setting is worth the admission alone as portrayal of the various weapons and military doctrine is spot on. Tanya, being one of the most understandable psychopathic loli that anime has to offer, only adds to its uniqueness and enjoyment.   \\n",

            "content": "My first encounter with the anime \"The Saga of Tanya the Not Particularly Evil\" intrigued me greatly. I walked in on my roommate watching some anime with a little girl and, as per tradition, I casually called him a pedophile. But then something strange happened. Rather than the usual \"ACKSHUALLY, she's a 500 year old demon,\" he said \"ACKSHUALLY, she's a middle aged man.\" Now, I was horrified by this. I slapped him and began to shout. \"Why?? Hasn't this trap shit gone on long enough??? It\u2019s too far!\u201c I said. But he explained the plot to me, so I told him it sounded stupid.\"No,\u201d he said \u201cActually, it's really good.\"  And that is where our sad story begins. (It was not, dear readers, actually really good.)\\n\\n\r\nAn essential problem here is that the whole premise feels pointless. Some dude dies and God doesn\u2019t like him so he turns him into a badass loli mage. Because that\u2019s a punishment now. Why is it important that this girl used to be a man when we know basically nothing about her previous life? This reincarnation seems to give her knowledge that battle-hardened generals envy, but there's no reason why some salaryman who\u2019s read a few wikipedia articles would be a genius at military strategy. And did he have to be some fedora tipper's wet dream? Libertarian, atheist\u2026\u2026I guarantee this man dabbles in bestiality just based on this combination, and this makes him a really unsympathetic character. Couldn\u2019t we have had an anime where a loli becomes Hitler, without this whole thing where it\u2019s actually some reincarnated old dude? That sounds like a much more interesting character. As it is, they keep telling us she\u2019s a monster or evil every episode, but she\u2019s mostly just dull, which is why they have to keep telling us\u2026..we would have never guessed if we were left to our own devices.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, I care more about the actual plot than this weird backstory. Or I would, if the AU was not so vague and dull. One alternate option would have been to create a whole new universe, with only slight similarities to our own, but that would have required world building and work. Another would have been to have it take place in a universe more similar to our own, but the points at which the anime departs from history often seem to be more out of ignorance than creativity, suggesting that this choice was never really an option. As such, we\u2019re stuck in this uncanny middle ground where the viewer knows next to nothing about the setting, despite how similar it is to his own world\u2019s history. The lack of clarification on points of departure is jarring and it destroys immersion.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u2018Characters' section must be put at 1/10, to represent that there is only one character. (And she\u2019s not that good!) I can\u2019t say I remember anyone else\u2019s name, or anything about them. It seems as if the creators genuinely did not put any effort into creating unique, compelling, or creative characters. I don\u2019t care about any of these people, or what happens to them. And every time I start to feel invested in Tanya I\u2019m reminded she\u2019s actually just some weird old dude, and the whole orphan backstory means nothing. Most character interactions are very shallow, and we don\u2019t know anyone\u2019s motivations other than the absolute basics. Where are the meaningful character interactions? Where is the development? It\u2019s ridiculous and shallow. \\n\\n\r\nThe ED was probably the best part of every episode. Not only because it meant the episode was over, but because it was actually not too bad. No complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thought most of this anime\u2019s potential was squandered. It wasn\u2019t an atrocity but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it, nor do I plan to watch the next season. There wasn't really enough tension or depth to keep me going and it became difficult to watch towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nOverall: Let's just call it a 4 or something",

            "content": "Mod Edit: This review contains spoilers.\r\n----\r\nThis anime, compressed into one long ass sentence: \u201cAn intelligent, asshole, soldier loli is actually a reincarnated, sociopathic, atheist, former salaryman, who occasionally gets forced by a stalker, god-like entity to pray to it in order for him-now-her to survive in a world-war setting and wreck his/her war enemies... with a magic gun.\u201d \r\nYoujo Senki was a pretty interesting show. It successfully presents an uncommon perspective in anime, where the main character is borderline villainous. I personally found it very entertaining and would recommend it to you.\r\nTL;DR at the end\r\nStory: 8/10 \r\nTanya Degurachaff (the main character) starts off in ouruniverse as an atheist, sociopathic, efficiency-valuing salaryman with many personality disorders and complexes. Some normal everyday shit happens at work, but the guy that he just cold-heartedly fired at work that day overreacts and murders Tanya by pushing him onto the train tracks. A god-like entity claims to be God, has a philosophical discussion with him before he dies, Tanya names it \"Being X\" since he's a non-believer, and then he gets told that he this will be his last reincarnation cycle (basically because he\u2019s a sociopathic atheist). He consequently gets sent to be reborn in a different, more war-torn world that contains magic and is reminiscent of the early 1900s in our world.\\n\\n\r\nHe-now-she is reborn as a girl and we become increasingly aware that she remembers her previous life as she reaches the age of nine. Now that she's a fully fledged nine-year-old, she chooses to join the military and rises through the military ranks in order to obtain enough achievements to live comfortably in the safety of the city. However, \u201cBeing X\u201d maliciously interferes at very critical points in Tanya's life, and so she often ends up continuously fighting in life-threatening magical gun battles. The reason why being \u201cBeing X\u201d interferes is basically in order to try to convert her evil, sociopathic, loli ass into a devout believer. However, instead of choosing to believe in God, Tanya angrily continues to reject the existence of God through ominous displays of smug insanity. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows him-now-her as she rises through the army ranks and becomes an overpowered, super strict, crazy, monster-like commanding officer. The story also gives some interesting perspective on the human nature of war, and the geopolitical strategy that goes into it\\n\\n\r\n- Will he-now-she ever get his-now-her happy ending? \\n\r\n- Who or what is \"Being X?\" \\n\r\n- How does Tanya, a sociopath, act in a military environment? \\n\r\n~Find out more by watching the show!~\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was great; nothing felt like it was too slow or too fast, but some watchers were initially thrown off because the first episode since it started in the middle of a war scene. The purpose of it was to build interest in the series by showing that there was going to be tons of action, but they consequently chose to present Tanya\u2019s backstory in the second episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is very unique, but it feels like the show is missing something to me. I think that it may be because there is no ambitious \u201cgoal(s)\u201d that the main protagonist has, other than just defying \u201cBeing X\u201d and trying to live comfortably in life. The story was also very interesting, having enough character development for all of the essential characters. Overall, I feel the story is worth an 8/10. I ranked it down mainly because it\u2019s nearly void of profound or meaningful qualities, and also because the show wasn\u2019t exactly \u201ccomplex\u201d or relatable in any way (except for perhaps the intelligence of the main character). I thought that the story was \u201cvery interesting\u201d, but never once called it \u201cgreat\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nReally, the only interesting characters in this anime were Tanya, Being X, and some random ass enemy-dad from the suburbs. However, to be honest, Tanya was really all this anime needed anyways. Tanya is interesting because she\u2019s an excellent strategist that prioritizes logic and efficiency as a soldier, which allows her to often make more effective decisions than even the highest commanding strategy officers. She's also pretty overpowered and crazy, so she wrecks her enemies while having some of the craziest facial expressions that I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, Tanya\u2019s thoughts and actions somewhat remind me of the main protagonists from Saiki Kusuo no Psi nan (10/10 best comedy) and Jinrui wa Shimashita (8/10 hidden gem). In these anime, the main character\u2019s words/actions and internal commentary are often hilariously in opposition to each other, as they reluctantly conform to others\u2019 expectations to achieve some sort of objective or conceal their true nature. This mainly presents itself when she must show respect for her superior officers, often becoming extremely enraged internally when things don\u2019t go her way.  \\n\\n\r\nThey only briefly built the personalities of the other characters that surround Tanya throughout the anime. The highest ranking officers showed up pretty often and got a decent amount of development, as did Tanya\u2019s main assistant Viktoriya Ivanovna. Viktoriya Avnovna is a very kind and tender woman, who is unexpectedly dedicated to her job as a soldier. She's supposed to be a main character, but I don\u2019t recall getting any of her background story. It must\u2019ve either been very insignificant or they may have just never told her story. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe background art is objectively amazing--- actually, they are some of the best backgrounds that I have ever seen in the anime genre. Additionally, the animation and action are great, the dramatic angles are top quality, the facial expressions are very expressive, special effects are good enough, all 3DCG objects blend perfectly and are barely detectable--- overall the art is quite great in general. However, they REALLY fucked up the female characters' head designs from the manga. In fact, it\u2019s so different, that I am literally at a loss for words. \\n\\n\r\nThe female characters look almost unrecognizably different when compared to their manga counterparts. Tanya and Viktoriya Ivanovna (actually, the women in general) were supposed to look like very beautiful characters/people. In the manga, she looked similar to how a beautiful shoujo anime\u2019s main character would look (the ED art is the manga art, in case you were wondering). Comparing the two... left me at a loss for words because in the anime they looked like some weird ass toddlers with weird-looking eyes. \\n\\n\r\nThe men look perfectly fine. This slightly ticked me off because they spent all of this time and money drawing these hella top quality backgrounds, but they deliberately chose to fuck up both Tanya\u2019s and Viktoriya Ivanovna\u2019s character designs. The new design makes them both appear less attractive and more scary and evil in Tanya\u2019s case, which may have been what the art director was going for. I don\u2019t like it, but I wouldn\u2019t have noticed if I didn\u2019t check out the manga.  Everything else is absolutely fantastic, so I feel compelled to give this category a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending were pretty unique, fun, intense, and catchy songs 9/10. The opening is an intense dark-sounding j-rock piece, while the ending is a bit more emotional, but still intense. Unfortunately, I feel that the background OSTs were pretty lackluster in general, but the main battle OST was pretty good. I think that they should have had a composer create a heavier, more fluid sounding main melody for the battles in order to convey the heaviness of fighting and taking a life, but it sounded pretty good and definitely got the job done. The remaining themes were relatively average instrumental background music. \\n\\n\r\nI feel that Tanya's voice sounded a bit off. It definitely fit her evil personality and was pretty intimidating, but I think it would sound better if she had a more softer voice that maintains the same level of intensity. Her voice didn\u2019t really seem to fit the character from the manga, in my opinion. It definitely fits the character from the anime, however. To be quite frank, Yuuki Aoi is an amazing VA and always does a spectacular job in her VA roles, so I\u2019m guessing it was somebody else\u2019s \u201cartistic\u201d interference that caused all of these changes. All of the other characters were voiced pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nAll things considered, I feel that this was a very enjoyable series. This was the series that I looked forward to watching the most during the winter 2017 season. This anime's title picture is what drew me in, but I mainly stayed for the asshole, intelligent, soldier loli, who is actually a reincarnated, sociopathic, atheist, former salaryman. I actually really enjoyed his-now-her personality; it essentially MADE this show. This show would not be anywhere near as interesting without Tanya. Without her, it would probably look something like a shittier version of \u201cAlderamin in the Sky (8/10)\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nWhat to Take away:  8/10 \\n\r\nThe story is very good, I enjoyed it and you probably will too (8/10). It was paced quite well; nothing feeling too slow or too fast. Tanya was really the only character that received development, but she\u2019s really all that the series needed anyways (7/10). The art is absolutely great, having some of the best background art that I\u2019ve seen in the anime genre, but they screwed up the female characters\u2019 beauty from the manga in order to make them look scarier (9/10). The OP and ED were great, but the background OSTs would\u2019ve been better if they sounded heavier to suit the war vibe, like something Sawano Hiroyuki would compose(7/10). Tanya\u2019s voice was great, but she occasionally sounded relatively squeaky. I would definitely recommend this anime to you personally.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it? \\n\\n\r\nIf you like:\\n\r\n- unique plots, \\n\r\n- intelligent/calculating main characters, \\n\r\n- war anime, military anime, magic anime, \\n\r\n- intense action scenes, \\n\r\n- strategy-based plots, \\n\r\n- great background art, \\n\r\n- and/or evil lolis *hears sirens in the distance* \\n\\n\r\nThen this anime is definitely for you. Otherwise, you probably shouldn\u2019t watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this helps you make your decision on whether or not to watch this anime~",

            "content": "My opinion: \r\nYoujo Senki is a series that succeeds in portraying the \u201creincarnated and transported to a different world\u201d scenario while having a unique approach on the \u201cmilitary\u201d genre. \r\nThe story is well executed and approaches the military genre from a new and unique perspective that I found really entertaining. The character cast is a \u201cone man army\u201d composed of Tanya, aside from her character there really aren\u2019t any other good characters.  \r\nThe animation works in harmony with the sound department, resulting in a great watching experience that really allows the viewer to enter the show\u2019s world.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nFor having insulted \u201cGod\u201d, an atheist andarrogant Japanese salaryman in the moment of his death is sentenced to be reborn in an alternate universe similar to 1910's Europe mixed with early aspects of World\u2005War\u2005II, in an empire torn apart by countless wars with all nearby countries.\\n\r\nThe salaryman is reborn as a girl who will be known as Second Lieutenant Tanya Degurechaff of the Imperial Army, a 9-year-old soldier girl. As God stated, if Tanya doesn\u2019t meet her end through a natural death or she refuses to have faith in Him, her soul will be sent to hell for all eternity. In order to avoid going to hell, Tanya decides to enter the Empire\u2019s Mages Division and fight in the \u201cworld war\u201d hoping to climb the ladder to the top ranks as fast as possible to remain away from the battlefield as a way to avoid the risk of being killed and at the same time \u201clive the good life\u201d.\\n\r\nEven if the arrogant salaryman is now forced to have the body of a young girl, he soon adapts to the situation and turns into a merciless soldier who prioritizes efficiency above all. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, in the beginning of the series, and even before I started watching it, I found the \u201cman in loli body\u201d to be ridiculous and it actually bothered me for the duration of the first 3 episodes but I soon got over it and got intrigued by Tanya\u2019s character instead of being bothered by her appearance.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in quite a normal world, except for the existence of \u201cmagic\u201d. The show does a good job at portraying how differing countries can act when they are disagreeing, just skipping the political talks and jumping to war, and the way it employs real war tactics such as trench warfare was really nice to see.\\n\r\nAlso, the \u201cEmpire\u201d can be compared to WW1 Germany, the Republic can be compared to France and the enemy alliance can be compared to the Triple Entente (and a few more comparisons I won\u2019t bother mentioning), I found all these similarities to be a great addition to the show by giving it veracity.\\n\\n\r\nThe story unfolds at a satisfying pace, nothing felt like it was developing too fast or too slow, but the first episode could have been done better and used to explain things such as why the Empire is fighting against so many countries, how the magic-based weapons work, how magic came to be, etc. With that in mind, the first episode did its job well, its purpose was to display an interesting scene that will compel the viewer to watch the series by showing that there is gonna be a ton of action, and it did that very well.\\n\\n\r\nI consider Youjo Senki to be quite the unique \u201cmilitary\u201d show that approaches things from a different and interesting perspective, compared to what I am used to. On the other hand, it lacks the complex story and meaningful messages it would take for me to consider it a \u201cvery good\u201d series.\\n\r\nThere aren\u2019t many \u201cclever\u201d moments or twists that left me pondering, just a straightforward story that although it is a tad bit ridiculous at times, I found it good.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWar does not decide who is right, but who is left\u201d. What really separated Youjo Senki from other generic war series (like Izetta:The Last Witch) was the fact that there are no real \u201cbad guys\u201d, or in this case bad countries, only patriots blindly believing their country\u2019s propaganda and soldiers following orders which is very true and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what I found very dumb: People, that studied and experienced war for 20-30 years can\u2019t come up with a good strategy but the businessman Tanya (because that is what she/he really is, a businessman) was able to do so without any effort. Even if I was to take into account the possibility that Tanya studied war and had a natural talent for it, that still wouldn\u2019t explain the veteran\u2019s incompetence nor Tanya\u2019s success, it\u2019s just ludicrous.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThis is where Youjo Senki fails. Except for Tanya and \u201cBeing X\u201d there really is no one that is worth mentioning, the support characters are just bland tropes used for decor, having the banal purpose of being plot tools, sacrifices or just to fill up the void.\\n\\n\r\nTanya Degurechaff, the protagonist, is a young blonde, blue-eyed 10 years old girl who is the reincarnation of a cold-hearted atheist and social-darwinist Japanese salaryman who was sent to another world because \u201che\u201d who is now a \u201cshe\u201d insulted God. Compared to others, Tanya has a high latent magical ability and is the only one capable of using an experimental \u201cType-95 operation orb\u201d due to Being X's interference. She controls a battalion of elite mages whose main purpose is to overwhelm enemy forces while also remaining highly mobile and relatively small. \\n\r\nTanya is quite ruthless and intolerant towards the mistakes and failures of others, much the same as in her previous life, and employs several extreme punishments and training methods. \\n\r\nWhat makes her characters interesting is that she is similar to an \u201canti-hero\u201d, she is merciless, cunning, egoistic, arrogant and shows sociopathic tendencies through the fa\u00e7ades she uses and monologues that explain the logic and reasonings behind her actions. Tanya doesn\u2019t wish for riches, world fame, world domination or other generic motives, she only has the mundane goal of living a comfortable life that ends by a natural death, which I found a bit hilarious but also original and made me relate to her character a bit.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBeing X\u201d is a self-centered and villainous god-like entity, more like a self-proclaimed God, and throughout the series it forces Tanya to praise his name by putting her in situations where she has no other choice than doing so. His form is unknown, he only appears through proxies but we know he has absolute power since he altered the fundamentals of the world on multiple occasions. \\n\r\nWhat bugged me was his unknown reason for being so obsessed with Tanya. Out of millions of non-believers he chose particularly that salaryman and then invested quite a lot of time (since this \u201cgod\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to be omnipotent and omnipresent) in trying to make that salaryman a believer. It just seems odd.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation has a well-suited color palette, it is fluid with well-done CGI and the background art is beautiful, but the character design is\u2026 let\u2019s just say the character design leaves to be desired. \\n\r\nThe action scenes have such a natural flow that it\u2019s mesmerizing, it offers a very good and immersive watching experience, and the animation, without a doubt, is one of the best this season.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI liked the opening theme but I found the ending theme to be great and I almost never skipped it, that says quite a lot. The OST is very good and gives one hell of an immersive experience because you can feel the impact behind every explosion, gunshot, etc. Most of the voice actors interpret the characters very well (loved whenever Being X made an appearance) but there are actors who could have done their job better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI highly enjoyed this series, which was a surprise to me. \\n\r\nThe action scenes were great and the show didn\u2019t have any moments I found obscenely ludicrous or any other irritating factors. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10\\n\r\nYoujo no Senki is a good show that employs a unique and well done plot accompanied by decently constructed characters, coming in a package with very good animation and sound. I recommend giving this show a try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(Review of first 5 eps)\r\nI had no interest in Tanya when it first aired. Its preview on ANN was poor and the story sounded bizarre to me. However, after the first few episodes I noticed this anime was recieving more and more good reviews and generating some buzz, so I decided to check it out. And I'm very glad I did. \r\n-Story- \r\nTanya is an original take on the now well-tred Isekai/AU genre. Firstly, the character is born (with a different gender) into the new world instead of merely being transported, as an adult, into it. Secondly, Tanya's goal is to survive in this newworld and make a success of her life there, not to go on an adventure or defeat some bad guy. \\n\\n\r\nTanya is evil in a sense, but not in the typical villain way. Being a salaryman in the previous life, she has a drive towards success and self-preservation, no matter the cost to others. She does occasionally demonstrate a more truly malevolent streak, which is always fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe strength of the lead's character means that Saga of Tanya the Evil is highly enjoyable both in war scenes and long dialogue sequences between Tanya and military higherups - it is a rare anime of any sort that can claim that. \\n\\n\r\n-Technical-\\n\\n\r\nTanya was animated by a new studio called NUT, and they have done an excellent job. The art is detailed, backgrounds are often beautiful, and most importantly Tanya looks like no other anime char I've ever seen. She can look both adorably cute, and terrifyingly evil, in the same episode. \\n\\n\r\nTanya's voice actor has a difficult job portraying such an original MC. It took a while to get used to the way her voice sounds but now I'm of the opinion that both her voice and performance is perfect for the role. It's also worth noting the OP song which is a catchy techno beat. \\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\\n\r\nTanya is what last season's Izetta should have been. This anime could have been a failure with worse writing, less competent production, or a lack of a unique and highly watchable main character. Instead, Tanya has all 3 and more. It is already a frontrunner for most surprisingly good anime of the year. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "To the people who finally expected a negative review on this show, sorry for being late; Being X gave me trouble. Also, expect lots of religion puns; have a problem, then you'd probably have a hell of a time with this damn review.\r\nYoujo Senki is a pathetic waste that doesn't know what the hell it's talking about, stuck in its own incompetence and stupidity of vengefulness and craziness that it completely ruins a potentially good war story in the name of edge and sacrilege. From its ridiculous premise that's a sloppy combination of the premises of Drifters and Izetta (both mediocre and bad war showsfrom the previous year respectively), to its laughable and generic attempts at emotion, this anime has less depth and intelligence than a Michael Bay movie; at least those have nice Megan Fox fan service and CGI that isn't fugly as hell. So, why did this train wreck of an anime bomb harder than a pack of fighter planes? Let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSo, a psychopathic businessman gets killed, but in the midst of death, encounters a pissed off God that reincarnates him as a mage girl in an alternate world and torments him. Again, just like Drifters, with a bit of Izetta. From there, we learn of the poorly defined magic that has multiple unexplained spells and bullets because the anime doesn't sit down and tell us about the many variations of spells and bullets shown throughout the anime. Plus, the hover system our protagonist's side uses makes no sense, with it being a 1-legged booster with nothing to help give them horizontal support. From there, we plunge into the two main plot lines: Tanya rises through the tanks in the name of self-preservation and hates the damn deity known as God, or Being X. Both of these are handled horribly, especially the latter since the anime doesn't have faith in us, meaning that it has to remind us about it at least 4 times per episode. I mean, dissing God and making him cruel is a good and compelling plot point, especially if we constantly remind the audience at nauseam, right?\\n\\n\r\nAs for the war itself, well, this show keeps skipping giant chunks of this World War that would really be beneficial to know, like the assembling of multiple companies under Tanya\u2019s rule, seeing Tanya become major, establishing just who is currently in the war without resorting to \u201cwho are we fighting this episode\u201d, etc. and it's quite upsetting since it basically sacrifices the real soul of the war just for the sake of fueling the awful plot of Tanya Vs God. It all feels arbitrary for the sake of a singular character\u2019s plot, which is a major sin in and of itself, especially in execution. Plus, in the later episodes where major war-ending schemes are launched, we get little insight on them (or sometimes are just thrusted into them without knowing what the hell they are), and with no sense of transition whatsoever. They literally gutted this war just for the sake of 12 episode pacing because god forbid we actually get character development, proper play-by-play on the events of the war, or anything that could help make a decent war story. Plus, some of these events, like Tanya stabbing a dude in the heart before dropping him alone in a huge body of water and them him somehow being alive and a mage ready to end her, raise major plot holes that really damn this script. Needless to say, this ain\u2019t no Saving Private Ryan, or even Pearl Harbor. By the final act, it gave up trying and just opted for pathetic deaths and displays of emotion, and a worthless cliffhanger. The show finally accepted defeat by the finale, surrendering any pretense of knowing what it was talking about, as I said it did earlier. What a waste of potential. Not even gonna touch any more of the ludicrous plot holes or moments of forced drama; this is already SEED Destiny levels of hellishly stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe crux of your enjoyment (or lack thereof) comes down to whether or not you like and/or tolerate Tanya as a character. Suffice it to say, I did not. She's only characterized as an unreasonably psychotic warrior who knows some decent military stuff (more than many experienced generals who have been doing this longer than Tanya has been alive in her current reincarnation), and almost nothing else into the final act, where she shows a teensy bit of compassion and turmoil. She doesn't develop or even get fleshed out despite her hogging the spotlight for 95% of this anime; can't go three minutes without her, making it an even bigger shame. People like to say that she is a villain protagonist, and that is just plain untrue. Villain protagonists are the people in which while we get to see them the most and what they go through to reach their eventual demise, the point of the story is to see them fail. Tanya is supposed to succeed against the adversity of war and the dickishness of God, therefore, she is a protagonist who isn't a villain, just overly brutal and unpleasant; a byronic hero, if you will.\\n\\n\r\nLet's compare her to two other military badass protagonists, Lelouch vi Britannia from Code Geass, and Char Aznabe from Gundam (I know he is usually an antagonist, but he's the protagonist of Origin and Zeta, so I win). Like Tanya, Lelouch vi Britannia is also arrogant and brutal, and suffers turmoil the more he goes on in his war,. However, we get to see many sides of him, from his charismatic side, to his lazy side, to his dorky side that proves how physically weak he is. We see him in a variety of perspectives and how he mostly deteriorates in the just causes he believes in. Unlike Tanya, we get to know a lot about him from his past to the many different demeanors he expresses around different people, aside from bloodlust and calmness. As for Char Aznable, he is a psychopath, just like Tanya, except portrayed in a realistic manner instead of an eccentric cartoon interpretation of a psycho. Tanya is a dick to people, willing to kill many of them for disobeying her, and is not a pleasant person to be around, especially when bloodthirsty; she's a simple anime crazy person, or what is basically what uninformed people deem as psychopathic characters. Char, on the other hand, is a true psychopath. He cuts of close relationships with people for his own goals, sets up people for death just to survive and not get his cover blown, or just because he has no use for them anymore, and does it all with one goal in mind. He seems approachable, but he is cold, twisted, and calculated, and has become a perfect soldier who isn't in need of compassion, especially after the first person he has romantic feelings for died in front of him. Now, is it a bit dickish to compare a new character like Tanya to two of the most well-written and recognizable anime characters in history? Maybe, but it sets things into perspective. \\n\\n\r\nPeople sometimes joke about how Tanya is the only actual character in the show, and barring a few minor exceptions, this holds some actual water. We have Viktoriya, who I can only describe as a discount Akane Tsunemori (from Psycho-Pass) with no development or fleshing-out, and the other characters aren't worth remembering, like Weiss. There's this one decent dude Tanya stabs, and he becomes a useless and crazy person who no longer speaks, there's his daughter who only gets two scenes of screen time, there are Tanya's other soldiers who are largely the same character, there's a generic mad scientist...what a riveting cast, right, ladies and gentlemen? Plus, all of the generals barring one are basically the exact same except one is old, one had blue hair, and one cracks occasional jokes. None of these guys develop or are fleshed out, and when some do go through turmoil, it's usually in the stupidest, most emotionally manipulative, and contrived ways imaginable. Talk about a ungodly cast; best of the year, right everyone?\\n\\n\r\nYou know how people stress making a good first impression? Well, Studio NUT did the exact opposite with how they handled the animation of this series. There is so much ugly CGU that is is grating, especially when it is CGI Tanya, CGI soldiers, or a CGI rotating landscape show that would only look acceptable in a WWII PS3/XBOX 360 game. It is absurd how much of it there is, and it almost never looks good. I also counted 5 moments where the rate rate went straight to hell; one in episodes 4, 7, 10, 11, and 12 respectively, with the first two being ugly rotating shot surrounded by ugly CGI books and battleships respectively.  The directing can be pretty awful too for some of these reasons. Sure, the magic (discounting when the magic barriers break and become ugly CGI fragments) looks pretty, and so do the bullets, but that doesn't help when it comes to poorly done action scenes (where dodging is a rarity) and awful CGI and cinematography. At least the interior design looks ice, but man do some of the characters look awful at times. I also hate Viktoriya's facial design, which is weird since one of the only good things about this anime's aesthetic is how different everyone's faces are, and how detailed and decently shiny theirs can look at times. I could go on and on about the awful CGI and everything else, but you get the point. For Studio NUT's first production, it doesn't look pretty, which is a shame when you compare that to the first anime done by Trigger, WIT, and MAPPA (Kill la Kill, many parts of Attack on Titan since they worked on it with Production I.G., and Terror in Resonance).\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, barring the horrible sound effects that look like there sometimes recorded from a broken boom box, this show sounds pleasing. The OP, \"JINGO JUNGLE\" by MYTH & ROID, is an addicting watch that perfectly encapsulates the crazed tone of this series, but this band makes amazing music anyway if their contributions to Re:Zero are anything to speak of. The ED, \"Los! Los! Los!\" by Tanya Degurechaff (Aoi Yuuki), is a decent ED that somewhat accomplishes the same goal, except this one is just passable whereas the OP is awesome. The music is also decent at what it tried to do, but isn't very memorable despite being actually kinda good.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the dub, it's alright. Most of the background and named character voices are pretty alright. However, I have issue with the voice of Tanya. To be fair to Monica Rial (the VA for Tanya), I don't really think any english voice actor could've really nailed the role of Tanya' and she does do the best she can while being one of the better possible picks for that character. Unfortunately, some moments fall noticeably flat and the character doesn't really lend itself to any english voice actor aside from a 10-12 year-old girl who's willing to sound really deranged and composed at the same time, sort of like a little-girl DBZ KAI Frieza. All in all, not a bad dub.\\n\\n\r\nLook, can't we just all admit that this was a terrible season of anime? Whether you agree or not, what a coincidence that the last anime I tackle this season manages to represent everything wrong about Winter Anime 2017, from awful frame rate hiccups, to god-awful and overused CGI, to a dearth of memorable characters that get properly fleshed out, to asinine plot twists and writing that abandons all cohesion. These were surprisingly popular trends for this infernal anime season in particular. When I first heard of this show, I had hoped it would be Shuumatsu no Izetta done right after that show turned from  promising series into a pathetic mess, but after the first episode, I lost faith. Said faith died even more the more this show kept going on. With all that said, before I find myself court-martialed for hating this popular war anime, I shall bid you adieu.",

            "content": "How would a modern day salaryman from Japan, an especially ruthless and career-focused one too, manage to survive as a little orphan girl in a war ridden world where magic exists and a being that calls himself God tries his best to make things harder for said girl?\r\nThe synopsis might sound a little messy. And honestly, Youjo Senki is an anime that I didn't plan to watch but tempted by the pretty amazing opening song, I decided to give it a try when it started airing. And I'm very glad I did. \r\nThe aforementioned salaryman was in his original life a cold person that onlyfocused on his job. He didn't feel any sympathy towards those he had to fire. His goal was to climb the steps of his career and to live an easy and peaceful life. And it was all going according to his plan, until the day a man he had fired took revenge on him and pushed him in front of a train. In the moment of his death, he is faced by a being that claims to be God. Believing that modern people don't need God, the protagonist denies his existence until the very end. And as a result of their conversation, he is reborn in a world of dire straits, where he needs to live on as a little orphan girl in the harsh reality of war. And in spite of the bad situation around, our protagonist - now known as Tanya Degurechaff - doesn't plan on giving up on living a proper life.\\n\r\nThe overall concept is pretty unusual. I was skeptical at first, but in the end it works fine. The show tells not only a story of a very young girl progressing with her military career, but also a fight between her and said Being X who tries to make Tanya recognize him as God. The story is very interesting and engaging, mostly thanks to the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nTanya is a character that is very nice to follow. She's dead set against Being X and manages to live on and be successful in spite of all the hardships he puts her in. It's fun to watch her accomplish new things and it's fun to watch her struggle. She's a strong character and, since her personality remains the same as in her previous life, she is still focused on pursuing an easy life and avoiding unnecessary mess. But if everything goes wrong, she puts her mind to it to overcome the obstacles.\\n\r\nHer experiences in the previous life weren't fruitless either. Not only does she have some knowledge of the war which in her original life had already happened, but her cold and career minded personality is perfectly suited for a soldier. But there's more - she's also progressing as a character in her new life. In the end, we can see she is a little different - she has gotten to know more about the human nature and its unpredictability. And she uses this knowledge. I loved Tanya and now she is one of my favorite characters in general. She fuels the story and is perfect fit for a main character, if you're not looking for perfectly moral warriors of justice. It's not that she's complete villain either. In spite of her being called evil, she's not essentially a bad person. She avoids unnecessary conflict and likes to have things peaceful. But at the same time, she doesn't hesitate to do everything to wipe out her enemies and she shows no mercy for the disobedient comrades either. And to top it off, she's genuinely enjoyng the battlefield.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, it's only Tanya that shines so brightly in this show. There aren't many memorable characters. There are many bland personalities and her soldiers don't have much to them either. There was only a little more focus on a small group of them, especially on Viktoriya. But unfortunately, the story hasn't progressed enough to put her or any other side character in the spotlight yet. Also, the main villain of the story only appears in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it's decent. The not so pretty CGI is used here and there but it's something I'm able to forgive - it didn't hurt my eyes that badly. No major animation problems spotted either. The character design may be disappointing for some, since it was changed quite a lot in comparison with the LN/manga designs. But honestly, I didn't mind. It's not a show where I'd like to see a cutie that ran away from some shoujo show and put a military uniform on. Which is yet another good point of the show! Tanya is not your average cute loli, and she's even less cute if you remember who she originally is. The characters in Youjo Senki aren't supposed to be some eyecandy, and I got used to the way they look quickly. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was very good. The background music was remarkable, but at the same time a little repetitive. It wasn't that big a problem though. It sounded good. The opening song - Jingo Jungle by Myth & Roid - is a pretty amazing song and actually the thing that made me give the show a try. The song fits the show very well. And the same thing can be said about the ending song - Los! Los! Los! sung by Tanya (Yuuki Aoi). Her VA did an EXCELLENT job not only with said song but with her voice as Tanya in general. The voice acting was generally good in this show, but it's Yuuki Aoi that shines very, very brightly this time. Her monologues are really something else. There's also another ending song (episode 8) which is Sensen no Realism by Niina Mako. The song is just about perfect, I'd say.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that is worth mentioning is the fact that this show is very detailed. More than you could think at first. I'm not gonna lie, I'm not very good at history. But there were some pretty neat details here and there. There are other details that aren't related to history, but also nice to see. Like Tanya's change of voice throughout the series, her problems with carrying the rifle (explained in the Youjo Shenki mini anime), the way conversation and fight scenes are choreographed (where camera movements tell us who is on the advantage at the moment). \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, in spite of its flaws (like there being no other particularly important character aside from Tanya or the last episode ending on a cliffhanger), Youjo Senki is an extremely enjoyable show that is far from being generic. And it's mostly this enjoyment, my love for Tanya and the excitement I felt waiting for each episode that make me give it a 9. It's not perfect but it's definitely solid (putting away the very personal feelings, I'd say it deserves a 7 or so) and it depends on the viewers tastes how much they are going to enjoy this anime because like I said - it's mostly Tanya that fuels the show and not everyone likes her and the overall idea of this anime. I enjoyed it A LOT and I hope with all my heart that it wasn't just an ad for the LN and that there wil be another season. Which would make sense, considering it's NUT's first anime and a pretty successful one.",

            "content": "I'm writing this review based on my impressions of the first few episodes, and what I know about the manga and LN. Its unfortunate, but this anime is probably already hopeless.\r\nIn a NUTshell (NUT is the apparently new studio responsible for this), this anime has failed. The art is crap, the animation is crap, the screenplay is crap, the sound is crap, and the voice acting is crap. No amount or quality of plot could possibly make up for this.\r\nArt: 3\r\nCan be said as simply as this: \"What the hell did they do to the main characters' faces?\" The art is extremely basic and lackingin detail; take a quick look at the art from the LN or manga, and you should instantly see the massive downgrade in quality. Even without that comparison, it's some of the lazies and shittiest art you can find in any commercial anime.\\n\r\nMy complaints that you should probably skip:\\n\r\nSingle lines as eyebrows, no textures, no details, maybe 6 different shades of color per character (2 for hair, 3 for uniform, 1 for skin. Complete shit), and a full color palatte that I can probably count on my fingers. The backgrounds look pretty much all the same, and in the few minimalistic action scenes, there aren't any backgrounds at all; just solid blocks of monocolored shit. And what the hell is with Serebryakov's diseased dinnerplate eyes with spines sticking out the side? Her face looks completely f***ed up.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nAs if the art wasn't bad enough by itself; the anime boasts tons of simple panning, still-frames and frames with just mouth movement, tons of recycling the same animation (For example: portrait of person A's mouth moving, switches to portrait of person B's mouth moving, then to the same previous portrait of person A's mouth moving); overall, it's some lazily-ass garbage; a pathetic excuse for animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is mediocre, the sound effects (such as guns or cannons) are completely off and have garbag depth and quality, and the voice acting is predominantly shit; about as bad as your average English dub. Every single character aside from Tanya sound slow, stupid, and retarded, and the idiotic dialogue doesn't help either.\\n\r\nTanya herself is supposed to be intimidating despite her age, but it comes out as flat and childish in the voice acting (Maaybe I'm being a bit harash with Tanya's voice, but the rest are truly horrific).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nNone of these people act or sound like they've ever been in a battle in the entire lifetime. Dumb narration monologues that state the obvious are common (Like \"He's doing that? But that should be impossible!\" or \"What? He just used an explosive shell!). Moreover, they sound like carefree, blind idiots, as if they were from some slife of life anime, not a war anime.\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\r\nIt's obviously too early to begin judging the plot, but all other aspects heavily swing this anime into the \"complete shit\" rating.\\n\r\nIf you were wondering, the anime is based in an alternate setting of WWI that includes mages, set from Germany's (The Empire's) perspective. Not particularly innovative so far, since much of the anime follows real history.",

            "content": "Let's start off strong: I hate Youjo Senki. I hate what it aims to be, I hate what it is, I hate that it tries to do things it clearly can't do. I'm an incredibly positive guy, always searching for the enjoyment in any type of series, and yet Youjo Senki cannot achieve the simplest of goals I could have set for it: help me with finding those positives.\r\nI will refer to Tanya as \"she\" instead of \"he\" throughout this review and hope that doesn't bother anybody. \r\n*Spoilers included* \r\nStory: 3 \r\nThe Saga of Tanya the Evil is first and foremost an isekaianime. A very grounded businessman dies after a worker he previously fired throws him under a speeding train. Just before he dies, God, or Being X as the show refers to it, approaches him to talk about his lack of faith and his life lacking values that a human should have. As an atheist, the businessman tries to disprove his existence (Uh, how?), which leads God to reincarnate him into an alternate world as a little girl. This world is one in which war is the main topic, strongest army units are mages: flying soldiers that are able to power up their shots through the use of crystals, and one where EVERYONE IS STUPID AND FAILS AT DECISION MAKING SO BAD THAT IT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE. \\n\r\nMy number one gripe with the series are the enemy soldiers and how they compare to Tanya and her squad. Episode one was enough to make me angry. Just to point a couple of horrendous, illogical moments in those 24 minute episode: \\n\r\n- a scout went straight up to the air instead of moving left or right and got sniped instantly. \\n\r\n- Ground units cannot dodge. \\n\r\n- Neither can air units AKA mages \\n\r\n- Tanya's the only character that can dodge \\n\r\n- All that Tanya needs to do in order to win a battle is fire off a couple of her magic attacks \\n\r\n- A squad leader decides to waste a ton of magic energy of all his men just to kill a couple of scouts, not caring about a counterattack that could happen (Spoiler: it happens) \\n\r\n- Soldiers are too often insubordinate towards their superiors \\n\r\n- People can go on an important mission, despite their squad leaders saying no, if they ask hard enough \\n\r\nLet me remind you, that this is a serious war, where people die probably every couple of seconds. \\n\r\nAt that point I had hoped that this would maybe be addressed, that some actually reasonable decisions are going to be made, that the threat would grow bigger. Nope. Tanya and her team attacked people by aiming at the enemy and flying towards them as they stare into the barrels of their guns and die like flies. The first dodge that an enemy performed happened in episode 6. When that took place, one of Tanya's subordinates said \"Wow, those guys are good!\" \\n\r\nAre. You. Kidding. Me. \\n\r\nThe standard for an enemy is either one that stays in one place or moves in a straight line. It's not hard to see why, this is the first anime of studio NUT, their budget was limited, they couldn't animate all the movement they wanted, but this is not an excuse at all. The camera could be placed and moved differently to give the illusion of a more living battlefield, they could use less close ups of the kills and instead focused on the shooting soldiers, Tanya or someone else could get hit from time to time and so on. I would even prefer more CGI over the lack of any sort of dangerous atmosphere in this show. \\n\r\nThe second big problem I had was the inconsistent intelligence of certain characters. Tanya, who is actually a businessmen on the inside, after reading a lot of books through her young life, is apparently more capable of creating strategies than the HQ is, which is full of people that probably studied war for 30-40 years. Even if I took into account the facts that Tanya came from a world where wars already took place, or she's just naturally talented in those type of things, that would still mean that everyone else is inferior to that one, little human being. And yet, the HQ finally get their shit together and make a proper plan that ends up being a very good one. I am not able to imagine how they were able to do that though, considering that they weren't able to push back the enemy until one person came along. \\n\r\nThirdly: What really is Being X? He clearly isn't omnipotent, he would easily achieve his goal if he was, he can't predict the future, his actions tend to have very little affect on Tanya or even fail miserably, he gets outsmarted by a mere human, so there's no way his plans are something that he came up with on the go and so on. Also, why would he prioritise this one being over any other? Giving no real rules to what is the God figure and how can it function isn't a problem on its own, that stuff may get explained later, but it becomes one when he is a rather active part of the conflict. It becomes even worse when some of his plans have nearly no effect. For example, in one of the last episodes, another person gets a similar power to Tanya's. The thing is, he doesn't kill a single person, even when he shot one in the back by surprise. Nice power you got there buddy. Tanya killed a small group with her first shot after receiving that power and she was seen flying around before she did that. \\n\r\nBut I can forgive anything, absolutely anything, if the show can still be interesting and/or entertaining to me despite its flaws. That's the main reason for why I watch anime. But this anime wasn't able to get to me. The reason being, as soon as Tanya receives her powers, she was able to annihilate almost anything in her way. When you know that there's a really strong weapon that a character can use at any time without consequences or any particular preparation, it makes the fights feel less exciting and repetitive. Was it interesting then? Not really. With everything depending on a God's whim and interference, it was rather random and very sudden. For Tanya to face a serious obstacle, Being X had to interfere or one of her subordinates had to pull something off, but I can't have any idea that it will happen, it just does and I'm supposed to go with that plot point. I don't want to do that though, I want to know what triggered that reaction at that exact point or why would that specific moment go the way it did. It just doesn't leave a lot in the back of my mind, or when it does, it uses that randomly once again. That's not always a bad thing, there were a couple of moments where that paid off and I was genuinely surprised while also understanding how that plot twist works. There were instances of decent writing and it sucks because the quality is so inconsistent, ranging from good to awful. \\n\r\nAs for the other strong points of the series, I have to say that it's a pretty solid deviation from the isekai genre. Unlike most other series where the main character is pretty wimpy and doesn't know what's going on, Tanya comes in with a mission. She's gonna beat God at his own game. That part of the story definitely works well, it pushes it far enough to make me interested in the ending alone. It's just a very good concept and I'm sure it will sell many people tired of the usual isekai scheme in some series nowadays. \\n\r\nAnd that's about it. \\n\r\nAll other themes and motives are completely pushed aside for the sake of getting from point A to point B, but what's the point when you left the important things behind? This show doesn't evolve, it just switches rapidly for the sake of convenience. I'm just done. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4 \\n\r\nDear God, I don't know who came up with the idea of putting a grumpy, atheist businessman into a child with magic abilities that later becomes a soldier but I gotta give him this one. Tanya is really well stylized as a character and grows throughout the series. She starts off as a psycho that desperately tries to cling to survival by using any means into a caring leader of a group that could follow her to the pits of hell, not losing her ideals at the same time. She's smart and collected, but when something doesn't go her way she gets angry and annoyed. She is stylized to contrast her appearance, she keeps on putting masks in front of different people but is still the same on the inside. She fits the tone of the show and thrives in the setting. When the entire focus is set on her alone, it becomes rather captivating. Her goal and way of living is compelling, maybe even silly, in a positive way. Can't really blame her character for the rest of the cast not getting treated the same way. That's because they all get very little detailing compared to Tanya. Once again, she tilts the balance too much. \\n\r\nLet me explain how do I see the cast of the show. Essentially, you could take any character from a specific group, like Tanya's squad or generals back at the HQ, and replace it by another one from that same group, and you'll get the exact same set of characteristics. Their reactions, dialogue, way of thinking would still be the exact same. I can't find a point to this, so the way I see it, it simply has none. While they made a good choice on focusing on Tanya, it makes it so she's the only complicated, convoluted character in the entire show. \\n\r\nThere were two other attempts at creating characters. One of them was Serebryakova, another girl that was the second in command in Tanya's group. She spent the most time with Tanya on the battlefield. At first she was a clumsy soldier that acted suddenly and impulsively, but by the end, it's almost like she got rid of her emotions. She grows into a cold killer that's able to sleep despite the hardest of tasks ahead of her and the most brutal things behind her. But.... why? How did that happen? Was it just the fact that she spent time with Tanya? Then why didn't anyone else become this way? Her only defining characteristic in her group is the fact that she's a girl, is that it? At one point, without me even realising, she randomly changed into a different person on the battlefield. \\n\r\nRandom.... sudden... where did I hear that before? \\n\r\nThe second attempt at making a distinctive character was Erich von Rerugen. He was one of the only people to notice how brutal and demonic Tanya's behaviour is. He simply didn't trust her. He tried to convince the rest of the generals that giving her more power is wrong, but nobody listened to him. This is where his character importance ends. He provides nothing more to the series. \\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are as replaceable as they could be. I like using the world \"blob\" recently, so I'll use it again, because that's exactly what they are. It's like all their lines could be said by just one of them, like someone created only one character and thought it's okay to stretch him onto multiple people. I don't think I can go any more precise about how I feel. \\n\r\nConcluding this part, the cast is clearly created to serve the purpose of surrounding Tanya rather than being their own people. I can see that, but I don't like it at all. At least Tanya was mostly entertaining to follow, having exactly her as an MC is probably the best selling point. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 4 \\n\r\nYou better thank the sakuga or I'll be all over this. \\n\r\nThe lowest point, as expected. Studio NUT's first project with little budget simply had to include serious amount of CGI and other tricks to save up some money for the important moments. While I could get behind making ground troops CGI, they're going to die in a matter of seconds anyway, but using it so much on mages as they soar and maneuver through the air looks uncomfortably different compared to the rest of the show. Even some key characters can't escape the harsh treatment, we get to see quite a few shots of CGI Tanya. Another thing was the mouth movement, most of the time it's simply the same mouth copied and pasted onto a different character. Perhaps it's not noticeable on the regular, because there are close ups that indeed differ, but at times it's silly seeing so many characters having the same mouth movement. \\n\r\nDespite that, there ARE moments where cutting corners paid off. Some specific battles look much better than others. Considering how important those were, I'm pretty sure that they saved the money to pay the animators for those scenes alone. Most notable one would be the fight in episode 11, where movement is very smooth and energetic. \\n\r\nBesides that, the directing is nothing to write home about. There are way too many still or reused shots, lack of interesting ideas that could help with the heavy usage of CGI, camera placement is very plain so the shots often lack depth they require and such.  \\n\r\nThe art style looks okay, lot of gray, brown and dark green. Those colors complement the militaristic setting well. The character designs are a bit off, Tanya and Serebryakova look completely different from the male characters. They're drawn differently, have totally different face outlines and shapes. Male characters look much harsher and they have more details. On paper this works, but visually the women stand out more than Necessary. Their gender should be enough to make them stand out amongst all those men flying around them, but with this choice it makes it feel awkward. On their own though, the designs are okay. \\n\r\nThe OP and ED were poorly directed and animated, just like the rest of the show they use a lot of still shots, some artwork or backgrounds, sometimes random shots from the show. There is absolutely nothing more to write about here. \\n\r\nYoujo Senki is not the most visually impressing show to say the least... \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\r\nI will give credit where credit is due: The sound design is great. Before I even get to the music, I have to mention how well implemented the sound effects are. \\n\r\nFirstly, great choice in sounds. They're definitely trying to help the utter lack of dangerous atmosphere simply by sounding dangerous. Everything is very loud, often overtaking the other sounds like voices. This really gives off the feeling of how much chaos is going on around the battlefield. The sounds of magic items actually fit pretty well with the rest of the show. They sound a bit mechanical, which works really well with the time period and setting (alternative World War I). Not like it came off as a surprise, the sound director for the show was the great Iwanami Yoshikazu, who previously worked on famous anime such as Fate/Zero, Unlimited Blade Works, Baccano, Psycho Pass and Sword Art Online. He's been around for a while now, he knows what he's doing. \\n\r\nThe voices were expertly picked. I usually don't talk about this too much, I watch series in sub and I don't feel comfortable judging Japanese voices, but Tanya's voice sounds exactly like she is an angry, annoyed child who got access to some insane power. simply put: she sounds crazy and mad, like she should. Miki Schinichiro makes an appearance as Erich, his voice is always great. The other ones do their job well, can't really \\n\r\nThe music isn't falling behind too far. It captures the very dynamic feel of the show, but doesn't really make it reach new heights. Accompanies the atmosphere, but doesn't go past being the sidekick. I'd say it's the minimum quality it had to perform at to make it qualify as \"good\" for me. I have found myself thinking about the OST in between episodes, so that's a good sign. \\n\r\nWhile the openings weren't well directed, the songs themselves are very catchy and energetic. They feel a bit off when you put the alongside the atmosphere of the show, but they're good enough to overcome that issue for me. JINGO JUNGLE by MYTH & ROID is simply a very good song with very strong lyrics and \"Los! Los! Los!\" sang by Tanya's seiyuu also feels good on the ears. Those are the kind of openings where you want them going on in the background so you can prepare a sandwich or something. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4 \\n\r\nRather than focusing on its mistakes, Youjo Senki moved forward with a pace that at least kept things enticing. With a couple of interesting takes on war and the isekai genre, this should have turned into my highlight of the winter season. While it wasn't per say boring, but my experience with Youjo Senki was rather annoying, not interesting, filled to the brim with mistakes and holes that were never covered. Having only a couple of smiles on my face throughout its runtime, I would say I had a pretty bad time with it. It tumbled down in every aspect, but never made a comeback that could save it in my eyes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4 \\n\r\nTanya simply isn't that good. No matter at what angle I looked at it, it never was good. It struggled to find its own direction and truly making the most of what it had to offer. Numerous other studios were able to find ways to cover for their lack of budget numerous times before studio NUT came along, but it didn't really try to follow those footsteps. They made an attempt to do what they wanted to do with the money and time they had, which could be commendable if not for the fact that most of my issues depend on the skills of the people writing the show. If that's lacking, no amount of money can save the project. That's how I look at the show - a failed trial run, a miserable attempt at doing things \"their own way\". Unfortunately, this turned out to be a serious disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nIs it only me, or does every time that Tanya gets annoyed at Being X, she sounds like the villains from Scooby Doo? \\n\r\n\"And I would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for you Being X!\" \\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion, but I can't really recommend you to develop your own.",

            "content": "Youjo Senki\u2019s protagonist Tanya quickly rose to become my personal favorite character of the winter 2017 season. I guess psychotic loli nazis make for exquisite characters.\r\n________________________________\r\nPlot: 6/10\r\nSet in an alternate universe that is similar to the era of the first World War, Youjo Senki follows Tanya Degurechaff as she fights in the Empire\u2019s army. This empire is essentially the world\u2019s version of Germany. In fact, every territory mentioned in the anime shares a geographic resemblance to actual European countries in our world. The major difference between reality and this fantasy realm is that magic exists in this parallel universe while it obviously (though unfortunately) doesn\u2019texist in our society. It is revealed that Tanya has an abnormally high affinity with magic, which is the predominating reason why she is able to quickly rise through the Empire\u2019s ranks along with her cunning and manipulation skills. Youjo Senki\u2019s story follows Tanya as she fights for the Empire and steadily rises to become their most notorious soldier.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of execution, Youjo Senki has both positives and negatives. It does an excellent job at introducing Tanya and providing background on her sadistic personality and distorted mentality. The anime quickly delves into her backstory, giving viewers valuable information on Tanya that helps them to better understand her goals and actions. However, at around the midpoint of the amine, it feels like the detail put into the plot dissipated. It seemed like Tanya\u2019s motivations and goals evaporated and were replaced with her blindingly following the orders that were given to her by her superior officers. In the initial episodes, viewers were given insight on Tanya\u2019s reluctance to follow the commands bestowed upon her and were showed the ways in which she planed to worm her way out of undesirable situations. Yet later on in the anime it feels like she just blatantly accepts whatever the higher ups tell her to do or just complains about the orders but then executes them without question, which results in blandness that could have been avoided if Tanya had simply acted like she did in the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story, the anime did a fairly decent job at portraying how differing countries can end up disagreeing and fighting to a point that culminates in a world war. My problem was that there wasn\u2019t much information given on why the Empire was fighting on so many different fronts in the first place. I believe that the first episode might have quickly explained this, but it was so poorly done that I can\u2019t even recollect what that reason might have been. Was it for territory? Power? Could it have ben out of desperation? Were they attacked first? Whatever the reason might have been, it was so indeterminately established that it made the warring seem somewhat pointless. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I\u2019d like to mention is how useless trench warfare is in the world of Youjo Senki. Just think about it. In this universe, magic exists, and individuals who posses magic, known as mages, are given flying devices and enhanced weaponry. If technology is advanced enough to create these flying contraptions, then why even bother to waste time and funding on ground forces? The mages can literally decimate them with an aerial assault as shown in the first episode. While it was an important battle tactic in the first World War, trench warfare and grounded units in general just seem like an utter waste in this anime. It takes so much time and effort to dig trenches, yet soldiers in them get wiped out at a laughably swift pace by the mages. Shouldn\u2019t the government and military of these nations focus on building up their mage forces since they can literally wipe out entire battalions without taking a single loss as shown with Tanya and her squadron? \\n\\n\r\n________________________________\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about this section. On one hand, the backgrounds and scenery can look very vivacious and detailed at times. When it comes to the battles, dark colors and imagery are used to emphasize the tense atmosphere that a battlefield is meant to have. However, I find that watching simplistically animated individuals flying around in the sky while randomly shooting at each other gets boring rather fast. The only character that keeps these scenes fresh and interesting is Tanya, whose insane facial expressions alone make the fight scenes much more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI start to have problems when it comes to the character designs. Excluding Tanya, they are all rather plain, but there is nothing particularly wrong with most of them. However, the appearance of secondary protagonist Viktoriya is quite lackluster. I think the animators were trying to make her look cute and innocent, but her design is just sloppy. I have mixed feelings on Tanya\u2019s design. Sometimes she looks perfectly fine, however in some cases (usually when her lips are drawn in an overinflated manner or her eyes look weird), I\u2019m not that fond of her appearance. There just seems to be an inconsistency with the art regarding Tanya.\\n\r\n________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTanya\u2019s voice actress, Aoi Yuuki, does an exceptional job at making her character sound both adorable as well as insane when necessary. She really brings life to Tanya, and I just loved listening to her voice. The opening theme song is performed by one of my favorite groups, Myth & Roid, and is definitely an above average composition. The ending theme song, Los! Los! Los!, is an addictingly catchy tune, and it has become one of my personal favorite anime songs. It is sung by Aoi Yuuki, so more props to her. The sound quality in Youjo Senki is easily one of its stronger points. \\n\\n\r\n________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTanya Degurechaff is one of the most entertaining characters that I\u2019ve seen in awhile. As I stated in the beginning, Tanya is essentially a psychotic loli nazi (yes, I know that nazis are from WW2 and not WW1, meaning that its inaccurate to label Tanya as a nazi since Youjo Senki is set in a period similar to that of the first World War, but I find the title \u2018nazi\u2019 to be very befitting of Tanya) who derives pleasure from the suffering and annihilation of her enemies and is stimulated by the carnage effectuated from battle. This is honestly enough to certify Tanya as a rather good character, but does she accomplish enough to be considered a great character? In all honesty, I don\u2019t think so. The latter episodes don\u2019t really develop her much, and the enjoyment derived from watching her slowly decreases as the anime progresses. Nonetheless, Tanya is still a detailed and intriguing character, and its refreshing to watch her in action.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to dedicate much time discussing the supporting cast since they really aren\u2019t worth mentioning. They\u2019re all there to either advance the plot, fill up space, or be sacrifices to Tanya. Oh, and there\u2019s also Viktoriya. I really don\u2019t see what her purpose is.\\n\\n\r\n________________________________\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nYoujo Senki starts off strong by showcasing its leading character completing epic feats throughout the first couple of episodes. Unfortunately, with each passing episode, especially after episode four or five, my interest in the show steadily dropped. It was still good, but I felt like the plot started to drag on at a slow pace without much happening outside of Tanya and her squad killing enemies who would just sort of appear without any significant explanation on their goals and/or purpose. All the anime let us know was that they were all vastly inferior to Tanya, which always meant that the outcome of these skirmishes would be the same. This resulted in some boring episodes that honestly weren\u2019t very entertaining viewing experiences. The only thing that remained consistently enjoyable to watch was the sadistic nature of our leading lady Tanya, and quite honestly, that was enough to keep me interested in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n________________________________\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the overall plot left more to be desired and the animation took away from the general presentation of the anime, Youjo Senki was still able to be a good series due to its entertaining protagonist as well as its great sound quality and the general enjoyment derived from watching it. If you\u2019re looking for a strong and/or insane female lead, I\u2019d suggest watching this anime. If you\u2019re into vaguely historical anime integrated with fantasy, then I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend Youjo Senki. \\n",

            "content": "Before Youjo Senki even aired, I had preconceived notions about it. Based on its ridiculous main character and overall premise, I was sharpening my literary claws in preparation to critically rip it to shreds in this eventual review. Lollis, reincarnation, magic and the tedious politics of war were all aspects I roll my eyes at individually, so naturally I didn\u2019t have my hopes up very high after the first episode. After concluding the final segment of Youjo Senki, I can say without doubt that my initial impressions couldn\u2019t have been farther from my analysis of the finished product. It\u2019s an anime I wanted to hate,but in the end surprised the hell out of me. \\n\\n\r\nThe Saga of Tanya the Evil starts out on a battlefield. The fog of war is palpable and laden with smells of gunpowder and blood. Screams of agony and despair resonate from friend and foe alike, causing your bones to shake with an uncontrollable fear. This is war. The first thing I noticed about the anime was the expert level of sound design. Each explosion and gunshot echoed in my brain, causing my focus to increase with each passing moment. \\n\\n\r\nThen, as if transported from the wrong anime\u2026 Tanya appeared.\\n\\n\r\nThe stark juxtaposition of the cute, Aryan 9 year old against the malevolence of a gruesome battlefield was hard to swallow. I just couldn\u2019t grasp how she was written into the anime at all. To add to her perplexing position, appearing beside Tanya was another glassy-eyed damsel, who clumsily trudged through the combat zone, narrowly evading enemy fire. Adding to the gunfire and merciless killings was the boom and crack of magical attacks from certain individuals. Mages, who could harness supernatural forms of energy contributed to the battle, a clear reminder that I was watching an anime and not a literal historical account. I paused the episode to digest what I was seeing. I know anime in general has its fair share of nonsensical moments, but the contrast of these characters and abilities with the haunting atmosphere was jarring. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series continued, I became less fixated on Tanya\u2019s chibi appearance, and more focused on the personality she exhibited, or the precarious situations she found herself in. Without spoiling, her backstory and purpose is explained, though not in the most sensical way. This disclosure causes most of the \u201cwhat the hell?\u201d moments to dissipate, and triggers the viewer to really hone in on the finer aspects of what Youjo Senki has to offer. The magic abilities some characters possessed were also loosely explained, as anime often does. Though I\u2019m not sure how I expected these powers to be any bit of believable.\\n\\n\r\nThe main story itself is nothing special. We get dropped into an ongoing war between nations (presumably during World War I), both at each other\u2019s throats trying to gain the upper hand in the theatre of battle. Tanya is a captain of a small battalion, relatively insignificant to the grand scheme of things. Through willpower and a stern leadership style, Tanya excels through the ranks in order to gain supreme power and ultimately defy her maker, God himself. There aren\u2019t many \u201caha\u201d moments or intellectual pondering to be had, just a straightforward war story with the added twist of a cutthroat preteen at the helm. I will also admit that while entrancing to look at, the magic elements weren\u2019t entirely necessary, as the series had enough occult moments to go around.\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously people, we don\u2019t need a recap FOR A TWELVE EPISODE SERIES.\\n\\n\r\nIf you care for historical fiction or war jargon, this anime is chock-full of it. After the noisy, action-packed battle scenes fade out, they are followed by debriefs, strategery and political patois to ignite the interest of any history buff. Very little of the past or present parallels our world technically, but the rhetoric and red tape of fighting a war are synonymous with some of the battles fought in the 1900\u2019s. Many risks are taken, with some paying dividends while others blowing up in the commander\u2019s faces. It can be pretty engrossing if you can get past Tanya\u2019s childish appearance.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Youjo Senki are irrelevant with the sole exception of Tanya. She\u2019s cute, ruthless and has a severe case of Napoleon syndrome. At first, I was so nearsighted that I assumed any other main protagonist would\u2019ve been a better fit for the story, but as the anime went on I actually began to think the opposite. Having such a unique character as Tanya for the lead gave Youjo Senki the propensity to stand out from the crowd of its genre. I could appreciate the route the writers went with her backstory and who she really was, but I think her past life should\u2019ve been elaborated on a bit more. In the end, Tanya grew on me as a character, and I eventually even began to empathize with her situations, something inconceivable to comprehend when she was introduced. One complaint I have about the characters is the trouble I had differentiating between friend and foe at various points in the show. Although Tanya and Serebryakova stood out due to their arresting appearance, the others disappeared into a muddled mess of similar faces.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and action scenes in Youjo Senki are some of the stronger points of the anime. No pixel lag or framing issues at all. Definitely one of the strongest showing in visuals this season, and the animators should be patting themselves on the back. The art style is grim and uninviting, utilizing a blend of muted dark colors. This style accentuates the vibe of each scene, and adds to the militant structure of the strategic scenes. The character models for Tanya and her female right hand are vibrant and contrast the battlefield well, and their facial expressions all flowed accurately.\\n\\n\r\nThere hasn\u2019t been an anime I\u2019ve pointed out solely due to sound quality since I watched the 2015 release of Knights of Sidonia. Anyone who\u2019s seen that show knows how much realism and feeling was put into each sound effect, and how satisfying they were to listen to. Youjo Senki\u2019s sound engineers emulate the harsh conditions of a war setting meticulously and with a level of finesse barely rivaled. I was quite impressed. The OP, though not always there worked to get the viewers pumped for some intense action scenes, while the epic, pulsing ED was my favorite of the season. Aoi Yuuki did a bang-up job portraying the adolescent tyrant, and from what I\u2019ve read she had a lot of fun playing her as well. The rest of the OST flowed together beautifully, with each track transitioning seamlessly into the next, and adding a level of believability to the accompanied scene.\\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, should you watch Youjo Senki? I was ultimately impressed with how much my mood shifted through the 12 episodes, and can give the anime a solid recommendation. The story won\u2019t blow you away, and the characters (sans Tanya) are uninspiring, but the action scenes and strategic nature of the battles will offer plenty of incentive to stick around. Plus, if you\u2019re all about reincarnation and fighting \u201cGod\u201d, there\u2019s plenty of goodies for you to indulge yourself with. I\u2019d recommend this series to fans of action shows or large scale battle shows like Attack on Titan, or Overlord, though the historical elements could relate its fans to Joker Game or others. Surprise of the season? Possibly, but I was certainly glad I watched it, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like it too! Thanks, as always for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my Winter \u201817 reviews!",

            "content": "Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, then it\u2019s probably recognized that the idea of a main character being killed and reincarnated as a totally new person in a new world is a recent new trope. Youjo Senki (Saga of Tanya the Evil) jumps right into the story like pouring rice. It gets more complex as we\u2019ll learn more about the political affairs, wars, and characters. If you fancy fantasy war stories, then Youjo Senki welcomes you with open arms.\r\nTo be honest, Youjo Senki can be an intimidating title. The promotional image alone can provoke some thoughts for viewers as they will wonder what kindof person Tanya really is. The show label her as one of the most dangerous individuals among the Imperial army. However, the truth is that this seemingly deadly girl was once a salaryman but was reincarnated after angering a mysterious entity (Being X). The show chronicles Tanya and her dangerous adventure as a fighter on the battlefield.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the setting takes place in alternate world, it\u2019s noticeable that it doesn\u2019t look much different from our very own. It has the look of the 20th century in Europe although magic exists in particular with weapon warfare. The troops involved in war doesn\u2019t look different either with their very human traits and besides magic, there really isn\u2019t anything abnormal. However, Tanya is a complex character that I would label as very different compared to a lot of the other characters. She is sadistic and self-serving based on her tactics and actions. Anyone that is part of her battalion can expected to be humiliated or trained in ways they can\u2019t begin to imagine. The constant mind games she engages with Being X brings a lot of psychology to her character and we learn about her personality. Throughout the series, we see that she constantly stands up against Being X and defies it while the latter tries to break her resolve. In ways, she can even be seen more as an anti-hero. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, if you fancy fantasy war stories, then this will be your cup of tea. Just do note that the show isn\u2019t really just about action but also a lot of internal affairs and military politics. It\u2019s also comparable in ways to World War I on the Europe Theater. Germany can be compared to as the Empire, while the Republic resembles France. The Legedonia Federation can be referenced to a united Scandinavia. The story itself may be somewhat confusing to understand as some characters\u2019 motives are not entirely clear. Being X is probably the guiltiest of this example. However, the war itself has a lot of reasons whether it\u2019s related to imperialism, political, or personal reasons. It still draws out the cruelty of war though with the violence, bloodshed, and causalities. It\u2019s also not uncommon to see trench warfare similar to those used in World War I and bombing of cities. The essence of magic brings the fantasy element to the war with flying devices and powerhouse spells. I can\u2019t imagine if our World War I would be fought with these new gadgets.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast of Youjo Senki isn\u2019t too dynamic. As the main female protagonist, Tanya steals the most highlight from this show thanks to her personality and skills. One other noticeable female character is Visha. As part of the Imperal Army, her personality is much kinder although still tough and vigilant. She also seems to understand Tanya and even believes that the way Tanya treats her subordinates is to ensure their survival in actual war. Unfortunately, the show doesn\u2019t really highlight many other characters from the Imperial Army as they stand behind the scenes. On the opposition of the Imperial Army, one character that stood out could be Anson Sioux, a man who develops a vendetta against Tanya. Despite some of these characters being given spotlight, Tanya is still the main event running the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow as a manga and light novel reader, I have not read too far into this series but the story still expands from where the anime left off. It\u2019s an incomplete adaptation and with just 12 episodes, I didn\u2019t expect that they can cover everything. However, I am satisfied with the overall portrayal of the anime as it captures the mood of the war. Even the comedy and humor are thrown in right with proper timing. Some episodes will also have cliffhangers that will get viewers to speculate future events. It\u2019s basically structured in a way that makes the show more thrilling.\\n\\n\r\nAs a series about war, you can definitely expect a lot of action. I am actually quite impressed by the way is animated by NUT, a studio that probably not a lot of people are familiar with. Nonetheless, the action is captured with fast paced movement and choreography. War elements are incorporated with realistic looking guns, uniforms, and its general setting. (war academies, shelters, trenches, etc) The part about magic is portrayed as crueler than what you can expect with aerial dogfights being a main attraction. Still, the most noticeable part about the show is still Tanya. She\u2019s like an angel with the heart of a demon. It\u2019s hard to take her seriously with the way she looks until you see her fight in battle. A running gag in the show made by older man often alludes that she looks like their daughter. What does impress me about the art expression is how it\u2019s able to bring Tanya\u2019s personality to its fullest to make the biggest impact. Sadistic expressions are not uncommon especially when she goes on a rampage. While the series has violence though, it does keep it less tame on television (maybe BD will leave them uncensored?). It still makes its point that the war is anything but a safe haven as bodies drop to the floor.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack wise, I think the show made it worthy of being a war story. I can\u2019t imagine how many times I have felt intimidated by Tanya just based on her voice alone when she\u2019s on a rampage. Not only that, the show brings in an impressive feel of psychology whenever Being X makes its presence. That sinister voice and god complex is hard to ignore. The OP and ED theme songs has a heavy metal-like instrumental sound although they both sound pretty similar. \\n\\n\r\nYoujo Senki is a show that I probably won\u2019t forget for a while and not easily recommendable for anyone. It has the ingredients to cook up a story that can intimidate any viewer on first sight. The first episode felt like it drops you into the middle of the story but once you get into the hang of it, it can be quite a ride. Tanya is probably a character that many people will remember from Winter 2017. A loli fighting on the battlefield while giving on demonic face expressions? How often do you see that?\\n",

            "content": "**No Spoilers\r\nYoujo Senki's concept is kind of risky, it is hard to understand what teh fok is going on  at first glance but can easily catch up if the plot is well executed by having good dialogues and decent narration. Youjo Senki is probably the best Anime of Winter 2017 ( all sequels aside ) It is the only series from start to finish delivered and surpasses my expectations, with episode 11 being all well-directed originally by Studio NUT is freaking amazing for a brandnew studio.\r\nStory 9/10 \r\nThe story is about a salaryman who was accidentally run down by a train and was rebornas a little blonde girl back in WW1( Tanya ). That concept alone is very interesting but a mysterious being calling himself a God just made the story more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nExplaining system / strategies of the military part is complicated but in this series, they tend to rely on heavy dialogues to explain complicated things such as new experiments, device and weapons which I must admit really worked for the series. But the most intriguing part is that Studio NUT  added some major events that is not part of the original light novel. yes it is major because 1. it can destroy the whole series easily if its direction is really bad and 2. putting such event makes the series more interesting if it's executed very well. A very risky decision coming from a new studio is really really bad but dude they manage to reach my expectations and with producing such great series. The plot of the series never dropped some direction from start to finish and putting such great work that is very interesting & entertaining with good dialogues and decent execution.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nA lot of viewers were criticizing the art style of the series. I think the studio made a good decision putting less detailed style to easily put great animation sequences if needed.\\n\\n\r\nThe series relies on good cinematography and well polished backgrounds when characters having interactions. The studio only animating the interaction / heavy dialogue scenes by 3 frames per second which is enough for that. They put more effort on their battle scenes and they reusing their explosion 2d animation from the entire series which is less time consuming and works perfectly. They manage to make new explosion animation on the 11th episode and really just add more quality to the production quality of the series. Having reused animation is not bad but the NUT manage to put of their reused animation in different ways. Action scenes are well directed by putting military strategies and it is not your typical shounen that only randomly fighting each other, putting decent choreography on the action scene is very enlightening. The fights also shows the character's attitude/emotions and every character differs, from very passive but very well strategic person to very aggressive but with bad coordination. It simply shows that Youjo Senki not only relies on Raw 2d animation but they also put some details to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe CGI is really bad on the early stages but manage to improve on the later stages. The studio's CGI was either used to put massive amount of people to cover up some time or put some CGI backgrounds to use when air fights are needed. They know that their CGI was kind of a low quality but they manage to pull that out by having quick paneling & point blank transitions and sometimes very far shot and cannot be distinguish even by zooming in. CGI backgrounds are freaking impressive tho, episode 6 was brilliant and ep 11 sky battle was also stellar. Putting good camera movements on the CGI works and by mixing up the Traditional 2d animation was amazing.Their 3d backgrounds are very well rendered and with such good details.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound is very very stellar, from Myth & Roid's Jingo Jungle to Mako Niina's Sensen no Realism. the soundtrack is well done, it puts some fight scenes into more good/aggressive sequence and builds up some excitement through out the action scenes. But the one really impresses me is that they never bothered getting a 2nd Ending theme and that was done by Mako Niina and it was perfect and fits very well on the series. Episode 8 were everyone is like is the series going an anime original and everybody having their doubts of the series bu then suddenly the 2nd ending started playing and it was fokin amazing. The 2nd Ending theme is the best of winter I must admit, It puts the viewer into some excitement and yet emotionally watching the sequence. The series ending theme really differs from all the music themes from all anime this winter, you can almost compare the ending to Rakugo's ending, they both well done and the sound is just amazing. Overall great soundtrack, great opening and topnotch 2nd ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTanya's development is nothing special but her characterization is insane, yes she is overpowered but her weakness is very noticeable. She was abandoned and its like she was very alone, only managing things all by herself.She has the knowledge but it seems like everyone doesn't understand her. Being X is a great villain, the character is very interesting and mysterious only having him on the series by saying some strange yet offensive lines that triggers Tanya.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters are the same, no massive developments but their characterization from the whole series is very strong, putting the plot more interesting and managing to put great interactions through out the whole series is just really good. No character developments on a series is bad to be honest but the series just progresses very well even without huge developments. The only development I know is when tanya being reincarnated and the other one where studio NUT originally directed ( not being part of the light novel )\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHaving Izetta The Last Witch dropped the whole plot on the 2nd half and became a disaster and also Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress with great concept but failed to impress on the 2nd half as an anime original. Studio NUT not only accomplished an amazing adaptation but also by putting their own original events on the later stage of the series just put the series on the top. Never dropped quality, stayed true to its plot and very well executed story. Overall an amazing military/magic series and very entertaining one. The series ended perfectly for a 2nd season but idk if we can get one in teh future.",

            "content": "Let's make it really basic and simple.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nI would've loved if they explained some things such as how this war started, the origin of the \"mages\", or even the story of the salaryman. That aside, you cannot just deny this is a hell of a story, how the salaryman(Tanya) doesn't believe in God(Mr.X) and this last refuses the fact that she/he doesn't believe in religion. You get to see some stuff that happened in the war, as well as some fiction, which is phenomenal. You get to see how anger can lead to anything in this world, which is pretty much true. IMO, i seriouslyloved it, but felt confused at the beginning, obviously understood most of the story at episode 2. Also, that ending though, the tease for a second season is too much.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10/10\\n\r\nThe art is just beautiful, pleasing to watch/see, backgrounds and landscapes were exquisite, the desings of the characters were so good, althought they were not as close as the LN or the manga, but the resemble was still there and it was beautifully made. Sometimes they used CGI, but barely noticeable and acceptable in any way.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10/10\\n\r\nThis is what i loved the most to be honest. The background music, the sounds of the guns and everything related to the war, the voice acting, the opening, the ending, everything was spectacular. But the complain i have, is that they seemed to not have that many people for voice acting as the person doing the \"Radio Command\" was also used in a lot of filler people.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat can i say. Character development for lots, for every single character. How they behave, how do they get angry or happy, their likings, their emotions and expressions. Althought the story centers on Tanya, they did take the time to show the development of all the characters. (This excluding the deity called Mr.X)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nFirst 7 episodes, i gave the show a 8 for enjoyment, it was missing some points here and there but nothing from the other world. But these last episodes have been more than fantastic and i really enjoyed every single second of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10\\n\r\nAs you see, i quite loved the show. You are free to disagree or agree, i don't really care. As always, pardon me for being redundant at times or any grammar error.",

            "content": "Forward: As of writing this review, I am roughly 5 episodes in, and I'm fresh from watching it, ergo I haven't had all the time necessary for all of the \"Refrigerator Logic\" to make itself apparent yet.  This is also my first review on MAL.  Keep this in mind.\r\nYoujo Senki has to be one of the biggest surprises of the season, coming from an entirely new studio and having one of the most idiotic-sounding concepts in recent memory.  However, Studio NUT has come out swinging with some fine work, and the story itself becomes far more impressive with context.  \r\nStory: 9/ Characters: 7\\n\r\nPerhaps the most surprising thing about this show so far is how strong its story has been, especially in the second and third episodes.  As is often the case, however, the plot summary does it no justice, and is especially bad, considering the show's outlandish concept.  The actual story is somewhat reminiscent of Odysseus's struggles with Poseidon, with a god putting the main character through trial after trial to prove the value a god has to a man.  It's quite an interesting argument, and one that hasn't reared its head in a while, as far as I'm aware.  \\n\\n\r\nTanya's character is far from the sympathetic protagonist, however.  She's cold, calculating, manipulative, and absolutely ruthless.  Not only that, but it becomes clear that her one-track mind has led her to a state of somewhat questionable sanity, without care for human suffering or emotion, and much less anything resembling mercy.  Everything is a means to an end.\\n\\n\r\nThe deity she so offended, the looming presence that is \"Being X,\" is, interestingly enough, much more the sympathetic entity.  While it's unclear whether X is a male, female, singular entity, or even possibly a collective, it appears to be an ultimately benign existence, happily handing out miracles and asking for nothing more than belief in it.  For those interested in the religious aspects of the story, it takes a fairly neutral stance, incorporating aspects of several major religions.  Agnostics probably won't be bothered, but I could see this being a potential turn-off for a hardcore atheist.  \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters, though, were rather lackluster.  This may be due to the fact that the story is still going, and they just haven't had time to develop yet, but very few of them seem to be relevant, and I'd even go so far as to say that many of those who are exist mainly as a foil for Tanya.  While this has built her character exceptionally well, and she's certainly interesting enough to hold the spotlight by herself, the presently weak supporting cast is one of the few things I feel is holding this show back.\\n\\n\r\nI do really like how the rest of the world responds to Tanya, however, albeit I do find a few encounters to be excessive or over-dramatic.  I definitely like how, for the most part, everyone just rolls with it after she shows her worth, which really speaks for itself.  But, the thing this show really lacks is a peer for Tanya, someone near her level.  Being X sorta fills this role, but its participation is limited, and Viktoriya, while she may be a good counterweight, really can't do more than be the audience's surrogate.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 / Sound: 7\\n\r\nI'm not going to say it's perfect, but it blows all reasonable expectations out of the water.  At first glance, it may look unbalanced and garish, but it's an easily acquired taste, and one that fits the story very, very well.  Studio Nut also does exceptionally well with the good old Crazy Face.  I haven't been this impressed with the animation of a single body part since the creepy hand movements in Konosuba.  The eyes, the mouth, the brows, they all move so well and contort in such beautifully horrifying ways that it's hard to fault it here.  At all.  The combat could be more fluid, and there are a few scenes that had a bit of noticeable weirdness.  That said, the animation looked far better than I expected, and some aspects, particularly the eyes, were nothing short of amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, meanwhile, performed exactly on-par with expectation.  There are some nice bits, like the sounds of the artillery, but even they could be a good bit better.  The voice work sounded rather good while I was reading the subtitles, but, well, that says about all it should.  It's hard to say much, good or bad, about voice acting if you don't know the language it's in.  Emotion was conveyed well enough to pick up on, but that's really all I can say.  Some might find Tanya's voice annoying, I suppose, but it doesn't bother me.  Altogether, in the sound department, there's nothing bad to say, but there's not much to write home about, either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyability: 10\\n\r\nThis show gave me what I wanted and then about a truckload more.  What else can I say?  It has its faults, but they don't have much presence, and almost none of them distract from the story.  There's really not higher praise you can give to a show in this area.  Nothing is flawless, and flaws really don't matter in the first place insofar as the audience is given enough reason to overlook them.  Youjo Senki definitely does that.  This is one of the most unique stories I've every reason to say that I am beyond impressed with it.  This show really is something special, and so far it's only getting better.",

But this show is completely different. From the first episode, you are treated with a psychotic smile, from the one and only loli--Tanya. Tanya is certainly one of the more interesting characters I have seen from this season. As you are watching this series, you travel through the trials and tribulations of a god denying girl, and her wish for a better life. I say it's really an enjoyableride. The show really gets into the Tanya's thoughts, her motivations and reasons. I also like how the show handles it's tone: it's dark and horrid, but there's also these short breaks where it allows the viewers to experience light-hearted humor. This makes the characters feel really human. I have watched 4 episodes so far and I think that this is a must-watch of this season.",

I already loved history and specially WWII and I've played for more than 200 hours to Hearts of Iron IV, so this anime was just perfect for me. I love how they tell two stories at once, one about the protagonist (who is the villain and ofc perfectly done) and the story about the world where the protagonist is. Both are interesting and the one about the world is kinda based in our history, it's like an alternative WWIIwith magic. Art is a little strange, but as we all know strange doesnt mean bad, it is a great way to get those expressions of pure insanity the protagonist has. The music is brilliant too, I prefer the ending song over the opening one but still, both are great. Animation in fights is great (and epic af).\\n\r\nThis was a pretty pleasant surprise, I usually think even the best animes often have a down side that I don't like that much, but this anime doesn't, it's just perfect.

            "content": "Humanity has historically found the idea of sending our youngest to war abhorrent, yet what happens when one of the most brilliant and talented soldiers of the time is a blonde, blue-eyed little girl? Inspired by the battle-scarred 20th century European climate, Youjo Senki makes use of a variety of unconventional expository elements that prove surprisingly effective for its genre, though not without flaws.\r\nAs personal preference, I will be referring to Saga of Tanya the Evil by its Japanese name Youjo Senki for the remainder of the review. Not only does it flow better, but it sounds cooler.\r\nWill you like it?\r\nYou may enjoy series titleif you\u2026\\n\r\n-- enjoy military themed anime, particularly those inspired by real world settings\\n\r\n-- seek an intriguing protagonist that easily set themselves apart from other MCs\\n\r\n-- consider the involvement such a young girl fighting a war interesting (my personal hook)\\n\\n\r\nYou may not enjoy series title if you\u2026\\n\r\n-- find yourself too opposed to the idea of a \u201cloli\u201d soldier\\n\r\n-- can\u2019t stomach episode ranges where dialogue and world-building may get a bit too dry\\n\r\n-- don\u2019t have a stomach of enduring action scenes they may go on for longer than needed\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nYoujo Senki is Studio NUT\u2019s debut anime, an adaptation of the esteemed and eponymous light novel authored by Carlo Zen and illustrated by Shinobu Shinotsuki. Most unfortunately, there is, as of March 2017, no English serialization of the work.\\n\\n\r\nIn contemporary Japan, a self-centered salaryman is pushed in front of a train by a former employee he had just fired that same day. Moments before impact, time is suddenly frozen by a mysterious entity simply referred to as \u201cBeing X\u201d. Having been a staunch atheist in his life, the man jeers at the supernatural force, refusing to accept it as his \u201cgod\u201d even moments before death. This Being X was not impressed by such defiance, and as punishment, the salaryman is reincarnated as young girl known as Tanya Degurechaff, though retaining her memories of her past life. Quite unlike Japan, Tanya now lives in a war-torn, 20th century European landscape, under the dominion known simply as the \u201cEmpire\u201d. Though she is but a mere child, Tanya expresses a particular affinity to magic, which warrants the attention of the Imperial Army. Here, the young girl thinks she can find climb the rungs of meritocracy in order to secure herself a comfy desk job safe from combat, but fate decrees otherwise. Tanya finds herself launched into the front lines, finding herself closer and closer to the death (and confrontation with Being X) she so desperately tries to avoid.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m sure what will both attract and repel potential viewers is the fact that the main character is a young girl, but I\u2019d like to fully stress that this unconventional design is fully explained within the lore of the series. The Imperial Army exists as a strict meritocracy with little concern for gender or age, and with the circumstances regarding Tanya\u2019s \u201creincarnation\u201d being what they are, there is a believable path of progression for her. Seriously, don\u2019t let it keep you from enjoying what is quite the intriguing exposition. Much of Youjo Senki proves extremely entertaining and invests pleased viewers with a fascinating world, explored by way of an amazing protagonist in Tanya.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the anime faces a few dry spells in terms of progression, with the biggest hit in enjoyment comes from the fact that around the middle episodes. There, we see a lot of the world-building and personal conflict with Tanya formerly prevalent pushed aside in favor of a more militaristic focus. It\u2019s not so much that I didn\u2019t enjoy the battles and ensuing strategy, but the exposition we were originally getting and becoming used to being relegated in favor of what could be considered inferior content did prove a detriment to the overall quality. Now, it\u2019s not to say that any given episode is straight up boring or painful to get through, but the middle section is notably inferior to the beginning and concluding few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nGenre & Characteristics\\n\\n\r\nAs a genre I wasn\u2019t familiar had much of a standing in the world of anime, the military theme reigns supreme as the core identity of Youjo Senki (hell, the name means something like Little Girl\u2019s War Record). I\u2019m not much of a military tactician, so I cannot attest to the veracity of certain strategies utilized by a given faction in the series, but they were executed in such a way that made sense to a layman like myself.\\n\\n\r\nFurther on this note, there is a ton of action, as would be expected in this sort of genre. What\u2019s cool about the fighting is how the soldiers are accompanied by units of \u201cmages\u201d, or elite combatants that utilize magically empowered weapons or defense matrices to devastate the opposition. This is mainly the reason why Tanya is even allowed to progress as quickly as she has since she retains a high affinity for magical competency. On the whole, all of the fighting scenes were excellent and generally choreographed well. If you are the sort that enjoys watching these sorts of skirmishes unfold, you\u2019ll be pleased by what the anime has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe supernatural plays a vital role in the lore of Youjo Senki, primarily through the force that is Being X. We are to assume contextually that he is a sort of deity, though whether he is one of benevolence or malevolence, that much is left to perspective. We do know, however, it is a entity who wields great power (enough to stop time and reincarnate beings) and seeks devotion from its inferiors (shown through the irritation of Tanya\u2019s lack of faith). The primary conflict of the series involves that between Tanya and this Being X, which proves analogous to that between a sort of David and Goliath situation.\\n\\n\r\nAn element of the story that heavily cultures the story would be the inspirations drawn from our very own world at war. Youjo Senki concerns itself primarily with a fictional corruption of early 20th century Europe, with Tanya serving beneath the Empire, or in our case, Germany. The opponents of the Empire, funnily enough, are the Allied Kingdom and Republic, both the United Kingdom and France respectively. Hell, even the names of the individuals of each faction mimic their real world counterparts (Degurechaff, Serebryakova, von Rerugen, etc.) As a fan myself of this time period, I found my experience greatly enriched as a result of the authors decision to mimic such an environment. It\u2019s not a complete one-to-one parallel, and each zone retains a variety of its own unique elements that justifies the mirror as a parody.\\n\\n\r\nNow, though the lore of these states are interesting, one of the issues of the series is that they aren\u2019t particularly explored beyond their initial presentation. I actually found it hard to really root for any side, as there\u2019s little explanation into the history and cultural values of the Empire, Allied Kingdom, or Republic besides what little bits exist in context. I\u2019m sure many will want to view the Empire as bad and want to root against it, but I question that considering I haven\u2019t seen much to say why they\u2019re a malicious faction other than their military aggression that, mind you, the opposing groups seem to offer with ease.\\n\\n\r\nI do not whatsoever believe this to be an issue associated with Carlo Zen\u2019s written work, rather it\u2019s likely more a fault of the series director in that more of the world-building was left behind in favor of other content.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is visually impressive, especially considering Youjo Senki is Studio NUT\u2019s first load. A variety of aspects helped make the animation for me, including the creative use of lighting, beautiful cloud design, and otherwise colorful atmosphere for a dreary world at war. In regards to characters, each retained a specific \u201clook\u201d to them that helped bestow and emphasize their individuality.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of that being said, I have to mention a few oddities regarding the animation that really stand out. For one, the lips of certain characters, particularly Tanya, tread into the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d at times. It\u2019s hard to say whether this is just a stylistic design by the studio or some intentional attribute made to represent the character, but considering the art of the light novel (illustrated by Shinobu Shinotsuki) is absent of this feature, it\u2019s likely the former. A downgrade, personally, but nothing too damning.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects of the series were particularly immersive, generally capturing that gritty atmosphere you\u2019d expect from a WWI-inspired battlefield. The magical strikes resonated strongly to emphasize their superiority not just visually but audibly as well. At times, it did feel as if certain combative sounds were overused, but nothing bad enough to break the immersion.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn\u2019t too bad, actually. While it may have been the most neglected aspect of the aesthetic department, you\u2019ll find yourself enjoying some of the tracks as good background music to whatever deafening battle is currently underway.\\n\\n\r\nThe various seiyuu throughout Youjo Senki perform their respective roles quite convincingly, with some stand out performances including Houchuu Ootsuka\u2019s von Zettour and Tessyo Genda\u2019s von Rudersdorf. In regards to our main character, Aoi Yuuki does well to encompass a variety of ranges in Tanya\u2019s otherwise restrictive voice, being able to range effectively from that tough commander to adorable girl when the situation demands.\\n\\n\r\nSince discussing the opening and ending is generally subjective anyway, I\u2019ll offer my personal opinion that the opening wasn\u2019t too great. I almost always skipped it, as I feel it doesn\u2019t particularly fit the series and is even a bit annoying, though visually it\u2019s okay. The ending, however, is quite nice. I\u2019m a fan of Japanese artists trying to speak/sing German, considering brilliant tracks such as Cyua\u2019s Blumenkranz (Ragyo Kiry\u016bin\u2019s theme from Kill la Kill), and the fact that Aoi Yuuki performs it as Tanya makes it even better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nTanya Degurechaff is our main character. Shrewd and unsympathetic, she is motivated completely by the prospect of self-preservation, seeking whatever means necessary to advance her position within the Imperial Army. Whether as a result of her reincarnation or by pure happenstance, she expresses a high affinity for magical power, which in turn is only reinforced by her various prayers to Being X. As a result of her sharp mind and battle potency, she has been dubbed by enemies of the Empire as the \u201cDevil of the Rhine\u201c.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed Tanya as a character, and she is easily the driving force of the series. I don\u2019t consider her the \u201cloli Hitler\u201d that some claim her to be,  as while she is extremely egocentric, there is little reason you can\u2019t understand her motives or fail to root for her on moral grounds. An argument can easily be made that she is the victim of Being X\u2019s omnipotent tyranny, a mere product of the environment in which she was forced.\\n\\n\r\nAs Tanya rises in rank, she commands an elite company unit with a variety of characters. Unfortunately, I never really felt like we got proper time with these subordinates to truly care for them as much as we should, save for maybe Viktoriya Serebryakova as she\u2019s been a part of Tanya\u2019s team since the earlier days. Their names are sadly forgettable, and you wont even find most of them on the anime entry page. Again, this is something I\u2019m sure isn\u2019t much of an issue in regards to the light novel, but this is a review of the anime, and these characters were notably misused.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the upper-echelon military leaders of the Empire are some pretty awesome characters in their own respects. Save for Tanya herself, these are easily the best characters in the series. Kurt von Rudersdorf and Hans von Zettour are the Imperial Army Chief of Operations and Chief of Staff, respectively. These two individuals are exceedingly brilliant and also caught on to Tanya\u2019s merit as a soldier early on. Conversely, Erich von Rerugen is the Vice Director of Strategy and Operation, and the only individual within the Imperial forces cognizant of Tanya\u2019s mental instability. He, along with the other heads of the Imperial Army, retain a great bit of relevance, an important trait for any supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, Youjo Senki appears to be a quirky, perhaps gimmicky series that holds no genuine promise of memorability save for \u201cOh look, a little girl with a gun!\u201d When investing further, however, you come to engage yourself in a taste of Carlo Zen\u2019s bizarre world of harsh wartime, supernatural influences, and intense combat. It\u2019s not perfect, marred by a few creative flaws and progression issues, but it justifies itself as an anime worth attention, and if you\u2019re into these kind of militarized stories, give it a shot.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I honestly believe that the shortcomings of the anime are not the result of the original work, rather the fact it wasn\u2019t adapted as well as it could have been. There\u2019s a lot of gray space that is likely filled in by content present in the light novel, but Studio NUT seemed forced to exclude a lot of it in favor of more action scenes or military exposition. I pray often that Youjo Senki gets a proper release in the West, though Being X will likely do what it can to fuck me and other English-speaking fans over, much like he does Tanya.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if there\u2019s a child protection agency I could talk to\u2026\u201d \\n\r\n\u2013 Tanya von Degurechaff",

            "content": "I've got a bone to pick with this series, and I'm inclined to be harsher towards it than I would be towards something that worse on a technical level, because it COULD be a lot better.\r\nYou can read the description if you want a summary of this series, so I'll just hop straight to the point: The main character, Tanya Deguracheff, is pretty great. She's edgy, scheming, manipulative, highly skilled, more than a little lazy (it's complicated), sadistic, and generally just a blast to watch. Everything outside the main character is boooooooring. The only characters that feel like they matter in the slightest are onlyinteresting in how they connect to the nazi loli herself.\\n\\n\r\nThis could all be forgiven if the show at least remained focused on Tanya, but past the first five or so episodes, it doesn't. Instead it focuses on the war story, which as mentioned before, sucks. The perspective tends towards Tanya's underlings, while Tanya herself is more of a force in the narrative than its center - other characters are at the mercy of her whims and schemes, while things were truly at their best when we were spending time inside her head, seeing her internal conflicts and thought processes.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, Youjo Senki writes itself into a corner. It has nothing going for it outside its main character, so it focuses on the main character. As a result, the setting and supporting cast are completely underdeveloped. In the later parts of the story though, when it tries to shift focus to the larger war, investment in it entirely hinges on our investment of the world, which there is none of. The story seems deliberately set up in a way to make the setting seem insignificant, like it's just Tanya's playground. It seems to be just one in an infinite number of alternate universe Europes, and with no sense of what life is like for common people caught up in the war and no relatable characters, I just don't care at all.\\n\\n\r\nYoujo Senki has some decent action and definitely many good moments, but its bizzare tendency to actively stay away from everything that makes it enjoyable made my ultimate opinion a net negative.",

People who are interested in cute girls playing around or who are into Ecchi stuff probably won't find much here.\r\nBut for everyone else this show should present something.\r\nSo,\r\nWhat does this show have?\r\nAnimation:\r\nIt's done pretty well, nothing of outstanding stature but better then most ofthe other shit that's come out this season.\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't to my taste but it suits the show well and some humans might enjoy it.\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\r\nThe plot definitely offers something different but if you were to ask me it's entire premise is flawed. That's not to say that the story is bad (In fact it actually draws you in and is entertaining) but that it's, put nicely over the top.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nYoung evil girl who has been resurrected by God (Nothing else to say).\\n\\n\r\nHow was my Experience?\\n\r\nThis is probably one of the shows I enjoyed more this season.

I noticed that no one actually highlighted this in the previous reviews. \r\nThe story has a gaping plot hole that kills it's fundamental premise. No spoilers here don't worry!\r\nRiddle me this, the main character Tanya was an atheist in his past life who offended God and thus was reincarnated.\r\nHe uses science as a justification for his belief. \r\nHowever:\r\n1. He meets this so called being X before dying which is a highly non scientific manner. \r\n2. Being X reincarnates him. Where is the science in this?\r\n3. Being X reincarnates him in a society where magic is normal. Thesociety also happens to be in the past in an alternate world which indicates being X's control over pretty much everything. \\n\r\n4. Given that the above occurrences fly past current human logic and science - reincarnations and magic, I mean, it would not be difficult for a main character if smart to rethink his stance. Which brings me to \\n\r\n5. Which is, Tanya was a sociopath in his past life only concerned with rising the ranks and living easy. I hardly think that he would give up the chance to suck up to being X and end up in a happier universe. He seems to have no issue with sucking up to humans.\\n\r\n6. Additionally, he's reborn as a military ace. The entire point of his reincarnation was for him to learn how to deal with strife. This becomes moot if the guy is reborn as some undefeatable paragon.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, despite all of that, he refuses to believe in the clear superiority of X, how X has given him everything he currently has for reasons unclear and is even vain enough to think that he can beat X.\\n\r\nNow if he can, that would be interesting. Till then, the plot makes no sense.\\n\r\nDude doesn't question that he's been reborn, there's magic, he's in an alternate world. I mean.",

            "content": "Youjo Senki is a twelve episode anime from earlier this year. It was brought to us by NUT. So far, this series and its recap episode are NUT's only aired productions. It's based off of an ongoing light novel by Zen Carlo. So, we have an anime from a new studio based on a light novel I've never heard of with an author I know nothing about. How exciting for us.\r\nStory:\r\nThe series opens with Tanya, our protagonist, leading a squadron of mages in the Rhine in some bloody skirmishes. We then go back and see that our narrative opens properly with a salary man firingsomeone for incompetence. It's clear from the narration that he has no sense of empathy and he's just coldly doing his work. Just when you're wondering how this remotely connects to the stuff from earlier, he's pushed in front of a train. Time stops and he starts talking with Being X, a powerful creature who claims to be god and in charge of the cycle of reincarnation. X sends our protagonist to another world, saying that he will make him acknowledge him as god by making his situation desperate. Our protagonist becomes Tanya, with his personality and memories intact. Tanya's magical potential is quickly discovered and she joins the military. At least this series gives her an early childhood to get used to a drastic change in gender and uses reincarnation as the tool for it instead of having her be changed by aliens and instantly okay with it for no adequately explored reason, looking at you, Kashimashi.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this series does have some issues. Being X's interest in this one person doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Yeah, they won't acknowledge you as being god. Why not find some people who will instead of wasting a bunch of time on this one person? Is it because you consider it a challenge? Also, if you wanted to make things desperate for her then why did you give her a massive amount of magical power? Is Being X a part of the Q continuum playing a game with a different member of the continuum where they each take turns using their powers to do different things to this poor girl to see how she'll respond? One reincarnates her as a little girl in another world, the next comes in and gives her a lot of magic to undermine the first and so on. Maybe it's explained in the light novels that go beyond the anime, but it seems kind of flimsy here. The narrative itself also follows a rather predictable path. Once they introduce a situation, it's pretty obvious where they're going to go with it. There's never a point where they subvert your expectations and do the unexpected. Except in terms of the military allowing a little girl to join. That's pretty bizarre.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, it is still kind of compelling to watch. This series borrows a lot from all of those JRPGs where your party has to fight against the arrogant god-figure who sadistically toys with ordinary mortals. Which I'm okay with because I like a lot of those games; FF Tactics, Breath of Fire, Xenogears, FF Legend, Shin Megami Tensei. Etc... So, it's kind of interesting to see a lot of their basic tropes converted to a different medium. The series is good at setting up parallels between this world of magic and our world and of having Tanya use our strategic history to her advantage. And the strategies she suggests are kind of clever. They aren't basic nonsense that any grade schooler knows like disguising yourselves as the other guys nor do they only work because the enemies act like morons. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu should take notes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those series that tries to make its characters both pretty unsympathetic & complex. Like Dune or Watchmen before it. Does it succeed? Kind of. Tanya is a character who's motivated entirely by self interest. If she does something for one of the troops under her command, it's probably so that she looks good. It's established right from the beginning that she doesn't much care for them or their lives and she will send them to their deaths without any real concern.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing that makes her kind of interesting is her feud with Being X. You would think she'd be willing to acknowledge him as \u201cgod\u201d just to make things easier for herself, given her general outlook. But she steadfastly refuses and defies him at every turn. We see her stubbornness come into play a few other times too but never to the same extent. Being X is pretty much the standard god-figure from those aforementioned games. An arrogant prick who toys with mortals and demands praises. The various supporting characters vary. A lot of them don't have much in terms of personality. Some of them are about as developed as you could reasonably manage for a side character in a twelve episode series.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in this is kind of interesting. The facial designs are really expressive. I particularly like the way they do Tanya's smirk. The series is also good about creating an otherworldly atmosphere when Being X shows up. The only real issue I have is that there are times when the characters look like they're superimposed over the backgrounds instead of blending in. It's an effect rather like looking at a part of a film where it's really bloody obvious the actors are in front of a green screen.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThey got some pretty good actors. Yuuki Aoi takes on the role of our heroine. Hayami Saori voices our most important secondary character and the Being X vocal effect is pretty grandiose. I have more mixed feelings towards the music. The incidental music tends to be decent enough but I kind of really dislike the theme tunes. Most of them have that heavily synthesised quality you tend to get when someone can't sing and is relying on auto-tune to make it sound like they can.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't really any romance in this series, ho-yay or otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nYoujo Senki is one of those series that's interesting enough for me to want to see a follow up but not strong enough for me to call it good. It's all right and if NUT does a follow up I'll definitely review that when it's finished but, for the moment, there are too many unaddressed questions. Especially Being X's motivations behind this level of interest in one person. It's also a tad too predictable. It's a decent start, but it needs to do some more work on developing its ideas. My final rating is going to sit at a respectable 6/10. Next week we'll look at Arion. I don't think the film is actually about the immortal horse, but we'll see.",

            "content": "Youjo Senki was an uncomfortable anime for me to watch as a man of faith.  Tanya's blasphemous rants against God were disturbing to watch, but I've heard worse in sharing the Gospel with others.  However, I didn't find the anime itself to be blasphemous, rather a poignant look at the battle between a God who desires to be worshiped and unbelieving Man, who refuses to do so.  I think it even gave a truthful look at how God reacts to those who rebel against him.  While the Church teaches that God is only love, he does have wrath, and he hasbrought calamities to those who would not believe in order to get them to believe in Him.  Which is the crux of what this anime is all about.   \\n\\n\r\nI think you're going to have a different view of this anime depending on whether or not you actually believe in God.  I didn't become a Christian until I was 20 and spent years refusing to live for God, until he brought calamity into my life like Tanya.  I then submitted to Him, and realized I was a fool for not doing it sooner.  But, from that perspective I understand Tanya's desire to ignore God and live the life she wants to live.  But, as someone who found the peace in submission, I also felt like I wish she would just submit.  The most irrational thing for her to do, in her mind, would be the only rational choice.  She cannot win against God.  It was immensely entertaining to watch her try, however.  It made for a fantastic plot, especially intertwined with the horrors of war. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, this anime revolved completely around Tanya and her struggle with \"Being X\".  As such, the entire cast was pretty much cut and paste military grunts and generals around her.  The only other character to stand out from the pack was her assistant Serebryakova, a strangely bubbly character for the anime, that in spite of her persona, was able to get things done and not hesitate in battle.  \\n\\n\r\nWith Tanya being the primary focus, her character had to be excellent in order for this anime to shine, and it did.  While the anime says it's \"The Saga of Tanya The Evil\", in reality, it's \"The Saga of Tanya the Schemer.\". Only twice in the whole anime does she do anything that could be described as \"evil\".  A more apt description of her would be someone who was callous and calculating.  She's no hero, to be sure.  She's not even an anti-hero.  She's basically a Nazi with villainous tendencies.  But, she's not particularly evil.  Although, you get the sense that she could become the Hitler of this world she's in and thus become evil.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing this anime excelled at was the battles.  Tanya leads a battalion of mages, that fight similar to Strike Witches.  These aerial battles are intense, especially each time she fights her nemesis, Anson Sioux.  The final battle of the anime was particularly amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nThe animation style of this is similar to Full Metal Alchemist.  Very good motion, decent character design, and full, rich European environments.  I was particularly impressed with the drawings that came at the end of each episode.  They were just photos of Tanya, but they were incredibly well done.  Something else that stood out to me was the sound.  The sounds of war were very realistic, especially the explosions.  It's a weird thing to notice, but the sounds of the explosions were deafening.  They sounded very realistic. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I highly enjoyed this anime and am looking forward to a second season of it.  Especially if it ends like how I anticipate it to end.   I would definitely recommend it with high marks.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9",

            "content": "Am I the only one here who do want to see Tanya Degurechaff grow while hoping she stays at the same age? Yes? No? Well... Youjo Senki or Saga of Tanya the Evil is a story of reincarnated salaryman who wakes up inside a blonde baby girl in a German-ish country right in the middle of a stagnant war. I was captivated with this anime by how it bring us the strategies within the war and not just that \"they attack, I defend\" kind of thing.\r\nYes, war strategies with a little spice of politics and \"Being X\" mixed inside would be the best to describeYoujo Senki. They never describe mages as the strongest forces in the world but a quick and fast to react force that could be used as a new way of strategy. In this anime, I could say that mages is some kind of their Scout class. They are the first one to be out of the gate to wreak the havoc behind the enemy's line while the others progress at the front line. Youjo Senki's writer really optimized that and wrote the strategies based on those ground.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, Tanya while being branded as evil from everywhere, she is not so evil as what she wants is living safely and peacefully. She tried her best to stop the war as she has that dream and obsession to beat Being X those drive her to do so. I love how they made Tanya frustrated over not being stop the war for good. I know from many books and websites of histories, that it was a mistake to overlook French Navy's escape to Africa and Tanya, who knew that from her previous life, took that to heart and fell into frustration as she was just a soldier who must obey the higher-ups. Her dream and obsession are two kind of thing that drives the character of Tanya and made her a very solid character.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching this anime, I have a good advice for you all. Don't watch this anime on full volume if you are wearing a headset. While the soundtracks are brimming with that military vibes, the sound effect will definitely make you deaf if you listen on full volume. While it is bad for your ear, I think it is a good way to immerse the war vibe in this anime as every bullet and shots being thrown must be deafening in real life, too. If you are not bothered to hurt your ear just to immerse yourself, don't say that I did not give you any warning.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this anime being a tactical military drama that rarely I found in an anime with mages involved. With how the anime ended, I really look forward its movie and wish for another season for this anime.",

            "content": "Youjo Senki has an interesting and relatively new premise for me, where an unbeliever is reincarnated in a troubled world in which he needs to turn around, as a trial of a deity who wants him, a cold, calculating man, to gain faith in divinity. His reincarnation in this peculiar world where magic is part of the military makes things much more interesting, giving a mystical touch to war. The narrative of the story, unfortunately, dragged itself for some time, making an exercise of the protagonist simply being invincible. This only came to change from episode 6 onwards. The studio, NUT, founded by former membersof the Madhouse, encountered a number of difficulties throughout the adaptation. This, unfortunately, has disrupted the experience of many viewers. However, far from it means that the studio is bad, it was able to stand out and recover from episode 7 onwards.\\n\\n\r\nYoujo Senki ended up with our protagonist seeing to what extent the \"Existence X\" would go so that he could have faith in him for the first time. Beyond, of course, the world war that would follow from then on because of the weakness and stupidity of the high echelon she served. Youjo Senki is a medium-sized work with an interesting proposal. The play has a series of imperfections and problems in the middle, yet it managed to finish decently. In my analysis, it is a good work.",

Tanya is an extremely unlikable character who you root for to FAIL, not to win, because she is just awful. The other characters are boring and do nothing. The only enjoyment I got out of this show was the fact that me and a friendof mine ripped on it the entire time we watched it, even that was difficult because the show is nothing. Overall 2/10, if you enjoy life and not wasting your time then please avoid this show at all costs.",

            "content": "Well the premise is certainly interesting, we have a 10 year old little girl commanding a battalion and it's not some cringe-y \"hope of the whole world lies in this little girl so I must follow her to the ends of the world\" kind of thing.\r\nTanya is a normal company employee that is quite good at doing his job, at the untimely moment of his death, god speaks to him and somehow he manages to irritate this being. He is then sent to a place as per his unfortunate suggestion, that will make him desperate enough to have faith in god.\r\nArt:\r\nThe animation and action ishandled quite good, it's not My Hero Academia levels but its consistency on how it moves is certainly pleasant and heart thumping when it needs to be. Some character designs seem to be out of place caricature (namely the protagonist(?) and one of her female subordinate) and while it can make sense on Tanya's part (protagonist) as she is 10 years old, it doesn't make much sense with the other, but you just kind of tune it out since everything else is great and since her face sort-a reflects her personality, in a way.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNo music used to force an emotion, it was handled well. Not exceptional but nothing to complain about either. Things that go boom, go boom, things that go whoosh, go whoosh and they go whoosh in a convincing way. It's pretty well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters aren't complex but that's not necessarily bad. A lot of anime mistake having quirks for having complex characters while I remember one very mediocre anime even just telling outright that their quirk is such and such. Really good examples of bad characterizations are One Piece and Fairy Tail where they put a quirk to some enemy like always saying something at the end of a sentence then putting some sappy back story and pat themselves on the back thinking they did good. \\n\r\nThis anime doesn't have that, there's no tragic back story, they're just people trying to win a war. Their motivations are clear and they are understandable and believable. Yes you won't remember them, but in a way, you're not really supposed to. Don't get me wrong, you'll feel what they feel, but in the end Tanya is the star and you see that consistently. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis anime is surprisingly funny. How Tanya speaks to make things convenient for her. (that's basically her end-goal) but everything ultimately bites her in the back. It's funny how everything goes against her, well, almost everything. The consistency, the tone, everything is handled well. Even her \"evil\" is handled with taste. She's not some warmonger but she's no patriot either. It's a really fun series and I hope more people watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThing's worth watching, definitely. The landscape of shounen is really changing. Before we basically had shouting protagonists, but now we have people with common sense and a lot of nuance. I love it, more please! \\n",

            "content": "Story : 3 : Past the basic premise and first few episodes, every episode is pretty much about war, how to war, what is war, what war is, war the war, how to war the war by warring the war, warfighting in the war against warfighters who war the war in the war.\r\nIt's kinda sorta a little repetitive and narrow-minded.\r\nArt: 7 : It certainly has its own visual style, if only because of dem huge lips. It's also quite good at building a period and a setting.\r\nSound : 7 : Great VA for the protagonist and a ton of fun here and there with thebattle sounds.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 7 : Yeah, not as high as one might expect. I do like the premise a lot, and I think Tanya Degurechaff's personality is a pretty brilliant idea, once you're past the idea of a 12 year old being a war demon. Hell, this kawaii uguu ojou-chan is probably the one that'll turn you off moe girls out of fear that they pursue you to the ends of the earth to blast your limbs off one by one.\\n\\n\r\nBut while Tanya's personality is fine, I have two gripes with Youjo Senki:\\n\r\nOne, Tanya herself doesn't evolve. She stays the same old thickheaded \"mein career, mein results\" personality throughout the entire anime, it seems. Perhaps a conclusion might change that, but for now at episode 8, this is pretty damn poor. It's always about how to destroy the enemy and how to win and have her soldiers do what she orders heartlessly. Ok. I get it. Good BASIC premise.\\n\\n\r\nBut they never do anything with it. She is supposedly undergoing a sort of penance by being in a WW1 setting. But she never has any real penance. She's a brutally powerful witch who cleans the battlefield so well that when she walks straight into an enemy ambush, she blasts them all away. Now she could lose, it's been implied many times that she's not actually invincible, but how long can you just tell me about that before I actually see it?\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of Tanya's bitching about how she hates danger and just wants an easy and comfortable seat, I never saw her get bruised. Not once. Worse, because she never undergoes defeat or failure, she never comes to a point where she has to question herself. The point of this penance is to make her reflect on her actions as a heartless person, so why the hell is it that acting like a heartless person is in no way detrimental to her? She never has any real trigger to evolve. It's just a bad bitch who stays bad and laughs maniacally about it. She's a ton of fun, but it's just the same old crazy girl doing murderous shit until you feel like you've seen it all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd two, besides Tanya herself, there is not a single character that matters in this anime. Anyone represented as even slightly contradictory to Tanya dies, or is too far away from her to harm her in any way. There is simply no stimuli whatsoever, it's just one girl being a horrible bitch and everyone around her being pretty much cannon fodder, or weak people who can't do a thing. Without defeats, or any valid opponents, it's just blazing through a weak adversity, and that's all that Youjo Senki has been recently, a fun, but mindless and plotless power fantasy, in the body of a 10 or 12 year old girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 : As I just said, Youjo Senki has become nothing else than a power fantasy embodied by a 10 or so year old girl. It's fun.\\n\r\nIt's just pure, evil, villainous, fun. You're on the side of a killer, a crazy murderer, who cares about nobody and only wants to further her career and her war. And it's a great load of fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 7 : let me completely make a completely BS prediction. I haven't seen the original novel nor the end of the series, but let me just predict the end of the plot:\\n\\n\r\nThe war will be lost\\n\\n\r\nTanya will be sold out by the government as \"that devil that the winners want dead\" and as a really embarrassing war demon they want to be rid of\\n\\n\r\nTanya will see that the machine she gave so much for betrays her and realise the error of her ways\\n\\n\r\nNow I could be ENTIRELY wrong here. But from the way the story is built up, it seems to be the logical conclusion. Tanya is being punished for being a heartless creature in a heartless machine and trampling over people's feelings and lives. And in the end, the heartless machine she serves for personal profit will crush her like all the lives she crushed.\\n\\n\r\nA poetic justice ending to a straightforwardly wrong ideology.\\n\\n\r\nBut the problem is, the war is just in its early stages. We haven't even come to the Verdun of this story. We are at episode 8, and the plot hasn't been getting anywhere, and Tanya's penance seems to be mostly about her doing whatever she likes yet.\\n\\n\r\nIt could last about 20 episodes before something happens where Tanya is actually challenged on her behavior, which is the point of the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in two clear words: fuck that. Youjo Senki can largely afford to throw us a ton of bones. Side characters that aren't total idiots who die, enemies and opponents that can properly challenge her, people around her who can resent, betray or ruin her. It's in a war setting, on a side that historically loses the war. It has every occasion to give us more than \"Tanya Degurechaff is evil. Look at her being evil. Just check how evil she is. Have you ever seen a little girl be this evil?\" for a whole season.",

This show does something that I rarely see in anime and that's the attention to the firearms and this show does almost everything from loading the gun to operating them, it's always done well. Most weapons used are from the appropriate nations to what they used in WW1 with the onlyexception being the M1 Garand. \\n\\n\r\nThe attention to detail is amazing in this show with a few scenes I don't wish to spoil. just pay attention to scenes and you'll see things that are used to help world building and authenticity such as paintings in the backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters there's some enjoyable characters that aren't super trope and are mostly unique. Tanya is a well done character at least to me albeit a little psychotic. \\n\\n\r\nMost of my enjoyment comes from the attention to detail and pretty well done animation and art. The story isn't amazing but doesn't subtract from the enjoyment.",

            "content": "miracles are just illusions caused by insufficient observation and understanding. they are just........glorious misunderstanding.\r\nmake way for the next generation isekai! \r\nits actually been a long time since i have seen an anime that builds its society in such a deep level. if you write this anime into a book, it might even look like a history book in some section. with the combination of politics, military, magic and loli. i will recommend the anime to anyone who likes op and straightforward MC who is pretty much a villain in the core. XD\r\nstory - 9/10: the story is based on the context of WWI, as evidencedin the anime, they still uses trench method of fighting, but all side have already developed Gatling machine guns and long range artillery. on top of that, there are a group of people who can use their mana to use charged weapons, which they are called the mages. the story was how Tanya, the MC, used her cursed power which was given or 'blessed' by the God to create a storm in this bloody battlefield, which ultimately made the Empire where the MC belongs to the strongest country mankind have ever known. as a finally-passed-newbie state MAL user, i liked the story quite a bit even though i wasn't expecting too much out of it at the beginning, but one can not only judge from its cover, after the first episode, it really made my heart race from just seeing those epic battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10: well, the art is actually not too bad if you are talking about everyone and everything about the anime except the MC and her assistant who are actually meant to be cute and charming looking, especially the assistant. but the result drawing was just unbelievable, i don't know if they purposely did that because its a shonen or they just don't want any ultra cute soldiers in their anime. but despite the art for women, every male character looks pretty damn likeable. every single one of them have completely unique feature and they all look powerful and cunning which gave the anime a completely new feel.\\n\\n\r\nsound - 9/10: the OSTs in this anime was absolutely brilliant. there are always a blood pumping orchestra playing in the background whenever a battle is going on, and they did a really good job of knowing when to pause the music. unlike comedy, this dark themed series dosent always need music, a silence in some part can be really dramatic and suspenseful, which i think they did a really good job on it.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters - 8/10: Degurechaff Tanya was unarguably our lead female MC in this series. despite having the appearance of a 9 years old girl, she earned the title of 'devil of the Rhine' for her ruthlessness and total invincibility on battlefield. which led to our suspicion of her actually been the antagonist of the anime. this however was quite a enjoyable point in the setting. apart from the MC, the first support came down to her assistant, who compare to Tanya, was like angel in the battalion. with her supposed cute appearance, kind heart, and the blush when scolded. she was simply the the best female character of the serie. \\n\\n\r\noverall, i gave the anime a 9/10, which in my opinion is a reasonable number. people says that this is really similar to overlord, but i just cant imagine what are the similarity apart from both MC been the  'villains'. rather in here, she's meant to be protagonist and we the audience suspect her to be a villain and in Overlord, the skeleton dude was supposed to be a villain but he did nothing but helping villagers.\\n\\n\r\nagain, i thought this is a really well-made anime which everyone should spend some time and have a look.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The concept of the story is nice, I haven't seen it touched before in anime but unfortunately it's potential isn't reached.\r\nArt: I have to say it is good at some points but most of the time it's god awful. The girls in the anime don't look decent at all, the protag herself sometimes has aDonald Duck lip thing going on, however art of urban areas and during battles isn't half bad. I can't over look the fact some of the minor side characters look better than the main ones which is quite sad.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OST is pretty good, I like the opening and the flow of music runs good with most situations through out the anime. Though for the running theme I dare say it would have fitted better if it sounded more German.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: They very mediocre and overall I'll forget about most of them a month or two after I'm done with this anime. The protag herself isn't to bad but the wasted potential is noticed.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth a seasonal watch for 2017, but I wouldn't pick this up again at the rate it's going... overall I feel there is a lot wrong with this anime that can be easily fixed and in other areas like the story should have been given more detail.",

He dies an expected death when one of the employees in the company he works in pushes him in front of a train to kill him but before the business man dies god stops time moments before his death to start lecturing him about faith and morality moments before his death. God wills him to bereborn in the body of a little girl named Tanya in an alternate history ww1 in the not German empire. \\n\\n\r\nIn the show you get to see a very interesting alternate history of ww1 where the show explores philosophy, atheism VS theism, science, war tactics, the reality of war, and various sociological concepts like using economic theory to determine people\u2019s actions, signaling theory, Stanford\u2019s prison experiment and you will get to live though other interesting topics through the protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\r\nThe animation of the anime is excellent and very high quality and only a few shows I have seen have better animation. Studio NUT has really done a great job with this show, the show has a little bit of CGI but so little it is hardly noticeable 3D graphics and it seems like everything was animated in 2D. the action and fight scenes in the show are well scripted and look amazing. \\n\\n\r\nRecommendation \\n\r\nDo I recommend you buy, rent or pass on watching this show? I would suggest that you buy this show its first season and look forward to its second season as there are very few shows like this being so interesting going over various things with such interesting, well developed characters. Most shows you will see don\u2019t stand out and don\u2019t have anything interesting to say and fall under typical tropes like good VS evil, a love story, a drama or a comedy but saga of Tanya the evil is a interesting story rarely if ever been done before quite like this about person VS god while exploring in depth the choices the character makes and why they do what they do and think what they think and know what they know. If you really enjoyed the anime I would also suggest you read the manga and the light novels by Carlo Zen. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cAny literature that refuses to step in line with science and philosophy, is homicidal and suicidal literature\u201d\\n\r\nCharles Baudelaire Quote\\n\r\nPosted 3 March, 2018.",

            "content": "Youjo Senki probably put a lot of people off with its weird premise, even the poster on MAL looks strange. Personally, I thought it was going to be some lolicon-baiting comedy with warfare as a backdrop - I was prepared to drop it like it was hot - fortunately Youjo Senki is more than the sum of its parts.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is set in the continent of Definitely-Not-Europe, and there's a war going on that's somewhere between WW1 and WW2; Youjo Senki borrows events from both wars to tell its story, as well as adding its own flavor (most notably there's magic). Beyond the ridiculous circumstancesthe main character finds herself in, there's a serious, gritty, war story being told here. They did a great job at capturing the ruthless pragmatism and madness that grips people in life or death situations.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI loved the action scenes, the explosions looked absolutely fantastic, and the CG they used wasn't obnoxious. The characters look good, and Tanya has some distinctly-not-girly facial expressions that drive home intense scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWhether it's artillery shells or bullets, the FX in Youjo Senki are excellent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nTanya is our reluctant \"salaryman\" hero(ine?), and despite her totally fucked personality, she is somewhat sympathizable; like any sane person, her goal is to not die. It never really got old how - though some people put up token resistance - everyone just accepted that a 10-year-old girl would be in the military and leading much older men and women, that's anime liberty for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are really, really, side characters in Youjo Senki, the focus is firmly on Tanya throughout. Viktoriya is the only consistently relevant one, and she's mostly used as comic relief, and can we talk about how she's in the pseudo-German army and her name is Viktoriya Ivanovna Serebryakova, which is probably the most pseudo-Russian name I've ever heard?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI always love a good war anime (well, a good war book, movie, or anything, really), and that's what Youjo Senki is, with the typical helping of anime nonsense along the way. I would highly recommend it to anyone who can palate the 10-year-old female killing machine and see the greatness beneath it.",

            "content": "You may can find bunch of fan based sh*ts out of there. But Youjo Senki is on another level of them. Author based this story on real WW1 then he included his  isekai idea as very well way. Story begins with selfish middle aged salaryman takes karma for what he did. Middle of his death \"Being X\" freezes time and irate to him. Being X wants him in cornered in difficult of life. Then ma boy reincarnates to sentry 20th sentry with magic exists. Being X gives him bunch of pressures. First Being X takes his poor d*ck and changes his gender. Shestarts life from zero as baby that who has abandoned in poor nunnery middle of war. Luckily she has good magic ability with her born but it is just wish of Being X wanted him cornered in war. Those plots based on story line not on fan base shits. \\n\\n\r\nRotten commanders just slows down WW1. Many young soldiers dies because of them. People may say Tanya is evil. But those retard commanders are real ones. She may can be selfish but she does her best whole time. Other mob characters just yells him with trash words. That's nothing for Tanya. I amazed Tanya's strong heart and fighting spirit. \\n\r\nIf this story goes similar to real WW1 it's there must be 2 sequels at least. I really wanna watch them. :3\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was normal but it was very well suited to story and characters. \\n\\n\r\nOp, eds were good. I loved ed theme song. Osts were fantastic tho. \\n\r\nCharacters voice were well suited. In early episodes Tanya's voice felt weird. But if think it back then it was suited as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters wills were strong. I really liked Tanya's dark side. She is so strong one. She maybe based on Hitler. Hitler hatred whole world but his people thanked him a lot.\\n\r\nBtw Anson and his daughter's wills give me chills. \\n\\n\r\nI rewatched it 3 times for fully understand whole story line.In the end i really enjoyed season 1.

            "content": "Back when Youjo Senki first aired, I watched the first episode, thought \"what the heck is this mess?,\" and went on with my life. After several people convincing me otherwise, I finally got back to this show as part of my backlog, and it was surprisingly enjoyable.\r\nPros:\r\n1. It's great for the casual war/history fan. Like most things that are anime-fied, there's a sweet spot between \"not interested in the subject IRL\" and \"obsessed with the subject IRL\" that becomes the target audience for Youjo Senki. If you've seriously studied WWI, you're probably setting yourself up for disappointment, but if you're like me, and vaguely rememberliking middle school/high school world history class, congratulations, you're in luck. Many battle tactics in Youjo Senki play out logically, and there's plenty of magic, violence, and action flashing across the screen as those tactics unfold. \\n\\n\r\n2. The show moves along at a good clip, without an excess of foreshadowing/dramatic irony. Nothing is worse than when you know what the plan is, and it still takes forever to get there. Youjo Senki explains what it's going to do and then immediately does it, drawing you along for more and more decisive points of the war.\\n\\n\r\n3. The dry, deadpan humor of some of the scenes after the ED. Don't miss out on those.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n1. The first episode starting in the middle of the action. I don't get it, and I personally feel like it didn't work. War battles need more context than what was given to be interesting/impactful, and I'm not really the sort of person who will watch a show just for the OP loli. The second episode is the \"real\" first episode that actually then takes you through the story chronologically.\\n\\n\r\n2. God/Being X. Their actions are wildly inconsistent, and the whole theme of faith/religion is underdeveloped. Instead of being interwoven as a consistent underlying dread, they just up at random critical moments as a plus or a minus, and they seem to take way more offense at the MC not being properly in awe than with the MC's selfishness, which makes God/Being X seem super petty. I mean, it's a great way to get the audience on the MC's side, because God/Being X acts like an overpowered toddler instead of something more all-knowing, but it could have been a much more interesting dynamic/relationship if God was more, well, godly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10, the background scenery looked very good and the action scenes were effective. The character designs also worked given what the show was trying to do but weren't my cup of tea. Serebryakova looked like a moe blob and what was up with the glasses guy's hair?\\n\r\nSound: 7/10, the OP/ED were fine but not particularly memorable. There was no attempt to show people in different countries speaking in different languages or using magic as a translator, although maybe language diversity is just not a thing in this world? (Haven't read the source material.) Tanya's voice takes a little getting used to.",

            "content": "[6.5/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nThe year of surprises. Recently, both western media and anime have been surprising me, usually in a good way. From Kong to Dragon Maids, I've found shockingly enjoyable entertainment in places where I really wouldn't expect it to be. Maybe i'm becoming softer, as the escapist entertainment slowly drags me through the depths of \"why don't you just have fun!\" and \"just turn your brain off, dude!\" and whatever other insipid statements tend to spring from the bad taste crowd. I'm not above making fun of someone for the kind of shit they watch, so when i'm conscious of the kind of shit i'm watching,well, it creates a whole new self-aware dynamic within my mind. \\n\\n\r\nI think that's my own idiosyncrasy though. I try to be as tepid as possible whenever introduced with an outlandish concept, like a salary man-turned loli in an alt-world war 1 with magic. Maybe that's why I've been getting surprised more and more. Gauging how excited you are can possibly salvage an iffy premise. Youjo Senki, or Saga of Tanya the Evil is one of those premises that becomes synonymous with stereotypes in anime. \\n\\n\r\nI'm prone to indulging in those stereotypes too. Whether it be laughing at blunt storytelling, bad character chemistry, or more vague things like farcical story concepts, like meeting a dragon while drunk and having it turn into a cute girl who is also a maid. Concepts that are generally reserved to this kind of escapist entertainment also known as anime. Senki is no different. But surprisingly, it does have some pretty awesome and memorable qualities about it. I feel like this is what some action fans may be looking for.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who has come to the conclusion that action anime isn't all up my alley simply due to the way the way it is very often constructed. Senki surprised me. It's strange because I am definitely a huge action fan in the live action medium, as well as a huge horror fan (anime doesn't really have much horror, though), yet the kinds of shows I've seen within this animated medium haven't done all that much to impress me with the action itself. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe i'm being overly cynical since I really dug Kill La Kill, and thought Mob Psycho 100 was pretty solid recently, as well, and while Mob definitely excelled in its action, Kill La Kill was more interesting to me with its characters. I guess what i'm saying is that my experience with the actual action in action anime has been rough. \\n\\n\r\nHere is where Youjo Senki comes in. While not something that is revolutionary or particularly awe-inspiring, there are elements here that any action fan can really get behind, not another dragged out twenty episode Shounen. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The War]\\n\\n\r\nAs I briefly explained, a salary man gets murdered by a co-worker he just fired and gets reincarnated into a German loli who tests positive for \"magical capabilities\" and becomes a powerful, yet very young battle mage in what can only be described as World War 1 Alt-Germany. With all the other parallels to other countries landing square in the \"tasteful\" zone. This salary man-turned-loli is incredibly cynical. Of humanity, faith, and just about anything in between. \\n\\n\r\nHe gets greeted by a \"god\", which he aptly refers to as Being X who gives him the opportunity for reincarnation but only if he takes up the name of the lord, pretty much. Of course this cynical guy doesn't want to do that, hence getting transported into wartime. The interest here stems from his relation with this pho-God and how this \"God\" is portrayed. Greedy, unfair, and somewhat petty, similar to some of our gods, but not all-knowing. \\n\\n\r\nSo a battle begins. Being X fights for this salary man's faith, and the salary man, who is now Tanya Degurachaff, fights with all her will to never bow to a being like this. A fight of faith versus humanity, with the humanity being cynical of humanity. Interesting, but may straddle the line of pettiness. Thankfully, Senki never journeys deep into that rabbit hole, and apart from a very well-placed monologue towards the end of the show, this show stays preach-free, which is a big thumbs up. Again, that stereotype of \"moralistic anime preachiness\" is, maybe not subverted, but surprisingly not all there. \\n\\n\r\nTanya rises in the ranks, trying to establish a comfy space in the back-lines, but gets constantly thrown face-first into the brunt of the action. She ends up commanding a battalion of semi-forgettable characters that follow her headlong into battle. Her stature (and age) are questioned, but only lightly, creating a very strange verisimilitude within this world. On one hand this is absurd, on the other hand this introduction of magic can actually excuse their recruitment of such a young officer. She's prone to incredibly powerful magic, but not powerful enough to be some overpowered main character, which prevents this show's Shounen-action roots from showing at all. \\n\\n\r\nSenki feels more of a globe-trotting adventure with a lot of very colorful pit-stops. Very similar to something like a Call of Duty campaign. Not necessarily a bad thing, especially since this show puts a lot of effort into creating political conflict which ends up being back-ended by the action. Not every episode ends with action, and not every episode really needs to. Tanya, and her VA, Aoi Yuuki, do an outstanding job in conveying this persons feelings as the show progresses, even if sometimes I could do without the constant introspection.\\n\\n\r\nIt always feels as though the war is bigger than Tanya herself, even if she is responsible for a very powerful battalion of mages. Which is great. This is a massive war with a lot of political ideologies colliding and it really wouldn't make sense to put this character at the forefront of it all, even if her eventual influence on a lot of the leaders who we see constantly sitting around important tables talking politics and smoking cigars feels a little too easy. \\n\\n\r\nThe technology of this war is confusing, but I suppose it ought to be. Being X is constantly interfering with other people, giving them advice and occasionally even empowering them with more powerful magic. The progression of technology is sudden and important, as years pass in the blink of an eye. I think Senki is at fault with not showing character growth as these years pass, which is unfortunately up to the artists to do, by aging Tanya accordingly. While she definitely matures in the sense that she becomes more seasoned to the war, no character feels different after the multiple-year conflict, visually. No scars, nothing. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Presentation]\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation is a bit of a mixed bag, however, there is definitely more positives to be said. The best thing I can say about Senki is how breathtaking its sound design is for a low budget TV anime. The gunshots, explosions, and everything in between sound crisp and powerful. Some moments truly stand out due to the sound, here. The OP and ED aren't too bad, inhabiting a grunge-rock base with some more pop-oriented elements thrown in during their chorus. I think they are good enough to be memorable. The OP itself is somewhat disappointing, with boring imagery and overall not too much creativity injected in it. \\n\\n\r\nThe sequences where new-comer studio NUT put visible effort into turned out awe-inspiring. Especially a prolonged ten-minute battle sequence near the end of the season was truly one of the better sequences in recent memory. However, there is some really blatant and unfortunately bad use of CG throughout the shows less-than-exceptional battles. One glaring moment was with a battleship cruising on what I believe was 'water' but the rendering was so hideous that it looked like a PS1 game. There is some frame rate issues with soldiers marching. All these things plague so many TV anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, and surprisingly, the editing does a lot of the heavy lifting. While this show was often dark and brooding, the editing and direction in many cases actually gave it a lot of life. Yutaka Uemura, whom I have not seen any work from, does some very solid work on Senki. Certain scenes and cuts really stick out as creative, fun, and even exhilarating. Even some more dialogue-driven scenes are cut well, which brings a new air to the way you listen to two people discuss war politics, which isn't always the most interesting topic. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter design is generally not too memorable, as it focuses mostly on realistic designs that contrast hard with our main characters design. It isn't a bad thing, since I actually enjoy more realistic approaches to design. Many of them just don't stand out as much. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Characters in an Alt-History]\\n\\n\r\nSo Tanya is an attempt at an anti-hero. She's called \"evil\", but words like cruel, greedy, conniving, self-righteous, and powerful come to mind more often than evil does. There was one scene where \"evil\" can be attributed to her name, but everything else more lays towards the \"Chaotic Lawful\" side of things. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I never really got the idea that she was some evil psychopath. If anything, she was just self-absorbed and only caring about herself, which is a fine character trait.\\n\\n\r\nAs a protagonist she's the most engaging character in the series. I also really want to thank the show for not relying on poorly-placed comedy to make light of certain scenes. While there is comedy, it is often more understated apart from a few glaring places, which is acceptable. With Tanya harboring more of an anti-hero roll, you end up siding more with some of the people she kills, rather than herself. One scene particularly worked well, with imminent civilian casualties being swept under the rug due to a law-interpretation she wrote the paper on. She values logical solutions over emotional ones, which may make her, as I said, cruel and ruthless, but she doesn't really indulge in a lot of what she does. She simply is uncaring towards it. \\n\\n\r\nViktoriya is the most prominent secondary in the show. Her design is perhaps the most questionable, as her eyes are a bit too big for her face. It looks odd. What is the most questionable is her role within the show. She really just plays a cute girl that slowly becomes encapsulated in Tanya's world. Viktoriya doesn't have much of a character arc. I wouldn't call her all that pertinent to the show and her eventual role is mostly just another girl, however, it just ends up pointing out the complete lack of females within the show overall. Weird. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I do say she's supposed to be a \"cute\" character, I wouldn't say the show overly relies on the \"cute\" aspect of her or Tanya for that matter. I'm really happy about that. This could've easily just been a show where a cute character murders people, and that would've lost my interest within the first episode. Thankfully it springs for a more in-depth approach to a character, even if it is definitely a result of marketing a character like this. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest issues that Senki develops is its lack of actual consequences. The show itself has some moral ambiguity to it, which really surprised me since I virtually can't think of any action or drama anime that has moral ambiguity. With that said, though, the ambiguity is all it really has. In the end, you are still supposed to like the side you see the most on screen. Especially some of the comrades that fight alongside Tanya in her battalion. They get hurt, but there are hardly any deaths. There aren't many characters that you see for more than an episode that die, and the show often does a fake-out for their deaths, which robs it of any impact whatsoever. This is such a disappointment because Senki does have an interested aura of moral grey to it, which is sorely missing in anime. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nThe Saga of Tanya the Evil is a surprisingly solid series. Even if it is plagued by a rough start, with the first few episodes being either incomprehensible or kind of boring, it makes a quick transformation towards the middle and end of the series. The story isn't anything to write home about, but Tanya's battle against faith is interesting and the refreshing morality of Senki elevate it to being pretty damn memorable. \\n\\n\r\nEven the opening and end credit themes are stuck in my head hours after watching the series. This is the kind of series I may want to see more of within this medium. Although it doesn't have the brutal emotional impact I feel it could have, there are some really positive elements here. Unfortunately, it doesn't have all too much violence or consequence, but the character interaction and eventual evolution of Tanya is worth the watch on its own, with the crisp, explosive sound design being the icing on the cake. \\n\\n\r\nIf it weren't for the sub-par animation at a few time-saving moments during the series, this would be one of the more visually fresh and arresting shows recently. I think there is a lot to say about Studio NUT as well, who definitely have a lot of passion behind their first project, and rightfully so. There are issues with the product overall, but the end result is a positive one. Maybe the cynicism of Tanya makes me want to contrast myself here, but Youjo Senki was a surprisingly entertaining series, and I look forward to seeing more, if there is more to come. It sure has a hell of a set up. \\n",

            "content": "Youjo Senki asks the question \u201cIf the reason for lack of faith in a higher power is the lack of need to yearn for the peace of mind granted by the concept of a higher being that will see you through the tough times, how far can you break someone before they start seeking comfort in a higher power? A greater purpose? A deeper meaning?\u201d It then follows it up with the question \u201cHow much of the story can you sacrifice for the sake of spectacle?\u201d\r\nThe answer apparently to the last question is \u201cpretty damn much\u201d.\r\nBut first, the watching order for Youjo Senki. Start withEpisode 2, then Episode 3. Episode 1 occurs in the middle of Episode 3 but I recommend watching Episode 3 first and then go back to Episode 1. You can skip Episode 1 but it does provide a good spectacle.\\n\\n\r\nAnd ultimately, that\u2019s what the show is despite its great concept: a spectacle. I cannot ultimately judge a show by its first season alone though but judging the first season\u2019s ability to stand on its own is not without merit, no?\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get right to it. Youjo Senki lacks sufficient character development given that it desires character-driven drama. That problem is the most glaring. The most painful part is that the show tried. It just didn\u2019t do so well. We see Tanya scheme and we see the scheme backfires at her. We see her plan based on the knowledge she retains from our world. We see her develop a sense of camaraderie with the men under her command. We see her rage as events beyond her control cascade around her. It makes for a fun watch. But it ultimately does not advance her character in any significant way because the need for spectacle supersedes the need for character development.\\n\\n\r\nTanya is grounded to a world she is not invested in. She only cares about herself. She has nothing to lose and that gets in the way of tension. Without risk, there is no drama. Being X is simply a monster generator at this point, creating more and more powerful enemies for Tanya to overcome with no rhyme or reason.\\n\\n\r\nTheir dynamic is ruined because the show forgets that love is an emotion just as strong as hate. The show taps on to hate and threatens to leave the viewers detached as Tanya's proverbial hate-boner stiffens because the only reason we have to be even invested in her is because she is the MC and by extension her enemies are ours too. Well it's not. Love and hate are two sides of the coin that is the basic currency of drama, the currency of investment. Love a character and you'll inevitably despise her enemy.\\n\\n\r\nBut Being X is now merely a phenomenon, not a character. And with nothing to lose, Tanya is virtually without weakness.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s for that reason that the fights are just purely spectacle instead of a narrative. The battles that should have developed the character and the story became a sport of how fast and how spectacularly can she mow down her enemies.\\n\\n\r\nGood rule of thumb: \u201cA fight must not break the narrative, but rather reinforce it. If the story has to be put on hold for the fight to occur, that fight shouldn\u2019t occur at all.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nBut for what it\u2019s worth, this show is enjoyable. And we don\u2019t know to what heights it can truly soar until its story ends. So for now, enjoy. This is Studio Nut\u2019s first splash and I must say they did a splendid job, my complaints notwithstanding.",

            "content": "Anime remains the best visual medium for showing fantasy.While Game of Thrones is a great live action television series, the series always struggled to make its fantastical elements realisic. The production cast probably breathed a big sigh of relief when they killed off its giant at the end of season 6. Western cartoons tend to have good animation but are always focused on kid audiences unless they are adult satire. Only anime can show fantastic elements and remain believable. Sadly there are only a few quality fantasy anime (Berserk, Magi, Fullmetal Alchemist). Why? Because crap like this clogs up the works!\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe premise, originally startsout sounding good, child soldiers fighting in an alternate WW1 that involves fantasy magic. Unfortunately, this premise isn't enough to sell its desired demographic of lonely, middle aged otaku living unfulfilled lives. Thus the story involves a salaryman pissing off God and being reincarnated as a 9 year old girl in this fantasy world. That's the ticket, Japan! You're weird fetishes never fail to drag series down.\\n\\n\r\nIts strange that he even gets reincarnated as a human when most stories involving humans angering gods have the human reincarnated as some sort of animal. I guess reincarnating the main character as a uniform wearing grasshopper wouldn't sell enough figurines. The series doesn't even use reincarnation properly. Reincarnation involves the person not remembering their past life and they are reborn from a baby. From a biological standpoint, a nine year old girl wouldn't have the capacity to carry the mind of a thirty year old man, especially while processing this new information. For that matter, does she have parents? Was there a little girl living a normal life before this adult man suddenly popped in and overwrote her soul for this bizarre practical joke? Nope, God shoved his soul in the way a player shoves a cartridge into a console. These stupid reincarnation stories are a dime a dozen, but they never try to do anything innovative with the material.\\n\\n\r\nOn the action end of things, I can't help but laugh at how this series is another war show that involves a protagonist that is both the best strategist and front line fighter. These two details do not correlate well, considering losing the fighter on the frontline means losing their strategic mind for future battles. Its silly, seeing a dozen men shoot at her while she zooms around like a fly. The gun she is holding is thicker than her arms and she is carrying at speeds that are possibly 60 mph. And somehow she shoots perfectly despite being less physically conditioned than her actual body! What's most frustrating is she isn't very strategic in several of the episodes. She sometimes just charges at an enemy that  outnumbers her and has better formation and doesn't die because she has plot armor. These bad guys make the Stormtroopers from Star Wars look like SWAT team crack shots!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks passable during the opening shots of the episode but when the show introduces its female characters, goes from passable to horrifying. Viktoriya is supposed to the fanservice character of the show yet she her face looks like a half melted marshmallow. Its impossible to distinguish her cheekbones. Her eyes are twice the size of her male counterparts. Her nose is practically nonexistent. Tanya, herself has a face as round as a bowling bowl. The show frequently covers her chin because it is hard to tell if she even has one. If there is a show to watch for attractive female characters, this isn't it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nGreat music utterly wasted on a stupid story with badly designed characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe two female characters follow basic archetypes. Tanya is the amoral self-focused protagonist. Her mindset is supposed to contrast her cute (?) appearance. Anime has contrasted cute with evil before but I've seen it done better because it generally has a theme, a purpose. In Sekai Oni, there is a theme, evaluating how abuse warps the minds of children.  In Naruto, the character Gaara shows how lack of relationships can lead to paranoia and psychopathy. There is no theme , for Tanya other than psychotic lolis are really marketable. Tanya's slasher smile is supposed to be unnerving but it comes across as over the top, belonging more in an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon than an anime. Vikoriya exists to contrast Tanya as an idealist but just comes off as airhead. She constantly whines and complains with little in terms of redeeming qualities. This dynamic is going to repeat constantly throughout the series with Tanya ordering Viktoriya to do something bad and then Viktoriya complaining about how evil Tanya is until it inevitably gets done with the justification of \"THIS IS WAR!\" used throughout. The villains are target practice for our overpowered protagonist throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nAnother boring light novel adaptation that wastes the time and effort of a studio that could be doing something better. If I want over the top action I'll watch Venture Brothers. At least that's funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\nThe music brings this series up slightly but nothing about this anime really drew my attention. The magic in the show looks like the magic explosions I've seen in other anime. The aerial fights are bland and one-sided. The setting is ruined by the stupid premise and the characters are unsympathetic. Anime needs to set aside pandering to otaku and focus on the quality of its writing.",

Though this really only applies to two characters thus far it contributes to the comical undertone of the show. Having a genre of military and magic with a R rating leads to a more dark comedy like feel. The reason why I find it hilarious is from the many contrasts and contradictions that occur throughout the show. Some of which are as follows.\r\nprayers to god in order to maximize magic output (that's blasphemy right there)\r\nlittle girl playing the role of a military officer\r\nmain character motives differs from her heroic and patriotic image\r\nmain character'splans tend to backfire\\n\r\nart style differences (them lips)\\n\\n\r\nI have been watching the sub and the dub.

            "content": "First off, I just want to say this is my first review for any anime so let's just see how this goes.\r\nI tried to keep this as spoiler free as possible.\r\nTo be honest, at first I thought this show was just going to be another boring, crappily animated, choppy shows where a character goes to another world. Althought the first episode may have been a bit all over the place, and the second episode may be a bit confusing. If you really grasp what is going on the show is very enjoyable. WW1 isn't too common in animes, and especially to see it fought withmagic is a nice addition. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNow I may be a bit newer to anime than some of the pros out there, but I know a good character when I see one. Tanya Degurechaff is a fresh new character that is unique in her own way. I won't spoil anything but this is probably the first anime you've ever seen where a 10 year old girl fights in WW1 and looks completely cool while doing it. Some of the other characters may be a bit bland in contrast to her however. It's intriguing to see Tanya's philosophy on certain topics throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nPS: They are NOT Nazis\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe animation is surprisingly good, nothing groundbreaking but it's pretty good quality. The fight scenes are done very well and a lot of the wartime aspects look very good. The magic looks clean and so do the explosions. I don't have much else to say about the art, it's just pretty good overall.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nIn my opinion, the best aspect of this show is the sound. You just want to listen to the theme song over and over and the end theme is sung by Tanya's voice actor. The soundtrack is very well done and the sound matches up to almost everything in the show. The fight scenes sound amazing and are easy on the ears. For example, the music that plays when Tanya is being all evil like just pairs perfectly up with her. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI can't say too much about the story so far as I have only watched 6 episodes but it revolves around Tanya's conflict with a \"Being-X\" who claims to be a god. You get to see how the god plays with Tanya during the wartime and makes her life harder. Eventually it just gets to the point where something about Tanya just enthralls you so you can't stop rooting for her in every fight. I really enjoy the story as of this point and I'm excited to see what the show does in the future.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis show is very enjoyable if you like anti-hero protagonists and the main character really just looking out for themselves. I've fallen in love with the show to the point that I can't wait for the next episode. Other people may view the show differently but in my opinion it's been amazing so far and I can't wait to see more of Tanya.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nHalfway into the show, I think it's been really good and I've enjoyed it. The sound is amazing and the art looks good. I can't wait to see how this show goes on.\\n\\n",

Los ! Los !), and and insert song. (i like both the OP & ED song) \\n\r\n(note : for OP Jingo means Aggressive Nationalism/Fascism)\\n\\n\r\ni enjoy it to the fullest, this anime centralized on a different perspective from the \"Bad guys\" (the empire), like some reviewers say it's same just like \"Overlord\" did.\\n\\n\r\n BUT i'm gladly agree that this not a kind of biased shiet plot like Saving Private Ryan, \u0411\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0438\u0433\u0440, Fury or \"Shuumatsu no Izetta\" dat i fully despised. so Rest assure F\u00fcr die \"Deutschland\" !!!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I finished the second episode of Tanya the Evil, I told myself this show could be something revolutionary. Episode 1 told us this was a show about a little Nazi girl flying in the air and killing people with magic. Episode 2 told us this show was a meditation on religion and the twisted morality of modern capitalism.\r\nBut, as I watched the rest of the show, I felt like those themes presented in episode 2 weren't as prominent as I would've liked them to be. Sure, we had a few good scenes of Tanya cursing God, but the show turned its focus to militarystrategy. If you're a history buff who is really into early-20th century war tactics, then you might love this show, since it spends a lot of time asking how WW1 would have played out if they had MAGIC! Personally, I was more into the religious angle and would have liked to see more emphasis placed on Tanya's conflict with the almighty Being X.\\n\\n\r\nThere's still a lot of fun to be had with this show, regardless of whether it satisfies your intellectual cravings. The production has some annoying cgi sprinkled in; one crowd shot had me longing for the days when they would pan over a still frame. That being said, most of the show's aerial action scenes were quite beautiful. The inventiveness of Superman flight with guns gave me the same feeling I had when Attack on Titan introduced samurai-Spider-Man combat. For all her sociopathy, Tanya is an engaging protagonist; it's hard not to connect with a character who gets so close to the things she wants, but always seems to stumble a bit at the last step. Meanwhile this show's OP and ED tunes are both insanely catchy; after each episode, these songs would battle for supremacy inside my brain.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say Tanya is the instant classic I was hoping for from the second episode, but if you like evil children, military strategy, or a good J-pop/metal fusion tune, you might as well give the show a chance.",

I see and hear many people say that Tanya is evil, and is the villain role of this anime. But to be honest, I completely disagree. I feel that she is just someone who understands what needs to be done in situations, and does them strictly because it is a matter of life or death in war. She does have her crazy moments, but I think she is not doing anything wrong or bad. \r\nThis anime is amazing in terms of giving the audience thrill, impact,and excitement. The timely comedic parts release the tension, making the audience have a nice balance of nervousness and laughter. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are very detailed and high spec, and they have perfect background music that are set at the right times that give off great effect to emphasise thrill.",

It resonated with me deeply as i find myself agreeing with the main character most of the times even do he is a villain and one of those persons that i would no like to meet in real life due to his cold and racionalway of thinking. There are animes that make u think ...and this one makes u think a lot. Like if in some twisted way all of this is true and we are trapped in a circle of perpetual war and hate in all the dimensions possible. Even if u already known about the second world war this anime will surprise U. Enjoy",

            "content": "This is one of the newest anime this year which reaffirms the fact that you can never run out of ideas or cliches for anything. Youjo Senki if anything, is original and pleasing to watch.\r\nStory:8/10\r\nHow would you feel if God damns you to the worst possible time in our history and does it all in order just because you don't agree with him? Youjo Senki answers that question. The protagonist(Tanya) is someone who dares to challenge God for personal reasons and is forced to wage a battle with him. While the story introduces quite an ample amount of twists and turns, what appeals the storyto me the most is the fact is that it examines the characters perspective and their views on the world. And yes, the military part of Youjo Senki is nearly the best part of it, where you get to see how terrible the war is and their consequences.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is something which is up to par and shines in the magical part of the battles. And by the way, I love how they designed Tanya. She is nearly the best loli that I have encountered. Some of the scenery depicted in the anime is close to real life, and that's what I like about them.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd then comes the sound. The best soundtrack is the op and it is a literal ear worm. The background music is not particularly great, but not particularly bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9/10\\n\r\nI believe I said it already, but Tanya is arguably the best character in this anime. No question about it. The badass decisions that she makes during battle is something to be praised. You also get a look at the politics behind the military and how it is likely to play out. You look at some characters and see the war from their viewpoint too. And there are some points where you can see a little black humor and horror behind some characters, Tanya included.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would rate it 9/10, because Youjo Senki has some minor flaws, but otherwise is nearly perfect. Something that I would recommend that you watch if you like Military anime(like Attack on Titan) and strategic thinking(Death Note/Code Geass).\\n\\n\r\nWaiting for Season 2!",

The story has right pace. Nothing felt obscure. The magick and loli aspect perfectly complements each other, and bundled(/executed) like this, it enables this anime to be military without feeling like shit. So I can't really deduct any points for being \"magic loli\". The \"planning\" scenes were great, and recognising some resemblance to real world fights were satisfactory. The interesting camera views in them were great accessory to Main Character thoughts, and great way howto freshen this kind of scenes. The story, settings, visuals etc, vere great. ...\\n\\n\r\nBut, there are 2 things that bothers me. First, although, all fighting scenes were entertaining and interesting, I still had that unpleasant taste of \"MC always wins\" in back of my throat. And it didnt go away. Second, it is interesting and entertaining to watch, but it didn't have any distinct emotional, impact and I just could not immerse in it. Which are my criteria for 9 and 10 star animes (on top of having great story and other things that this anime has). This 2 reasons are why I give it 8 stars, but I can't imagine how this anime could be done better. For what it is, it is Perfect. But not compared to wholesomeness of other anime...",

Character development and such is non-important! And I completely agree. This anime was meant to be nothing more than an insane loli being crazy all over WW1 with magic. And that would have been completely fine. Yet they screwed that up, of course they did.\r\nRather than just being an insane loli Tanya is early on revealed to have been reincarnated from our world. However, the whole plot point about Tanya being actually a middleaged Japanese man seems to exist merely so that the anime can do absolutely nothing with it and make you wonder what the whole point is. In the end, it all comes up to some encounters between Tanya and God, who is angry that this one particular person does not believe in him. This kind of makes me wish that they had a plot twist revealing that He has actually done this to millions of people, each with his own alternate WW1 reality, but that is sadly not the case. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, this all seems to lead to a completely unearned and out of place philosophical moment in the last chapter, albeit it is presented with interesting visuals. All of this is completely unnecessary, no one is watching this to find out how pragmatically evil Tanya will trump the equally amoral God.\\n\\n\r\nOh, it also does that thing where it keeps telling you how bad war is while portraying it as something completely awesome and practically harmless, since, inexplicably, none of the main cast dies nor suffers any major injury at any point.\\n\\n\r\nOk, you say, the plot is broken and the characters are uninteresting, so what? I watch this for the amazing battle scenes. Yeah, well...it doesn't really have much going for it in that regard. Fights are little more than things moving fast and light flashing in front of your face. There is little to no tension since, as I mentioned before, we are not given any reason to believe that these guys can even die, Tanya even survives a full-on explosion all Nappa-style. And the CGI that always appears at the worst moments is so bad I actually recommend watching those particular scenes if you're in need of some cheap laughs.\\n\\n\r\nStill, when it tries it can provide some really visually entertaining scenes and it ocasionally gets into the so-bad-it's-good territory to make it somewhat bearable if you have a lot of free time. Not recommended though. 5/10\\n",

            "content": "When I first heard about this show I expected it to be pretty stupid.  It follows a young girl named Tanya who is born in an alternate Germany during an alternate version of WW1.  Magic exists in this world and it is because of this that Tanya is enlisted into the military at a very young age due to the fact that she is naturally gifted with a high storage of magical power.  Once in the military, she climbs up the ranks to major and ends up leading her own special unit in order to fight for her country.  In actuality,Tanya is a middle aged Japanese businessman who was killed and then reincarnated into this little girl's body by God, whom Tanya calls Being X.\\n\\n\r\nWith a premise like this I expected the anime to be a comedy but to my surprise it turns out to be rather serious about its plot.  When you first watch it I'm sure you'll laugh at how a bunch of soldiers are taking orders from a 10 year old girl but after a while that will completely have changed.  \\n\\n\r\nTanya may be a 10 year old girl but as the show continued I stopped considering her to be a child.  She is a mastermind when it comes to warfare and can be very manipulative and ruthless when the situation calls for it.  Even though she is the main character there are times where you will think of her as a villain.  She has killed officers who questioned her command and even ordered her troops to open fire on a group of civilians who may hold a grudge against the Empire in the future.  Her character is extremely interesting especially when you consider that her only goal in life is to live comfortably away from conflict.  However, even as she gets closer and closer to fulfilling her goal, Being X always finds a way to make sure that she's put in very deadly situations.  However, even with all of the shit that Being X throws at her, Tanya is determined to survive and continually overcomes whatever the war or Being X throws at her. The fact that the writers were able to take a very strange and somewhat stupid premise and turn it into something this interesting is honestly incredible.\\n\\n\r\nIf you ever come across this anime I recommend that you at least give it a shot.  It may seem like a very weird concept at first but after the first couple of episodes I'm sure that you will not be disappointed.",

            "content": "I have to give you an important advice: don't judge this series by the first episode. \r\nBecause, well, when I just had started watching I felt like it wouldn't be something worth my attention. It seemed very dubious and strange. However, begining with the second episode, affairs surely had taken unexpected turn. \r\nThe story is the most delicious part here. It's quite unique in some way (if you know an anime, in which the similar thing occured, tell me. Overlord doesn't count). \r\nGenerally, it is about the war. War similar to World War II, but happening in another world with magic. Though, it's not sohard to find references. I mean, it's obvious. \\n\r\nOur little cute girl fights for the sake of Empire, which is quite like Nazi Germany. \\n\r\nSome episodes were solely delicated to dialogues of the mc and others, discussing strategy and tactics. Those played their role as preparation for future fighting scenes which were executed with some good taste, I should say. \\n\r\nPacing is a little fast. Maybe, it's even more fast than it should be. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation's okay. Almost all screen's time belongs to Degurechaff, but I can't really complain. I like her design and facial expressions. She's so adorable when she kills people with a smile on her face :). \\n\r\nI especially liked close combat scenes, it was quite a view. \\n\\n\r\nNah, I didn't like the sound here. It's something I don't like to listen to. OP, ED were pretty mediocre on my opinion. Nothing remarkable about another sounds. \\n\r\nWhat I did like was Degurachaff's voice. Also, I was quite delighted to hear Sato's voice from Ajin here :) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters?.. Well, that's a main flaw of the series. Because, in fact there're only two characters here. Degurechaff Tanya and Being X. \\n\r\nAnother characters are very bleak, there's nothing noticeable around them. They're just a part of decoration. I mean, even Serebryakov. What can I say about her character, motives, plans, backstory? Nothing. Though, she was with Degurechaff from the very begining. \\n\r\nYoujo Senki is about a conflict between main character, protagonist, who detests Being X, which plays a role of antagonist in his own turn. That's all about characters.\\n\\n\r\nI've quite enjoyed it. Not so much, as I might. Still, I surely would watch the sequel. Especially, after such epic ending. I'm quite interested where would the conflict lead. \\n\r\nI like the war theme. And I like when it comes to anime. I've heard there's the ranobe. I might check it out in the future. I've got a feeling anime has dropped down a lot of details.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure about recommending it. Perhaps, I would recommend it to a person who're into war theme.",

            "content": "Youjo Senki, the Saga of Tanya the Evil.\r\nAn apt name for, what I believe, is an incredible show. It is one of very few to delve into a historical/fantasy setting with more intent than to merely showcase the latest in animation, color pallets, and fighting Lolies. Instead it goes far deeper and aims at a narrative that pits an antagonistic main character agains God himself. This makes for very interesting storytelling.\r\nTo start with the characters - \r\nTanya is an understandable, yet unfathomable, individual; singularly bent towards self-preservation and her own needs, she is very amusing to watch, particularly in how she interacts with both God,or \"Being X\" as she calls him, and her fellow human beings. Speaking of, the supporting cast are, for the most part, a fairly stock group of individuals that have occasional shots at genuine personality and humanity, but for the most part take backstage to Tanya's quest to outwit or even take a literal shot at God. However, there are a few moments where they do come alive and it is those few moments that help make the show truly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story - \\n\r\nThe story starts out with the appearance of unoriginality; World War 1 with a little bit of magic thrown in so the studio can include more colors than gray and brown, but that rapidly changes with episode 2. From there, Tanya's saga unfolds in the unusual light of her relationship with \"Being X\", and the mounting number of challenging situations he throws her into. While there's plenty of episodic battles and blood-chilling murder-face to keep us interested and amused, the overarching story of Tanya's quest to outwit God unfolds gradually through the first 8 episodes, and then much more rapidly in the last 4. Looking back, I now realize that moments I thought were \"lulls\" in genuine plot development were actually necessary, and not just filler battles. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound - \\n\r\nBoth are very good, in my opinion, and particularly during the battle scenes. Studio Nut has held little or nothing back in producing this, its very first project, and this shows brilliantly when it needs to. The aforementioned battles are brilliantly animated and powerfully scored, and leave you more than a little bit impressed. \\n\\n\r\nIn sum, I believe that this show is entirely worth watching, so long as you are interested enough in one (or all as I am) of the following: history, military things, or religious/ethical narrative. I very much look forward to a sequel to this, and hope it's not long in coming; the one hang up I would have about recommending this show fully is that it definitely needs one.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I loved it entirely.",

Instead of creating\\n\r\n too much MCs without any useful purpose. The MC is  very unique character that doesn\u2019t care about god or other people\u2019s lives . He just respects the company system and administrative sequence and hard working.he believes that god doesn\u2019t exist cuz if he does exist he wouldn\u2019t allow people get wronged,opressed,maltreated,killed or fired.pretty new main character that is some how original.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Music:8/10\\n\r\nthe soundtracks were so great,well synced when there\u2019s a funny,serious,crazy and fight scenes. The art and the animation were great but they weren\u2019t a top notch tho.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8/10\\n\r\nenjoyed this show more than I expected .. funny scenes were well made and not pushed or pretentious. The show had some great thoughts about how people tend to act wildly when they use their feeling to live instead of logic.\\n\r\nToo bad there was no actual end for the story but the end was good that it made me so excited for a second season.\\n\r\ncan\u2019t wait to know what will happen and will the MC believe and thank god for his blessings or he/she will keep his attitude of hating on god.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8/10\\n\r\nthe dark horse of this season and strongly recommendedd",

            "content": "The plot essentially illustrates a few things:\r\n- corporations are \"evil\", notably with how they lack compassion for humanity, seemingly wanting robots/computers for workers\r\n- military rewards merit, but has a lot of political bureaucracy in the higher ranks, in which they simply use you and toss you in a similar \"evil\" way as corporations\r\n- evil can easily recognize other evil, possibly breeding a darker evil\r\n- how an \"evil\" corporate mindset deals with various situations, including dealing with religion/superstitions, teamwork, human resources (team building), life goals (retirement vs honor vs love and happiness)\r\n- evil is tolerated, even desired, if it shows strong promise of fulfilling personal goals\r\nStory:gained depth and history by loosely connecting the show to familiar time periods. Avoided lame ass-pulling and flashbacks to justify actions. Didn't break the rules of its world over and over.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: letting personalities clash with very different personalities, which produce interesting unique reactions is a basic requirement. This one took different philosophical lifestyle mindsets and made them clash in life or death situations, sometimes showing that the victor is the one with the right attitude, as opposed to the one with the most capability/power.\\n\\n\r\nSound: the voice acting, especially Tanya's, is quite expressive and fit the characters and situations adequately. The music modestly enhanced the impact of the show's drama and suspense factor. Typical cheesy unrealistic studio sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nOP/ED search terms: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Sensen+no+Realism\\n\r\n- Sensen no Realism \\n\r\n- JINGO JUNGLE\\n\r\n- Frozen Rain\\n\r\n- Los! Los! Los!\\n\\n\r\nArt: well blended/coordinated, with cinematic effects liberally applied. Characters were able to deliver messages through body language, facial expressions, allowing dialogue to be kept fairly flavorful. No declaring emotions and no calling your moves here. From having a beat-up disheveled look to show distress level, to detailing a character to show how arrogant and pompous a person is before they even speak, the artwork spoke its thousand words. Frequent scene change, perspective changing, and panning kept things active looking. No real lazy rush jobs noticed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: I gained some wisdom watching this show. I enthusiastically recommended it to a lot of friends. Too bad they didn't react as positively as I did; perhaps I overhyped or spoiled it. They instead told me to watch shows that were to be enjoyed with your brain turned off, or shows that encouraged escaping from reality, rather than learning more about its harshness...",

            "content": "Let's get started with this masterpiece now shall we.\r\nThe opening premise of this anime is slightly of putting, mainly because of the 'man in a girls body' thing which puts people off. However, because of the MC's personality, you will find that her gender....really doesn't matter. She is, and was, a sociopath, with gender playing little to no role in her initial character mold. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe series follows the life of the super-competent, sociopathic salaryman-in-a-girl's-body in an AU of Europe on the brink of a world war, as she does her best to improve her lot from am orphaned girl to a position of comfortthrough military progress, with our protagonist ending up in the AU equivalent of Germany after pissing of a God-like entity by refusing to believe in the existence of God at the moment of his/her original death in Modern Tokyo, with a little magic thrown in to shake things up. The reason I give it a 7 rather than a 9 or an 8 is because the mechanics of magic in the world aren't really explained properly, which really stuck in my craw. However, the change in war strategy that magic caused is very well explored in this story, with magic being made equivalent to highly mobile and versatile heavy artillery. It is an engaging plot, with a well explored and developed MC.\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is detailed, and the animation crisp and smooth. The muted colors fit the WW theme extremely well.\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are on the heavy metal side, which doesn't really fit with the semi-somber mood of this series- while it has a lot of action, it is not the sort of happy action you find in an action series. It is a grey-zone story,and the heavy metal opening doesn't fit.\\n\r\nOther than that, the general BGMs are fitiing with the military theme, with nothing particuarly notable about it.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe Character development is as phenomenal as it is narrow. There is little to no development of any character other than Tanya. However, it is so well done, that it really isn't required for the other characters to be developed.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThe irony of Tanya's situation, as well as view of war strategies that the series provides makes it a very enjoyable watch. While there is no overt humor, The fact that she keeps getting handed more responsibility when she is working to get the opposite keeps you entertained, along with a riveting story line keeps you glued throughout the series\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThe series is a very enjoyable, and very underrated for its overall quality. The best parts are the explanations of war strategies and the aerial action scenes.",

I regret doing that as when I took a closer look I saw a great show that surprised me. The main character Tanya and her assistant Visha are rememberable and you get attached to them fast. I like the feud between Tanya and Being X as it\u2019s twisted through the main war, it keeps you wondering if Being X is pulling the strings with certain things and if Tanya is playing into it\u2019s hands. The story gets a bit stickyand can get confusing but it straightens up in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I loved it and watched the 12 episodes straight, I would suggest it to any anime watcher who wants to see war, insanity and awesome fight scenes.",

You get promoted to positions you don't want, or can't handle. You want a transfer, you wind up the LAST place you want to be.

            "content": "Few anime, I could quantify as having been done flawlessly or even near so.  So many anime are: so full of cliches; copied characters and stories; missing story elements such as foreshadowing; lack of cohesion within the context of the world created by the anime; or even forgotten rules or character traits revealed in one part of a series only to be ignored or forgotten or contradicted later on.  Tanya is not one of these.  Tanya is one of the few anime that appears to have been done on a technical level, nearly perfectly compared to most anime.  It will surpriseyou.  When I first started watching, I frankly expected little quality or entertainment and nothing more than mere distraction, but this show has quite a compelling story told in a riveting standout fashion.  \\n\r\nIn episode two, I saw one of the best dialogues between two characters i have ever seen.  I have replayed just that banter more than once it is so powerfully dramatic and yet bears a ring of truth.  Each episode the story got more mind blowing and engaging and better than the previous one.  The show draws you in with how simple it starts out and bears a hint of a typical generic story of this set of genres.  It deceptive in how your mind can be tricked into complacency then shocked into stunning surprise and interest.  \\n\r\nWe all ponder big questions of life like where we come from or what to believe in or about death.  Tanya gets to ponder that and more such as a global fear that the world maybe out to get you.  These remarkable real world anxieties and life reflective questions are a driving force for this series.  These issues are constantly brought to light almost like Al visiting Sam in Quantum Leap.  The biggest question and motivation of all for the show maybe faith.  Yes it has religious overtones but they are quite subtle compared to other shows with similar genres and themes.\\n\r\nTanya has a powerful grip once you start watching it.  Between the technical side being done nearly perfectly and the story itself though not totally original in every way is compelling and interesting enough to keep attention from one episode to the next in a nearly growing addictive way, Tanya is one of the best anime from start to finish though there is hope for more seasons.  \\n",

Whenever the show attempts world building, it's boring and none of the information stays intact, leaving much to be desired.\r\nArt - 5\r\nI understand that Tanya's facial features and the dark and gritty pallet are both stylistic, but that doesn'tmake it any less ugly to look at, sadly.

            "content": "Where to start with this brilliant creation. It peaked my interest from the beginning with its first episode, which establishes Tanya and Serebryakov and introduces us to the concept of mages. I was already prepared for a 7/10 with this one. However, the next few episodes established even more of Tanya's character, and brought in commentary on religion and faith. The bulk of the show deals with military strategy, and ends with commentary on rationalism and human nature. I was not prepared for all of that. Tanya is a character that is despicable in every way, yet she has a strange charm about her thatmakes me hope for her success. The way she is able to ensure her success makes you hope her plans will work. The same goes for the Empire as a whole, despite the fact that they seem to be portrayed as the bad guys. For me, there is no villain, everyone is just human to me. They live and die on their own merits, and that makes me love this anime. As much as I love a story with a concrete good and evil, this story is so much more interesting in that the only reason anyone in this anime is defeated or killed is their own mistakes and human flaws. No one is simply a bad guy that needs to be defeated, since we are following arguably the most important battalion in the Imperial Army. Each battle is a significant part of the story. I really enjoyed myself with this anime, and Tanya Degurechaff will likely be one of my favorite anime characters of this year, perhaps even decade.",

            "content": "So Youjo Senki or Saga of Tanya the evil, on the surface is a story about an overpowered loli destroying enemies like grass on the field but as the same time it's really not. So why is that? Let's find out with me in the first anime that studio NUT produce and which i consider a fairly good hidden gem of winter 2017.\r\nStory:\r\nIf you already watched ep 1 and dropped because it's not your liking, please reconsider because actually the story starts off with a middle-aged man, whose job is to fire people. One day, he was pushed to a running train by one ofthose fired workers. In his last moment, \"Being X\" or God appeared out of nowhere and give him one last chance to have some faith in God himself. And how did he do that, by sending the dying guy to reborn in the form of a liitle girl in a pretty similar world as us in the time of WWI, and of course there is magic involved. God, this sounds so lame on paper.\\n\\n\r\nSo as time passed by, our protagonist grew up a bit, she decided that if she want to settle down in this world, the best way is to join the army and luckily for her, she's naturally a powerful witch... And then, the legend of Tanya the evil is born.\\n\\n\r\nWhat happenned in the series is basically the German trying to take over the world again so the world building here are very large and simple. What interesting is the way they fought the wars, there are usually magic soldiers on the sky of each sides and they played an important part in the results of the war like destroying enemy soldiers or scouting all over the place. But still, there are countries that dont have these kinds of soldiers so they have a lot of disadvantages...\\n\\n\r\nTanya, with her powerful magic, climbed the ladder of possition in the Army very quick. Soon she became an important part of the German army with her amazing war strategy. Now she's a leader of a strong magic company that killed enemy of the country like grass in the field. She might be the biggest badass in the sky but the journey to an easy life she longed for is seemingly a long way to go.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nWhat seperates Youjo Senki from some other generic magical wars is Tanya herself, she and her struggle against \"Being X\" is what interesting the most about it. I love strong female lead so of course i like Tanya, one of the most ruthless heroine i've had the pleasure to watch in anime overall. Never hesitate to use others for her own good. She's portrayed like a villain, merciless, sophisticated and fearless. She's like a fresh wind blowing the clique characters in anime lately. It's really amusing to watch her.\\n\\n\r\nBeing X on the other hand, is the driving force of the story. To make Tanya have faith in him, he used every chances possible to prevent Tanya from achieving her goal in life. created situations that forces her to begin believing in the higher power.  His motivation might be clear, but the mystery surround him remains the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is unfortunately one-dimesional mostly. So i dont really care about them.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is quite weird i must say. It made the girls look baby-ish. But i actually think it's quite interesting to see. For the most part, the animation is ok with some beautiful fights in the blurry sky. The color is pretty dark to fit in the endless war they're fighting.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing spectacular about the soundtracks in this anime. It mosly has done an alright job to put in the mood for the fight scenes and it has a catchy op song.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\\n\r\nYoujo Senky is surely on the better part of Winter 2017. A fairly exciting and amusing anime to watch. If you like wars theme and strong female leads, this might be the show for you.\\n",

I hate loli girls too, but this one in this anime is different. Curious? Keep on reading.\r\nStory 8/10:\r\nA very original and interesting intake in the military genre mixed with magic.\r\nAn atheist salaryman gets killed by an angry man, but seconds before he dies he's saved by Being X (or God, as he calls himself). This Being X gives him anotherchance in life and reincarnate him in the body of a 9 year old soldier girl working for the Empire (Nazi Germany) to make him believe in god. Our heroine is a hardcore atheist and refuses to believe in a god. He then forces her to believe in him in multiple ways, but she/he grows to hate Being X even more. The anime tells the story of our soldier girl Tanya (ex salaryman) or as she's called \"The Devil\" as she climbs the stairs of the military due to her excellent reasoning and strategies and battle competences. The Empire is following Hitler's path \"Lebensraum\" which is the colonialism of countries next to the Empire for economical reasons.\\n\r\nSound 10/10 :\\n\r\nI can not write how much I loved the sound in this anime. I'm a sucker for dark and epic choir, and let me tell you this : The OSTs are so good they gave me goosebumps sometimes. The OP and ED are so good that I couldn't skip them\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nDecent art that captured the dark/gloomy atmosphere of WW Europe.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10:\\n\r\nThis is where the series lack the most. How does a salaryman think in the same level or sometimes better than old military generals/colonels? Other characters literally have little to no role.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 :\\n\r\nCombat scenes were so thrilling to watch, and I enjoyed myself a lot. Also, I could not get enough of Tanya's smirk.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 :\\n\r\nIf you wish to watch something entertaining while reflecting on our WWI and WWII history, then this anime is for you. Beware, one of its genres is the MAGIC genre.",

Okay I was extremely unhappy to finally see a anime with a girl who is quite op which is a...guy. Though i never saw an anime do somehing like this before so it is prettyinteresting. But I still finished the anime and it was pretty good! Though I barely see strong powerful mc anime. Alsoo it hit me when finding out that Tanya had to praise god just to get almighty powers like she had to rely on someone.  Watch the anime still though i quite recommend it!",

            "content": "I really hope this whole \"putting-lolicon girls on the battlefront\" thing doesn't become a saturated thing.Because for the most part it has been successful. After Sound of the sky in 2010, Girls Und Panzer in 2012 and the very disappointing Izetta from a couple seasons ago.Being the first show made by a NEW studio , they really picked a clever concept to copy and take it to their own route.Unlike Izetta that had promises of a full scale war with magic and lesbian relationships, and dropping the ball on each part,Youjo Senki deals with reincarnation and the full frontal destruction and tactics of complete brutalWAR.The premise about this regular day businessman who is a real jerk.After getting killed because of his jerkish misdoings, he gets reincarnated by this being called \"Being X\"into the body of a little child and after being not only recruited into the military at the age of like ten,she ranks so high that she ranks higher than most of the soldiers in the war.She isn't the only little girl in the war though.The military must be very desperate to just recruit children let alone little girls.Regardless, I really really really really really really really enjoyed this show.I liked how the story didn't make it where Tanya, our main protagonist(or antagonist) is not in a disadvantage and just wrecks everything(even her own soldiers at times)when she feels like it.We'll get to her later.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, this show is the debut of the new production studio called NUT(i'm not kidding).And for they're first work, the animation is actually pretty impressive.They really do know how to make really good explosions and some very insane combat scenes.I also like the facial expressions on the characters.If someone was mad,you can tell that their mad;if someone was insane you can ABSOLUTELY tell that they're insane.But the animation is far from perfect.There are times when the use of 3D becomes really jarring and sticks out.Also, there are some bits of choppy and wonky animation in some parts that you have to look careful enough to spot.But nothing is perfect and as a first attempt ,Studio NUT did a really good job and shows how much potential they have for the future.The art in the show is really beautiful especially when magic is in use. This may sound weird, but I like how Tanya looks with her huge eyes and the style is really distinguishable which is a good thing for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in the show is interesting because to me it surpasses the animation by a hair.This show has some of the craziest sounds heard in anime, they put a lot of impact in the explosions and the weapons that would make Skrillex proud.And the Opening, holy crap.Besides being an epilepsy fest ,the opening is so awesome, probably because it was made by Myth and Roid and they're awesome.And the ending is awesome too because it was sung by Tanya herself.Oh and I watched the dub of Youjo Senki and it's really good,but I couldn't help but wonder who the heck all these voice actors were.I don't really recognized that many of them.Regardless, I liked the dub.\\n\\n\r\nGetting back to Tanya she is so merciless and intense, and it works so much with her because she isn't just a girl, she is a MONSTER.I like how someone as insane and clever as her is still seen as a little girl who has to sit in a booster chair at dinners with her captain( i think) and while everyone else drinks beer, she has to drink coffee. There are a bunch of other characters like that one guy with eyelashes on the side of his eyes,that other guys who died but didn't ,and another girl a bit older than Tanya named Viktoriya Ivanovna Serebryakova who is really cute yet I still don't know what a girl like her is doing in a war like this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI had a ball with this show.I haven't had so much fun with combat and people dying since ........Madoka Magica?There isn't one time in the show that bored only because it was nice to just watching a little girl wreck stuff up and kill many people.What was the worst part of the show for me was the ending because it doesn't end it just stops and it won't be anytime soon when Season 2 comes out.I feel like they could of resolved everything in the final episode but draws out just to end on a cliffhanger,But on the bright side, that means more Youjo Senki will happen and more chaos will happen and i'll be there for it\\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\r\nSomeone said something in episode 12 and I couldn't help myself but think about the anime Monster.\\n",

            "content": "In a nutshell: Nazi Loli, what more could you want?\r\n If you're one of the people who don't think this is an enough reason to watch this, then just read this. \r\nStory - 7\r\n  The concept of an arrogant business man reincarnated as a challenge against Go- I'm sorry, \"Being X\" was really enjoyable to say the least. It was such a simple idea that the MC is straight out evil and villainous. Yet, a lot of people loved Tanya, while at the same time they despised her thoughts. Also, the plot's progression was smooth yet chaotic, more chaotic than a real war. Thisanime might seem like a war between nations at the surface, but in reality it's a war between Tanya and Being X (I'll get to that later). The ending... it was such a mix feel of emotions, that's all I will say I don't want to spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\n Don't have much to say here. The way the hair and lips are drawn really give a character to studio NUT. A lot of people actually might disagree with me but I thought the lip and hair style were really visually appealing to look at. However, the often shown CG soldiers butchered my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\\n\r\n Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. First, there's Tanya. Her character was really a great example of arrogance. She completely disregarded religion for just looking down on people who believe in it, even after meeting god himself. There are all the side characters which are pretty much fillers created by being X for Tanya, although they're all very interesting well done characters. Which gets me to my rant about Being X. Where do I start? Out of all the characters, Being X is the worst character of the all. First of all, He says managing 7B people was already hard for him, what does he decide to do next? Create an entirely new world (more people to manage) just to torture Tanya. Like seriously, this guy is a psychopath, I can get millions of other examples. Hopefully the creators would make an excuse for this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\n  It was a pretty enjoyable anime. It has a unique style, story and art. \\n\\n\r\n(PS: This is my first review I know it could've been better.)",

            "content": "PLOT AND STORY LINE  \ud83d\udcd6\r\nYoujo senki follows little Tanya, a girl whose cute appearance sometimes covers up her evil and ruthless self that got her the nickname \"Devil of the Rhine\". The 'devil' that resides inside of her body is the soul of a man that was reincarnated as a little girl into a world of magical warfare. In the moment of his death, the man meets 'Being-X', the self-proclaimed, God that wants to convince the man into believing in GOD. He of course refuses, and so gets reincarnated into a cruel and rough world where he would find his faith. The man, nowTanya, accepts it as a challenge and fights her way trough the world by becoming a magician-soldier and later on a extremely successful major whose war tactics drive the Empire in becoming one of the most powerful nations in Man's history. \\n\r\nThe story itself is really interesting and catchy, and the whole 'Cat-and-Mouse' game between Tanya and Being-X gives it more depth and also more entertainment.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat wrapped everything together into an amazing story was definitely its setting. After the reincarnation the man was sent to the beginning of the 20th century, into the poverty and the harsh life that marked the years before the first world war. Of course, it is a alternate version of Europe at that time with 'Germany' as the Empire, 'France' as the Republic etc. \\n\r\nNow what breaks all the ordinary and mainstream military genre of the anime was definitely the bit of magic and sci-fi. It is some kind of techno-magic that was fused with the weaponry that each country was using.  The only pity of this anime was that they didn't do more with that magic. All the weapons were based on one and the same concept but always say, at least they didn't make giant robots. \\n\\n\r\nThe action and the fights are also outstanding. Very thrilling and exciting always following a tactic but with many elements of surprise. The star of most fights was clearly Tanya. Her crazy and daring self put her in a lot of dangerous situations but she of course always found a way out of it. \\n\r\nOn the whole, you have an extremely entertaining and thrilling military action with a couple of really good plot twists, no plot-holes, a bit of magic for the fantasy fans and of course an absolutely interesting setting for history fans.  \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc66\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters, I firstly want to mention the outstanding character design. They all look so amazing, especially the main characters such as Tanya, Viktoriya, Hans, Erich and so on. Clearly distinguishable from characters of other anime, yet when it comes to personalities I can't say that they were really good. Of course, the lead character is an exception given the most attention in the anime. Tanya's wit, cleverness, ruthlessness and a bit of madness were kinda refreshing and gave the anime that little extra. The other characters were also good. They had some really unique personalities and they were actually given character, but I didn't see much development in any of them. The only character I saw evolving was Viktoriya Serebryakova. She started as a bit weak and scared official but later on became a really brave and strong lieutedant. The only thing I don't get are her eyes. All the other eyes look normal but hers are big and blue and look really creepy. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION AND STYLE \ud83d\udcbb\ud83c\udfa8\\n\\n\r\nThis was definitely heaven for my eyes. As mentioned, amazing character design. amazing animation, outstanding backgrounds, flawless fight sequences...I cannot name one thing regarding animationa and style that wasn't good. Well welcome to 2017 I guess. There is no bad animation in 2017. The only thing that can go wrong here is a bad, boring style and design which is not the case in Youjo Senki. In one word: FLAWLESS. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION \ud83d\udc46\u274c\ud83d\udc47\\n\\n\r\nI didn't watch many Winter 2017 anime, but I certainly will and I am even more sure that after all I'll still be thinking that Youjo Senki is one of the best anime of the season. It has an extremely interesting story, an amazing setting, entertaining characters and a flawless animation. This anime has something for everyone and I'd really like to know if there was someone disappointed about it.\\n",

He is smart and described as a sociopath, at a point that is true but being reborn with this knowledge left and a female who would not go a little crazy. On that a stalking god harasses you. \r\nI think in shorteverything Tanya do is highly motivated and makes the story even greater.

Just think of it, all you know about the wars that have happened and all theories on how we should live in modern society. \\n\\n\r\nWhat would you do if you knew the most likely outcome of the war you ended up in? \\n\r\nThinking about that is why I give it 10 as a over all.

            "content": "[This review contains minor spoilers.]\r\nI am glad that I watched this.\r\nI would recommend this to others.\r\nI have watched this once, subtitled. I have only watched the anime.\r\nI probably won't watch this again.\r\n---- Positives ----\r\nThe theme is interesting, although it sometimes fades into the background.\r\nThe theme of Being X's involvement in the world via believers is used well all the way through the last minutes of the series. The rest of this point is a negative though, listed in the Negatives section.\r\nThe main character keeps their characterization.\r\nDegurechaff keeps their life views throughout the series, despite the difficult situations that they're subjected to. Because there was enoughto potentially change their ways, the fact that they didn't change was almost a form of character development in a way.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character never discusses their past life.\\n\r\nDegurechaff never directly brings attention to the fact that they've been reincarnated nor to the heavily-made implication that they come from a timeline in the future and they have knowledge of the historical war that's taking place. This actually works well in the series because it avoids the risk of devolving into a time traveler series, which usually aren't done in a very fresh manner [time travel back, explain future event, no one believes, go through struggles to get them to believe, everything works out, the end].\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great when it wants to be.\\n\r\nBackground art and side character art is great, and Degurechaff and Serebryakova sometimes get great art [though they sometimes don't, see Negatives section].\\n\\n\r\nThere's one good use of 3D in the series.\\n\r\nDuring one animated sequence near the beginning of the series, it seems that 3D is used very well in a 2D-3D distance-movement blend. When the characters are far away, it looks like 3D animation, and at the perfect point as they approach the camera, they switch to being animated in 2D.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects are good, one musical theme is good.\\n\r\nSound effects overall were good, especially the magic-related sound effects. A good example of background music is in the first few minutes of the final episode. The OP and ED were good overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe series sort of ends.\\n\r\nEven though the series ends in somewhat of a \"Now, go read the source material!\" way, it also does somewhat come to a conclusion, not particularly being a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\n---- Negatives ----\\n\\n\r\nThe 2D art falters occasionally.\\n\r\nThere are two styles used for moderate close ups: artistic and bland. This problem largely affects Serebryakova. For characters moderately far away from the camera, art can, at times, be somewhat low quality.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. Although the art style is sometimes great, it too frequently dips low.\\n\\n\r\nThe 3D art falters often.\\n\r\nExcept for the one time when 3D is used well [mentioned in the Positives section], it looks jarringly bad.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No, although most 3D art used in anime series in this era looks jarringly bad, so this is par for the course.\\n\\n\r\nBeing X doesn't intervene enough.\\n\r\nThe middle of the series is devoid of Being X's involvement. Even when it possesses the pilot to talk to Degurechaff, the reveal is lackluster. It seemed that Being X didn't do enough to attempt to convert Degurechaff. For the main part of the series, it actually helps her out [even with the curse, it seemed too generous].\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: Maybe. Being X does state that it's being overworked, so there's a good in-world reason why it doesn't intervene too much and why it doesn't seem to think its plan out a little better.",

            "content": "I have just finished watching the anime. I am impressed. When I first watched the first episode I was like 'Man whats this, magic girls or what?'. I dropped it there. Then, I just decided to watch the second one. That changed my mind really quickly. First of all you have to understand - the anime explores the idea of having God as the main antagonist. Its done in quite remarkable way, you really get to cheer for Tanya. Now Tanya is our main character. She is little girl, with mental state of a very logical, smart man, who doesnt have morale. She uses people.\\n\r\nThe stor -  Its original plot, interesting, and you want to follow the development. It suprises you - most of the times you expect one thing, and it happens compleatly the opposite. You want to see the turn of the events. Very few animes manage to make you unable to predict what is going to happen.\\n\r\nArt - I really, really like the art. I dont know why, but some scenes just make me fall in love with the anime. I dont really like the art of the brown haired, big eyed girl. The art is not that special. But it has its charm. \\n\r\nThe sound - Now... I believe the most important in the anime's sound is to be played at the exact moment, to make you 'feel' that moment more, to make it alive. To empower its emotions. And here the job is done. I find it really impressive. Each time the sounding hits me. Not only that, but the actual music is really good\\n\r\nCharacters - The characters... shine. The anime is questioning the rationalism in humans, how they act, how they think. The main character... is it bad, or is it good? You cant say. Its done in masterful way. There are no scenes to fill time. Every single one has its meaning. Not only that, but you get to have a psycho main character, that makes you seat on the edge of your seat, make you smile, make you shiver. I love her. She may look flat, but she is really deep. If you dont agree, I will ask again - is she good, or bad?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - The whole anime made me stay on the edge of my seat. When every episode ended, I wanted to watch the other so bad. When the new one came, I got my popcorns (or just food), sat comfortably, got something to drink and watched. On moments it made me shiver in excitement, others made me worry what will happen. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - the anime is original, makes you think about revenge, human nature, hate, brings you a different point of vew - God is 'bad', war. Its so good. And not only that - the anime manages to bring all that to you masterfully, with an interesting story and enormous amount of excitement. If I were you, dear reader, I would watch it. Now. You may not like it a lot, but it has the potential to be all-out loved from you. Of course, some wont like it. Its always like this.  And I say it, because I almsot dropped it at episode 1, but now LOVE IT. An anime this good deserves atleast to be given a chance.",

            "content": "An arrogant man is thrown into an alternate world upon death. The man is reincarnated as a cute-looking blonde girl Tanya, a kind of ideal female figure for lonely anime fans. There\u2019s a vicious world war going on and the hero becomes a soldier. She is good at magic, killing, and best, unlike many anime heroes, she is not a wimpy brat whining about saving humanity. She is ruthless. The main character makes Youjo Senki stand out among hundreds of alternate world (isekai) anime.\r\nTanya is what makes this anime worth watching. She is merciless. She doesn\u2019t care what happens to people caught in the destructionshe makes. But she is not insane. Tanya is a calculating, mostly rational character. She represents consequentialism, the idea that the end justifies the means. She orders killing even civilians to prevent the possibility that they can come back as soldiers to prolong the war. By killing a few innocent she wants to prevent immensely more casualties. Her ideas are simple and direct: be ruthless and fast in order to end the war as quickly as possible. \\n\\n\r\nThis is also how evil justifies itself. Mass murderers defend their ignoble actions by saying that it is for the sake of good results. All invasions throughout the history didn\u2019t happen because the perpetrators had bad motives, but because they were \u201cgood\u201d deep down. The Japanese empire attacked half of Asia to \u201chelp\u201d weak Asians to develop. The Japanese army did crimes against humanity in Nanking because they claimed that the end will be good for everybody. Tanya shares the same mindset with the militaristic early twentieth century Japanese leaders. Her ideas are one-sided, narrow, and unfortunately not challenged seriously throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nI related the connection between Youjo Senki and real-life ugly truths to emphasize that anime is not innocent. It is not always escapism. It can serve to justify evil. Anime is a medium of telling tales and there are all sorts of tales. Some tales are insidious, they prey on the innocent.",

            "content": "Spoiler Free Review\r\nSend Feedback if You Have Any\r\nWhen you think about a battlefield, the last thing you expect to see is a little girl. No, I'm not talking about those cliche superhero scenes where someone's crying daughter is saved at the last moment. Think World War whatever number. The sound of bullets and shells being fired from all directions. A war zone with bodies everywhere. Not really a place to see a child. Well, prepare to have that thought process completely rewritten by Saga of Tanya the Evil.\r\nOur story focuses on a simple nameless salaryman. Emotionlessly following the ways of the world, he was onhis way to becoming one of the top businessmen in Japan... that is until he was pushed in front of a moving train by an ex-colleague he had just harshly fired. Moments before death, he meets a god-like entity which he calls Being X. After a conversation about his faith, Being X decides to resurrect our businessman into an alternate war-stricken universe as a little girl called Tanya Degurechaff, in hopes that his faith will increase when put in a desperate situation. The anime shows us how Tanya goes from an orphan with nothing to an elite soldier at an incredibly young age, rejecting God in every way possible.\\n\\n\r\nTake bit and pieces from WW1 and WW2, insert some magic, and we get the world of Tanya the Evil. Most of the series is Tanya and her battalion fighting against the enemies of the Empire, carrying out orders to weaken the neighbouring countries and strengthen their own. Each episode is packed with so much action and/or drama that there's never a dull moment. Whether it be testing out new equipment or ambushing enemy bases, Saga of Tanya never ceases to bore as we are shown the terrible brutality of war. The magic is mixed in well enough so it doesn't feel out of place. All armies have their own magical soldiers that have the ability to fly and shoot magically enhanced bullets, providing quite the battle spectacle.\\n\\n\r\nTanya is a badass. Anyone that has seen this show can agree. Over and over we see her tactical mind and merciless behaviour reign supreme against hell on earth, pulling off each mission with outstanding success. As a character, she's quite likeable despite her ruthless attitude. In some ways we can kinda relate to her way of thinking, using any means possible to rise up in the world. She doesn't care about anyone except for herself, but she's shown off in such a way that we can't help but root for her. Why? Well, it's probably because of her rival.\\n\\n\r\nOur MC is up against the soldiers of several armies, but her real rival is an actual god. The one that brought her to this world, Being X's only goal is to get Tanya to have faith. To achieve this, Being X manipulates the world from afar, forcing Tanya into extreme situations so that she may fall desperate and ask God for help. Every time Tanya tries to live a carefree life, Being X pulls some strings to throw her back onto the battlefield. He's a pretty good at messing shit up in the background, but this is where the show's major flaw appears. Tanya has no real physical rival. Tanya is pretty OP in a sense, able to defeat enemies quite easily. She doesn't lose much, so it can get kinda get repetitive when it's just her getting thrown back into war over and over just to just wipe out soldier after soldier.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty decent, with the action scenes really standing out as anything special. A few of the character designs are a little off-putting at first, but you quickly get used to it as your concentration turns towards the action and drama. There is also a few moments of CGI, but it's done so that it doesn't drastically stand out from the 2D. This series has to be applauded for being able to use 3D without ruining the consistency of the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSaga of Tanya the Evil is an amazing show. The main character and the war setting all come together to create an amazing story of the struggles against the ultimate higher power: God himself! I highly recommend this to everyone.",

            "content": "Get your schedule ready and have a few snacks cause you're in for a good time. Youjo Senki is an anime that aired in Winter 2017 with 13 tries to air a new episode every week.\r\nWhen I first heard about Youjo Senki, I thought that it would be a waste of time trying to watch it because of it's ridiculous character and mediocre art style and design for it's characters. Believe, the flaws are still there, but I've grown to this anime. Never have I ever seen myself go to my twitter CHANGE MY DAMN PROFILE PICTURE TO A 9-YEAR OLD ANIME GIRL, but boyI did.\\n\\n\r\n-Plot 7/10-\\n\r\nPreviously I gave Youjo Senki's plot an 8/10 but then I thought about that. An individualist atheist salaryman got pushed off a train, talked to God then was reincarnated to a little girl in WW1 then became a great soldier to the Empire and even becoming a Major. This may seem like I'm poking fun of the plot but hear me out, when the guy wrote the Light Novels of this anime he made an extraordinary job tricking people to think that this deserved to be a 'Pass'. I've seen many people pass up this anime because of 'how ridiculous and horrible' the plot is.\\n\r\nHa, look at them now, praising Youjo Senki.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion:\\n\r\n\u2713 The plot is ridiculous\\n\r\n\u2713 It, however, was used correctly\\n\r\n\u2713 Lolis\\n\\n\r\n-Art 5/10-\\n\r\nI really tried to adore Youjo Senki's art and I did at the end. However, the characters, what happened? I have a question: \"Why do you have to settle for the second best when you already saw the best?\", how does this relate? Well, I saw the art of Youjo Senki on it's manga and it's light novels and they were FAR BETTER! Visha, a Second Lieutenant on this anime, looks like her face was melted and was genetically modified to look like living, breathing, human scum. Don't get me wrong, her face is ok, to say the least, but if you compare her face in the anime to the manga. Well, no comparison! I've also noticed that they added a bit of CGI which looks great! That's one good thing I can say about the art.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion:\\n\r\n\u2713 Worst art style out of the three adaptions of Youjo Senki\\n\r\n\u2713 May Being X bless Visha's face\\n\r\n\u2713 It's CGI is good though\\n\\n\r\n-Sound 10/10-\\n\r\nI see no problem about the sounds, if a character looks like a kid, it has a voice like a kid. If a character looks like a tough man, it sounds like a tough man. Also the OP and the ED are on repeat since I heard them! Myth & Roid, Aoi Yuuki and Mako Niina are amazing!\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion:\\n\r\n\u2713 No problem about the sounds\\n\r\n\u2713 Good OP and EDs\\n\r\n\u2713 Expect the Loli to sound like one\\n\\n\r\n-Character 6/10-\\n\r\nI pretty much have the guts to say to you that this anime has failed to establish or develop the feelings, the personality or even the basic needs to make a character a character. Everyone in this anime, except Tanya and Being X, is bland and boring because the anime forgot to give time to other people, that's why I believe that the whole community is one-sided in their opinions about the characters. The Bad Guys are dumb, Being X is evil and Visha still has an ugly face. Unlike in the light novel, we don't see character relations or even character hobbies that much. Here's a thing for you, did you know that Tanya wrote her thesis called \"The Logistics Behind a Highly Mobile War Theater\" at age nine? Did you know that Tanya is skilled in playing cards but she somehow lost to Viktoriya when playing against her?\\n\r\nNo? It's not your fault or even the anime's fault, maybe the anime needs more time to establish these character relations, hobbies and personalities, I can understand that 13 24-minute episodes have little time (so why did you waste one try on a recap episode, NUT?!)\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion:\\n\r\n\u2713 Bland and Lame characters except for the main\\n\r\n\u2713 One-sided opinions because of this\\n\r\n\u2713 You may not get along or even grow to love other characters besides Tanya, Being X and (sigh) Visha\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment and Overall 10/10-\\n\\n\r\nListen to me, despite the negatives I've said about this anime, despite the comparison between the anime and the light novels or the manga, despite VISHA'S UGLY FACE, I enjoyed this anime. I adore this anime. Heck, I believe this became the best anime of Winter 2017! And I will give this a 10/10! Why? Let's say you have a weird kind of addiction, let's say drawing spirals everywhere. You can waste paper and materials doing that right? But as long as you like doing that, why mind the downsides? (NOTE: Do not use this logic for anything else, only in anime, shows and music)\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion:\\n\r\nThis anime is\\n\r\n\u2713 Good\\n\r\n\u2713  Best anime of Winter 2017 for me\\n\r\n\u2713  not a disappointment!\\n\r\n\u2713  lazy at fixing Visha's face\\n\r\n\u2713 a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThank you!",

            "content": "Copy and Pasted from my Script from Rookery Radio 3/20/18\r\nCharacters: 5/10\r\nYou like Tanya? You think you're gonna like her? Good, because she's probably the only character that I remember or care anything about. This show doesn't have much emphasis on any other characters besides being-X or Tanya. It gives a good attempt to flesh out some side characters in an attempt to make their near-death seem a bit more meaningful, but I feel those attempts flopped overall because I didn't care for the death, or near-death, of any of the side characters. I hardly knew their name half the time or recognized them when theycame on screen. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nThe story is enough to keep me entertained, and with how unique the plot is there wasn't really much they could do in terms of deviating from the formula Media Factory had set. Some of the political drama that happened off the battlefield was interesting, but for the most part the majority of the story happens with Tanya on the field, doing her duty as a soldier. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10 \\n\r\nIt did what it was supposed to, and then some. Each opening started with a bang and hyped you up for the episode, and each ending came in with such thrust that you were stuck between immediately going to the next episode or sticking around for the ending, despite having already heard it multiple times. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI wouldn't say the art was perfect but man was it pretty darn good. I especially loved the amount of detail that went into the characters facial expressions, the signature body language of a militarized unit, and how much work into making the side characters (despite failing) memorable visually. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nIt wasn't like I was wasting my time with this show, I genuinely had a good time watching it. I wouldn't watch it again however as it didn't really wow me that much to warrant a rewatch, maybe with friends on a weekend but I wouldn't rewatch it myself. I recommend it, as we probably will with all shows during military march, for those who enjoy seeing the mechanics of a working military and army splayed out on screen. I also recommend for anyone who's heavily into the thrill of action, but don't really want the obsessive and sometimes annoying shonen character tropes. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ever thought about watching Youjo Senki before you read anymore here's my opinion in one word. DON'T! This anime doesn't deserve any of your time. Don't even watch, don't even think about it. It's a dumb show that will waste your time. \r\nThe story of this show, is as followed. Right before this office worker dies, he is visited by a self proclaimed \"God\" also known as Being X. But our main character doesn't believe in God, which upsets \"God\" so much. That God reincarnated him, with all his memories of his past life into a little baby girl. That will one day be 9year old Tanya. Apparently though after this reincarnation, his next one is not guaranteed. God/Being X also tells him to survive as long as he can. So it's safe to say, that it's really is Tanya's last time to be reincarnated.  Somehow as a 9 year old girl, Tanya joins the military. Yeah, I don't get how that makes any sense either. I guess the military doesn't give a shit, that's the only reason I can think of. But it's not believable to me. There are no other kids in the same military, or any other military for that matter. Everyone else pretty much looks like an adult. It sticks out even more, when other characters want her to leave the military, because she's around the age as some of their kids.\\n\\n\r\nThis shows animation never surpasses fair. Which isn't a terrible thing in my opinion, just as long as it never dips. But unfortunately for Youjo Senki has moments that I would say looked bad. Thankfully most of the time, they are just small bits! What really knocks down the animation, by a peg or two. Is that a lot of the characters, just look bad. With the exception of a handful of characters, but even they don't look amazing. They stand out when compared to the rest of the cast, so points to them. But again to me they don't look amazing.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the characters. What characters? I ask, because 80% of the characters, are about as good as a background character. Hell even the main character Tanya, lacks depth when compared to a puddle of water. The only good moments for the characters. Other than some very small parts, and one other character which I will not mention. Was when Tanya and Being X are exchanging conversation. It made it feel, as if there could be so much more to both these characters then there was. Everyone else just kinda fills space to say/explain something every once in a while. Sure some characters have a bit more, but for the most part not as much as Tanya. \\n\\n\r\nBut you May be asking \"What about the music?\" Well I liked some tracks quite a bit every now and then. Listening to the OST now though, doesn't change that. Which makes me sad, because I was hoping to find more tracks to listen to more than once outside the anime. Although I don't really see myself listening to the whole OST again.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment I got out of this show ranges. Most of the time, it was absolutely pathetic! Other times it gave me hope, that it would stay at a ok level of quality. Only to kick me in the balls later on. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this could have been a better anime. Sadly it isn't. The characters are lacking any real depth. There's no real character development. Animation could have been a bit better, the characters designs could have been more appealing to look at. The music had it's moments though, which I was thankful for. Well that's all I have to say, so later.",

Then there's Youjo Senki.\r\nThe Saga of Tanya The Evil follows the story of a salaryman transported into another world when he died in the old world. I know, this sounds a lot like TONS OF ANOTHER ISEKAI ANIME! But, seriously, instead of making the isekai stuff the main point, they just tweak the old world a bit (thus, magic was present). The protagonist is then transferred into a body of an orphaned girl. For an isekai anime, theytook a sharp turn here. The protagonist early life is pitiable.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is filled with a fighting scene such as human dogfighting (it sounds weird but trust me, half of this series filled with human dogfighting another human mid-air), massacre, shelling, gunfight, and many more. This makes the anime an action anime by default. The art is nice considering the studio is pretty new, this is their best work so far. Oh, and it really resembles our own history (minus the magic part). Watching this makes you want to learn actual history. Some of the people uneducated in military terms should proceed with caution since this anime contain a lot of military jargon and terms. Otherwise, it's really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, the OP and ED are good. The VA for Tanya is superb. The rest? Meh\\n\\n\r\nCharacter? Only Tanya gets the progression, the rest is a walking cannon fodder with personality as deep as a puddle\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is very good. I enjoy watching this a lot",

All of the characters are great! I really don't like religion, and that IS a part of this anime, but it doesn't take over the story. It's like... squeezing a bit of lime over asoda. You know it's there, but it's not overwhelming. I love Tanya so much, and this anime is easily a ten across the board!",

            "content": "Youjo Senki was a quite the unique experience and i have to say first about other reviews before i start with the review. I find it kind of funny that people are reacting lots about the generals to be dumb in strategic actions and that they have not achieved anything before Tanya comes along, People are also writing about how can a 9y old be as smart or maybe smarter as the generals and flame the ratings because of this, i find that quite stupid overall, the brain of a small child can Learn/access/progress/use new knowledge many times faster then a adult when i sayfaster i say lot faster, and thinking about Tanya to have all the experience and knowledge about knowledge/science/history/behavior gained from a different lifetime with higher technology and knowledge then the current age she lives inn.\\n\\n\r\nTo Have such knowledge/exp with a 9 year old body and a intense mind to progress information she has at her disposal no wonder she are as smart or smarter then the generals, if it would be realistic she would be way more smarter then all the generals combined, and that is something i believe we will see in the next series!.\\n\\n\r\nTime for my my scores.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9,5/10.  many have pointed out lack of character dept and i agree there, i would say that Tanya,Mr.X are the cool sadistic characters and for me booth are overall evil but i think the mr.x the god him self is the most evil, as for the company/battalion she commands there are not much in them in personality same with the generals + the mad scientist.\\n\r\nBut to sum it up this series is almost only following the main character so there are not much time to make personality's to the other characters considering its a wartime anime, generals and army personnel tend to be doll and cant expect to much inn just 12 episodes, there are a few places here and there you get to know the other characters better but there is almost no time for that because the story flow is good and strong. But i have a feeling that the next series will be more focused on the characters and i have a strong feeling that we will see lots of improvement in this parts in the next series especially in Marry if i got the name right.  \\n\\n\r\nThe personality of the main character and the setting of the anime makes it a masterpiece, not often you ever will see this in a anime and that makes in unique.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10:  The story flow in this anime is very strong, you are going with a fine phase and there is absolutely no fillers at all.\\n\r\nThe setup is basically a alternative timeline of our world in the age of ww1-ww2 taking a stage but the difference in this world is that we got magic, so the strategy and how the war works in this time line is a little bit different.\\n\r\nThis timeline is over the date of our timeline ww1, so this war is a combination of our history ww1 + ww2 set together but in this anime timeline its the first world war.\\n\\n\r\nArt+Sound 10/10.  I find the art to be very good and i do not want to spoil anything so i wont say anything about it then its awesome.\\n\r\nSound, is very good and quite realistic, and lot of good music and sounds with the action and the setting makes this anime unique.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10.  I have to say this is 1 of the best anime i ever seen if not the best and i have seen like 200+ shows and i seen most of what the most consider as best and most popular.\\n\r\nThe setting/timeline/art/music/fight style/character makes this to one of the most unique anime's ever created, its good with story and you feel entertained and wanting more every time you see a episode, and even if you re watch the series you gain knew experience because stuff you missed last time and it still feels very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have to say sry in advance for my spelling and probably not the best eng you seen, i am not from a native eng country so hope you did bare with me and take something from my review, and hope you watch and enjoy this show as much as i did!.",

            "content": "Tanya the Evil offers an interesting premise in that our lead, Tanya, is actually the reincarnated form of a male adult human resource worker whisked away to an alternate 1920s-era world by a being proclaiming itself to be our world's god (which Tanya acknowledges as Being X due to being atheist) and forcing him through suffering the perils of war to make her (how I'll address Tanya the remainder of this review) a believer. In spite of her predicament, Tanya defies Being X's influence on her hellish life by enrolling in her country's military as a mage, as the world in which she lives inis capable of utilizing magic for use in combat.\\n\\n\r\nTanya the Evil's run is driven primarily by how our lead reacts to her unique predicament. Having her past life's experience as a human resources worker and the knowledge she gains taking part in the Empire's military, Tanya becomes a seemingly young prodigy to the military who is ruthlessly able to plan out effective strategies and tactics to dispatch enemy threats with her squad. While seemingly doing this with the best of intentions for the Empire on the surface, Tanya is secretly trying to use her achievements as an opportunity to get high enough in the military's ranks where she won't have to be active on the battlefield and defy Being X's efforts to force her into worshiping it. But between the incompetence of her superior officers and Being X's influence to stir things on, Tanya finds things often not going her way in spite of the increasing achievements she makes on the battlefield.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the series also sports some of the best quality animation I have seen for the year thus far. This is best highlighted by the aerial magic combat scenes that Tanya and her soldiers can have confronting enemy squadrons as there is plenty of fluid movement and engaging choreography to get out of the show's intense action. In addition, the anime faithfully creates settings and clothing based upon the 1920s European time period that Tanya the Evil is set in, alongside the magical technologies employed by mages to fight in battles.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is a weakness that can be said about Tanya the Evil, it would have to be Tanya being the main focus of the series. As the main hook of the series, this can be a double-edged sword. Granted, Tanya doesn't exactly have the most positive traits as a character and the series is well aware of it by delving into her reactions to her unique situations, which can make for some engaging black comedy and philosophical focus on the flaws of religious faith. However if Tanya's character is a turnoff for watching the series, then there is little else that one can enjoy out of it beyond its action scenes. There aren't many other characters given prominent focus or depth, and the plot mostly focuses on Tanya's involvement in battle and her mounting issues between Being X and her military superiors. Not helping matters is the series ending inconclusively as Tanya the Evil's light novel source material is still ongoing as of this review.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tanya the Evil is solid entertainment in exploring Tanya's actions and thoughts dealing with being on the battlefield and attempting to defy a divine being. However as this is the main hook of the series, this can turn away fans if they want more to it besides focus on Tanya and are not fans of her character focus. While I did enjoy what Tanya the Evil offered up, I wouldn't necessarily find it among the best titles that 2017 has offered thus far thanks to the narrow focus it employs on Tanya's exploits.",

It shows how the most promising get held back by such established leadership and general bureaucracy. It also visualizes the various \"game of thrones\" style politics that happen at the top.\r\nIt also shows management/human resource challenges. The drama of confronting the undisciplined and weaker-willed manpower was taken to quite the extremes--I can imagine how some HR types would love to use some of the techniquesutilized in this anime, but can't out of kindness and ethical policies. The difficulties of recruiting top talent and the strategy of getting such skilled individuals, who know it and show it through cockiness, to work as a team is shown as a best case scenario. If only it worked like this in real life...\\n\\n\r\nTake all this, and skin it with a seemingly moe girl in a stereotypical WW-era German setting, and you have Youjo Senki (Evil Tanya).",

Death note and Code Geass are good examples of anime that do that. I personally feel like Youjo Senki can definitely stand ground with those two. The story is very new and interesting. It centers around the belief of god and faith. Its a very deep theme but is presented beautifully in the anime. The art is very visually stunning. Especially scenes where they show people firing shots. The sound andmusic was OK, i like how they tried something different for music, but it wasn't my cup of tea. For characters i really liked the main character but thought the other characters were a meh. Even though i gave it alot of praise, to be honest i didnt really enjoy the anime. I respected all of the categories and techniques they used, but personally it wasn't that fun for me. If you want to try something new and want a good short series with beautiful animation and a great story. This anime is for you!",

In science fiction, the beauty of making the new story is also in the making of a new world! The vivid description and advanced knowledge of the human condition that Tanya has just adds to the density but When people rate this anime for its characters, remember to look at what the anime is trying to focus on.

            "content": "This is a show that I went into, unaware that there was a light novel from which it was based. And...I LOVED THIS!\r\nI was looking forward to the next episode every week.\r\nWhy?\r\nWell, despite the summary of the show, the actual premise is: Asshole A vs Asshole B. Or more precisely, an asshole human vs an asshole god(s?). That was fairly unique for me. Not often do I see a writer brave enough to risk pissing off the zealously religious by writing a story about how a human got reincarnated and decides to live his new life spiting his creator. \r\nNow, some people might find thisshow boring, thinking its a less shoujo friendly version of Izetta, the Last Witch. You might think these two shows are similar, but they are nothing alike at their core! This show, intentional or not, is a humorous exploration of religious belief. Depending on interpretation could be a statement of \"Ha! This is what happens to you if you don't believe in god.\" or \"See? This is why I don't believe in god. Look what he did to me?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe art style does take a bit of getting used to. Although it's not similar to the LN or the manga version, it's very expressive of a character's emotions. \\n\\n\r\nSound is also pretty decent. The OP and ED were fitting to the story, especially the lyrics. I had some fun singing \"Feuer! Sperrfeuer! Los! Achtung Deckung! Hinlegen! Halt!\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall, definitely recommended if you're looking for a more humorous, but dark and intellectual series!",

            "content": "Looking through the anime titles that I had chosen to watch and review Youjo senki or its English equivalent which is sage of Tanya the evil sits high on my list. With the premise of an interesting setting, theme and capable voice cast as well as what promises to be an interesting take on a conflict that is modeled after the first world war I can say that this anime drew me in immediately and I must say I was impressed by the result. \r\nYoujo senki is a war/action anime that has pseudo historical elements within its story.  This review has a chance ofminor spoilers so please be aware. \\n\\n\r\nYoujo senki takes place in an alternate world and in a time and setting that is roughly an equivalent to the world as we know it during the events of the first world war. In this alternate world, the empire a country that is located in the center of the continent that it is situated in is engaged in a number of wars with the surrounding countries. The year is year that this story takes place in is roughly the 20\u2019s. In this war, the empire though a sizable country that has both a powerful military and a sizable industrial might to back them up is fighting a war against several enemy factions that are each worried about the power that the empire has been building up. In this case, one can see that the empire is largely based on WW1 era Germany based not just on the titles that its officers have but also the names of its characters. \\n\r\nThe empire finds itself facing the combined armies of three different factions which is the Republic, The Entente alliance and the allied kingdoms respectively. Here the republic is loosely based on the French republic for bases of their character names and the name of their capital while the Entente alliance is based on countries of the Scandinavian peninsular like Denmark and Norway. Lastly the allied kingdom is based off the UK. The other major powers like Russia and the US are present but only provide logistical support to the main powers. \\n\\n\r\nTechnology wise the combat between the armies makes use of largely weapons of WW1 era which in this anime includes bolt action rifles, large artillery guns, machine gun teams, WW1 era fighter and bomber aircraft and of course the infamous trenches that made WW1 so different to other wars. The one aspect that Youjo senki introduces to the combat is the introduction of magic and those that wield it which are called mages. Unlike mages shown in other anime the mages here unleash their spells not by use of wands but learning spells that they unleash through the aid of a computation crystal. This allows them to unleash their powers through both their weapons in the case of attack spells and Armour for defensive spells. Apart from attack and defense spells mages are also able to use their powers to achieve flight and it is this combination of spells that make mages so powerful in this world. As a result, mages are elite troops due to the low number of them within all armies and though part of the regular military are treated differently. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea of using an alternate version of WW1 era Europe as the setting for this series I felt was good and interesting as this is a setting that is seldom seen. By having the main character and her men fight for a faction that many would see as being the bad guys we get to see what would have happened if they through the use of smart and well thought out plans and strategies and magic manage to defeat the powers that are arrayed against them and win. A large what if scenario if you will. \\n\\n\r\nTanya \\n\r\nTanya Degurechaff voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Aoi Yuki of Gosick and SAO fame and is one of the main characters of this series and is the protagonist of the series. A soldier of the empire and a powerful mage whose abilities are such that she is called the Devil of the Rhine by the empires enemies that she faces on the battlefields in which the empire fights its war with. Due to her latent magic power as well as her intelligence Tanya was promoted rather early in her career and as a result she is often underestimated by both allies and enemies alike due to both her age and her height. Her unusually low height makes her look more like a child than an adult which is often used for comical purposes in the show. Personality wise Tanya is a ruthless, calculating and cunning person that cares only about herself and her advancement in ranks. In the beginning, Tanya after joining the military only had a limited amount of things that she wanted and cared about which for this phase was to stay away from the frontlines and stay in the rear where she will be safe. \\n\\n\r\nDue to circumstance, she ended being put in more and more dangerous situations eventually being assigned to the frontlines themselves. Apart from being ruthless and calculating Tanya is also a smart person and a capable strategist and tactician and is able to come up with ingenious solutions to problems and at the same time come up with smart tactics to deal with sudden battlefield situations. Tanya also demonstrates the ability to always see the big picture of a situation which I find admirable within a soldier and a unit commander at that. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough ruthless and cruel Tanya is not without any positivity as though she still treats them harshly Tanya does care about the men that serve in her battalion willing to both motivate them and guide their growth as soldiers as well as shoulder any extra burden that she feels that they shouldn\u2019t have. One notable trait of Tanya is her bluntness in that she is not afraid to express what she thinks of both the people that she encounters and the actions that they take. This is something that I thought was nice to see as all too often military officers tend to gloss over their plans and not worry about or consider actions that may affect them. Having someone who is both smart enough to understand the plan and be blunt enough to express their opinions of it without fear of censure is a good thing I felt. Another notable trait of Tanya\u2019s is her speeches which though all are motivational tend to be quite dramatic though they almost always have the intended effect. \\n\r\nTanya, I felt was a well-designed character and I felt that her seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Aoi Yuki really did a fantastic job voicing the character of Tanya. \\n\\n\\n\r\nVisha \\n\r\nViktoriya Ivanovna Serebryakov voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of the irregular at magic high school and Owari no seraph fame is one of the main characters of the show. A second lieutenant within the empire\u2019s military and a member of Tanya\u2019s rapid response battalion Viktoriya who prefers to be called the name Visha serves as Tanya\u2019s second in command. Personally, wise Visha is a kind-hearted person that cares about the well-being of her comrades and will take the time to get to know them when given the opportunity and as a result she is well liked among the battalion. Visha is also an honest and dutiful person that prefers to tell the men everything that she knows about a mission and hates hiding details from the men. \\n\\n\r\nThough easily intimidated by soldiers of higher rank than she is and not having the bluntness of Tanya Visha is still very much loyal towards her friends and comrades and has great trust in not just them but also in her commander Tanya\u2019s judgement and actions as well. Because of Visha\u2019s personality she serves as an effective second in command to Tanya in that she contrasts with Tanya\u2019s personality\u2019s brash and ruthless personality with one that is kind and caring towards anyone that she meets. Though not as powerful as Tanya in terms of combat ability Visha is able to hold her own in most fights and at the same time keep up with Tanya\u2019s fast flying speeds quite easily proving that she too is a capable soldier and mage in her own right. I felt that Visha was a well-designed character and I liked how she had a personality that was the opposite of Tanya\u2019s. This had the effect of minimizing the risk of Tanya turning everyone in her unit against her by being her usual self as Visha will be there to stop her from going too far. This contrast I felt was a good move on the studio\u2019s part. I felt that Saori Hayami really did an excellent job portraying the character of Visha here. \\n\\n\r\nErich von Rerugen \\n\r\nErich Von Rerugen voiced by veteran voice actor Shinichiro Miki of Bleach fame is one of the main support characters of the show and is a high-ranking officer within the empires strategic HQ. A capable soldier and an expert strategist Erich is an honest, measured and cautious person that is also methodical with his plans in that he tries to account for every action that the enemy can take in each situation before submitting his plan. Erich and Tanya can be said to be enemies in that Erich is the only person within the empire that see\u2019s Tanya as a monster in the form of a little girl while the others see an extremely capable young officer that is proven in bravery and combat. However, it\u2019s important to note that although Erich despises Tanya he still respects her combat prowess and intellect and is often surprised on how well her unit fights on the frontlines. Though in the beginning he saw her as a monster as the series progresses Erich starts to develop some respect for Tanya and by the end of the series has some faith in her. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation for the series I felt was well done with the character designs and the design of the various environments being especially detailed and well done. The designs of the uniforms that were worn by the characters of the various factions I felt was impressive. The combat scenes that were in the series I felt were pretty well done and detailed with the fights themselves being both frantic and enjoyable. The animation for the use of the magic that was used in the series I felt was also nicely done. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, I felt was particularly good in this series with Aoi Yuki who voiced Tanya and Saori Hayami who voiced Visha doing a great job voicing their characters. Aoi Yuki in particular I felt really managed to portray Tanya really well able to switch Tanya\u2019s personality at will to reflect changing events and emotions. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\r\nMusic for the series I felt was pretty good with the opening and ending themes being my favorites. The scene music that is used for different scenes also felt appropriate for the given scene. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed Youjo Senki as it had an interesting story, interesting setting, a great cast of characters and a capable voice cast. Using an alternate world that is modeled after the first world war I felt was an interesting setting as this setting is not widely seen or explored within anime. \\n\\n\r\nOne advantage that this brings is that it allows the studio to feature both the actual countries that took part in that historical war and at the same time impose the anime version of events into it. I felt that the various factions that were in the show which as explained earlier amounted to three main blocs which was the allied kingdom, entente alliance and the republic respectively was well thought out and designed with each being pretty unique. The Empire which was the main faction in the show was also well designed and thought out. One result of using an alternate earth as the setting for the series is that it allows the development of an original storyline in which events that did not happen in actual history can be explored and the effects of those happening can be visualized. In this I thought it was interesting to see the empire despite being surrounded on all sides by powerful enemies and not have one ally still emerge victorious despite having to fight on multiple fronts. This was not just as a result of Tanya and her unit\u2019s contribution but also in the plans that were drawn up by HQ most of which I found to be interesting. Being a military themed anime the main point of the story is of course the participation and involvement of the main character and their contribution to the overall story which in this case is the war. In this I felt that Tanya and her men despite numbering less than a battalion is able to field both the firepower of a much larger unit and at the same time have the maneuverability of smaller units and with this affect the course of the war by being sent on specific and critical missions that allow the empire to secure many advantages against their opponents. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters I felt that both Tanya and Visha were both excellent characters that were well designed and developed characters that had rather interesting personalities. Tanya in particular while having the appearance of a little girl who looks way too young to be a soldier is nonetheless an extremely capable soldier whose high latent magic gives her the power to unleash many devastating spells that when combined with her other combat skills makes her a powerful soldier that is capable of going against multiple foes at once. Tanya\u2019s skill in battle is matched with her personality which while ruthless and unforgiving towards her enemies is caring towards her troops though this is not something that she would reveal to others. Visha however is different in that her personality is a contrast to Tanya\u2019s in that she is both kind and caring and actively looks out for the men under her command. In the relationship that these two have though Tanya is the superior officer Visha is subordinate whose personality helps ensure that Tanya\u2019s ruthless personality does not get out of hand and that the unit is still able to do their jobs. \\n\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for this series I felt was especially strong with Tanya\u2019s seiyuu Aoi Yuki and Visha\u2019s seiyuu being pretty impressive. Aoi Yuki in particular deserves a lot of praise as Tanya is not the easiest of characters to portray as she has many different personality traits that though making her stand out makes portraying her difficult. In particular, I really liked how Aoi Yuki was able to voice Tanya\u2019s speeches as I felt that the speeches while motivational were also resounding and had conviction in them. Whether in battle or outside of battle i felt that Aoi Yuki really managed to do a great job here voicing Tanya with this role being one of her standout roles in all the roles i seen her in. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Imagine a reality in which the world's most power hungry nations battle for control and dominance in classic WW1 style. Now include the fact that these nations have troops capable of flying through the skies with almost magical abilities and weapons and you are sure to turn some heads. Now include the fact that a loli is a major for one of the most powerful mage battalions and I may have just broken your neck. As strange as this concept sounds, I found it even more strange how good this show turned out to be. Here's my full overview for Youjo Senki: \r\nStory: 8\r\nAs Istated before, yes; a young girl who looks younger than a middle schooler is in charge of a massive battalion of mage-like warriors that dash through the skies as a superior form of air artillery. Their goals range from them demolishing their foes on the ground to the ones lurking in the heavens with them. The one who leads is Tanya Degurechaff, a once male salaryman that is reborn into a little girl thanks to the best/worst, all-knowing entity known simply as God. Struggling to maintain a peaceful upbringing in her new world, Tanya battles the enemies of her nation and the plans that this God has set forth for Tanya.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, pacing matters little as the story is always about the war and how close the Empire is to securing a victory. It is very simple to follow as long as you focus on the situation at hand. Every episode delivers a battle where the strategy is logical and makes sense. No holes, just war and the motives that follow it. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 \\n\\n\r\nI very much liked the art style in this show. It's not basic enough that you see it often in other shows. The best scenes are obviously where the action is. Seeing Tanya zip through the air striking down mages with her bullets, bayonet, or magic was a \"blast\". Aside from the action, Tanya's emotions are delivered very well. When you see her angry or upset, you truly see and feel it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nI see the sound in this as average only because nothing was really memorable. I always skipped past the opening/ending songs so no tune were favored by my ears. If anything, the sounds of war in this are fairly nice. Whether it is the cannons going off, explosions being set, or the clanks of tanks making their way across the ground. Everything seemed good, just not amazing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nOkay, listen, I have a knack for evil MC's and that is exactly what you get here with Tanya Degurechaff. There are no stupid, clich\u00e9 traits that plague her like countless others protagnoists. She is focused, determined, and is as serious as your dentist. Honestly, Tanya has very little backstory but she does not need it here because all that matters is where is trying to go. There are no plot holes about her that leave you scratching your heads either so she is very simple to follow. I'll say this, don't get attached to the character but her ambitions. \\n\\n\r\nBesides Tanya, you'll constantly see the faces of Tanya's strategic leaders and the mages that take orders from her. I found most of them to be okay and that's about it because I've already forgotten their names. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 \\n\\n\r\nBeing only 12 episodes, I did find the show to be enjoyable. I found Tanya to be very entertaining and I was curious about what obstacles were bound to stand in her way. I eagerly waited for the clashes between her and God and how Tanya's perspective on it and life would change. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nJust watch it, it's good. I've not kept up on the news for a second season but the ending implies one. When it drops, I will be there to see what I got from the first season: a whole lot of vintage-looking battles and a loli ordering the troops around. Paradise. \\n",

            "content": "\"The Saga of Tanya the Evil\" is an \"isekai\" anime, meaning like Sword Art Online it's about a character who lived in our world until he or she is transported to another, more fantastical world. The story of this anime I am awarding a 9/10 just because of how unique and batshit insane it is! Get this: an evil salaryman living in modern day Japan is murdered by a disgruntled worker he fired, only to piss off God (whom our protagonist calls \"Being X\") in the afterlife and deny his existence. A vengeful God then punishes our main character by reincarnating him as a littlegirl in a war-torn fantasy world not unlike our own 1940's Germany. Tanya decides to make the most of her situation, so she joins the military, rises through the ranks, and basically tries to conquer the world! If this show reminds you of anything else, let me know, cuz I think it's pretty DAMN UNIQUE!\\n\\n\r\nIf I were grading this show on the character of Tanya alone it'd be a 9/10. Tanya Degurechaff, the Devil of the Rhine, is the focus of this show and she really is the main reason to watch it. Tanya is that rare anime protagonist who is a totally remorseless villain, yet is still a total treat to watch! She's so charismatic and intelligent, you can't help but want to follow her evil exploits.Think of Lelouch from Code Geass or Light from Death Note. Whenever Tanya freaks out and curses God or chews someone out, that is when the show is at its most entertaining! Still, all of the other characters get very little focus and even Tanya's best friend, Viktoriya, gets little to no character development. There *are* some good moments, like when Tanya convinces to her classmate to drop the program because he's a family man with a daughter Tanya's age, or that one Republic soldier who becomes obsessed with killing Tanya after she steals the special gun his daughter bought for him, but these are few and far between. The side characters get around 7/10 compared to Tanya, so overall I'd give the character score 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is well done, 8/10. The backgrounds are very detailed and beautiful, and action scenes utilize 3D models in a way I've never seen done better in anime. I'm surprise because studio Nut (yes that's the name) is a brand-new studio, and for its first anime, Tanya us exceptionally well made. Character models look good (especially Tanya's insane facial expressions), except when they don't. For example, there are plenty of times where I thought Viktoriya looked cute and pretty, but there were just as many scenes where she had this derpy fish face that made me cringe.\\n\\n\r\nSound was very well done in this show, 9/10. Listen to this show with headphones and you'll feel like you're on a battlefield due to perfect sound effects. The music in the show is also great, the OP Jingo Jungle (apt name) stuck in my head for days. I'll also mention here the EXCELLENT English dub. I started watching in Japanese, where Tanya's voice was also very good, but I switched to English for Monica Rial's A+ performance as Tanya! Rial played a similar villain named Maria in Witchblade, and she's just as perfect for Tanya because she so effortlessly switches her voice back and forth from cutesy to crazy. Seriously this show is worth watching just for Monica Rial!\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this show is an easy 10/10 but your mileage may vary depending on how much you enjoy crazy anime girls and action/explosions. I *do* think the action scenes were exceptional, like those sky surfing battles are some of the best in anime. I also really enjoyed the subtle, dark humor in this show. For example, Tanya actually just wants a quiet, easy life, and a military career is just a step towards getting that safe desk job. What's funny is that Tanya does *too good* a job on the front lines, so she keeps being sent back into combat over and over! Another running gag is Tanya is afraid of secondhand smoke (something they haven't even heard of in this world), and then at every strategy meeting her superior officers are always chain smoking.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Saga of Tanya the Evil is a crazy show I'm giving 9/10, though your mileage may vary depending on your tolerance for extreme violence, blasphemy, lolis, and wartime imagery.",

Well, that at least covers the overall feel of the show and as a lover of history I really enjoyed it. I'm not going to go into spoiler territory but, I will say I do enjoy a good evil protagonist and regarding this show, it's done extremely well. (Keep in mind this is set in an alternate timeline my fellow history buffs lol)\r\n   I will saymy only complaint with this show is I was hoping for a bit more character development within our main group of characters. I feel it has the potential to be very reminiscent of the \"Band of Brothers\" tv series but from an axis powers point of view. But, so far all we've got is background on our main character plus a small drop in the bucket of one of the enemy characters. But there's plenty of time and that's a small nitpick.\\n\\n\r\n   The animation is really good and the only issue I had was two characters looked a bit soft for a war drama(guess which ones) but, I let it go as it really grew on me as the series progressed and it said a lot for the one character in particular.\\n\\n\r\n   The sound was very reminiscent of the old documentaries so I really enjoyed that a lot. Albeit a bit more crisp than said footage.  \\n\\n\r\n   I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a good war drama and loves action. 9 /10 as of the time of this review. Ready to continue this story.\\n",

I feel this story bit off more than it could chew but succeeded in some ways.\r\nThey gave a fairly interesting protagonist who is funny in her own ways. Every other character you could ask me their names and I would never be able to tell you. Her fight with the character \"Being X\" (or God) is amusing and to me the only interesting part of the anime.\r\nThat being said the half try at this odd military aspect is decent. I feel the military pointof the show is just this huge shit show to hide from the fact that the concept for Tanya, the protag, is very odd and weird. The show is military heavy. So keep that in mind if you wish to watch. Even so, the military plot is bland and boring.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed about the show is the protag. She is very interesting in her own ways but how she came to be how she did is unbelievable, even in anime terms.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. It's unique and different. Though you can tell who the main characters are because they actually look different than everyone else.\\n\r\nThe op is fantastic tho and the ed is good. The bombs and gun is rather loud imo.",

            "content": "Youjo Senki, or as it has been translated into English, The Saga of Tanya the Evil, (which is particular, and will address later) is a piece of alt-history fantasy. Our main character is a Japanese salaryman living in the current day, who has rejected God, and after being killed by a former employee, out of resentment for having been laid off, is told that he must accept God in his next life. This next life is where the story begins, in the year 1925, during The Great War, but not quite the same as the real one. The biggest major difference, as you can probablygather, is that the armistice wasn't signed on the 11th of November, 1918, and the war has continued, mostly in the same manner as the real Great War, with the exception of the fact that as it turns out, magic exists in this universe, with Mages (Tanya being a major one) who are able to precisely send artillery strikes onto targets, as well as stop getting hit, and other magical things. It's also worth noting that the country names are different. The German Empire (the country Tanya fights for) is 'The Empire', the US are the 'Unified States', the UK are the 'Allied Kingdom', all of which mean little to me, beyond France, who are the Entente Alliance. I won't go over this too much, but could they have chosen a worse title? It'd be like if it took place in the Cold War, and Germany was called the NATO Warsaw Pact.  \\n\r\nAnd so, Tanya, (who's a 13 year old girl unlike most the officers who are just middle aged men, by the way) must find a way to end this stalemate and win the war for the Empire. And this is the highlight of the show, since the action is all very well orchestrated, and it uses the setting of WW1 more as a backdrop than as something it attempts to actually emulate, there's never an intertitle telling you she's in Ypres or the Meuse-Argonne or anything, but it's just muddy trenches and villages in Europe so they all look pretty much the same, and it's probably more DAK than Imperial German Army with the fact a lot of it isn't emphasised on the trenches, which isn't a complaint. Still, that's not to say I have no complaints at all in regards to this. Mages are capable of sending surgical strikes onto their targets with ease, so surely this would be enough to have a major change to the trench warfare system, if not the abandonment of it. After all, what actually caused it was the combined arms Blitzkrieg, predominantly utilising planes and tanks, both of which are used in the show. But no, it seems like soldiers in this universe are told to sit in a trench and wait for someone to charge over the top, and if some flying loli comes up with something that I can only guess is a G43 (a magazine-fed semi automatic German rifle, which may be anachronistic but the Unified Kingdom had M1 Garands so if they don't care about historical accuracy then I don't) then just accept your death. \\n\r\nSo, to get to the point, it's about our titular character Tanya, who is evil, it even says so in the title. But is she really? She might be an extremely staunch atheist, even in the face of supernatural happenings, which isn't particularly evil, but neither are her actions. I know a thing or two about Patton and Guderian etc. (i.e. important military personnel from the 1910's onwards), and she really doesn't strike me as that different to any of them. If I had to describe her philosophy in a sentence, it would be getting the mission done at any cost, but she didn't do anything especially wrong in my opinion, even in one of the later episodes which I felt was meant to make the viewer perceive her as Hitler or something. Perhaps it's because we're so used to anime protagonists being absolute beacons of moral behaviour, and never doing anything bad, and so I was in the wrong mindset, expecting her to slap a shell-shocked soldier or firebomb Paris or something. At the end of the day, she's not that great of a protagonist. She's better than what we usually get, and I'd rather she's as she is than some Shinji Ikari, but I feel like the author rested a lot of the entertainment value on her being a great character, which I didn't think she was.\\n\\n\r\nSo, is Youjo Senki a bad show? It really isn't, and of many instances of moe-isation of war, this does strike me as one of the better ones, but it just could've been so much more, and I suppose it's like some WW1-era artillery. It tries to hit many things, but fails to hit any. A show about the Great War, a show about magical powers, a show with an amoral yet compelling protagonist. It tries to be all of these, but doesn't do any with that much finesse. It's not a bad show, it's all well made, but it's certainly not one I plan to watch again any time soon.",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nThe concept was pretty interesting. Having modern day salary man who climbed up in society for peaceful life, but his lack of human heart/soul and being too much of a so called \"logical, rational\" person became his downfall. Story of revenge, hatred, conflict, mankind and gods playground.\r\nI found for the most part the idea of the story pretty interesting.\r\nBut the minus side of the story for me is the whole more serious military topic, patriotism, soldiers and such in general. As I personally despise military in reality,then even in fiction more \"realistic\" presentation of such things are a big turn-off for me. So that was a big minus for me plus how old smart ahems farts sit behind the table and play game of chess with life. So this is strongly minus for me simply because of personal reasons.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big plus of the story was the whole concept of mighty being toying with our protagonist and I guess the big picture will be in this story the goal of making main character gaining the human \"heart\".\\n\\n\r\nAlthough another issue with the story would probably be lack of development or progress in characters themselves. It felt that story was too focused on war and tactics than the actual story.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, story is pretty interesting and for the most part the plot and development of the world is great, whilst character focused story is quite slow.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nArt its superb. Action is pretty amazing. Aerial combat was pretty amazing that at some point it even became pretty much of a matrix. Design choices are great. Overall art was just great, but it missed a little bit for me to be truly amazed or impressed. Thus won't get full mark from me.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I move to OST, I will mention sound effects in general. I found the balance of music and sound effects very impressive. In a sense it felt as playing battlefield with war tape mode. Meaning that sound was quite spacious, rich and fulfilling/immersive. Now to OST. Music was generally absolute bliss, a lot tracks were very tense and fitting. And the way they made music fade into background of action and make it suspiciously quiet during some of the more dramatic and tense moments, was simply spot-on.\\n\\n\r\nPretty impressive sound.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nMiddle-aged society drone with lack of human soul gets body of yohjo. That alone is impressive. Seeing the adventures of young sociopath in the fields of blood was darn impressive.\\n\\n\r\nAside that quite few character very somewhat interesting, but more of annoying or just plain stupid. It's world filled with battle and military mania. Thus we have lot of human chess players. But at the same time making them unlikable and showing cruelty of humanity for silly reasons is pretty nice thing to see now and then in Anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that I found the characters good in more of a objective way. But personally aside full on mad sociopaths, I didn't really care much about characters. Having crazy characters is entertaining enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, in sense of enjoyment characters are varied and are for the most part quite interesting. \\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nI did mention my main complaint in story section as it connected the most to that part.\\n\\n\r\nWill add that I did quite enjoy overall, ended up binge watching in a day and even though I initially gave it 7, whilst writing this review I noticed no much I play around the weight of \"personal enjoyment\" in scoring. The average would be still 8 worthy.\\n\\n\r\nThus I will give this show 8 as very good Anime with few issues plus a little personal complains I had about it.",

            "content": "What's that? You say you want and Evil, German, loli, flying around and killing people. This is definitely the show for you. I will talk about at least the first two episodes in this review. Ep. 2 is where the hook for the show is, so I would recommend watching them before reading any in depth reviews. \r\nThe story is somewhere between WWI and WWII. However, it is set in some fantasy reality. So it is not really those wars. One big difference is that the major battles are fought in the sky, by psychically/magically propelled and armed soldiers. \r\nTo make things more interesting weseem to be placed in the evil conquering empires POV and following a little girl named Tanya. Tanya seems to excel at focusing her powers during combat, all the while being evil as heck and loving it. In the second episode, we find out that Tanya is actually the forced reincarnation of a ruthless businessman. Forced by some sort of god, that is salty because the MC will not acknowledge the gods existence, even on deaths doorstep. So now Tanya has to make the most of her second life. All the while, struggling against a crafty god. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in the show is pretty good and the actions scenes are flashy and full of weight. Some shots are done in CG animation, but these are usually wide shots or when a group of soldiers are flying. The character design is also kinda of generic except for the MC and her head subordinate. Everyone else is generic soldier-man.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the Tanya and her subordinate, there are only a few other characters that get characteristics. One of which comes a little later in the story and would basically be the hero protag of a different anime, who sees Tanya as the evil boss Character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I highly enjoyed this show. Sometimes the show can slow down a bit. However, knowing that there is usually a climactic action scene or Tanya being evil at the end of some (sort of) boring episodes, can help keep the viewers interest.",

The one thing that sort of interested me was the reincarnation of the business man into Tanya, but they never even explored that. So basically he was reincarnated somehow with the knowledge to become a general as a little girl that is super op, unlikable in (not a fun way) and boring. I would recommend this anime ifyou have a thing for lolis, slow paced completely unexplained plots and only one character being the focus for most of the screentime.

            "content": "First review. Anyway, Youjo Senki was a good anime in my eyes. It lacked a good amount of characters, as in that you don't learn much about Tanya's squad and who they are, what they do. The story was very simple. Basically WW1, the Empire wants to win the wars they are in. That's the background. Tanya is good at magic, that's why she is important. The artwork was good for the most part, but the effects could look better, you can tell the characters look different than in most shows, but I enjoyed it. Sound, I'm not sure, not a huge sound person, soundedgood, voices were nice and fitting. I enjoyed it enough to watch all of it, therefore it was good. I'd recommend it for most people looking for a decent action anime with something new to the table.",

The story is interesting because the theme is about how far one can get in life as a \"devil\" in world war 2 (or was it 1) setting and what obstacles you would meet.\r\nThe only character you end up caring about is Tanya, the main character. I find every other character as superficial overused personalities. She is quite a relatable character and youend up wanting to root for her. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED is great. They are both worth listening to. The voice actress of Tanya is a famous one and definitely helps with making the anime more interesting. Her voice acting gives Tanya the kind of depth and attention she needs. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime requires you to use your head as you watch it. You have to be interested in moral and philosophical subjects because if you aren't, Tanya and her life story won't be at all interesting to you. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty normal. It seems like the kind of artwork a normal studio produces. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave this anime an 8. The episodes don't end in a cliffhanger and neither do they give much thrill. The way the author recreated World War 2 centred around Tanya was what made this anime worth watching.",

Taking place in an alternate universe where the world is on the tipping point of its first world war, this young girl takes up arms to bring her glorious country to victory.\r\nOf course, an average anime of this type would be little fun, seeing wars fought with a couple of magic users is an old concept and rather boring at this point, so this anime takes everything a step further. Our main character, Tanya, hates god because she is an absoluteatheist, and this being that claims to be God just wont stop messing with her, until she finally admits defeat and admits that God is real and everything is going exactly to his plan, which paves the path for the never ending stream of hilarity that is this girls 1v1 fight against god himself.\\n\r\nThe series has a pretty good set of supporting character, including:\\n\r\nOnly other mage girl: The only other girl in this series that is a mage\\n\r\nGuy with scar above his eye: He is just this guy that shows up often with a scar above his eye but is important because he survives getting stabbed\\n\r\nThe people in Tanya's squad: Just your average memorable characters that are immune to bullets because plot protection\\n\r\nHigh ranking officer 1: He has weird hair and hates Tanya, but doesn't do much.\\n\r\nHigh ranking officer 2: Actually talks to Tanya, embraces her good war advice and uses it to make himself look good\\n\r\nHigh ranking officer 3: IDK what he actually does, but he is important for some reason\\n\r\nAnd of course plenty of soldiers fighting a war that will probably never end.\\n\r\nThe art and sound are very good, with the intro and ending theme being some of my favorites in a while. \\n\r\nHowever, Tanya is basically the only character actually be built up, most of the other characters are just there to exist and fill the roles that the anime needs them to, so if you are not into characters that use logic to determine all their moves in order to benefit themselves then you will probably not like this anime.\\n\r\nOverall it was a pretty good anime that showed what would happen if WW1 and WW2 happened at the same time and magic existed. \\n\r\n8/10 would definitely take up gods sword again.",

            "content": "[not many spoilers, i'll keep it vague] I'll start off by saying that Youjo Senki had quite a lot of potential. One of the main reasons why I started this series was because I felt that its premise was interesting and unexpected - an atheist salaryman reborn into another universe as a girl, participating in a world war? You don't find that in most animes, so kudos for that, i guess.\r\nThe most problematic area, in my opinion, was character motivations and relationships. To me, Tanya's motivations were never clear at all. She did say that all she wanted was the 'climb the ladder in therear' and not go to the frontlines. But at the frontlines, she displays aggression and an enthusiasm for violence that contradicts her statements from before. This is especially problematic as this is a very character-centric anime. This means that the plot revolves around Tanya, and her rapid-response battalion. If her motivations aren't clear, then the plot is essentially devoid of investment on the part of the main character. Furthermore, there was a lot of potential in terms of relationships between characters. For example, her relationship with the female war veteran that follows her everywhere could have been more well-developed. What do they think of each other? Why are they paired together? What about her and her battalion? There are some scenes of camaraderie, but nothing to outrightly suggest that they have much loyalty to Tanya. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was also problematic, in the sense that it kept pushing for pay-off, without the set-up required. This is an anime about war. That entails really dark and heavy themes, of death and destruction and bombs. However, we as viewers usually don't get invested in the war and violence at all if we aren't emotionally invested in the the characters. In other words, the deaths of unnamed characters usually fail to incite any emotion in a viewer, unless the story has \"set-up\" our investment in the character. Okay, to be fair, they did try in a few instances (can't say, spoilers), but it wasn't enough, and at most they spent about a minute on it? There wasn't enough time spent to make sure that we understand and value these characters, and would be sad if they died. Thus, despite the constant emphasis on a \"world war\", I didn't feel much for it. Furthermore, there is quite a lot of patriotic talk in the anime (like,, everytime someone important opens their mouth). However, the anime only 'tells' us - instead of 'showing' us - that the consequences of losing this or that battle would be bad. Of course, anyone would understand that losing battles and seeing people die is bad, but reality is that depicting a successful operation in the face of all odds doesn't leave an impact the way failing and seeing your men die does. Then again, 12 episodes aren't enough time for all that set-up, though it does pay-off quite nicely in the end. (See: Kuroko no Basuke and the Inter-school competition)\\n\\n\r\nThe art was quite good though, I particularly liked the way they depicted the battle scenes, though the way characters were drawn kind of put me off. Music was okay, not amazing, but okay. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, not very worth watching, but still pretty enjoyable. The ending is a pretty good twist (and a perfect set-up for a next season heh)\\n",

I found it a welcome change from my usual genres and may consider rewatching it in the future.\r\n~Should you watch it?~\r\n- Story:\r\nThe general idea is pretty easy to follow, but may seem complicated at some points. It mainly just follows the rising of the main character through the ranks and the war progressing.\r\n- Characters:\r\nThe main character is really the only character with a unique personality. While the others do get character development, their personalities tend to be the same. The main character is also the only oneto get a real backstory.\\n\\n\r\n- Action:\\n\r\nYoujo Senki isn't 24/7 in-your-face action-packed, but certainly a decent amount. Action scenes involve guns, epic blasts, and death and/or destruction.\\n\\n\r\n- Violence:\\n\r\nIf like me you aren't fond of a lot of gore, this anime isn't too bad. It isn't incredibly graphic, although there are a few occasions when a character is 'pumped full of lead'. Apart from that, blood is generally a common sight - it is a war-based anime after all.\\n\\n\r\n- Humor:\\n\r\nThere isn't much humor to be totally honest. It is a pretty serious anime, although every now and then there might be a little something funny, but don't expect anything 'hilarious'. The anime itself remains pretty strong and enjoyable even without humor.\\n\\n\r\nApart from all that, if you think you like the idea of a cute, somewhat psychotic, lethal little girl being in the army and killing people, definitely give this anime a go.",

            "content": "EY, YO WHADDUP IT'S MY MOST ANTICIPATED ANIME OF WINTER 2017. Now, let's have a one-sided discussion on Youjo Senki by the studio with the best name for hentai.\r\nStory: Could've been better with the setup. 8/10\r\nThis is the second most interesting part of the entire show. You would think after seeing the PV and reading the synopsis that this would be based mainly around major action set pieces, but the main focus is on the cause and effect of each strategic decision, as out main psycho is almost all-powerful due to her circumstances. The true enjoyment is in the psychological skirmishes and setup in thequieter scenes, with the execution and situations in the thick of the battles being the reward for all that thinking and foresight. Normally, this would be boring, but the characters and the inherent nature of the military and each soldier's ranks and specialties allow for some interesting and exciting situations, while still having room to point out how seriously (NOT PG WORD) the entire setting is. On top of that, any instances of asspulls or bull can be explained by SONZAI ECKSU just pulling some strings willy nilly to mess with our salaryloli, while still allowing there to be tension and an idealogical conflict between the two due to the specifics of their beings, if that makes sense. However, there is one specific instance of bull near the end that I could not be satisfied with, even if it means we might get more Youjo Senki.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Inconsistent, but managed to impress me around the end. 8/10\\n\r\nThe only character that has a notable design is Tanya herself, but that's almost the point. She strays from the more realistic (not realistic, just more so comparatively) designs of literally everybody else due to the nature of her personality, which is one of the more out there ones in recent anime history. Whoever designed, animated and directed the shots of Tanya when she goes full crazy elitist loli all deserve medals, as they are SPOT ON. The animation has a few highlights in the first two episodes to reel you in, but the last two episodes kick it up a notch not only in the animation quality but in direction as well, as there are a few more interesting things done visually compared to the rest of the show. The CGI rages from actually bad to decent in a few places. The middle of the show is not as interesting of technically proficient as the specific episodes I mentions and rely more on the dialogue and characters, which I'll get to, of course. The explosions are notable due to how much impact they portray and how awesome they look. The OP is actually terrible, with 40% of it being footage from the show just thrown in there with no meaning, unlike what was done in 91 Days' OP with it's slick, meaningful editing. The original footage of Youjo Senki's OP also has little meaning, and the last shot of Tanya watching a sunrise is not at all appropriate to the tone and focus of the show. The only semblance of theming is with the clocks in the early part of the OP. The ED is nothing but stills with little meaning, if any, but I have a feeling it was less due to incompetence and more that the few high quality, stylish stills and the song were supposed to carry it. It's a 6/10 in my eyes, which, considering it's an ED, is pretty good, if only when you compare it to most others.\\n\\n\r\nSound: WOAH, IS THAT A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL OR A FIGHTER JET? I CAN'T TELL, THEY SOUND EQUALLY AWESOME. 9/10-Hypothetical blind man watching anime for some reason\\n\\n\r\nGod bless the soul of whoever made the mages and their weapons sound so amazing. OP and ED songs are both perfect. Jingo Jungle plays to the strengths of Tanya's character (by which I mean the trait that most people notice the most from the PV), but as I said earlier, the visual aspect of the OP didn't take advantage at all. The ED song was by Tanya's VA. ED songs by cast members is usually a good sign that the VA(s) had a blast portraying the character, which, since Konosuba 2 is an example, is a great thing. However, I cannot give this a 10 due to the lack of standout performances from most of the other cast members. The VA for Ajin's Satou does a great job with his Zettour, but the only other standout is Serebryakova's VA, who was slightly above good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: SHE IS THE DEVIL IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE GIRL. AKUMA DA/10-IGN Japanesesalaryman% freshness-Rotten tomatoes\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the show, no doubt. I'd rather not explain her backstory, actions or ideologies, as I think it's best to just see for yourself. I just think it's best to point out that she's not as insane as the PVs or the people who watch this show make her out to be. She's much more intelligent than that, which makes her outbursts even more cathartic. The other characters are good, specifically the generals and that blue haired guy I quoted. However, the other characters, including Serebryakova lack any depth, especially when compared to the standouts, with at least one of them being nothing more than a plot device, albeit one that both makes sense and enhances some of the conflicts and themes, while also showing how much of a hindrance SONZAI ECKSU will be in the future.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I expected more, but was satisfied with the last two episodes. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: an 8 that should've been a 9\\n\r\nI could have a huge discussion just about how deftly Tanya deals with her situations early on, along with her mindset regarding things, how she treats those around her, and how she takes advantage of any opportunity she takes to try and get things moving her way. Mind you, this is excluding the strategizing and the actual way that the show presents everything, keeping me intrigued when most shows would get the drop. I've been keeping things vague and dropping hints constantly because I couldn't forgive myself if I deprived someone else the ability to perceive the events in this show firsthand, and be like \"Oh, that's what that pretentious nerd was talking about\". \\n\\n\r\nIf you have any tips for me to improve my reviews or happen to want someone who has way too much free time and can thusly spend hours discussing a single show, message me or something. I honestly don't know if PMs are a thing on MAL. Anyway, I hope you watch and enjoy this show, regardless of whether you value over-analyzation or not.",

SPOILERS BELOW!\r\nThe story is about a salaryman who gets reincarnated into a loli named, Tanya Degurechaff, after being killed by an ex-employee that he recently fired, and meeting a being who claims to be God but Tanya calls him, \"Being X\". The reason for being reincarnated like this was because the salaryman was atheist and had a lack of faith towards the employee he fired.\r\nThe era Tanya was born was in an alternative timeline of WWI where magic exists. She was born with outstanding magic capabilities and was recruited for the Imperial army and behaves like noother heroine.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progress, Tanya starts to believe in Being X as he helps her defeat her enemies by giving her more power. There were times where Being X would mock her as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art quality is unique compared to every other anime I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound quality in this anime is amazing. The opening, Jingo Jungle, by one of my favourite bands, Myth & Roid; the ones that did the second opening song for Re:Zero, is great.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are unique with a few generic like some of soldiers.\\n\\n\r\nMain:\\n\\n\r\nTanya Degurechaff: A former salaryman who was reincarnated as an intelligent loli that's a jerk and becomes a soldier. She ranked up to Major quickly.\\n\\n\r\nViktoriya Ivanovna Serebryakova: An second lieutenant who's optimistic, friendly, and carefree soldier. She works right under Tanya.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting:\\n\\n\r\nAdelheid von Schugel: A mad scientist! (my Okarin reference) who was a former atheist and his experiments in weapons didn't work well with Tanya until Being X made him believe in him.  \\n\\n\r\nErich von Rerugen: Vice Director of Strategy and Operation. He's very passionate, sensible, and sincere about his country. He was also against Tanya's promotion and has a complicated relationship with Tanya.\\n\\n\r\nHans von Zettour: A Brigadier General in the Imperial army. His believes and mindset are outstanding. He's like the brains behind the Empire's success.\\n\\n\r\nKurt von Rudersdorf: Another Brigadier General in the Imperial army. He is always seen smoking a cigar.\\n\\n\r\nBoth Hans and Kurt are friends as they went to the same War College.\\n\\n\r\nWeiss Matheus Johann: The vice captain of the Tanya's 203rd Aerial Mage Wing, and the captain of the Tanya's 2nd Aerial Mage Squadron that belongs to the 203rd.\\n\\n\r\nBeing X: Some invisible being that claims to be God.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot. I love the fights and characters in this anime. My favourite part was when Degurechaff pretends to talk like a playful little girl when communicating over radio to the workers of the Dakia factory then starts an attack on the factory while the workers are laughing. The only thing I didn't enjoy as much is the story as it can be confusing at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this a 8/10.\\n\r\nThis is a MUST watch!\\n\\n",

That is what I love about anime they are not always predictable like most movies that use the same story and ending over and over.  As for the first season it ended well and here is hoping for season 2, I would really like to see where the take the story. I am trying not to give too much away but the story really males me want to startthe light novel I would like to see the story to continue. The art was original it took the most getting use to but you cant judge a show just by art. I would have to say that the episode where the battalion was being trained and they had their first battle was the best of the series in my opinion.",

            "content": "Due to description and premise sounding really obscure and strange and in addition to that I would be Studio NUT's first anime I had real doubts that this would be anything. But I was gladly surprised to find out that this would be this good. Concept of grown man reincarnated into a parallel universe WWI Prussia is kind of absurd. And to be honest I am no a huge fan of military animes. With this anime I am willing to make an exception since they really  know how to make working story and chars. Characters have great personalities, backstories and motivations are gradually builtup to them. This is not simply a psycho loli killing people and commanding troops mindlessly but it is coldly and tactically calculating and loli who has been given a second chance and is now taking full advantage of that to drive her? and her? nations agenda for greater good. Her motivation is also driven by the Being X that is clearly trying and testing her and/or to fuck with her throwing several obstacles to get her into believing him. We can see true human nature to be revealed here and to see how emotions drive them despite how they try to be rational. And that rational being is our Tanya who appears as a monster.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first anime of Studio NUT this is a brilliant one with great soundtrack, art that really shows expressions of Tanya, intriguing story and multidimensional chars. I am really looking forward to this and that is why it gets a well earned 9/10.",

            "content": "TLDR: A pretty interesting but poorly handled idea wrapped into ok action, extremely ruined by unnecessary edge.\r\n(spoiling out only episode 1 and 2)\r\nWe start off at episode 2 where the plot instantly presents a very interesting idea of Rational vs Emotional. On one side we have an over the top rational guy that won't believe in god even if one appears in front of him and on the other side we have the guy that was driven into a corner, which ended up murdering him and the god (or being X).\r\nThis was a very intriguing start and what I liked the most about it isthat the main character didn't lose his s**t even facing a situation like this, showing again to which extreme he's on the Rational side.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where my very first problem with the show appears - the fact that what I said above is episode 2.\\n\r\nThis looks like a small detail, but in reality the first episode is the one that tries to appeal the most to the audience (aka the hook). So we learn here that the hook of the show is not the interesting above mentioned conflict, but action and edge. Also, it has a psychological effect to set the main hero in your brain to the loli...\\n\\n\r\nAnd daaaamn the edge gets annoying as hell at points. Not only that the thing is aesthetically extremely displeasing, but it conflicts the very main idea of the show by taking off the Rational side of the MC, turning... it... into a typical sadist.\\n\r\nThe most obvious next complain is - why a loli?\\n\r\nI am 100% positive that giving the MC like 5 more years wouldn't damage anything in the plot, so the obvious remaining answer is - to please the edgelords (sometimes... really.... fu Japan...). And again it makes no sense within the theme of the show! When the MC is so interested in just securing his easy life, he should have just chilled out for as much as possible. I am sure he would be provided an ok life, considering the importance of the mages in the setting.\\n\r\nThese two things are actually the biggest flaws in the show and damage it from multiple aspects. If you can get over these, then your experience with it will be a lot better than mine.\\n\\n\r\nNow the logical question that follows is - how does the show handle its core idea and does it go anywhere with it? The answer is - kinda...?\\n\r\nIf you look at it on a superficial level - yes. This whole thing is like a game to the being X (going to call it that, it cracks a smile on my face), which constantly sets up bad situations for the MC, at some points making it even look like trolling and watching the MC struggle can be very entertaining at points.\\n\r\nBut again there's this thing that keeps bugging me... Being X is the biggest a**hole in the series. In the Rational vs Emotional fight, I'd really like to see both positives and negatives of both sides. In the Rational camp we can see them both: negative - can't understand human emotions and pays for it; positive - brings results. Yet in the second camp there's only an ass that keeps making wars and killing off people just for the sake of fking around with one person and not only that, but gives power to that person so that it stands a chance so that the killings continue. It's way too easy to take a side.\\n\r\nI have to say that I'm not trying to nitpick this, because it really doesn't take that much effort to show another side of X - just a few scenes here and there where blessings save life. Then it would perfectly symbolize what Emotions are - sometimes warm, sometimes self-destructive.\\n\r\nIn the end we have to blame the laziness of the scriptwriter and the low demands of the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing one could care about are the characters... and we have literally one. Everyone else is of low to no importance and the only opposing force in the form of an actual character will exist in the sequel.... YAAAAAAY!\\n\r\nI also generally tend to hate on \"perfect\" characters. I'm talking about Narsus from Arslan Senki or the MC from Alderamin etc. This is the category that the MC of this show falls into. All the judgments he makes are always corect and his logic has no flaws, being dragged down only by others, even to the point of unjustified hate, despite the MC having the right predictions.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it's as I said before. Watch this for some action, ignore the rape faces (unless you're into this kind of thing) and try to not too dig too deep into the plot. This is a decent time-waster, nothing more nothing less.",

            "content": "\"Deus lo vult\"...\r\n*****    Some minor spoilers ahead!   *****\r\nOn first impressions, LA thought this anime would be showing how Tanya, an ace in the Empire's army would open up to her cohorts within the war with Viktoriya being her clutch back into \"humanity\" due to Tanya's obsession with killing and violence, however this notion was QUICKLY revoked as it didn't become \"fixing Tanya's behavior and opening herself up\", instead changed to her rivalry towards \"Being X\" or GOD and just her survival in this new world wrought by war, all due to Tanya's previous life as an atheistic salaryman about todie and was reincarnated by Being X through a wager and Being X doing everything in his power to both make Tanya \"respect\" the gods as well as making Tanya go through hell and back in times of the war, THAT was kinda what cemented LA into both carrying on watching this anime and very quickly jolted to one of LA's favourite anime of Winter 2017. Sure it's sorta a blend of both \"protagonist is OP\" (but only through Being X's interferences...so slight twist there on this trope) and \"transported to another world\", but blended soo well all due to Tanya's motivations and just her primary goal of both sticking it to Being X and surviving \"this life\".\\n\\n\r\nAfter that...it drove too deep into the war commentary perspective instead of focusing on the major plotline at hand, sure the entire war and Tanya trying to get into the rear echelons is her entire goal and Tanya allowing herself to shoot herself in the foot AND allowing the war to go into world war level was Being X's cause, but the anime's meat is just showing more war commentary than the conflict between Tanya and Being X, which was the best element in the anime and it's not an exact \"faffing around\", but LA just wanted to see more of it and kind lost it's maniac, sadistic anti-heroism it had in it's earlier episodes, LA still liked the series and like last season's Shuumatsu no Izetta, it went down the same route in terms of plot format, just exchange yuri fluff with war commentary without our main protagonist as it's focus. HOWEVER if there is a bit of defense in all this, this is more build up to Being X secretly planting his own plan to throw Tanya off through both the war and driving Tanya deeper into it AS well as creating a new rival for Tanya.\\n\\n\r\nLA doesn't need to say much about characters as the characters are minimalistic in some sense what with Tanya, Being X, Empire's Military higher ups like Hans von Zettour voiced by Houchuu Otsuka, Kurt von Rudersdorf voiced by Tessyo Genda and Erich von Rerugen voiced by Shinichiro Miki  as well as Tanya's own troops of the Empire and Viktoriya Serebryakova voiced by Saori Hayami. Yes, LA's favourite character was Tanya followed up by Viktoriya only if by default due to their screentime, but LA's more interested character was Being X himself but his screentime is VERY limited if anything and he works \"behind the scenes\" if anything. In terms of character development, Tanya gets the majority of it what with being a character-focused anime and everything, thing is, due to how the anime shifted from a resurrected person vs. GOD to...war commentary, she kinda lost some character development and she just still kept her sadistic nature, Viktoriya isn't much better as she's a bystander to the war conflict let alone a character without much power to the proceedings. The Empire's military higher ups are stereotypical to say the very least but the only character within that group to have some relevance to Tanya was Erich only because he is suspicious of Tanya. The characters if anything is shaky especially if you want to root for Tanya or see her fail, LA was in both parties for that.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by NUT, the animation was rather top notch if albeit slightly shaky due to some animation's quality dipping ever so slightly at times, though the battles were not one to be affected...completely, still the battles were some of the better animation fronts. The character designs were decent at best what with the animation going crazy with Tanya's crazed facial expressions, the rest of the character designs were at best ok but had some semblance of \"who's he again?\"...especially concerning Tanya's forces sans Viktoriya (that or trying to remember their names were just difficult to remember). Nonetheless, the animation was above average even with it's dip in quality at times and for NUT's first foray into a full length anime especially one this ambitious in it's animation, it's worthy of praise, quality and all.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, the voice cast is very good on both the Japanese as well as it's FUNimation Dub. In the Japanese, LA just LOVED Aoi Yuuki as Tanya and Saori Hayami as Viktoriya, like match made in heaven especially Aoi Yuuki as Tanya (it had her perfect range of loli and sadistic). On the FUNimation Dub side, Monica Rial as Tanya had perfect cadence for Tanya in similar respects to her Japanese counterpart and this too for Jeannie Tirado for Viktoriya as well. What can LA say?, this voice cast as minimalistic as it is, is excellent on both fronts.\\n\\n\r\nOn the soundtrack of Youjo Senki, LA will say BOTH the OP \"Jingo Jungle\" by MYTH & ROID and the ED Los! Los! Los! by Tanya Degurechaff (Aoi Yuuki) were LA's favourites of this season respectively (to the point LA has been listening to BOTH songs on loop at times). As for the OST, they fit the mood perfectly, LA had a special affinity towards the latin chanting battle OST prevalent in most of the battle scenes that it had it in.\\n\\n\r\nThe finale brought back Youjo Senki to it's former glory AS well as using it's military war commentary to it's best advantage in the form of Tanya's increasingly cynical view on war and humanity towards it and how she just wants the war to stop by ANY means to the point of raving cold-blooded insanity to smite God. The finale also brought on some new plot points and makes sense due to this being an ongoing light novel it opens the gates to a second season?...maybe?. Nonetheless the ending brought back the magic from it's earliest episodes and LA pretty much had a positive reception on this ending if it had the hinting at a second season!.\\n\\n\r\nYoujo Senki put an interesting spin in the entire resurrected in a new world fantasy world especially when it came to our anti-hero main protagonist in whether you rooted for the sadistic loli or wanting to see her fail to her detriment of her resurrection placed on her by God as well as her conflict with GOD, but it got slightly lost in the war commentary it had going for it, until the final 2 episodes where the focus was back in which it redeemed itself...albeit slightly. Again this situation Youjo Senki fell into was similar to last season's Shuumatsu no Izetta even down it being about magical military warfare with female leads. By going into more comparisons and differences, they both have great starts then they start faffing around away from the major plotline then making up for it for the finale, the only difference between the two is the atmosphere, Shummatsu no Izetta being more optimistic, Youjo Senki being more pessimistic about it all. \\n\\n\r\nEven with all it's faults and how it disappointed LA in how it went into this direction, LA still liked this anime to allow this anime to STILL be in LA's Top 3 of Winter 2017 albeit barely (it got third place if your wondering) and wasn't nearly as a big disappointment as Shuumatsu no Izetta was.\\n\\n\r\nGod will it... indeed",

            "content": "I don't know how this got a 8 I guess people can enjoy anything must be nice. This show has a lot of explosions most of them were the exact same 9 in 10 were just copied and pasted. The music for the opening of each episode is the most annoying thing other than that I don't remember any of the OST. Magic is never at all explained I think people are born with it but we never see it used as a tool in every day life only war and magic seems to come from some core thing mages carry I don't know theshow doesn't care so I guess I'm not supposed to either. there is a recap episode after episode 6 which is bizarre and a huge wast of time. Tanya and that other girl with the long brown hair look like they were drawn by a one artist and the rest of the cast done by a another its really weird. the show doesn't care about anyone other than Tanya I don't remember anyone else's names and no one does anything in the show anyway. Everyone in this show keeps screaming about how Tanya is evil the only evil thing she did was in the first episode she intentionally but indirectly gets two of her allies killed and she never acts like that again for the rest of the show. The story goes nowhere god is a psycho and wants this random nobody to worship them and does nothing to inspire worship in others and just acts like a child for no reason. There is a world war but this show tells us jack squat about this world so who cares and that's the problem the show does nothing except stare at Tanya doing nothing the only good things I can really say are that there is no fan service (thank goodness) and the bit around the end where a big plan comes together wasn't awful but not great because of what happens after. I cant recommend this series to anyone just awful but if you're someone who enjoys any show put in front of them and is trying to kill time just watch something else you may not think your time is valuable but every bad show you watch is one less good show you get to see before you die go watch \"Haibane Renmei\" or something there are plenty of fantastic shows worth your limited finite time this isn't one of them I need to smack my brother upside the head for recommending this to me.",

            "content": "The saga of Tanya the Evil (Saga) is a show based in an alternate world that closely resembles WW1 Europe. Saga initially aired in January 2017 at the time I was unaware of the show, later when I discovered its page, I passed on watching the show as the critics convinced me that Saga would not be worth my time despite its relatively high score. Fast forwarding to this season and Isekai Quartet is coming out. I had watched 4 out of the five shows featured and was curious as to Saga again in preparation for Quartet. So I found it and watched it dubbedonce I found there was one available. \\n\\n\r\n\tOne of the things I did like about Saga was its setting. The World War 1 setting is a neat period of history that until recently was not touched upon as much as the other great war. That is not to say they were going for sheer periodic accuracy; it is very much just based in that period. The big twist to the setting is that in this universe Magic exists, and the nations in the world use it to bolster their military might. Saga doesn't show many applications of this magic. We learn that children are tested for mana while young. If they have enough mana, they are sent to become mages. They channel their magic through crystals broaches pinned to their chest which allows them to fly and/or imbue their guns to shoot bullets as devastating as artillery or track multiple targets and put up shields to resist enemy fire. I don't think they show magic doing anything else though I think at one point Tanya throws a fireball, I absolutely could be wrong though.  Its something Saga does not go into any real depth about. I often wondered how this magic affected this world's history but with the way, not quite Germany generals talk about famous battles in Earth history like Hannibal's or Ceaser's remains unchanged leading me to believe that magic must have been a more recent discovery. Again I may be wrong, but Saga does not go into detail to refute that. \\n\\n\r\n\tIt is honestly one of my significant issues with Saga was that it never really goes into detail much.  I get they only had 12 episodes, but the show loses a lot by being this vague. I would have loved to get more background info on not quite Germany, almost France, The UK's sibling, maybe Norway, approximately Serbia or Burgundy, heck we did not even get to see much from Nearly Russia. This lack of information carries to most of the characters too besides Tanya, her adjunct, and the generals in strategy. The viewer is just not given enough to care about these characters nor many defining traits to differentiate them from other soldiers. \\n\\n\r\n\t\tThe cast as I mentioned is a bit lackluster. Tanya the main lead is not likable, but she really was not meant to be. Before she was reincarnated to this world, she was a manager of some sort at a company, a bit higher up than the typical salaryman. Tanya was a callous and cold man. He was a ladder climber with dreams of upper management for a comfy life, something she strives for even in her new world. Tanya is a person who hates inefficiency and incompetence at the start of the show we see him firing someone for not meeting their quotas. There are some excellent points to Tanya. The troop she trained that have passed muster in her eyes she values much and makes sure they are taken care of. Though part of me believes this is just because it would reflect poorly on her to her superiors if she lost men.  She also reminds me a bit of a lawyer always finding ways to skirt around or justify her actions to international war law. Her adjunct Visha is a bit of an airhead she is well-meaning enough and smart enough to command a squad of men, that and Visha clearly is the fanservice character as her rack is plentiful. The generals were a bit fun they had all the traits of their WWI counterparts with lots of drinking and smoking big cigars while they directed the troops throughout the war. It would have been nice to see more than the glimpse we got of the opposing sides generals, but it was fine as it was. Also, Tanya kills an opposing mage, and his daughter who has fled to for the most part USA signs up to fight against Tanya is named Mary Sue I chuckled at that.\\n\\n\r\n\tIt does bring up a good point though I was surprised at how egalitarian these countries were. As opposed to their counterparts who just had women enlisting in support roles for the most part these countries do not discriminate whether a male or female wants to join active service. Now, this could only apply to the mages as they are a privileged class and a resource these nation states do not want to squander. Now that I think of it I did not see much in the way of female grunts, but more on background later.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe battles and tactics employed were pretty cool to watch. I also liked the tech they gradually used some of it was later WWI tech towards the end.  There were some subtle fact references sometimes too. In one moment where Tanya is facing an enemy mage, he uses a trench shotgun. Something the Germans called out the Americans in WW1 as illegal because of their effectiveness at sweeping trenches. Something Tanya does as well. \\n\\n\r\n\tArt-wise for the main cast, it looked average, but when it comes to the big battles sometimes, the CG looked really rough if there was a vast mass of people moving.  It was neat to see each nations motif for their mages. They all were individualized. I laughed when I saw the UK's Sibling's mages were riding mostly broomsticks. In the sound department, nothing stuck out. I mentioned I watched this dubbed and they did an excellent job I liked  Tanya's English Va better than the Japanese one.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\tIn the end, Saga turned out to be okay not what the critics lampooned it for, nor worth the high praises heaped upon it either.",

            "content": "When one reads the synopsis of the anime, they will automatically feel interested. The idea seems very new, and different. It also makes you curious to know what will happen next. And for the first two episodes, it kept getting more and more interesting.\r\nUntil you realise that the 'plot' is completely unrelated to the execution.\r\nstory: 2/10\r\nAs mentioned in the synopsis, apathetic middle aged dude gets reincarnated to a little orphan girl by a pissed off 'God', because somehow this way will show him that God exists, and make him grateful, he then gets into this tough world but discovers that there is some sort ofmagic(?) that people fight with, and that he had amazing, unique powers.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I had many problems:\\n\\n\r\nMy first problem was how irrelevant the whole reincarnation into a lilo was. He volunteers to enter the army at the age of 8 (no questions) and goes on to become better and better. Having already been an apathetic person, this helped him in being a 'merciless' soldier. and his past life also helped him, but is that all that there is to the whole reincarnation process? We get to rarely see 'God' or 'X Being' in limited scenes where he says empty words that mean nothing, but somehow fuels Tanya to 'overcome obstacles', I have 2 questions:\\n\\n\r\n1. Isn't talking to him acknowledging the fact that he exists?\\n\r\n2. How can she not believe in God, yet falsely pray to somehow make her magic work? made no sense.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a great disappointment to see that the reincarnation was only made so that we'd see how the dude seemed very wise in her other life. [as Tanya] \\n\r\nWhile the first 2 episodes seem greatly interesting and different, the anime just falls into a very normal series about war. (No right or wrong, patriotism, fighting solely for one's country and following authority) The whole trying-to-be-badass-and-challenge-what-is-calling-himself-a-god- could have easily been avoided. It added nothing to the plot but explaining why a ten year old is leading war. \\n\\n\r\nMy second problem was the fact that Tanya was a fucking lilo. Her being a lilo is a hit or miss, a hit where you think this is brand new and different, interesting to see a 10 year old bossing everyone, or a miss where it's very creepy and offsetting, and also where you cannot believe how everyone acted like it was completely normal and ok for an 8 year old to join the army and beat others all by herself. I don't know about you, but I don't think it was normal back in 1942 (her being a mage doesn't justify anything.) \\n\\n\r\nI also did not really understand the usage of magic, there is little to no details about it. It was unnecessary and can completely be thrown in the garbage. In the series, some humans have 'magic abilities' which can help the country in war, so scientists create some flying shoes and boxes which 'mages' can fly with to fight enemies. They can also protect themselves and, while using very normal guns, shoot very non-normal bullets. Now don't ask me why people who can use magic need rifles and bullets to begin with, because I cannot give you an answer. It felt like the 'magic' was only put there in an attempt to make the anime look cooler. We never know any kinds or types, any details, what can make it weaker or stronger, when it started existing, its abilities. We know nothing at all.\\n\\n\r\nBUUUUUUUT, the anime *is* entertaining. At one point it did feel repetitive and boring, but for the most part it was greatly engaging. I think it would have been much better had the protagonist been a normal aged character, or if the reincarnation thingy was of any relevance to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nTanya wasn't a very bad character. Staying in her/his head was quite entertaining and the thought progess was enlightening, but I only felt that the show was about her, which was of no problem at all, but left me forgetting all other characters. I just found her, or him, a little too smart. It's not like he was a General in the military in his past life, he was just a very simple businessman, his talent and abnormal ability of command, training, and combat were just too...unrealistic. His flexibility as well. He adapted rather too quickly to transforming from a middle aged man to an infant girl, he did not even blink. \\n\\n\r\nmy problem with the characters was the X being/God. He was very bland and childish, in the very few scenes where he appeared to pause time, it seemed that he was only trying to tease Tanya while failing miserably to 'prove his point.' Such a meaningless character.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, as mentioned above, are very easily forgettable. The only character worthy of praise was Colonel Sioux, he left quite an impression on me.\\n\\n\r\nAnime Art: 6/10\\n\r\nI divided it 5 for the background and places, and the other 5 for the characters design.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds & places are extremely beautiful. I paused the anime more than a couple of times to take screenshots of how mesmerizing most of the scenery looked. What made the rating go low was the characters' design and how bad they were. Tanya and Viktoriya especially looked very, very sloppy. It pained my eyes whenever Viktoriya appeared in any scene.\\n\r\nThere is some lazy work in the battles as many scenes are repeated or static, but this did not cause me much of a problem as they did, at the end, entertain me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough I didn't feel it was used much, the sound was very good. From the opening and closing themes to the soundtracks and everything in between..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nthe story and characters' design needed lots of improvement but they did not prevent the series from being an engaging one. Not something I'd regret watching but not something I'd recommend, either.",

            "content": "This is an updated reviews, written when I finished the series.\r\nThis was one of the two series I actively watched every week during this winter/spring, the other one being Kono Suba. While Kono Suba never failed to deliver what I wanted, but Youjo Senki started good, and then deteriorated rapidly.\r\nYoujo Senki was a big disappointment. The series started with a great promise, but after first few very interesting episodes devolved into a very boring slog of events that were barely advancing. Initial episodes were amazing. 2 or maybe 3 or them. After that part, the series are not worth watching, unfortunately. \r\nDetailed breakdown below.\r\nStory:\r\nThe premiseof a psychotic little girl serving in an alternative universe equivalent of World War I is very interesting. Opening episodes were interesting too. However, after first opening episodes where the series demonstrated the crazy heroine and antagonist, the show devolved into a slog of drawn out slow events which mostly involved some people talking about this or that aspect of war, without any of the amazing fights. You'll see people talking ,discussing maps, battle plans but barely anything of significance is being said, and events progress very slowly. Another big issue is that Anime seems to be uncertain about what it wants to be and which side it wants to take. It is unclear whether it wants to be sympathetic to protagonist, to the antagonist, or show life of troops under command of Tanya, or perhaps just indifferently show the events and let the viewer decide. So, it jumps all over the place. At one frame it tries to demonize Tanya, then it tries to show her human side, then it shows how expendable the troops are, then it tries to make viewer sympathetic towards them. It is very inconsistent and frustrating to watch as well. The ending was very unsatisfying. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is quite ugly. It sorta works in movement, but there's absolutely minimum detail on character's faces. While older generals look tolerable, original design of Serebyrakova was pretty much butchered, and even Tanya herself looks worse than the original art. There's CG being used in big battle scenes, it is noticeable, but not too noticeable. The anime also features quite a lot of cost -cutting techniques which become very noticeable in the 2nd half of the season. There are a lot of \"talking heads\" scenes, \"let's slowly pan something while people are talking in background\", etc. In the second half of the season I've noticed that all aerial explosions look the same, and it is one thing that can't be unseen. There are a lot of reused sprites there - every single aerial explosion is identical to each other down to the smallest detail.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSound is alright. There are few decent \"dark/menasing/heroic\" themes there, but they sorta lack punch. They play in background, but are not powerful enough to truly impress.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nTanya is interesting enough, but she never gets to do much aside from first few episodes. Basically, after the introductional episodes, the anime somehow manages to avoid putting main character into any situation where here character would make any difference. Events sorta unfurl on their own, and Tanya barely gets any opportunity to display her crazy character qualities. The supporting cast are pretty much cardboard cutouts, with maybe one or two generals displaying hints of resemblance of character. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nVery frustrating to watch. After first episodes I really liked I sorta kept waiting for more of the same amazing stuff. Except that anime never delivered anything of the sort.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe best idea would be to watch first two or three episodes, and then drop the show completely. It'll just drag on and on, without ever delivering similar material.\\n\\n\r\nSo, not recommended to watch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so I liked the story, the English voice actor fit perfectly for the main character but as much as I would have enjoyed giving it a 7 or 8, it was the design of the main character and her assistant that really caused me to give it a lower score.  Everyone else looks great, like how a \"normal\" character would look.  The main character and her assistant, however, look like some weird messed up dolls in the face.  The eyes are way too big, or disproportionate, for their heads.  I kept being distracted every time I saw them and couldn'tstop thinking how much it was ruining the show for me.  \\n\\n\r\nBesides that, everything else was fine, and a good show to have playing in the background while doing other things or to watch while eating.",
