            "content": "I write this as a gay adult man who's actually interested in proper M/M romantic representation and as someone who's jaded of queerbaiting and stereotypical heteronormative gay relationships in the shounen-ai genre. So when I was drawn into the hype that YOI offers a compelling storyline which extends beyond cheap queerbaiting and homo-fanservice, I was intrigued to say the least. \r\nI am going to do my best to be entirely unbiased. There are certain redeeming qualities to the show that I think deserves mention. \r\na) Ethnic representation: It isn't often to see America being represented by a Latino, to see prominent cast members from Russia,Thailand, China, Switzerland etc. \\n\r\nb) Proper treatment of women: Women are not objectified with melon boobs without any form of agency at all. Common anime tropes of the possessive brother veering into romantic desire of his sister are effectively established and subverted accordingly. \\n\r\nc) Accurate representation of anxiety and its debilitating effects onto one's psyche, projecting insecurity, doubt and unworthiness onto everything around you. \\n\r\nd) the soundtrack is well composed and suitably appropriate. \\n\r\ne) effective narrative turn of events in the later episodes that cast light on why certain earlier events transpired the way that they did. \\n\\n\r\nNow, moving on to the problems (SPOILERS INVOLVED):\\n\\n\r\nHorrible ambiguity involved in the main M X M relationship. Frankly, it's disgusting. The relationship between the two characters was never firmly established as fully canon; but there were so many moments between them that comes across as queerbaiting; but never realised as a full-fledged canonical couple that is settled beyond a doubt. The kiss is censored, the rings are dismissed as \"Onajimai you\" (for good luck), and even if we were to believe that they are \"engaged\" at some point, the conversation between Victor and Yuuri at episode 11 and 12 was so formal, as though between a coach and his student, that it just isn't the way a fiance would speak to one another! It vacilliates between intense homo fanservice (\"So Yuuri, what are you going to do to make me excited?\" and outright denial of their relationship, where Yuuri insists that OURRELATIONSHIPISNOTLIKETHAT. It's pretty sad; the show's entire premise is centered on Yuuri finding his sexual maturity and confidence in himself, as well as displaying his \"love\" of Victor to the world, however, there has NEVER been an explicit declaration of love, only outright denials and public displays of affection are either censored such that there is room of ambiguity for what it is, or veering on intense bromance. \\n\\n\r\nTo those people who claim that the ambiguity is what drives the homoerotic tension of the show, I ask you as a gay person. Would you have said the same thing if the couple was a heterosexual couple? You wouldn't, precisely because ALL shojo anime, even if it operates on some level of ambivalence or ambiguity, is always resolved with an outright declaration of romantic intention - it's what makes the scene magical, or romantic. Love is something that should not be hidden, and if this was a shojo show, we would be accusing the creators of playing us for fools. So why are we applying a different standard for YOI? Why is it possible for JJ in episode 11 to declare that he's going to marry his girlfriend, whereas Yuuri and Victor have to hide their relationship, their supposed engagement as \"onajimai\", good luck charms? \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, as a sports anime, it fails on the exact reason that I've mentioned above. Every single sports anime ranging from Free to KnB is all about being CLEAR, CONCISED and DETERMINED on the desire or the goal that you aim to achieve; ie this is what I want, and this is what I plan to do in order to get there. Rather, in YOI it's all about Victor Victor, it's not like that it's not like that. Well then, Yuuri, what exactly is the nature of your relationship? The true nature of their relationship is never fleshed in full, and as a sports anime, the skating scenes were repetitive and unnecessary - is it really needed to cramp 6 skating performances in one episode, of which it pretty much looks the same with bad animation anyways? Plot is almost non existent as well; and seems to exist solely to push for fanservicey elements between the two protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, the anxiety that Yuuri experiences is becoming a tired, recurring plot device that is losing its effectiveness. in EVERY single relationship conflict, it's always Yuuri who causes the conflict, due to his anxiety such that you can almost distill it down to a formula: Yuuri's anxiety causes some form of misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the situation -> They fight -> Cold War -> They get back together after Yuuri skates. It's never Viktor who begins the fight, speaking of which, we still do not know anything much about who Viktor is as a person; he exists as some cheap 2 dimensional perfect character that is there to lift Yuuri from his anxiety like some Godsend. Asides from the fact that he seems a little clueless on handling Yuuri's anxiety, he doesn't seem to have any flaws as a human being. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, please please please do not every compare this to No.6 where the relationship is explicit, sensitively drawn out, and the characterisation and relationships are honest and sincere, without any cheap queerbaiting at all. Due to its cheap exploitative queerbaiting, which feels deceptive - despite getting \"engagement rings\" in 10, their relationship at 11 and 12 was so horrifying formal, without any of the characteristic warmth of newly engaged - it deserves nothing more than a 5. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for goodness sake, please do not mention that the kiss HAD to be censored due to Japanese media laws. I studied media in Japan at one of Tokyo's top universities. There is no such law involved; Shinsekai Yori and No.6 had explicit M/M kisses and they were aired on TV you know. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Once upon a time, there was a young man with a big dream. He idolized a famous Russian skater named \u201cVictor Nikiforov\u201d and hopes to skate on the very same ice as him. Initially, that dream sunk until Yuri was able to impress Victor by imitating his routine at perfection. You can guess what happens next. Victor is so impressed that he decides to be Yuri\u2019s coach at the upcoming Grand Prix Finals.\r\nAs an original TV anime, Yuri on Ice doesn\u2019t suffer from adaptation issues. It\u2019s also directed by Sayo Yamamoto, known for her work Michiko to Hatchin, Lupin the Third: The Woman Called FujikoMine, and Space Dandy. Expectations are considered high with her talent. In fact, this was one of my most hyped show of the season. We don\u2019t get a show about ice skating often so it\u2019s also a breath of fresh air. The fact is, Yuri on Ice initially had a deceptive title for the Western audience. Don\u2019t let that fool you though because Yuri on Ice is a show that goes beyond expectations on the ice rink.\\n\\n\r\nStarting off, the first few episodes introduces our main protagonists. Yuri Katsuki is the 23-year old main male protagonist who has been skating at a young age. Although not hailed as a prodigy, Yuri\u2019s determination and personality earn him praise and friends. His weakness lies with pressure as he is known to mess up at crucial moments. Early on, we can see this easily as Yuri even has self-doubt about his own body. In essence, Yuri is a good natured guy that most of us can relate to and has a lot of potential that is just waiting to be unlocked. That brings in Victor, the key to making Yuri into the next big thing. The 27-year old figure skater has gained international recognition for his talent and won numerous championships. (In fact, 5 consecutive Grand Prix Finals!) As such, you can expect that Victor has countless fans around the world. He\u2019s also Yuri\u2019s idol and him becoming his coach is a dream come true. Victor\u2019s philosophy and key to success is to surprise the audience and the skaters themselves. As he puts it, \u201cDo the opposite of what people expect, that is the only way you will surpass them!\u201d Indeed, Victor can seem like a tough coach but genuinely hopes Yuri will be a success. The duo has some of the best chemistry in the entire series that begins as a professional relationship, to friends, and to even intimacy.\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of figure skating, you can expect a lot of competition. It\u2019s not just from Japan or Russia but also countries from all over the world. The most prominent rival that Yuri faces is a young man from Russia named Yuri Plisetsky (known more as Yurio when he\u2019s in Japan). Unlike Yuri, Yurio is already a hailed as a prodigy with his achievements such as three consecutive wins at the Junior World Championships. His personality is also more of an antithesis compared to Yuri as he is more arrogant and takes pride in his abilities. During his time in the show, we can also draw a parallel similarity between him and Yuri. Both seeks to make big names of themselves in the figure skating world. Both hopes to surpass their own limits and crafting their skating style to perfection. However, what really separates them both is how they seeks to accomplish this. The show chronicles both of their roles as rivals although there are also times when they act more as casual friends. In the meantime, Victor is portrayed as a playboy coach. The way he trains Yuri expresses passion. In fact, Yuri\u2019s skating style and theme revolves around love (or dubbed more as \u201cero\u201d) There\u2019s obvious sexual chemistry between the two that can be interpreted beyond a professional relationship. Anyone can interpret it differently but it\u2019s undeniable that there\u2019s more than them just being student and teacher. As the story unfolds, we can see how their relationship progress both in and out of the ice rink. There\u2019s even physical examples that shows how close they really become later in the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show highlights Yuri, Yurio, and Victor and the main characters, others in the show also should deserve some recognition. Most easily recognized are characters such as Otabek Altin, China famed skater Guang-Hong Ji, Switzerland\u2019s Christopher Giacometti, Canada\u2019s Jean-Jacques Leroy (\u201cJJ\u201d), Thailand\u2019s Phichit Chulanot, Korea\u2019s Seung Gil Lee, United States\u2019 Leo de la Igelsia, among others. Each of these competitors has their own unique talent, skating style, and personality that really brings the show larger than life. I also have to emphasize on some of the unique background storytelling about them in particular with Christopher. JJ\u2019s narcissism is also hard to ignore both in and out of the skating rink. What\u2019s most impressive about these characters is how each of them tries their best to impress the audience and viewers. They all have reasons to win and be the best that they can be.\\n\\n\r\nSo why should you really watch Yuri on Ice? The show has the sports competitive atmosphere but every now and then, the audience will definitely notice the character relationships. It\u2019s very human and can be fierce at times. At its core, Yuri and Victor will draw the most attention. Even at times, the show pushes the BL tones to overdrive. However, that really shouldn\u2019t hold anyone back from watching the show because Yuri on Ice is so much more than about male butts and fan service. As a straight male, I had no problem enjoying this show for what it has to offer. The way it capitalizes on the competition, characters, visual dynamics, themes, and directing is worth every minute. Even the pacing works out quite well as it doesn\u2019t waste much time getting to the point. Comedy is also straightforward and although can get rather awkward at times, it still effectively delivers with character chemistry and reaction faces. (how can anyone not laugh at Yurio\u2019s priceless expressions?!) In retrospect, it\u2019s a show that is here to entertain.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio MAPPA, Yuri on Ice is built on creativity and realism. There\u2019s many sides you can see this but the most prominent elements that makes this show visually stunning is the directing. If you look closely at the show, the human body movements is directed at a very intense level. Every time a skater enters the rink and performs, we can see how the camera angles capture their every movement. Each skater has their own unique style as well and it also spells out their personality with their performances. Quality wise, the show also has strong production from the setting, character designs, to the choreography. Of course, Yuri on Ice isn\u2019t without fan service. Most of it is expressed by playboy coach Victor and the bath scenes. But like I said before, this really shouldn\u2019t hold you back from giving the show a chance.\\n\\n\r\nIf this show wasn\u2019t impressive enough, Yuri on Ice also excels with its soundtrack. The OP song \u201cHistory Maker\u201d by Dean Fujioka is creatively directed with a catchy male tone. In addition, the theme song captures another theme of the show about making memories on the skating rink. The soundtrack and OST during each performance also knows how to impress the audience with by the character movements that supplements with their style. Character voice mannerisms throughout the show is also memorable. Who can forget about Victor\u2019s seductive voice or Yurio\u2019s silly arguments with his Yuri? However, what\u2019s most important is that the soundtrack, voice, and theme songs brings out the best of this show to a realistic level. Even though they are professional skaters, we can see how human they are like any ordinary person as well.\\n\\n\r\nAh Yuri on Ice, a title that isn\u2019t what it seems. The promotional poster is what it is and what you\u2019ll expect. Coming into this show, I had high expectations with the talented staff involved and didn\u2019t have an ounce of disappointment. Perhaps the show isn\u2019t suitable for everyone\u2019s tastes or style but I would recommend it to anyone. I\u2019m not an expert on ice skating myself but watching this show got me genuinely interested in learning more about the sport. This TV anime takes ice skating and character relationships to a new level that is phenomenal. With a hint of \u201csee you next level\u201d for second season, I just hope it gets a continuation to make more history.\\n",

            "content": "While 2013's Free is considered many things but perfect, its role in broadening an avenue in mainstream media for other fanbase-dubbed \"manservice\" works is undeniable, rekindling a bygone genre only previously seen by those who sought it. Yaoi isn't exactly new to the medium, the ever-ceaseless late 2000s cultural shift contributing towards LGBT acceptance's decay from a taboo to mundane facet in media. Just in 2002, t.A.T.u.'s \"All The Things She Said\" music video was banned by several broadcasters and countries for its \"controversial\" content where two women kissed. And today, Miley Cyrus dry humping everything barely merits a shrug from most people. If beingdesensitized has done anything positive to our current society, it's allowing others to express themselves openly without it being harshly shut down by a majority rule, which also carts over to anime... well, kind of. \\n\\n\r\nAnime has always been pushing the boundaries of what's considered acceptable content for decades, striving in its brazen depiction of whatever it chooses to highlight. And no, I'm not just speaking on the mid 2000s boom of lolicon fetishism, I'm talking about all the way back to its humble beginnings, with titles like Belladonna of Sadness making waves in 1973 with its phallic imagery and sexually charged content that could still be seen as provocative, even by today's \"no boundaries\" standards. Content that ultimately went on to inspire the works of many creators, with one notable example being acclaimed director, Kunihiko Ikuhara; a man who's also credited for bringing an artistic touch to themes of sexual liberation through his various hyper-stylized works. Sexual decadence and open expression have always been a part of anime's arsenal, the only real change is how frequently they're being used.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us all the way to Fall season 2016, which alone has 4 to 5 anime titles that either overtly or hinted at homoerotic relations in some way or another, while just a decade ago, receiving 4 to 5 titles with these undercurrents in it within a year's time was considered a milestone. As the 2010s pass, our increasing rate of connectivity, information sharing and understanding of others has diminished miscommunication and heightened acceptance of alternative preferences, sexual or otherwise, resulting in a largely overlooked trivialization of sexual content in anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn some ways, Yuri On Ice could be seen as another byproduct of this trend, if only to a much more abrasive degree, positioning men in suggestive poses while participating in a sport used as a vehicle to portray who they are as people. And where something like Free boasts eye-grabbing swimming sequences, Yuri On Ice capitalizes on ice skating scenes that dwarf the efforts of most animated TV productions. Too bad it isn't enough to distract from the fatal flaws that plague the entire production. You see, Yuri on Ice tries its damnedest to shed light on its cast; a cast that is constantly reduced to doujinshi deviant art-bait clippings despite its honest efforts to mold them into believable personalities.  \\n\\n\r\nBut the question is, does Yuri on Ice justify it? Is there a base purpose for its shounen-ai fluff to be there? I may not be Ikuhara's fan, but there's no denying each of his works deliver provocative, purposeful messages. There's always a constant need to stress freedom of expression with homosexuality itself just being another extension to further emphasize that idea. Self-indulgent at times but justifiable if you care for what he's trying to say. But what about Yuri on Ice? Does it actually justify these men's intimate devotion for each other or is it just trying to fetishize everything to draw out a marketable audience that usually takes in this content at their own leisure? Is there a purpose here outside of being titillating manservice?  What I'm trying to ask in the most ignorant and offensive way possible; is Yuri on Ice just being gay for the sake of being gay? \\n\\n\r\n\u2014 Views episode 6, guy figure skating grabs his ass \"I think I'm gonna come\"\u2014 \\n\\n\r\nWell... I guess that answers my question. \\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice is a harmless fanservice pastime dressed up as a coming-of-age story and cut from the same cloth as any other sports tournament anime, let's stop pretending otherwise. The sooner we kill the pretension that it's something more profound than that, the faster we could sit back and enjoy it for what it is; a fun, easygoing yaoi-bait show with pretty boys trying to balance characterization and fetishism on the same pedestal. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as yaoi-bait entertainment goes, Yuri on Ice is definitely a show stopper when it comes time to take the games to the ice. Brought to life by Mappa, a young studio renowned for their presentation and audiovisual prowess, Yuri on Ice is yet another notch under their belt, boasting ice skating scenes so free-flowing that at times it's easy to believe that they might have been rotoscoped. It's this selling point that got most to give Yuri on Ice the stamp of approval, and understandably so. You don't really get this much effort from an animated TV production on a regular basis. But do I think that's reason enough to warrant all the appraisal it has gathered? Of course not. Those 5 minutes per episode aren't a saving grace for the other 15 minutes, especially when those 15 minutes often spend its time being a mishmash of basic fanfare for literally every sports story ever conceived or a roulette spin of yaoi/comedy for those who care for it. \\n\\n\r\nHalf of the ice skating involves numerous elements, like panning around the competitors in a news camera fashion with occasional audience reaction shots to round it out. When you realize that the actual dances are being overlaid onto different backgrounds with minor, sparse tweaks to delude, you find the show's highlights disappointingly operate on a limited dispensary. They retain their integrity as the show's highlights, but they're not all they're cracked up to be. And honestly, that aspect of it doesn't even bother me since the changes make every encounter fresh. What does, however, is its half commitment towards its characters in one direction or the next.\\n\\n\r\nTrying to build legitimacy for its characters while simultaneously reducing them to objectified pretty boy specimen for the sake of manservice has left Yuri on Ice in a gimmicky realm where all of its achievements could only muster up to being \"that show with the really nice ice skating scene,\" a sentence worse than death for anything looking to stand the test of time. From nobody's fault but its own, this anime has effectively built itself a glass ceiling that it could never surpass. \\n\\n\r\nBut enough of me taking the piss out of this show, let's go over the basics that it chooses to cover and what good it was able to do.\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of competitive figure ice skating, Victor Nikiforov stands as the person to beat, being a beloved and envied figure throughout the sport's industry, as well as a person of inspiration for newcomers trying to break into the field. With an elegant physique that exudes self-confidence and a natural knack for the sport, Victor is the complete package. One of the countless people that adore him is our main character, Yuuri Katsuki, a novice ice skater who idolizes everything about him, to the point where his sole dedication to the sport of figure ice skating derives from the infatuation that he has for the otherworldly reigning champion that's always occupying his TV screen. Through dumb luck and perfect timing, Yuuri is presented with the once in a lifetime opportunity to study under his mentor, the story subsequently dedicating itself to their blossoming relationship as it coincides with the world tournament that wraps everything up within it.\\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice's flamboyant characters are given simple reasons for their ambitions, the show's format complementing its cast; ice skating being both the engine of characterization, every character's idiosyncrasies expanding on their personalities, and a divider granting those characters undisturbed time in the limelight, the story's short, 12-episode tournament format spurring frequent ice skating characterization and an inexorable sense of movement toward a definite finality. Ice skating characterization examples include Chris Giacometti's lowbrow episode 6 exhibition relaying his sexual and methodical confidence in appeasing the audience versus the protagonist's quick flashes that redeem his low sex appeal, Victor's unworried nonchalance regarding his envied, exceptional technical skills, Yuri's eccentric, soft style despite his fiery personality and even minor characters like Jean-Jacques, the show's JoJo stand-in, whose cockiness translates to a showboating spectacle. The theatrics, choice of techniques, tight turns, and loose gesture all coalesce into a final form that define who that person is on and off the ice rink\u2014this characterization the show's biggest strength.\\n\\n\r\nAnd perhaps this very thoughtful decision to characterize the characters' personalities is also the reason I find the whole thing to be a waste. Because despite itself, Yuri on Ice was a show that was never meant to appeal to me. So where I would usually outright dismiss something like this, it just so happens that there were nuggets of detail within it that I found appealing. An appeal that required me to drudge through content that I couldn't psych myself into caring for no matter how hard I tried. \\n\\n\r\nAnd really, it didn't have to do much to make me like it, just either muffle the shounen-ai content down to a realistic degree or stop dancing around the idea and just fully embrace it. The show is suggestive of the possibility of there being an actual sexual interest between the main leads but at the same time, it only cock-teases this idea to maintain the illusion of the fiction it wants to sell. And once again, excuse my politically incorrect wording but if you're going to be gay, be all the way gay goddammit. Stop pussyfooting around. I don't need some full blown orgy like Sausage Party's celebratory ending, all I want is a clear yes or no for where they stand, none of this \"just gay enough\" gray area. Is it so hard for a male homosexual relationship to be taken seriously for once? \\n\\n\r\nNow with all that being said, is Yuri on Ice worth the watch? Yes, but only if you have nothing else in your catalog. As it stands, it's not something I see any need to jump into. Yuri on Ice is that intermediary show that you pick up to pass the time on your way on to better ones. What it has that works is its wonderful ice skating scenes and the usage of it to inform the audience of who the characters are, as for everything else, it's either standard for its genre or serviceable to a very niche market.",

That\u2019s what it\u2019s listed as, that\u2019s what it was first promoted as, and it\u2019s how I would believe the series creators wish it to be seen. But Yuri!!! on Ice is so much more than just a sports anime. If you\u2019ve been anywhere around the anime crowd online (or even out of it, sometimes) in the past twelve weeks, then you\u2019ve probably heard about the \u201cgay figure skating anime\u201d of the season.\r\nThe biggest question I\u2019ve seen around is, \u201cwhat\u2019s so good about it?\u201d It\u2019s just gay. It\u2019s just pandering to fans. It\u2019s just this, just that. So it\u2019sa lot of things. Here are some of them.\\n\r\n(NOTE: no massive spoilers but the nature of the relationship between Viktor and Yuuri does get touched on briefly.)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\n(for a summary of points skip to TL;DR)\\n\r\nYuri on Ice features a plot that is, to me, fresh and unique for a series about sports.\\n\r\nFrom the get-go what sets it apart from your typical sports anime is clear. To start with, our main cast is not in high school. Although one character in the trio is a teenager (he\u2019s 15, to be precise), the main focus is on our protagonist and his coach, who are 23 and 27 respectively. Having mature, full-grown adults lead the narrative means that there are a lot of stereotypical conflicts that can be avoided, and it gives the show a different flavor. There\u2019s no \u201cwhat to do after graduation\u201d or \u201cmy favorite senior is leaving\u201d subplot, no \u201cwe\u2019re young and stupid and we\u2019ll do anything to win\u201d motivating factor- the tone of the series is a lot more realistic and the story itself is grounded by it.\\n\r\nThe other distinguishing factor is, our main character isn\u2019t inexperienced or \u201cbad\u201d at his sport. Despite what his personal narration might have us believe, he\u2019s essentially Japan\u2019s ace in figure skating, and talented enough to make it to the world Grand Prix final by himself. He\u2019s not learning figure skating over from scratch - he\u2019s learning what he loves about it, and why he skates.\\n\r\nMoving on to the matter of the plot, we\u2019re given a scenario where someone has fallen out of the spotlight, hit a road bump in the journey of life. Katsuki Yuuri is 23 and good at what he does but he\u2019s missing something. He\u2019s not confident. Yuri on Ice is about how he finds that something, finds the will and wish to keep fighting. In that way, it\u2019s the best kind of \u201cmotivational story\u201d, the sort that says you don\u2019t just have one shot at life when you\u2019re a teenager and ready to Take On The World, that says you can turn things around at any time.\\n\r\nYuri on Ice encompasses various themes, such as love (in all its shapes and forms) and life (how to live it, how to love it). It also embodies key messages which I think are highly relevant to our modern world, such as how life doesn\u2019t end after you pass your teen years and hit your twenties, or that you are more than your fears and anxieties. There\u2019s always a second chance. In that way this series carries a message that is sure to instill in its viewers some hope for themselves. It\u2019s riveting, optimistic, and endearing, while maintaining a mature, fairly objective perspective.\\n\r\nIn terms of actual plot there\u2019s not much I can say for fear of ruining the story, but one thing I have to commend is how a certain reveal in the later half of the series becomes a massive plot point that changes our perception of one very special main character. This isn\u2019t a story that\u2019s predictable by any means. Just like Viktor Nikiforov, who lives to surprise his audience, it seems Kubo (the series\u2019 original creator), too, loves taking her viewers by surprise. Yuri on Ice is unpredictable up until the very last moment, and that makes it an exciting experience for first-time viewers. And while unpredictable, it also makes heavy use of foreshadowing to drop plot points and details that might confuse you at first, but all make sense when given context in later episodes. Rewatching the series is another experience in itself because you do it in an almost entirely different light.\\n\r\nBut I haven\u2019t addressed the elephant in the room yet, have I?\\n\r\nYuri on Ice is gay. Yes. It\u2019s gay as hell but it\u2019s also subtly gay, quietly gay, it\u2019s gay without it being the main point of the story, it\u2019s gay but not once does it allow the queerness of its characters to define itself. You\u2019re given a romance between two males that isn\u2019t fetishized, exploited, mistreated. It\u2019s a romance that\u2019s written with respect, and I have to commend Kubo for that. There is a turning point near the middle of the series that really spells things out for you, and after that every interaction between the two characters involved is painted with love, care, and adoration. The nature of their relationship is never outright stated in-series, yet it\u2019s clear as day how they feel for each other.\\n\r\n(Bonus: Kubo herself stated indirectly through a tweet on her official twitter account that Yuri on Ice is, basically, a world without homophobia. The love portrayed here is organic, normalized, and treated with respect. It\u2019s a beautiful thing.)\\n\r\nWhich brings me to another point about the storytelling in Yuri on Jce. If you grew up used to western media and their habit of favoring straightforwardness over subtlety, then Yuri on Ice might strike you as funny. They never say they\u2019re in love! So who\u2019s to say they really are? That argument could be valid in a show produced in the west, but Yuri on Ice is a piece of eastern media. Subtlety is the name of the game here. But fear not, it still delivers when we need it to, and the little quirks and affectionate interactions it divulges are priceless and wonderful.\\n\r\nOn the whole, the pacing for the series may seem a bit fast at times, but given that it\u2019s a one-cour series with such high ambitions I think it\u2019s to be expected. Perhaps with more episodes we could\u2019ve had more time to develop our side characters. Perhaps with more episodes we could have more scenes off the ice. But MAPPA wasn\u2019t given that liberty, and I think they made the best of what they had. Apart from slight pacing issues I think Yuri on Ice\u2019s story is brilliantly constructed, unique, and heartfelt. It\u2019s imbued with positivity without being cheesy or overbearing, and remains mostly grounded in reality. While the story is mostly serious, it gives us moments of pure comedic gold at times and manages to jump from one atmospheric moment to another without much of a problem. Watching every episode is an emotional rollercoaster - the best kind where you don\u2019t fall off and the loops don\u2019t make you feel sick but give you a nice, heady rush.\\n\r\nYuri on Ice is a narrative that manages to be completely sound, utilize foreshadowing effectively, and draw parallels between moments in older episodes and newer ones. The ending, without spoiling anything, manages to be completely satisfying while thoroughly offensive at the same time because of how good it is. Everything comes full circle. It does everything in the book of Good Narratives right. It\u2019s an alarming feat for a one-cour original anime series.\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nYuri on Ice is a sports anime that transcends the boundaries of sports anime with a unique new narrative and organic, character-driven conflict. It balances out comedy and serious moments with careful maneuvering of scenes and plot points, and features a gay romance that doesn\u2019t override the main narrative but rather becomes part of it. The themes of the series are uplifting, meaningful, and carefully woven into its plot. Overall, it\u2019s very well-written and definitely worthy of a 10 in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nYuri on Ice\u2019s animation in episode 1 is probably one of the most gorgeous things I\u2019ve ever laid my eyes on. Of course, that\u2019s because it\u2019s the first episode, but we can, for the most part, apply that notion to every frame after that for the next 11 episodes.\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to address the art and animation in Yuri on Ice in two separate categories: general art and animation, and skating art and animation.\\n\r\nFirst, as Yuri on Ice is an ice skating anime, naturally a lot of screentime is devoted to elaborate skating choreography and routines. Stay Close To Me is easily the best-animated, and if you\u2019re looking for something that properly represents what Yuri on Ice as an aesthetic piece of art is, then that performance in episode 1 is definitely the way to go. However, the quality of skating segments does falter sometimes as the series continues.\\n\r\nBut wait! Yuri on Ice isn\u2019t a Dreamworks Animation production with a USD 160,000,000 production budget. In fact, it\u2019s got a budget of perhaps USD 1,500,000, which is straight up 1% of what western blockbuster animation movies get. Now, add on the fact that figure skating is a sport where you\u2019re constantly moving, where you\u2019re basically dancing on ice - there\u2019s a lot more nuance the animators had to capture in their animation than, say, a jump for a smash-hit in badminton or a dash across the court in basketball. So the characters may have been off-model at times, so the camera pans might have come off as flat after a while- trust me when I tell you that Yuri on Ice delivers where it really, really needs to. It delivers.\\n\r\nMoving on, let\u2019s talk about general animation. Off the ice, the characters are generally well-animated and detail is given where it\u2019s needed. The series also plays with a lot of different lightings, using contrasting cool and warm color palettes generously to dictate the feel of a particular scene. Due attention is given to close-ups; you can always tell when a scene is important because of the sheer amount of effort that goes into animating every minute detail.\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not just generic detailing, you can tell they\u2019ve really thought things through and settled on what they want to emphasize in certain scenes. It\u2019s the little things, like the tremble of a hand, the glint of metal, the soft shine and faint pink tinge of lips in motion, that tell you that these animators care about what they\u2019re creating. Yuri on Ice is a series animated with love.\\n\r\nI\u2019m giving it a 9 in this category.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Yuri on ice is great. It features a wild array of instruments, music genres, and styles. I'm not an expert in music, but considering they had to have upwards of twenty, thirty individual songs made for the routines alone, each one is pretty well produced. If you include the simple, lilting piano OSTs that play during emotional scenes, then you're good to go on a trip that will bring you to tears. Either way, you're bound to end up with a favorite or two at the end of it all.\\n\r\nThat aside, for the sound effects that came from skating they recorded the sound of the choreographer they worked with\u2019s skating, so each scrape of the blade on ice, each sharp thud with a land, all of these are almost frightfully real.\\n\r\nThe tight sound effects and wonderful OSTs, combined with tasteful timing and appropriate music choices, add to the immersive experience of watching Yuri on ice. Sound gets a 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nSee: Katsuki Yuuri.\\n\r\n10/10.\\n\r\n\u2014is what I\u2019d like to say, but I\u2019m obligated to go in-depth into things, so I'll do that.\\n\r\nThe characters in Yuri on Ice may seem like cookie-cutter models at first, but as the story unfolds you learn more and more about their personalities and motivations, and (cliche though it sounds) they really will surprise you. Particularly Katsuki Yuuri, who is, I would venture to say, the most well-developed, realistic, and sympathetic character I\u2019ve seen in recent years. Don\u2019t let his weak narration in episode 1 fool you - you\u2019re in for a wild ride with him as the protagonist of the series.\\n\r\nWhile its characters have their fair share of strengths and flaws, Kubo takes it a step beyond so as to hint at what exactly led them to be the way they are today. Everything is deceptively simple on the surface and deep as Mariana\u2019s Trench when you look closer. I think what really makes these characters work is that they\u2019re genuine. They\u2019re real. Katsuki Yuuri may have anxiety, but he hates losing. He\u2019s headstrong. He\u2019s bad at dealing with fans. Viktor Nikiforov may have lost his way in life but he\u2019s still fighting, he\u2019ll still do things on a whim and try his hand at everything and anything. He has a dog. The dog is his best friend. He took the dog with him when he leaves on that whim.\\n\r\nOur main cast is lovable, but the side characters, too, get far more development than you would expect from a one-cour anime. Yuri on Ice treats every character with respect, with love, as though each one deserves all the time on screen in the world (though they don\u2019t get it).\\n\r\nBeing an anime about the international figure skating scene, we\u2019re introduced to a lot of characters from different countries. None of them fall into the pitfalls of stereotyping by nationality, thankfully, and they\u2019re all lovable and have their own quirks and personalities. When the series hits its peak, we also learn that they have their own motivations for winning. You can tell that Kubo hasn\u2019t slacked on anything, not even with writing so-called minor characters.\\n\r\nOf course, when we put this all together, the dynamic between everyone is sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartwarming. Yuri on Ice succeeds here by making the rivalries between everyone friendly rather than toxic. There\u2019s no murderous subplot or decade-long grudge hiding under some amicable smile. They\u2019re just a bunch of teens, young adults, adults, that want to win, but want to stay friends through it all. The consistently supportive atmosphere means things almost never turn sour between anyone (though for story\u2019s sake we do get to see some conflict break out between our main cast), and we can enjoy the series the way it is without unnecessary drama or conflict.\\n\r\nTo put it one way, Yuri on Ice has no antagonist, but it still manages itself so well because Katsuki Yuuri is his own antagonist. He is his biggest hurdle. He is what\u2019s holding him back. And a lot of conflict stems from how he views himself and those around him, which is not only a very organic way to create character-based conflict, but also painful to watch, because Yuuri is painfully relatable to almost everyone. He\u2019s an incredible character, and the growth he sustains throughout these twelve episodes is awe-inspiring.\\n\r\nOf course, not forgetting our world champion Viktor Nikiforov! He\u2019s the hot foreigner who is s whimsical and smooth and, well, hot. But he\u2019s a lot more than just hot, as the story eventually reveals. Viktor\u2019s growth is shown in a more quiet, subtle way than Yuuri\u2019s, but it still happens, and the landmarks for it are Big. He\u2019s also another breaker of anime character molds, though because his growth is tied into the narrative I can\u2019t say much on the specifics.\\n\r\nIn short, Yuri on Ice\u2019s characters are genuine, relatable, and crafted with love and care. While being a diverse group of people, they avoid both racial and general anime stereotypes, and for the main cast great care is put into the development of their multi-faceted persons. These are not flat characters, they are the sum of their experiences and memories and imperfections. Also, Katsuki Yuuri should win an award. Some kind of award. Anything\u2019s good.\\n\r\nSo, a 10 here, too.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI have not followed an anime week-by-week through its airing season since Kekkai Sensen happened, and even then sometimes I forgot that the subs were out and would watch it two or three days later. Every night for ten weeks now I have stayed up until 4 a.m. to catch the live broadcast of Yuri!!! On ICE. It\u2019s ridiculous how much this show has affected me. It\u2019s made my life 300 times better and ruined me. To see a world where homophobia doesn\u2019t exist, where mental illness is treated as something normal, and not a weakness, is something I never thought I\u2019d see in an anime in my life. Kubo Mitsurou is a blessing to the world.\\n\r\nHow could I give this anything but a full 10/10? I\u2019d be lying if I cut the score any lower than that.\\n\\n\r\n(BONUS- messages Yuri on Ice carries with it because I\u2019m a sap:\\n\r\n-you are more than your mental illness\\n\r\n-your failures do not define you\\n\r\n-it\u2019s never too late to pursue your dreams and turn things around, whether you\u2019re 15, 25, or 50\\n\r\n-love does not complete you. It makes you a better whole\\n\r\n-true love exists\\n\r\n-there is a place you can\u2019t reach unless you have a dream too large to bear alone)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nYuri on Ice\u2019s opening theme, History Maker, is a more accurate summary of the series than I could ever come up with myself. It\u2019s really made history, in so many ways that I couldn\u2019t possibly list them all at once. It\u2019s taken what might be considered a niche sport and turned it into something wonderful and beautiful and, importantly enough, possible to appreciate for a bunch of anime-watching folks that probably were just looking for a good time.\\n\r\nThis is a review, but it\u2019s also a request. If you\u2019re here, on this page, reading this right now, and you\u2019re sitting on the fence with the spikes digging into your butt, wondering, \u201cshould I watch Yuri on Ice?\u201d then I implore you with all my heart to give it a chance. It\u2019s so much more than what the horrible people who call it shameless pandering and fanservice will ever be able to understand. The reviews here are not an accurate reflection of how the fans of Yuri on Ice feel about the series as a whole, and I am willing to bet majority of those who laughed at it for being \u201cyaoi\u201d have seen exactly three and a half seconds of the first episode.\\n\r\nThis series is a work of art. It saved 2016.\\n\r\nSee, Yuri on Ice is that best friend you never knew you had. You\u2019ve been looking for them all along, you just never knew it.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "People who do not like Yuuri!!! on Ice have obviously missed the point of the series.\r\nYOI is phenomenal. It shows, doesn't tell. The characters are complex and deep, realistic, and the narrative touches on issues such as anxiety and depression, but only if you are paying attention.\r\nYou see, this is not a series for those who are expecting a casual watch. This is a series for those who tend to analyze, and think deeper. I REPEAT: THIS IS A STORY FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO ANALYZE AND THINK DEEPLY. If you want a series where the answers are handed to you, THIS IS NOT IT.It is a narrative where a lot of things are supposed to be connected by the viewer. They will not tell you Yuuri has an anxiety disorder. The will not tell you that Viktor was battling major depression. They will not tell you why Yurio wants to beat Yuuri so bad. They give you clues and lead you there, but connecting the dots and knowing what is happening is YOUR responsibility, and much like a lot of Eastern media it is not meant to be viewed through a Western lens.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, people will argue that a series SHOULD tell you things. And it does. Yuuri on Ice tells us Viktor Nikiforov is a well accomplished figure skater, yet he was willing to give it all up in an instant, in any way, to get out of it. We know that Yuuri Katsuki panics on the ice and the things he says don't quite add up to the things we see. We know that Yuri Plisetsky is a hot headed, young, talented skater who can't seem to grasp the notion of unconditional love. Why? Sometimes you get straightforward answers (i.e. the amazing plot twist in episode 10) yet sometimes bits and pieces are sprinkled within different episodes. Sometimes you will learn something, which makes information from multiple episodes ago make a lot more sense. This series is MEANT to be looked at from every angle to understand characters ambitions, thoughts, actions. Just like real life. And it's GOOD that way. That is WHY it's so amazing. Rarely is there a series where I am excited for the next, next, next episode because I want to understand the characters more. Because I want to know what the motivation for this decision was. Just like in real life, you do not know everything right off the bat. You have to be patient and attentive, and you are rewarded for it.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll see I rated this series a 10, and that's because it truly is a masterpiece. There will never be any series that surpasses YOI. I will never be satisfied with another piece of media as much as I was with this one. I will never be as excited weekly for another show to come out. I will be hard pressed to find better, more fleshed out and complex and realistic characters than I did here. There is nothing about Yuuri on Ice that I do not adore. The music, the animation, the characters, the kinds of love shown throughout the series, everything. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't want to take the time to have a deeper understanding of the series, then this is not a show for you. But if you're willing to pay attention, then you will be rewarded with likely the best series of this decade. And this isn't an over exaggeration; I truly believe nothing will be better than Yuuri on Ice for a very, very long time.",

            "content": "WARNING: This review contains (some) spoiler elements \u2014 without which the problematic aspects of the show could not possibly be discussed \u2014 and makes use of language that is not entirely PG-13.\r\nProceed at your own risk.\u00a0\r\n---------------\r\nAhh, Yuri!!! on ICE. Possibly the highest-praised, most-watched anime of this season.\r\nSo popular it is, I\u2019ve had to blacklist like eight different tags on tumblr to spare my eyes of it. This thing is fucking everywhere. And don\u2019t get me wrong, its popularity is not the problem here; hell, I was expecting to be right aboard the bandwagon, right at the front, driving the goddamn train.\r\nWhen I made my list\u00a0forstuff I\u2019ll chew this season, it was right at the top in terms of anticipation; from the synopsis alone, it sounded exactly like my kind of thing \u2014 figure skating is an old love of mine, and the promise of beautiful animation drew me right in. (Though IRL I prefer watching female figure-skaters, it\u2019s still a novel thing in anime, and, well. You take what you can. Discounting Onna\u2019s brief figure skating scene in Death Parade, and maybe some romantic \u201clet\u2019s go skating\u201d type of dates in shoujo, I legitimately cannot remember seeing it elsewhere off the top of my head.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd I tried to stay optimistic about it. An optimism that lasted about two episodes, until the crass, bleak humor (weight jokes, really? frig right off, mate) and the wildly fluctuating quality of animation began to make it jet-pack right outta this mess.\\n\\n\r\nLittle did I know, those two things would end up being the more minor of my issues with the show.\\n\\n\r\n---------------\\n\\n\r\nSTORY & CHARACTERS \u300c 1 / 10 \u300d\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t let the synopsis fool you; this is not an enjoyable tale of sportsmanship and high-voltage rivalries that make sparks fly on the rink. Russian Yuri gives up on winning back Victor\u2019s tutelage before the season is even half through (and he never had it to begin with, turns out).\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nEven if that doesn\u2019t particularly bother you (and you\u2019re here just for the hot guys and the homoerotic subtext that \u201cisn\u2019t subtext at all\u201d), the whole thing is extremely ill-paced: important plot (ha, plot. what plot?) elements are only mentioned as an \u201cOh, yeah, by the way---\u201d kind of afterthought, while moments which are supposed to be either tense / suspenseful or dramatic fall flat. It\u2019s very shoddy work, and while I was still willing to forgive it, the show did two things: fucked up in the animation department, and then the...\u201dromance\u201d happened.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s be very clear on one thing here: if you\u2019re straight, you write gay relationships \u2014 especially those involving characters of the sex opposite yours \u2014 at your own risk.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nBecause 99% of the time you will fail, and you will fail hard.\\n\\n\r\nPeople like to praise the show for being \u201cprogressive\u201d (and about a bajillion other terms that mean the same thing and are mindlessly thrown around) in including (and centering its focus on) a canonically gay, canonically engaged / soon to be married couple, they fail to recognize (or willfully ignore, and I\u2019m not sure which is worse) the problems with Victor and Y\u016bri\u2019s relationship. In plain English: this is a gay couple written by a straight woman. A gay MALE couple which has your stereotypical heterosexual dynamics.\\n\\n\r\nI feel the need to stress this.\\n\\n\r\nStereotypical. Heterosexual. Dynamics.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, despite what you\u2019d think, relationships between people of the same sex don\u2019t work the way stereotypical straight ones do. Hell, most healthy relationships of any kind don\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t work like that. It\u2019s a common misconception that gay people mimic straight ones and it bugs the shit out of me. Most depictions in media (which are not written by actual gay people, that is) give in to this misconception, and from thereon it becomes clear at who the product is aimed at. A little like lesbian porn, if you will.\\n\\n\r\n(Hint: it ain\u2019t for the lesbians!)\\n\\n\r\nLet me put it another way: this is little more than veiled yaoi, and it\u2019s not particularly tasteful yaoi at that.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does Y\u016bri refer to himself as the \u201cwoman\u201d who seduces the playboy, they even fit your standard seme/uke stereotypes, with Victor being a hetare/wanko seme (a devoted loser, basically) dressed as a \u201ccool\u201d type at first glance, and Y\u016bri being the sasoi (seductive) uke dressed in an \u201ceveryman\u201d type\u2019s clothes. Hell, these combinations of character types, as well as the dynamic between them, literally form one of the two most basic, stereotypical types of  relationship found in the genre.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAnd, you know, this would\u2019ve been less of a problem if at least the characters were interesting beyond this. It wouldn\u2019t have made it forgivable \u2014 I hold the opinion that you should be honest about what you do and especially about what you write, and trying to sell me yaoi labeled as a \u201cgood romance\u201d is a filthy, filthy lie \u2014 but it would\u2019ve made it bearable. Perhaps even slightly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the characters weren\u2019t interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s like the author opened up tvtropes, cracked her knuckles, and set about finding and writing the most basic characters she could, structuring each of them around a particular trope or \u201ctype\u201d. Everyone in this show is flat, and I don\u2019t mean in terms of breast size. There\u2019s no character development, either, despite what some fans of it will try to tell you (though this doesn\u2019t particularly bother me in a show, to be honest, so this at least is a neutral point in my book); it\u2019s all one big onion, making me more frustrated with every layer I peel and put aside.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a parade of stereotypes, flattened to absolute thinness.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy, what little of it is there, is...lackluster. Downright terrible at times, really. And not in a good, shitty pun kind of way. Likewise for the dramatic moments, which manage to be boring rather than induce an \u201coh no my babies!\u201d reaction.\\n\\n\r\n---------------\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION \u300c 2 / 10 \u300d\\n\\n\r\nOh, god, where do I even begin.\\n\\n\r\nLook, I know I cannot expect ridiculously HQ animation in every episode of an anime, not every studio is ufotable \u2014 who at this point can probably open their own damn bank \u2014 but if you know your budget is not that large, you generally do two things: conserve it so it\u2019s steady throughout and bring out the big guns on moments that truly matter. You\u2019d think those moments would be the skating montages and maybe the Big Damn Kiss moment, but...they aren\u2019t. I mean the kiss itself was decently animated, if cowardly camouflaged, but the skating montages? No. Instead we got HQ animations of Victor\u2019s (admittedly shapely) butt.\\n\\n\r\nWonderful.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not even that big of a loss, in retrospect, which is where another big problem arises: whoever choreographed and thought up these routines did a very shitty job. Sorry not sorry about the language but, honestly, subtlety can\u2019t convey how bummed I am about this. Part of me was glad to not see this much bad choreography in HQ, even though that would probably have helped it be at least somewhat better.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering they got an actual former figure skater in on the job, this is a huge let-down.\\n\\n\r\nThe moves are repetitive, and the fact that frequently the animation wasn\u2019t at least half as good as it could\u2019ve been, made pretty much every skating montage \u2014 except perhaps the one Y\u016bri does when copying Victor\u2019s old routine, which I begrudgingly admit was nice \u2014 extremely disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the character designs are poorly done (beyond every character fitting a certain Character Type\u2122, so that the myriad of fangirls can Pick A Favorite \u2014 which is unimaginative, but not bad by itself). I expect a certain flamboyance and creativity when it comes to figure skating, but here the costumes just ended up looking either badly sewn-together or silly, the kind of thing a kid would wear for Halloween, or both. Kitschy, for all its oddities, is not a word I generally associate with the sport. And it\u2019s one that I frankly wish I don\u2019t have to associate with it ever again.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of consistency in animation, the bad choreography, the designs that alternate between ridiculous and boring, make for an absolute cringe-fest. Surprising, considering the director, but I guess all of us have bad days.\\n\\n\r\n---------------\\n\\n\r\nSOUND \u300c 5 / 10 \u300d\\n\\n\r\nThe voice cast was...nice, I suppose (I don\u2019t remember anyone\u2019s VA but Victor\u2019s, and that\u2019s because I\u2019m a fan of Junichi Suwabe). The soundtrack on the other hand is extremely forgettable \u2014 I genuinely only remember the opening, and even that very vaguely; I didn\u2019t particularly like it and thus tended to skip past \u2014 so I cannot pronounce myself there. Generally sound doesn\u2019t matter much to me past the VAs\u2019 performances, as this makes for a huge part of the characters, but in a show that is (supposedly) about figure skating, this did come off as something of a disappointment. Music should complement a routine, even add to it, but here it did a big whoop of nothing.\\n\\n\r\n---------------\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT \u300c 1 / 10 \u300d\\n\\n\r\nIf it wasn\u2019t clear enough \u2014 I did not enjoy this. With every new episode I felt my horror increase as the show kept getting worse while at the same time somehow amassing an even bigger fanbase and even more praise it was, in my opinion, deeply undeserving of.\\n\\n\r\nYuri!!! on ICE is not a good anime. It\u2019s not even a mediocre one. It\u2019s terrible, even if only because it tries to pretend it\u2019s something it\u2019s not: an effort to be inclusive. I\u2019d call SJW bullshit on this, had it really been aimed at actual gay people and not at the hordes of gullible fangirls who want to feel good about their fetishization of homosexuality, who have found in this series a virtual gold mine that they can point at and present as proof they \u201csupport the gays\u201d when confronted or otherwise called out.\\n\\n\r\nActually, you know what, I\u2019m gonna call SJW bullshit on it anyway. Many of its fans, from what I\u2019ve seen, tend to fall into the category of straw, third-wave feminists. The author (Kubo) strikes me as one, too.\\n\\n\r\n---------------\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL \u300c 2 / 10 \u300d\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d sooner shoot myself in the foot than go near this again. I\u2019m probably going to eat my pride and beat my completion OCD into submission when the second season will air. And it will air, don\u2019t doubt it \u2014 this has birthed a franchise that has the potential to become more milkable than SAO.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nI guess there\u2019s some sort of sweet, vicious sense of retribution in the capitalization off of its thirsty fans (anything can become popular if there\u2019s a plain enough self-insertable MC or the chance of two guys touching dicks \u2014 and YOI manages to deliver both, as switching Y\u016bri\u2019s gender does fuck-all to change the story, so really, in a sense it\u2019s a show for everyone), but it\u2019s a small comfort that cannot wash out the bad taste I\u2019ve been left with.",

            "content": "Pardon any typos below. If you're one that appreciates character development, you'll find yourself relating to many characters in the show.\r\nYuri!! on Ice is a beautiful and moving story with a main character that's capable of relating to anybody and everybody in the slightest.\r\nHe's unique in that he he showcases vulnerability and holds doubts about his abilities to achieve gold medal. He's not perfect and he knows it. He holds doubts, but still keeps his determination (although not at first). \r\nWith the help of establishing an intimate relationship with Victor, it was refreshing to see Yuuri develop more interpersonal relationships with his opponents alongside strengtheninghimself on the intrapersonal level.\\n\\n\r\nI appreciate how fleshed out the characters were (main and minors), it was consistent in foiling/juxtaposing against the healthy relationship between Yuuri and Victor. Each opponent had a unique character to them as well as their own strengths and weaknesses which kind of shines light on what Yuuri himself needs to hone in.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it's good and the animations are your standard animation. They emphasizes more detail in more significant scenes but the level of detail is inconsistent when it comes to performances. It can be choppy and awkward but it's not horrific.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few iconic sounds in here (other than the OP and ED) and most of the soundtracks for the main characters are accompanied by their own personal taste and compliments their personalities. Perhaps the most beautiful track is Yuuri's free-skate (also titled \"Yuri on Ice\")\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the storyline, the anime is highly enjoyable and I appreciate the production's take on portraying intimate and mutual love. The love portrayed in the anime is multi-dimensional (friendship, mentorship, romance, companionship, and more). Yes, one can say that his anime is very gay, but it does so without attaching that \"shounen-ai\" tag to normalize gay/bi characters/relationships or at least mutual relationships. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I liked this anime because the characters and relationship dynamics are fun. The story is inspiring and holds sentiment that makes you connect with the emotions of the characters. The characters are hard to dislike as each have their individual strengths and weaknesses (all of them are highly commendable). There is a variety of music that goes from fun-loving to intense and gorgeous. I highly recommend anyone to watch this anime.",

            "content": "The most difficult challenge a reviewer faces when writing about this show is choosing if it should be initially referred to as \"Disappointment!!! on Ice\" or \"Queerbait!!! on Ice\". Both names are equally hard-earned and both unfortunately represent it well.\r\nBut how such a promising show ended up being so underwhelming? It has an interesting premise, very appealing character designs, previews suggested strong visual direction and great sports scenes combined with a quality soundtrack. The first two episodes were perfectly watchable. What went wrong? Well, honestly, quite much.\r\nFirstly - Yuri on Ice is surprisingly cartoonish - it heavily relies on exaggerated goofiness and chibi faces. Itdefinitely isn't a serious sports drama - its general tone is rather light-hearted and inconsequential. In itself it isn't anything wrong (although I admit it isn't what I expected), but it heavily damages its ability to create tension. And tension is something which this show sorely lacks - during ice skating performances there wasn't a single moment I felt on the edge of my seat, feeling pressure of important things being at stake. So I felt exactly the opposite one should feel watching well-executed sports anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also significantly struggles in the writing department - the script seems devoid of ideas of how to outline key events and where to go with them. It's also very repetitive - the typical episode goes as following: someone does a skating program (with all important points of it explicitly explained to us in an off-screen commentary), he is scored and then the show proceeds to the next skating program. Repeat several times. Most of events, characters backstories and development are narrated to the audience by internal monologues of skaters during those programs. It comes off jarringly unskillful. All the more the show has a penchant for introducing number of new skaters per episode, telling their stories only during their skating programs, and forgetting about them the moment they get the score. As a result the show is extremely unfocused. It jumps between skater to skater, with little connection to the main narrative, as if it wanted to fill up the time the writer had no idea how to spend better. If we combine that with questionable quality of individual lines, the fact most of side-skaters are boring and with the annoying tendency of the show to reiterate the same points over and over again we have to come to a sad conclusion: the writing is bad.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the second episode the anime doesn't excel in animation either. Quality takes a big hit, ice skating programs lack frames and key animator's polish. It makes one wonder even more strongly why this show decided to include so many of them. The soundtrack helps to save the situation a little - some of those skating programs are still quite pleasing too watch - but it's by no means enough.\\n\\n\r\nTHE NEXT PARAGRAPHS CONTAIN VAGUE SPOILERS\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally we've come to the show's main selling point - M x M romance(?). What this show plays with its main pairing is probably the most self-aware, obnoxious and dishonest baiting game I've ever seen in the medium - the anime is constantly devising the scenes building up a serious, honest, for my taste even tad too conventional, romantic relationship between two guys. But all of that in either a tongue-in-cheek or very fuzzy way. It does it so intensely at the end of the show the main pairing is almost undeniable, but at the same time as a relationship it remains totally ambiguous.\\n\\n\r\nUsually I don't mind ambiguous relationships in anime that much, I even frequently find them offering interesting storyline perspectives. Not in the case of Yuri on Ice though - this show suggests non-straight relationship in so utterly unsubtle ways they make sense narratively only if they lead to a conventional and clear romantic pairing. They don't. As a result the show ends up being extremely disingenuous and deserves only to be booed off for that.\\n\\n\r\nEven ignoring the above dishonesty the show still isn't a particularly good romance - it spends too much of its energy on setting up those little moments suggesting (never confirming!) the characters are in love to accurately capture the magic and emotion between too people drawn to each other. Since it also isn't a good sports show nor a character drama it ultimately isn't worth even a tenth of the hype it currently gets. The show might not be atrociously bad, there were clearly refreshing and interesting ideas behind it. But they were not enough.\\n\\n\r\nAll the more it doesn't really end conclusively - it only offers more promises and tells us we should wait for them to be delivered in the second season. I am not forcing anybody to do the same, but personally I'm not falling into that trap again.",

I don't see how this should be rated so high otherwise.\r\nViktor indeed threw/temporarily stopped his career for Yuuri but that doesn't point to how big-hearted/grand act/in love he is with the guy (if in the first place they ever showed Viktor suffering from having withdrawn temporarily from his career). Viktor along with Phichit are simple creatures who take delight in life -- and this if anything really illustrated the fact for me.\r\nPlease don't be quick to throw story artistry away? Spoilers- if Yuuri's and Viktor's narration in ep 1 and ep 10 respectively didn't show you how dirt poor the production team treats storytelling as an art I don't know what might. They are very literally telling you word for word what is happening in their story. It's so blatant you can even miss the fact you're being spoonfed. They don't care about storytelling. YOI just wants to show you how enjoyable and recreational life can be. Viktor can probably just narrate \"And that's how I met the Japanese beauty, Katsuki Yuuri, and came to be engaged with him. Love, life and peace.\" and fandom will still be screaming their lungs out w/o prior context. What...\\n\\n\r\nAs some of the reviewers have put it, Yuuri's character is a joke. A complete mess. Know why? He was only born to fulfill the role of guy lover. Have we ever heard of what he thinks about ice skating w/o bringing Viktor not even seconds into his monologue? You can be influenced, sure, but if *every* monologue winds up being about Viktor I think we've got another problem coming...\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing worthy of praise is how we're missing Yuuri's actual position in the story - which we automatically assume we aren't, bc he's the protag and anything he sees is by default true. We're misled into thinking he's a rather lousy and cowardly skater but each and every ep reveals otherwise. He's got decent to great skills and if ep 10 revealed anything he's not the persona that's been presented to us on screen. Though that still doesn't make his characterization any less confusing (or maybe he just isn't thinking about anything at all) except accepting love and life as it comes? Really, YOI is ultra bland. If you walk the streets today or sit in a cafe you can see the same thing (and that's everything) that's happening in YOI. People, connections, fun, laughter.\\n\\n\r\nIt can appear to be great on the surface for portraying rl well but you guys are losing a lot of focus. Character development, plot, anguish with the sports -- there's absolutely nothing going on in YOI other than a bunch of ppl getting to enjoy their lives. It's no different from Tamako Market, Flying Witch etc in genre and you have to ask me, YOI can't even pass for a love story, not bc it doesn't have love but it's not a /story/. You don't just slap two people together and then skim right to the end saying they're in love before we have the chance to watch it happen.\\n\\n\r\nFor an ice skating show the routines are gorgeous eh? (lmao) How many times has Yuuri repeated his Eros routine now? Are they, idk, skating or flapping their arms? The frames, oh man. Do these athletes even care about ice skating beyond a recreation and a naive, selfish pursuit of getting to enjoy life?\\n\\n\r\nYOI's good enough as a slightly above mediocre, slice of life about inherently nothing (maybe lofty starlit adventures?). No it's not even about ice skating, it's about how the athletes as people /make use/ of ice skating. I think Ginban Kaleidoscope had a better focus on ice skating and it's main theme is a /love story/.\\n\\n\r\nSo... guys, please stop. Sword Art Online, Kimi no Na wa, now this. You guys are really... (coddles forehead with hand)\\n\\n\r\nYes watch it, watch YOI if you want bc it can bring you up in a bad mood (humans are so easy to get entertained) but for the love of, don't go around throwing it like some monumental trophy bc facts:\\n\\n\r\n- No. 6 did the first gay anime trope\\n\r\n- Samurai Flamenco had fun fucking with itself but had a better proposal that wasn't even intentionally gay (perspective of the guy proposing)\\n\r\n- Just go watch Ginban if you're thirsty for ice skating\\n\r\n- Watch any yaoi if you want actually, they can be unexpectedly deep (tho dramatic) for all they're worth\\n\\n\r\nYou know ppl applaud that Viktor and Yuuri are met with no resistance but I'd rather say that's the problem. Are they not gonna be met with resistance in the real world? The problem with YOI is that it pulls all these moves, have Viktor stop his career or be met with relative non-prejudice and these acts invoke a phenomenal reaction from fandom bc of the implied meaning.\\n\\n\r\nA meaning which shld only come to fruition after you've worked hard for the outcome. YOI has done nothing but skim over /any and everything/ and you get happy just from a single line narrated by a character. Next episode they're gonna goof around again and if Viktor just says \"And we got married!\" I think fandom is gonna spontaneously combust.\\n\\n\r\nYOI is almost like a fanfiction at this point -- not because it's so fantastic and unreal but wish fulfillment. Fandom is so thirsty they'll probably eat anything up. I can see what YOI's good for, but fandom has to realize they're pushing their expectations onto this show and making it sound 100x better than it really is.\\n\\n\r\nBafflingggg. I won't ever agree, letting Kiseijuu or the likes sit in the same rank at this.",

            "content": "For starters, I'd like to say that I'm not really a fan of sports anime, but I feel like this one can be appreciated even by the ones who aren't in the genre at all. \r\nSo, before I start talking about the anime itself, I would like to point out that Yuri on Ice is suuuuuper gay... To the point that is easy to understand why many nickname it \"Yaoi on Ice\". I however decided to ignore this factor of the show ( which I'm positive Yaoi fangirls will love )  and focus on pretty much anything else that it is about. Being aman that loves Yuri ( I'm talking about girl-on-girl romance/action, not the main character of this anime ), I can't show bias and let it influence my judgment. \\n\\n\r\nSo, as for the plot not really being the most original ever, Yuri on Ice has a very good narrative and overall pace, without too many interruptions or filler-like moments, although I can detect a couple of ones that lean towards fanservice. However, the development and deliver of such plot is very well done and doesn't make the viewer questioning it at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation, despite not being always as detailed as I wish it would be, remains fluid and clean, with enough frames and speed that it will make it look almost on movie level of quality. About the animation, it's noticable how it switches from a very cured style to an extremely chibi and Slice of Life-like one, very often in comedy moments, but also in more serious ones. It feels put in place well, and despite it may appear lazy, I like its use. \\n\\n\r\nThe strongest point that this anime has, is in my opinion, the music. From the opening to the ending, to the themes and songs accompanying the fabulous executions of the skaters, I found the music absolutely amazing, which is also a key factor in some performances.\\n\\n\r\nI also like how a realistic approach is used in this anime, without any special powers or eternal slow-motion moments with thousands of words of thought, it's simple and straightforward, yet it doesn't make it any less impactful. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a nice variety of characters, which have their own ways and motives to push them in what they do. We often hear their thoughts and experience their personalities that sometimes feel even deeper than the main character himself. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think that Yuri on Ice nailed perfectly its objective as a sport anime, and I honestly found it enjoyable thus far. It's admirable, since this year and for the next, there are a certain number of anime  that are also very good, with this one sharing some space in the spotlight.",

            "content": "Review, cause I'm mad, and not even at the show but this fandom for being so thirsty that they scream groundbreaking even for a pointless mess. That's what yoi is, a pointless mess, a terribly failed attempt at best, that is on the level of \"I dont even think you tried at all\". \r\nYou call it groundbreaking, I can't even call it sport anime, so I kind of wish they would erase it from the genres here, because new people might think this is what sport anime is. \r\nBut to what to put there instead? I DO NOT KNOW. Because this show is just amess. The comedy probably stands if you like this kind, it just made me hate everything even more. Sport anime? Shounen ai? NONE OF THESE HAPPENS. There is some figure skating with awful art and repetitive themes that will bore you to hell after half of the show, and then there is a flamboyant probably bisexual - as I dont really believe he was ever with a man before - who forces himself on one of his admirers. \\n\\n\r\nI can't tell you how creeped out I was with Victor after like three episodes when it became clear, the show runners suck at writing, and they won't ever tell you about their(especially HIS) real feelings. Because without discussing their real feelings for each other, Victor was a bored millionaire who came to play with this poor japanese boy OUT OF BOREDOM OF HIS OWN LIFE. He took a break from figure skating to go and fool around, pretending to be cheerful - he was so fake ohmygod - and outgoing. Like wow, ok man, there is so much to love about you. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there is Yuuri. I wish I could have a 2hours long video of that five seconds when he shouts ITS NOT LIKE THAT for the people around the table after they got their NOT-engagement rings. That is his character. I am only here to repeat It's not like I'm gay. His whole struggle to be a better skaters from episode one is gone with Victor showing up and starting to fool around with him. Everything is just Victor Victor Victor/It's not like that It's not like that. And that is not what sport anime stands for! But also not what a supposed groundbreaker anime with gay line should be. It shouldn't be VAGUE if it's groundbreaker. There shouldn't be room for doubt for anyone, but that can't be right? Because Japan is too conservative. Oh please, then what's the point of doing an anime with EXAGGERATED AND WITH THAT ANNOYING gay in it, if you will just back out at every last second? This is not how you change people's opinion about gay people. Not with making them flamboyant and fake without actually talking about their feelings so people could see love between two men can be just as sweet as any other. \\n\\n\r\nThis story was a mess. You can't take it seriously for the sport or the love, but not even for the comedy which sucked. And no, I won't talk about the other characters as they did not matter for the show. Poor Yuri was supposed to be a main, and he was just mostly ignored because they added unnecessary showing off scenes for Victor instead of cutting some extra minutes to make his character deeper. But still, he was the only sport anime like character. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there is also no point of talking about a story, as there is hardly one. The show and with that you all who liked it, only care for the gay so what's the point? People'll watch it for the gay that everybody shouts about, then if they know not much about anime/sport anime they'll scream it's great, the others who saw way too many queerbaiting already will probably be creeped out like me - because just how could the makers go so overboard and still be freaking chickens, I do not understand. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, listen to people who say the art sucks. It is like the whole show. At first glance you see it's something shiny and good, but then you go deeper and it's ugly and undetailed. Also the repetitiveness will bore you to death. There was more creativity to SWIMMING in Free than to the skating here. And I was so hyped for the skating, so I just want to shout into the makers face for not even satisfying me with that. \\n\\n\r\nAnd just please. PLEASE. Stop comparing it to No6, you are utterly disrespectful to everything that story stands for everytime you say they are on the same level.",

            "content": "Yuri on Ice is, in my opinion, a mediocre anime that was held back more by its topic of choice and the 12 episode limit than the overall directing. It does, however, bring issues from both.\r\nWhen animating other sports such as ping pong, tennis, and even football, you can often make short-cuts and get away with occasional stiff movements. However, ice skating is a much more visual sport, requiring the animator to be skillful in translating every body movement in order to capture the same sort of magic. As a result, the technical mistakes made in Yuri on Ice leave more of an impression thanthey would otherwise have in any other show. This was especially apparent in many of Yuri\u2019s earlier skates where many scenes were often choppy and Yuri himself was barely even recognizable at certain points. Is this the studio\u2019s fault? Overall, I would (mostly) say no. MAPPA did an overall excellent job, particularly in the performances in the last two episodes, even including details like Victor spinning around in tandem with Yuri during his skates. The fault here lies more with how demanding ice skating is to animate rather than the incompetence of MAPPA\u2019s well-known animating team. Nevertheless, the oscillating quality of animation still undermines the impact of some of the individual performances, and I can't help but imagine that if MadHouse embarked on this same project that the animation quality and the number of sakuga-worthy scenes would increase.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, as someone who is not familiar with ice skating myself, Yuri on Ice left much to be desired. Many skating techniques such as the triple salchow and quads were shown throughout the course of the show, but the show never fully explained why the moves were so difficult and demanding other than showing skater errors (which helps convey an image, but can only go so far). While the skaters practice as demonstrated by their montages, they never practice individual techniques and only serve to create a general picture, so the viewer can only vaguely assume how hard the jumps are and what sacrifices the athlete had to make in order to compensate for it during the actual performances. It removes much of the emotion and thrill that would be there otherwise. Additionally, the development of Yuri\u2019s skating ability was primarily done through a combination of self-monologue and superficial errors. While the latter element was conveyed well, as a viewer I was more interested in seeing more improvement in the overall choreography rather than just in the jumps; I often had to rely on the commentary rather than the visuals in this regard, which is counter-intuitive for a sport like ice skating. Admittedly, Yuri demonstrating his first skate and free skate eventually felt repetitive, and the differences between each skate became less noticeable. This is indicative of real competitions, but it can eventually get droning to watch given how often we see Yuri skate. The monologues is a directing choice that I\u2019m more split on personally. It distracts from the actual performance taking place, but it is in many cases unavoidable given the 12 episode limit and ergo the small pockets of time the characters are given to develop outside of the competitions. I personally felt that certain monologues often interfered with the show, but I can\u2019t think of many ways to address the issue.\\n\\n\r\nThis ties into my next point, which is that I found most of the characters to be boring. I didn\u2019t find them visually unappealing since many of them (for the most part) had distinguishable and vibrant designs (and as a Korean, I am grateful that they didn\u2019t design the Korean representative horribly as some anime/manga occasionally tend to do). What I found boring were their personalities, or rather the lack of development and background given to each of them. Whether it\u2019s Otabek, Leo, or Christophe, we\u2019re often granted only momentary backgrounds into each of these characters, during the performances themselves no less when we\u2019re supposed to be focusing on the visuals. I would\u2019ve much preferred that Yuri on Ice follow the footsteps of other great sports manga/anime like Ping Pong and Eyeshield 21 and focus more development outside of the competitions rather than only during them. Yurio\u2019s development was especially affected by this as well despite being the secondary protagonist. Much of the screen time was given to Yuri, so a good chunk of Yurio\u2019s development came from during the skates than outside of it. Even in the last two episodes, both Christophe and Phichit were barely given more than three minutes of screen time for their routines, which is barely acceptable. I can\u2019t wholly blame the director for this though as the 12 episode limit cripples the potential for a variety of possible character development. Regardless, I found it hard to care about many of the supporting cast and what the medals meant to them with only brief, momentary expositions.\\n\\n\r\nTo highlight a character, I had trouble figuring out whether or not I liked the inclusion of Victor. It\u2019s certainly an interesting twist to have a role model and former competitor suddenly impose himself on to the main character as his coach, and it is what originally hooked me into the show in the first place. However, Victor is an extremely unrelatable character. The majority of his development is conveyed by his coaching ability juxtaposed by his perceived skating ability. However, the element is already lost since many people have very little experience being placed on a pedestal like that, much less in an area unfamiliar to many such as figure skating. In fact, the setting itself only takes place because Victor was not entertained as his status as a competitor since his ability was so far ahead of the rest. That is a feeling and emotion that already cannot be properly conveyed to the viewers. As a result, while I enjoyed the companionship between Yuri and Victor, I did not find his personal development nor the one shared with Yuri as viscerally evoking as I thought it would be.\\n\\n\r\nTo highlight another character, I greatly enjoyed the inclusion of JJ, despite having as much exposition as the rest of the minor characters. Initially portrayed as an unbeatable figure with unshakable pride nailing every jump skillfully without fail, he is the first one to be crippled by the pressure of competing on the grand stage. The difference in the two is so massive that I couldn\u2019t help but be taken slightly aback by the character\u2019s emotions. JJ initially served as a great antagonist through his sheer ability as a skater and his endless confidence, but the director chose to show an interesting development by exploring one of the many elements of being a skater, and what better way to do it than by tearing down the most powerful opponent? This was one of the few developments I greatly enjoyed (though I was miffed that his performance still allowed him to receive a 3rd place), and I would have liked that the show tried to explore more personality diversity this way than through the aforementioned expositions.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to highlight the third and final character, who in my opinion is one of the better characters in the anime. This character does not exist. What I mean to say is that Yuri on Ice does not have a forced antagonist that is meaninglessly vitriolic. While it may occasionally work in other genres, it often does not work in the sports genre as such characters are usually overdramatized and don\u2019t push the narrative forward in any other way other than to be unnecessarily obnoxious. I realize I am harping on this trope a bit too much when I think it can be done well with proper care (Agon from Eyeshield 21 is a good example of this). That being said, I\u2019m glad that such a character did not exist as he would have run counter to the overall atmosphere of the show and surely would\u2019ve had dragged it down further.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few things I want to mention before I close out this review. This anime had a fantastic soundtrack, and for the international aspect that this anime tried to capture, it was done wonderfully, extracting all types of music ranging from classical to rock. Many of these were not sung by Japanese (or at least I couldn\u2019t tell the difference) which is a great attention to detail that helped make the setting feel more genuine. If there is one minor thing I really disliked, it was how Yuri\u2019s Love Eros skate was designed to model after a katsu-don than actual love. Even for Yuri on Ice\u2019s standards that\u2019s just a bit too silly, and never in any of my times witnessing that skate did I ever receive an image that even vaguely reminded me of a katsu-don. The material for stolen love was even right there in the form of Yuuko. That\u2019s just one example, but the point is that I really didn\u2019t find the Katsu-don imagery that appropriate, an impression that I only grew more confident in each time I saw Yuri skate Love Eros.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend Yuri on Ice? Sadly, no I wouldn\u2019t; despite being clearly well-thought and superficially well-made, there are too many core issues ranging from character development to pacing for me to confidently call this a solid anime. The average animation is subpar, almost all the characters are not worthy of any note, and the overall momentum of the plot leaves much to be desired. It is however original, both in the sense of its concept as a whole and the fact that it does not derive from any manga, light novel, or etcetera. It is impressive in that regard, and Yuri on Ice is not anything MAPPA should be ashamed of for such an ambitious project.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Note: There's a lot of complaints about how \"gay\" this anime seemed. While it's certainly suggestive and appeals to the female audience, it's not that bad, and I didn't think it impeded with my assessment of the show.",

Experiencing the comedy in this show is like having a warm bucket of expired milk thrust untomy face. The three kids are so out of place in every scene they're in and do nothing that any other character could have done in a less cringeworthy way. What's even worse is how the anime fails to build up tension. It's like, they don't even attempt. The show, instead of at least attempting one of its quadruple salchow axel toe shitters and landing flat on its ass, just cruises on the smooth ice as if that's satisfactory. There's no slow motion or increasing music intensity to hype us up. On episode 6, there's so many skating matches in one fucking episode I just get desensitized to them. And on top of that, there's some skating routines that actually look so repetitive and mundane and forgettable, they could fall into a background of a white wall and I still wouldn't notice them. Also, the gay moments are so high key and try-hard that it's more cringey than sexual or funny. Most sports anime with good-looking guys have very low key gay moments that don't get in the way of whatever is actually happening. Look at Haikyuu or Free Iwatobi Swim Club. Haikyuu had some overly bromance moments, and Free capitalized on shirtless guys. This anime could have capitalized on beautiful looking men, and it did with Christoph, but it looks like their only desire with the gay moments is to punch you in the face.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the animation. Supposedly the best part of this show, but it's not nearly as good as a show that depends around good animation should be. The vast majority of the good animation is during the skating matches, and even then it's not good. You'd expect a lot of fucking sakuga moments from these scenes but the only thing moving is the skater. There's not enough colours or background movement to keep me entertained. The background just zooms in and out as if that's a substitute for actual dynamics. This makes what would otherwise be an amazingly animated scene into an awkward looking movement of character designs. It's like watching a gif move on top of an image that someone is vehemently zooming in and out of. And also, a point to note here between the animation and the dialogue. The show tries to make most of its points with dialogue and internal monologue as opposed to showing us with visuals. This is fine for the educational parts of the show where they explain the technicalities of skating, but when they want to tell us that Akatsuki is struggling or that he's tired, they make Victor have an internal monologue, as opposed to showing us visuals of him wearing out and getting tired. This makes the dialogue kind of heavy-handed (for lack of a better word).\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the characters. I'm sorry, but good character designs do not make up for a lack of consistency in the characters. The cheap comedy they try to use with the characters gets in the way of their development and, personally, my connection with them. Victor looks like the kind of character I would connect with on a personal level, but the way they write comedy in random spurts gets in the way of me taking him seriously when I'm supposed to. It makes him seem less sincere. You can't just alternate between comedy and sincerity like that. Akatsuki is probably the only well written character. I feel his pain and I like the way he develops and I'm going to continue watching the show for the sole purpose of watching him develop. The Russian Yuri, however, is like Shadow the Hedgehog but far less interesting and with no superpowers whatsoever. It's like they felt the need to make one of the other main characters an edgy shitlord, and based his whole personality around that. This makes him an incredibly shallow character. You'd think we'd have more background on one of our MAIN FUCKING CHARACTERS, but nah we're good. His angst and rebellious nature are used primarily for comedic nature, so when they try to pass it off in a serious moment, it is cringe at its finest. Oh, did I mention, Akatsuki and Victor are the only real \"main characters.\" Even the Russian Yuri, at this point, is a side character who was only main for the first few episodes. I hope he never comes back.\\n\\n\r\nNow, finally, the music. Obviously shit. The OP is an EDM track that sounds like an aspiring teenage DJ tried to be Calvin Harris. The ED is another EDM track with garbage autotune, and this is coming from a Future and Chief Keef fan who also adored 808's and Heartbreak by Kanye West. The music they play during the skating scenes is so underproduced it sounds like I could have made them from Garageband loops alone. Some are alright, I guess, like Minami's, but I could have made a better soundtrack throwing filters on masturbation noises.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could sum up this show in one word, it would probably be \"cringe.\" Maybe \"lackluster,\" would also come up.",

            "content": "Yuri on Ice! is a series I never would\u2019ve given the time of day to if it weren\u2019t for other surprisingly good sports anime like Haikyuu! Or Ping Pong The Animation. However, I\u2019ve come to realize that sports anime can be some of the most relatable, since they place the viewer into a more realistic setting rather than transporting them to a mystical fantasy world where one could only dream of existing. This causes the hardships the protagonists are going through to be moreso empathized with, and their overall growth throughout the series to be better understood. The same could be said about Yuri, butthe show does have some yaoi elements that could make it less relatable to the majority of anime viewers.   \\n\\n\r\nProduced by TV Asahi (Shinsekai Yori) and Avex Pictures (Noragami Arogoto), Yuri on Ice pretty much had a precedent set for it from the beginning. The pilot episode contains some expert levels of animation and a likable cast of characters. The humor was well timed, and the skating segments were entrancing to watch. Yuri Katsuki, a once famous Japanese figure skater, has fallen from grace and decides to retire in seclusion following an abysmal performance at the World Grand Prix event. It\u2019s not that his love for skating died, it\u2019s more or less what he thought he had to do after being so embarrassed at the competition. Instead of sucking it up, Yuri does what all of us would\u2026 eat pork cutlet bowls and watch the wheels fall off on his pride.\\n\\n\r\nHis once idol and Russian skating champion, Victor Nikiforov finds out about Yuri\u2019s retirement after a video is posted of the him skating Victor\u2019s winning program. Naturally he takes it upon himself to become Yuri\u2019s coach and help him get back to form by winning the World Grand Prix the next year. Yuri on Ice is a great tale of redemption, told mostly lightheartedly, and connects the viewer to the minds of the skaters through inner monologues and flashbacks. Unlike a team sport like Haikyuu or Kuroko no Basket, this series draws heavily on the strength and focus of the individual to tell its story. Each character\u2019s ice time can almost be seen as a vignette; a glimpse into the individual\u2019s internal strife or what gives them the motivation to skate at all. It\u2019s short and sweet, allowing viewers just a taste of the sport without having much time to get boring.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest compliment I can give the anime as a whole is that it doesn\u2019t really pander to its viewers. The fujoshi themes are there, but never really seem to go overboard. Having the peculiar relationship between Victor and Yuri can be offputting to some (including myself who dropped it at episode 4 initially), but it\u2019s meant to be. Yuri doesn\u2019t even realize he\u2019s gay when he first sees Victor, causing the blossoming of their relationship to be awkward at times. Yuri as a character is obviously flawed, but through Victor he develops some \u201creal\u201d motivation and ends up reaping the benefits and takes risks to impress him. I can't say that I cared for the copious amounts of man service showing up in the anime. Chiseled, half naked men loafing about in hot springs are not high up on my enjoyment list.\\n\\n\r\nVictor, on the other hand is a character who I didn\u2019t necessarily enjoy. Serious and sensual one moment, while silly and flamboyant the next. He seemed to be a necessary evil for the thematic relevance of a yaoi relationship, but didn\u2019t strike me as \u201crelatable\u201d on any level. He certainly didn\u2019t emulate the impression I had of a world figure skating champion. The writers made up for it with Yuri Plisetsky, the Russian teenager who embodied every cutthroat high school jock whose parents pushed them to the limits. He was immature and often showed it externally, and was too young to realize how unimportant what he did really was in the grand scheme of things. His jealousy and envy of protagonist Yuri was humorous based on how unnecessary it was. The rest of the characters didn\u2019t make much of an impression to me. Many had their own backstory, but existed as little other than placeholders in Yuri\u2019s story.\\n\\n\r\nPS- I\u2019m not really sure how old those triplets were, but they sure were mature for their age\u2026 using smart phones to post videos online and explaining the rules of figure skating? Yep, seems legit.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned the animation is on point in this anime. My knowledge of ice-skating is solely from watching the Winter Olympics but the intricate detail involved with the skaters movements during their individual segments are breathtaking. i've also been told that it is technically correct as well, adding to the realism of the show. normally a focus as intense as this show has would detract from the animation in other normally a focus as intense as this show has would detract from the animation in other scenes, but Yuri on Ice does not falter here. The character models and emotions are emblazoned on their faces quite accurately, which is nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects in this anime are well timed and realistic for the subject matter. However, the music was very hit and miss for me. Some songs (especially the English ones) were hard on the ears, though most of the orchestrated tracks were well developed and presented. The OP, although catchy, was not a track I could get onboard with for some reason. The ending was much better in connecting with the anime in general, and showed the lighthearted flair Yuri on Ice is known for. Voice Acting was superb all around, and the various nationalities of the skaters in the show were illustrated effectively here.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Yuri on Ice? I'd say at least give it an episode or two of a preview. The series doesn't shy away and it'll be apparent whether or not it is a series for you. I enjoyed it for what it was, and tried not to get too wrapped up in the yaoi business, as I feel like it detracted from the overall presentation through no fault of its own. It certainly wasn't a series I thought I'd even get through, so that should speak for itself. If I could break it into a sentence it would be: \u201cA beautiful story of redemption, though not without blemishes, that takes you on a lighthearted and fun journey back to the top.\u201d An anime best viewed with less than serious intent. I'd recommend it to any fans of the sports genre looking for something new, and who aren't put off by a little more than bromance.

            "content": "There isn't really a plus side to Yuri on Ice beside being an ice skating show with guys. Although there are a few good moments and the ingredients for a sport anime are here, the love story overwhelms everything. As it unfolds, you quickly notice nothing else than romance matters: rivalry, friendship, family, other skaters and even competitions lose most of their appeal fast, sometimes to the point of becoming trivial. It doesn't help that the protagonists are a bit shallow and rely too much on surface caricature to build a personality; the story rapidly becomes a weak excuse and a routine for romance, joiningthe routines on the rink. Sadly, the performances on ice are also repetitive and bear no thrilling, giving you the feeling you've seen one, you've seen 'em all!\\n\\n\r\nWithout the support of inventive and stylish art and animation in its execution, Yuri on Ice ends up as a failed souffl\u00e9. Lacking in every aspect of its writing, breathless in the artistic ambitions that could have redeemed the show, it falls short of everything. Not bad enough to fall below the appreciation of \"average\", but there's nothing more to expect from it.",

            "content": "My very first review for a very special anime. Yuri!!! on Ice is a show about Yuuri Katsuki, a 23 years old top figure skater from Japan. He trained in Detroit and  qualified for the Grand Prix Final for the very first time in his life, but he became last place with a very low score due mental and physical problems. His idol, Russian champion Victor Nikiforov takes the gold once again. Yuuri doesn't know whether to retire or to continue, he feels like his career is over but he also wants to skate on the same ice as his idol again. He visitshis home town to think things over, and suddenly Victor Nikiforov himself appears at his home and tells Yuuri he'll become his coach and will take him to the Grand Prix Final. And that's how the heartwarming story about figure skating begins. \\n\\n\r\nPlease do not compare this show to anything BL/yaoi/shounen-ai related because it's not what this show is about. Sure, Victor and Yuuri share an emotional and romantic bond but it's very subtle handled. The romance is there to make Yuuri stronger as a competitive skater and to accomplish his goal to win a gold medal at the Grand Prix Final. Yuri on Ice is enjoyable for both male and female audience. The main theme of the show will always be sports, so you won't hear any love confessions from either of them but you'll definitely notice there's something going on between them. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9/10\\n\r\nYuri on Ice is very realistic to the real figure skating world. The creators of this show are big fans of figure skating, and they definitely know a thing or two about how the skating world works. That's why this anime has been praised by many real life figure skaters. Figure skating is a very beautiful and passionate sport, where people can express themselves in routines, music and glittery outfits.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very simple and the pacing seems a little off here and there. There is a time skip of five months or something between episode 4 and 5 while the last three episodes happen in three or four days. The story is very rushed near the ending, and the dynamic between Yuuri and Victor changes drastically (read: they give you the feeling theyre dating) but no one in this show talks about it, neither the main characters or the side characters. They all just kinda let it happen. This felt a little frustrating to me because I wanted to have a deeper look into their relationship, but the show is all about the sports and their relationship will be up for interpretation until the very end. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this show is actually funny and very solid, but that's just my opinion. I think the comedy doesn't work for everyone, for example manservice is used for comedic purposes in the first 4 episodes. Yuuri's family runs a hot spring and there will be a few scenes where Victor appears butt naked. \\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice has a few sudden twists and turns during the story, and all of them are positive and mostly heartwarming. There will be moments you'll feel shocked, extremely happy, sad and you'll feel for the characters, even if they're not that important to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending left lots of people unsatisfied, but personally I didn't feel that way at all. Many things happen in the finale and I had to rewatch a few times to fully understand what's going on because it's a little bit rushed and fast paced. The ending hints at a season two and that's why I liked the ending: everything you wanted to happen in the finale can still happen in season two! \\n\r\nI can assure you the ending of season 1 is a happy ending, even though things won't go as you expect.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\r\nYuri on Ice has a huge cast of lots of international figure skaters. They all have their own reasons to win, different outfits, routines, music and lots of personality. The characters aren't stereotyped and are unique in their own way. Some of them skate for love, some for their country and some of them just to beat Victor off his throne. \\n\\n\r\n- Yuri \"Yurio\" Plisetsky, Yuuri's main rival from Russia is a 15 year old, very talented but rude character. I didn't like his character at all in the beginning, but I came to like him because his skating is absolutely wonderful. It's a treat for your eyes, the music he uses for his program is phenomenal and his outfits are the best. Yuri fricking Plisetsky, a cold hearted lil tsundere crawled his way into my heart. \\n\r\n- Phichit Chulanont from Thailand, Yuuri's rinkmate in Detroit, is an extremely likable character who skates to make history for his country,\\n\r\n- Flamboyant Chris from Swiss who wants to beat Victor no matter what and doesn't feel motivated because Victor isn't skating this season,\\n\r\n- JJ \"the King\" who wants to take over the whole skating world but he realizes the pressure of being number one can be overwhelming,\\n\r\n- Michele \"Mickey\" Crispino who skates for his twin sister and breaks his personal record by a mile when he realizes his love for her is unhealthy and let's go of her. Mickey isn't a very important character but his free skate performance made me cry like a baby\\n\r\n- Yuuri's family, childhood friends, ballet instructor Minako-sensei and his fellow Japanese ice skater and fan Minami-kun who supports Yuuri no matter what. They don't appear a lot, but they are likeable and they add a good amount of comedy to the story\\n\r\n- The two characters who nestled their way in my heart are Yuuri and Victor. Yuuri gets an immense amount of character development, he has major anxiety problems, (sometimes so bad it's unpleasant to watch). Luckily he has Victor by his side who'll support him as much as he can and together they'll work things out. He grabs on to Victors love and rises himself to the top. Victor may seem like a mysterious character with unknown reasons to coach Yuuri, but near the end of the series it turns out he's nothing but a big sweetheart who had no inspiration left to surprise people and felt imprisoned by skating. He took a break to coach a failing Japanese figure skater and found his love and life in the boy and his home country Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThere are even more characters, but these are the ones who left the biggest impression on me\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art itself is amazing. The realistic scenery which includes different countries (Japan, Russia, Spain) and real life ice skating venues is amazing to see. The outfits were designed by real life figure skating designers and Yuuri's free skate outfit was even made in real life. The routines are choreographed by Kenji Miyamoto who is a figure skater himself. \\n\r\nThe characters all look great on the ice, but the animation was rushed and felt incomplete. The expressions of the skaters looked awkward and unfinished. The body movement is amazing to see though and the jumps are awesome. Overall, most skating routines didn't really grab my attention, but it didn't affect enjoyment one bit.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\r\nYou know why lazy drawn routines didn't affect my enjoyment? Because the music is absolutely outstanding! The show uses both real life music and new created music for the show. On Love: Agape and Allegro Appassionato in B Minor (Yurio's music) and Stay Close to Me (Victors Free program) are the ones who just left me speechless. Another favorite is \"Theme of King JJ\" which is an incredible catchy song, you can see the public singing along while he skates to this music and even I had to sing along because it's just too good! Yuuri's free skate \"Yuri on Ice\" is the most memorable, it's a song which expresses his entire career in a beautiful way. \\n\r\nThe mix between classical and pop music is great, and it's one of the best aspects of this anime. \\n\r\nThe OP is catchy, and don't even get me started on the ED: it's perfect. One of the best and unique ending songs I've ever heard!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nWhen I first started this anime I had very low expectations but it turned out to be my absolute favorite. I love the OST, the characters, the story, the comedy, the art style, the realistic and professional view of a very beautiful and interesting sport. Everything just works for me. The gay romance was such a treat since I like yaoi slightly more than yuri or straight relationships, but I would've rate 10/10 anyway. You shouldn't shy away from this anime just because it has a few gay moments! \\n\\n\r\nEverything about Yuri on Ice is just so satisfying. The creators put so much effort in this show and their hard work has payed off. I really think this show deserves its hype.",

            "content": "Probably the most overhyped/overrated anime since Sword Art Online.\r\nNot only are the characters pretty flat, not only is the story really really bad, not only does the animation of this series become so bad that Studio Deen would have to start blushing, not only is the world building some of the worst in any anime but people also have the nerv to call this anime a good represantion of a gay relationship.\r\nIs this what straight women think what gay men would behave like if they'd be in love?\r\nThe relationship of Yuri and Victor is some of the battiest Yaoi shit I've seen in any anime.They don't kiss - They just hug in a way to make it look like they're kissing. They don't get in a relationship between lovers - They are just master & student who really like each other. They don't get engaged - They just buy lucky charms for each other, that look like engagement rings. \\n\r\nAnd don't come to me claiming that the kiss had to be cencored for the japanese audience. There were plenty of anime where gay characters had kissed each other in a clear way (Sakura Trick, No.6) so please just cut the bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character is flat and cringy and every potential that they might have had is wasted, because every episode had to have at least 3 ice skating scenes instead of actual character building through some relationships. The cringiest and worst character is Christophe and his presence probably describes the best why Yuri on Ice has such garbage writing. Yuri, the main character, is every sports protagonist of every shitty sports anime. He's such a blank slate that new story tools like a second dog dying have to be created to give him some new reactions. Victor is the stereotypical gay character. Every line he says has to be ambivalent and no real strong motivation is given as to how and why he quit his career.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the story. Most of it is spend in the ice rink and instead of giving the viewer some eye candy through some cool shots of Russia or Japan we mainly get some of the worst sakuga animation you will see in any anime. 90% of the characters could be cut out completely and nothing would change. Motivations are explained through inner dialogue in the ice skating scenes which just is lazy. There is no subtlety to anything in this piece of garbage story. One thing I can give credit to this anime though is, that the humor most of the times works and the first 2 episodes were pretty okay. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation like I've said is pretty bad. The first episode had some really beautiful scenes but then the director decided to use this exact animation again...and again...and again...and again but only worse.\\n\r\nWe never get an explanation as to how who is better than who. The only visual indication we ever got as to how someone was doing good or bad during their skating scenes is when they tripped. A talented director would have cut out some of the skating scenes to save some of the budget for a few important story scenes.\\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice fails in every way. It fails as a sports anime. It fails as a love story. It's fails a character study.\\n\\n\r\nThe only enjoyment I got from this anime was how this whole mess of a story crumbled apart near the end.",

            "content": "I write this as a gay adult man who's actually interested in proper M/M romantic representation and as someone who's jaded of queerbaiting and stereotypical heteronormative gay relationships in the shounen-ai genre. So when I was drawn into the hype that YOI offers a compelling storyline which extends beyond cheap queerbaiting and homo-fanservice, I was intrigued to say the least. \r\nI am going to do my best to be entirely unbiased. There are certain redeeming qualities to the show that I think deserves mention. \r\na) Ethnic representation: It isn't often to see America being represented by a Latino, to see prominent cast members from Russia,Thailand, China, Switzerland etc. \\n\r\nb) Proper treatment of women: Women are not objectified with melon boobs without any form of agency at all. Common anime tropes of the possessive brother veering into romantic desire of his sister are effectively established and subverted accordingly. \\n\r\nc) Accurate representation of anxiety and its debilitating effects onto one's psyche, projecting insecurity, doubt and unworthiness onto everything around you. \\n\r\nd) the soundtrack is well composed and suitably appropriate. \\n\r\ne) effective narrative turn of events in the later episodes that cast light on why certain earlier events transpired the way that they did. \\n\\n\r\nNow, moving on to the problems (SPOILERS INVOLVED):\\n\\n\r\nHorrible ambiguity involved in the main M X M relationship. Frankly, it's disgusting. The relationship between the two characters was never firmly established as fully canon; but there were so many moments between them that comes across as queerbaiting; but never realised as a full-fledged canonical couple that is settled beyond a doubt. The kiss is censored, the rings are dismissed as \"Onajimai you\" (for good luck), and even if we were to believe that they are \"engaged\" at some point, the conversation between Victor and Yuuri at episode 11 and 12 was so formal, as though between a coach and his student, that it just isn't the way a fiance would speak to one another! It vacilliates between intense homo fanservice (\"So Yuuri, what are you going to do to make me excited?\" and outright denial of their relationship, where Yuuri insists that OURRELATIONSHIPISNOTLIKETHAT. It's pretty sad; the show's entire premise is centered on Yuuri finding his sexual maturity and confidence in himself, as well as displaying his \"love\" of Victor to the world, however, there has NEVER been an explicit declaration of love, only outright denials and public displays of affection are either censored such that there is room of ambiguity for what it is, or veering on intense bromance. \\n\\n\r\nTo those people who claim that the ambiguity is what drives the homoerotic tension of the show, I ask you as a gay person. Would you have said the same thing if the couple was a heterosexual couple? You wouldn't, precisely because ALL shojo anime, even if it operates on some level of ambivalence or ambiguity, is always resolved with an outright declaration of romantic intention - it's what makes the scene magical, or romantic. Love is something that should not be hidden, and if this was a shojo show, we would be accusing the creators of playing us for fools. So why are we applying a different standard for YOI? Why is it possible for JJ in episode 11 to declare that he's going to marry his girlfriend, whereas Yuuri and Victor have to hide their relationship, their supposed engagement as \"onajimai\", good luck charms? \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, as a sports anime, it fails on the exact reason that I've mentioned above. Every single sports anime ranging from Free to KnB is all about being CLEAR, CONCISED and DETERMINED on the desire or the goal that you aim to achieve; ie this is what I want, and this is what I plan to do in order to get there. Rather, in YOI it's all about Victor Victor, it's not like that it's not like that. Well then, Yuuri, what exactly is the nature of your relationship? The true nature of their relationship is never fleshed in full, and as a sports anime, the skating scenes were repetitive and unnecessary - is it really needed to cramp 6 skating performances in one episode, of which it pretty much looks the same with bad animation anyways? Plot is almost non existent as well; and seems to exist solely to push for fanservicey elements between the two protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, the anxiety that Yuuri experiences is becoming a tired, recurring plot device that is losing its effectiveness. in EVERY single relationship conflict, it's always Yuuri who causes the conflict, due to his anxiety such that you can almost distill it down to a formula: Yuuri's anxiety causes some form of misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the situation -> They fight -> Cold War -> They get back together after Yuuri skates. It's never Viktor who begins the fight, speaking of which, we still do not know anything much about who Viktor is as a person; he exists as some cheap 2 dimensional perfect character that is there to lift Yuuri from his anxiety like some Godsend. Asides from the fact that he seems a little clueless on handling Yuuri's anxiety, he doesn't seem to have any flaws as a human being. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, please please please do not every compare this to No.6 where the relationship is explicit, sensitively drawn out, and the characterisation and relationships are honest and sincere, without any cheap queerbaiting at all. Due to its cheap exploitative queerbaiting, which feels deceptive - despite getting \"engagement rings\" in 10, their relationship at 11 and 12 was so horrifying formal, without any of the characteristic warmth of newly engaged - it deserves nothing more than a 5. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for goodness sake, please do not mention that the kiss HAD to be censored due to Japanese media laws. I studied media in Japan at one of Tokyo's top universities. There is no such law involved; Shinsekai Yori and No.6 had explicit M/M kisses and they were aired on TV you know. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Once upon a time, there was a young man with a big dream. He idolized a famous Russian skater named \u201cVictor Nikiforov\u201d and hopes to skate on the very same ice as him. Initially, that dream sunk until Yuri was able to impress Victor by imitating his routine at perfection. You can guess what happens next. Victor is so impressed that he decides to be Yuri\u2019s coach at the upcoming Grand Prix Finals.\r\nAs an original TV anime, Yuri on Ice doesn\u2019t suffer from adaptation issues. It\u2019s also directed by Sayo Yamamoto, known for her work Michiko to Hatchin, Lupin the Third: The Woman Called FujikoMine, and Space Dandy. Expectations are considered high with her talent. In fact, this was one of my most hyped show of the season. We don\u2019t get a show about ice skating often so it\u2019s also a breath of fresh air. The fact is, Yuri on Ice initially had a deceptive title for the Western audience. Don\u2019t let that fool you though because Yuri on Ice is a show that goes beyond expectations on the ice rink.\\n\\n\r\nStarting off, the first few episodes introduces our main protagonists. Yuri Katsuki is the 23-year old main male protagonist who has been skating at a young age. Although not hailed as a prodigy, Yuri\u2019s determination and personality earn him praise and friends. His weakness lies with pressure as he is known to mess up at crucial moments. Early on, we can see this easily as Yuri even has self-doubt about his own body. In essence, Yuri is a good natured guy that most of us can relate to and has a lot of potential that is just waiting to be unlocked. That brings in Victor, the key to making Yuri into the next big thing. The 27-year old figure skater has gained international recognition for his talent and won numerous championships. (In fact, 5 consecutive Grand Prix Finals!) As such, you can expect that Victor has countless fans around the world. He\u2019s also Yuri\u2019s idol and him becoming his coach is a dream come true. Victor\u2019s philosophy and key to success is to surprise the audience and the skaters themselves. As he puts it, \u201cDo the opposite of what people expect, that is the only way you will surpass them!\u201d Indeed, Victor can seem like a tough coach but genuinely hopes Yuri will be a success. The duo has some of the best chemistry in the entire series that begins as a professional relationship, to friends, and to even intimacy.\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of figure skating, you can expect a lot of competition. It\u2019s not just from Japan or Russia but also countries from all over the world. The most prominent rival that Yuri faces is a young man from Russia named Yuri Plisetsky (known more as Yurio when he\u2019s in Japan). Unlike Yuri, Yurio is already a hailed as a prodigy with his achievements such as three consecutive wins at the Junior World Championships. His personality is also more of an antithesis compared to Yuri as he is more arrogant and takes pride in his abilities. During his time in the show, we can also draw a parallel similarity between him and Yuri. Both seeks to make big names of themselves in the figure skating world. Both hopes to surpass their own limits and crafting their skating style to perfection. However, what really separates them both is how they seeks to accomplish this. The show chronicles both of their roles as rivals although there are also times when they act more as casual friends. In the meantime, Victor is portrayed as a playboy coach. The way he trains Yuri expresses passion. In fact, Yuri\u2019s skating style and theme revolves around love (or dubbed more as \u201cero\u201d) There\u2019s obvious sexual chemistry between the two that can be interpreted beyond a professional relationship. Anyone can interpret it differently but it\u2019s undeniable that there\u2019s more than them just being student and teacher. As the story unfolds, we can see how their relationship progress both in and out of the ice rink. There\u2019s even physical examples that shows how close they really become later in the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show highlights Yuri, Yurio, and Victor and the main characters, others in the show also should deserve some recognition. Most easily recognized are characters such as Otabek Altin, China famed skater Guang-Hong Ji, Switzerland\u2019s Christopher Giacometti, Canada\u2019s Jean-Jacques Leroy (\u201cJJ\u201d), Thailand\u2019s Phichit Chulanot, Korea\u2019s Seung Gil Lee, United States\u2019 Leo de la Igelsia, among others. Each of these competitors has their own unique talent, skating style, and personality that really brings the show larger than life. I also have to emphasize on some of the unique background storytelling about them in particular with Christopher. JJ\u2019s narcissism is also hard to ignore both in and out of the skating rink. What\u2019s most impressive about these characters is how each of them tries their best to impress the audience and viewers. They all have reasons to win and be the best that they can be.\\n\\n\r\nSo why should you really watch Yuri on Ice? The show has the sports competitive atmosphere but every now and then, the audience will definitely notice the character relationships. It\u2019s very human and can be fierce at times. At its core, Yuri and Victor will draw the most attention. Even at times, the show pushes the BL tones to overdrive. However, that really shouldn\u2019t hold anyone back from watching the show because Yuri on Ice is so much more than about male butts and fan service. As a straight male, I had no problem enjoying this show for what it has to offer. The way it capitalizes on the competition, characters, visual dynamics, themes, and directing is worth every minute. Even the pacing works out quite well as it doesn\u2019t waste much time getting to the point. Comedy is also straightforward and although can get rather awkward at times, it still effectively delivers with character chemistry and reaction faces. (how can anyone not laugh at Yurio\u2019s priceless expressions?!) In retrospect, it\u2019s a show that is here to entertain.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio MAPPA, Yuri on Ice is built on creativity and realism. There\u2019s many sides you can see this but the most prominent elements that makes this show visually stunning is the directing. If you look closely at the show, the human body movements is directed at a very intense level. Every time a skater enters the rink and performs, we can see how the camera angles capture their every movement. Each skater has their own unique style as well and it also spells out their personality with their performances. Quality wise, the show also has strong production from the setting, character designs, to the choreography. Of course, Yuri on Ice isn\u2019t without fan service. Most of it is expressed by playboy coach Victor and the bath scenes. But like I said before, this really shouldn\u2019t hold you back from giving the show a chance.\\n\\n\r\nIf this show wasn\u2019t impressive enough, Yuri on Ice also excels with its soundtrack. The OP song \u201cHistory Maker\u201d by Dean Fujioka is creatively directed with a catchy male tone. In addition, the theme song captures another theme of the show about making memories on the skating rink. The soundtrack and OST during each performance also knows how to impress the audience with by the character movements that supplements with their style. Character voice mannerisms throughout the show is also memorable. Who can forget about Victor\u2019s seductive voice or Yurio\u2019s silly arguments with his Yuri? However, what\u2019s most important is that the soundtrack, voice, and theme songs brings out the best of this show to a realistic level. Even though they are professional skaters, we can see how human they are like any ordinary person as well.\\n\\n\r\nAh Yuri on Ice, a title that isn\u2019t what it seems. The promotional poster is what it is and what you\u2019ll expect. Coming into this show, I had high expectations with the talented staff involved and didn\u2019t have an ounce of disappointment. Perhaps the show isn\u2019t suitable for everyone\u2019s tastes or style but I would recommend it to anyone. I\u2019m not an expert on ice skating myself but watching this show got me genuinely interested in learning more about the sport. This TV anime takes ice skating and character relationships to a new level that is phenomenal. With a hint of \u201csee you next level\u201d for second season, I just hope it gets a continuation to make more history.\\n",

            "content": "While 2013's Free is considered many things but perfect, its role in broadening an avenue in mainstream media for other fanbase-dubbed \"manservice\" works is undeniable, rekindling a bygone genre only previously seen by those who sought it. Yaoi isn't exactly new to the medium, the ever-ceaseless late 2000s cultural shift contributing towards LGBT acceptance's decay from a taboo to mundane facet in media. Just in 2002, t.A.T.u.'s \"All The Things She Said\" music video was banned by several broadcasters and countries for its \"controversial\" content where two women kissed. And today, Miley Cyrus dry humping everything barely merits a shrug from most people. If beingdesensitized has done anything positive to our current society, it's allowing others to express themselves openly without it being harshly shut down by a majority rule, which also carts over to anime... well, kind of. \\n\\n\r\nAnime has always been pushing the boundaries of what's considered acceptable content for decades, striving in its brazen depiction of whatever it chooses to highlight. And no, I'm not just speaking on the mid 2000s boom of lolicon fetishism, I'm talking about all the way back to its humble beginnings, with titles like Belladonna of Sadness making waves in 1973 with its phallic imagery and sexually charged content that could still be seen as provocative, even by today's \"no boundaries\" standards. Content that ultimately went on to inspire the works of many creators, with one notable example being acclaimed director, Kunihiko Ikuhara; a man who's also credited for bringing an artistic touch to themes of sexual liberation through his various hyper-stylized works. Sexual decadence and open expression have always been a part of anime's arsenal, the only real change is how frequently they're being used.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us all the way to Fall season 2016, which alone has 4 to 5 anime titles that either overtly or hinted at homoerotic relations in some way or another, while just a decade ago, receiving 4 to 5 titles with these undercurrents in it within a year's time was considered a milestone. As the 2010s pass, our increasing rate of connectivity, information sharing and understanding of others has diminished miscommunication and heightened acceptance of alternative preferences, sexual or otherwise, resulting in a largely overlooked trivialization of sexual content in anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn some ways, Yuri On Ice could be seen as another byproduct of this trend, if only to a much more abrasive degree, positioning men in suggestive poses while participating in a sport used as a vehicle to portray who they are as people. And where something like Free boasts eye-grabbing swimming sequences, Yuri On Ice capitalizes on ice skating scenes that dwarf the efforts of most animated TV productions. Too bad it isn't enough to distract from the fatal flaws that plague the entire production. You see, Yuri on Ice tries its damnedest to shed light on its cast; a cast that is constantly reduced to doujinshi deviant art-bait clippings despite its honest efforts to mold them into believable personalities.  \\n\\n\r\nBut the question is, does Yuri on Ice justify it? Is there a base purpose for its shounen-ai fluff to be there? I may not be Ikuhara's fan, but there's no denying each of his works deliver provocative, purposeful messages. There's always a constant need to stress freedom of expression with homosexuality itself just being another extension to further emphasize that idea. Self-indulgent at times but justifiable if you care for what he's trying to say. But what about Yuri on Ice? Does it actually justify these men's intimate devotion for each other or is it just trying to fetishize everything to draw out a marketable audience that usually takes in this content at their own leisure? Is there a purpose here outside of being titillating manservice?  What I'm trying to ask in the most ignorant and offensive way possible; is Yuri on Ice just being gay for the sake of being gay? \\n\\n\r\n\u2014 Views episode 6, guy figure skating grabs his ass \"I think I'm gonna come\"\u2014 \\n\\n\r\nWell... I guess that answers my question. \\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice is a harmless fanservice pastime dressed up as a coming-of-age story and cut from the same cloth as any other sports tournament anime, let's stop pretending otherwise. The sooner we kill the pretension that it's something more profound than that, the faster we could sit back and enjoy it for what it is; a fun, easygoing yaoi-bait show with pretty boys trying to balance characterization and fetishism on the same pedestal. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as yaoi-bait entertainment goes, Yuri on Ice is definitely a show stopper when it comes time to take the games to the ice. Brought to life by Mappa, a young studio renowned for their presentation and audiovisual prowess, Yuri on Ice is yet another notch under their belt, boasting ice skating scenes so free-flowing that at times it's easy to believe that they might have been rotoscoped. It's this selling point that got most to give Yuri on Ice the stamp of approval, and understandably so. You don't really get this much effort from an animated TV production on a regular basis. But do I think that's reason enough to warrant all the appraisal it has gathered? Of course not. Those 5 minutes per episode aren't a saving grace for the other 15 minutes, especially when those 15 minutes often spend its time being a mishmash of basic fanfare for literally every sports story ever conceived or a roulette spin of yaoi/comedy for those who care for it. \\n\\n\r\nHalf of the ice skating involves numerous elements, like panning around the competitors in a news camera fashion with occasional audience reaction shots to round it out. When you realize that the actual dances are being overlaid onto different backgrounds with minor, sparse tweaks to delude, you find the show's highlights disappointingly operate on a limited dispensary. They retain their integrity as the show's highlights, but they're not all they're cracked up to be. And honestly, that aspect of it doesn't even bother me since the changes make every encounter fresh. What does, however, is its half commitment towards its characters in one direction or the next.\\n\\n\r\nTrying to build legitimacy for its characters while simultaneously reducing them to objectified pretty boy specimen for the sake of manservice has left Yuri on Ice in a gimmicky realm where all of its achievements could only muster up to being \"that show with the really nice ice skating scene,\" a sentence worse than death for anything looking to stand the test of time. From nobody's fault but its own, this anime has effectively built itself a glass ceiling that it could never surpass. \\n\\n\r\nBut enough of me taking the piss out of this show, let's go over the basics that it chooses to cover and what good it was able to do.\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of competitive figure ice skating, Victor Nikiforov stands as the person to beat, being a beloved and envied figure throughout the sport's industry, as well as a person of inspiration for newcomers trying to break into the field. With an elegant physique that exudes self-confidence and a natural knack for the sport, Victor is the complete package. One of the countless people that adore him is our main character, Yuuri Katsuki, a novice ice skater who idolizes everything about him, to the point where his sole dedication to the sport of figure ice skating derives from the infatuation that he has for the otherworldly reigning champion that's always occupying his TV screen. Through dumb luck and perfect timing, Yuuri is presented with the once in a lifetime opportunity to study under his mentor, the story subsequently dedicating itself to their blossoming relationship as it coincides with the world tournament that wraps everything up within it.\\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice's flamboyant characters are given simple reasons for their ambitions, the show's format complementing its cast; ice skating being both the engine of characterization, every character's idiosyncrasies expanding on their personalities, and a divider granting those characters undisturbed time in the limelight, the story's short, 12-episode tournament format spurring frequent ice skating characterization and an inexorable sense of movement toward a definite finality. Ice skating characterization examples include Chris Giacometti's lowbrow episode 6 exhibition relaying his sexual and methodical confidence in appeasing the audience versus the protagonist's quick flashes that redeem his low sex appeal, Victor's unworried nonchalance regarding his envied, exceptional technical skills, Yuri's eccentric, soft style despite his fiery personality and even minor characters like Jean-Jacques, the show's JoJo stand-in, whose cockiness translates to a showboating spectacle. The theatrics, choice of techniques, tight turns, and loose gesture all coalesce into a final form that define who that person is on and off the ice rink\u2014this characterization the show's biggest strength.\\n\\n\r\nAnd perhaps this very thoughtful decision to characterize the characters' personalities is also the reason I find the whole thing to be a waste. Because despite itself, Yuri on Ice was a show that was never meant to appeal to me. So where I would usually outright dismiss something like this, it just so happens that there were nuggets of detail within it that I found appealing. An appeal that required me to drudge through content that I couldn't psych myself into caring for no matter how hard I tried. \\n\\n\r\nAnd really, it didn't have to do much to make me like it, just either muffle the shounen-ai content down to a realistic degree or stop dancing around the idea and just fully embrace it. The show is suggestive of the possibility of there being an actual sexual interest between the main leads but at the same time, it only cock-teases this idea to maintain the illusion of the fiction it wants to sell. And once again, excuse my politically incorrect wording but if you're going to be gay, be all the way gay goddammit. Stop pussyfooting around. I don't need some full blown orgy like Sausage Party's celebratory ending, all I want is a clear yes or no for where they stand, none of this \"just gay enough\" gray area. Is it so hard for a male homosexual relationship to be taken seriously for once? \\n\\n\r\nNow with all that being said, is Yuri on Ice worth the watch? Yes, but only if you have nothing else in your catalog. As it stands, it's not something I see any need to jump into. Yuri on Ice is that intermediary show that you pick up to pass the time on your way on to better ones. What it has that works is its wonderful ice skating scenes and the usage of it to inform the audience of who the characters are, as for everything else, it's either standard for its genre or serviceable to a very niche market.",

            "content": "Yuri!!! on Ice is a sports anime. That\u2019s what it\u2019s listed as, that\u2019s what it was first promoted as, and it\u2019s how I would believe the series creators wish it to be seen. But Yuri!!! on Ice is so much more than just a sports anime. If you\u2019ve been anywhere around the anime crowd online (or even out of it, sometimes) in the past twelve weeks, then you\u2019ve probably heard about the \u201cgay figure skating anime\u201d of the season.\r\nThe biggest question I\u2019ve seen around is, \u201cwhat\u2019s so good about it?\u201d It\u2019s just gay. It\u2019s just pandering to fans. It\u2019s just this, just that. So it\u2019sa lot of things. Here are some of them.\\n\r\n(NOTE: no massive spoilers but the nature of the relationship between Viktor and Yuuri does get touched on briefly.)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\n(for a summary of points skip to TL;DR)\\n\r\nYuri on Ice features a plot that is, to me, fresh and unique for a series about sports.\\n\r\nFrom the get-go what sets it apart from your typical sports anime is clear. To start with, our main cast is not in high school. Although one character in the trio is a teenager (he\u2019s 15, to be precise), the main focus is on our protagonist and his coach, who are 23 and 27 respectively. Having mature, full-grown adults lead the narrative means that there are a lot of stereotypical conflicts that can be avoided, and it gives the show a different flavor. There\u2019s no \u201cwhat to do after graduation\u201d or \u201cmy favorite senior is leaving\u201d subplot, no \u201cwe\u2019re young and stupid and we\u2019ll do anything to win\u201d motivating factor- the tone of the series is a lot more realistic and the story itself is grounded by it.\\n\r\nThe other distinguishing factor is, our main character isn\u2019t inexperienced or \u201cbad\u201d at his sport. Despite what his personal narration might have us believe, he\u2019s essentially Japan\u2019s ace in figure skating, and talented enough to make it to the world Grand Prix final by himself. He\u2019s not learning figure skating over from scratch - he\u2019s learning what he loves about it, and why he skates.\\n\r\nMoving on to the matter of the plot, we\u2019re given a scenario where someone has fallen out of the spotlight, hit a road bump in the journey of life. Katsuki Yuuri is 23 and good at what he does but he\u2019s missing something. He\u2019s not confident. Yuri on Ice is about how he finds that something, finds the will and wish to keep fighting. In that way, it\u2019s the best kind of \u201cmotivational story\u201d, the sort that says you don\u2019t just have one shot at life when you\u2019re a teenager and ready to Take On The World, that says you can turn things around at any time.\\n\r\nYuri on Ice encompasses various themes, such as love (in all its shapes and forms) and life (how to live it, how to love it). It also embodies key messages which I think are highly relevant to our modern world, such as how life doesn\u2019t end after you pass your teen years and hit your twenties, or that you are more than your fears and anxieties. There\u2019s always a second chance. In that way this series carries a message that is sure to instill in its viewers some hope for themselves. It\u2019s riveting, optimistic, and endearing, while maintaining a mature, fairly objective perspective.\\n\r\nIn terms of actual plot there\u2019s not much I can say for fear of ruining the story, but one thing I have to commend is how a certain reveal in the later half of the series becomes a massive plot point that changes our perception of one very special main character. This isn\u2019t a story that\u2019s predictable by any means. Just like Viktor Nikiforov, who lives to surprise his audience, it seems Kubo (the series\u2019 original creator), too, loves taking her viewers by surprise. Yuri on Ice is unpredictable up until the very last moment, and that makes it an exciting experience for first-time viewers. And while unpredictable, it also makes heavy use of foreshadowing to drop plot points and details that might confuse you at first, but all make sense when given context in later episodes. Rewatching the series is another experience in itself because you do it in an almost entirely different light.\\n\r\nBut I haven\u2019t addressed the elephant in the room yet, have I?\\n\r\nYuri on Ice is gay. Yes. It\u2019s gay as hell but it\u2019s also subtly gay, quietly gay, it\u2019s gay without it being the main point of the story, it\u2019s gay but not once does it allow the queerness of its characters to define itself. You\u2019re given a romance between two males that isn\u2019t fetishized, exploited, mistreated. It\u2019s a romance that\u2019s written with respect, and I have to commend Kubo for that. There is a turning point near the middle of the series that really spells things out for you, and after that every interaction between the two characters involved is painted with love, care, and adoration. The nature of their relationship is never outright stated in-series, yet it\u2019s clear as day how they feel for each other.\\n\r\n(Bonus: Kubo herself stated indirectly through a tweet on her official twitter account that Yuri on Ice is, basically, a world without homophobia. The love portrayed here is organic, normalized, and treated with respect. It\u2019s a beautiful thing.)\\n\r\nWhich brings me to another point about the storytelling in Yuri on Jce. If you grew up used to western media and their habit of favoring straightforwardness over subtlety, then Yuri on Ice might strike you as funny. They never say they\u2019re in love! So who\u2019s to say they really are? That argument could be valid in a show produced in the west, but Yuri on Ice is a piece of eastern media. Subtlety is the name of the game here. But fear not, it still delivers when we need it to, and the little quirks and affectionate interactions it divulges are priceless and wonderful.\\n\r\nOn the whole, the pacing for the series may seem a bit fast at times, but given that it\u2019s a one-cour series with such high ambitions I think it\u2019s to be expected. Perhaps with more episodes we could\u2019ve had more time to develop our side characters. Perhaps with more episodes we could have more scenes off the ice. But MAPPA wasn\u2019t given that liberty, and I think they made the best of what they had. Apart from slight pacing issues I think Yuri on Ice\u2019s story is brilliantly constructed, unique, and heartfelt. It\u2019s imbued with positivity without being cheesy or overbearing, and remains mostly grounded in reality. While the story is mostly serious, it gives us moments of pure comedic gold at times and manages to jump from one atmospheric moment to another without much of a problem. Watching every episode is an emotional rollercoaster - the best kind where you don\u2019t fall off and the loops don\u2019t make you feel sick but give you a nice, heady rush.\\n\r\nYuri on Ice is a narrative that manages to be completely sound, utilize foreshadowing effectively, and draw parallels between moments in older episodes and newer ones. The ending, without spoiling anything, manages to be completely satisfying while thoroughly offensive at the same time because of how good it is. Everything comes full circle. It does everything in the book of Good Narratives right. It\u2019s an alarming feat for a one-cour original anime series.\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nYuri on Ice is a sports anime that transcends the boundaries of sports anime with a unique new narrative and organic, character-driven conflict. It balances out comedy and serious moments with careful maneuvering of scenes and plot points, and features a gay romance that doesn\u2019t override the main narrative but rather becomes part of it. The themes of the series are uplifting, meaningful, and carefully woven into its plot. Overall, it\u2019s very well-written and definitely worthy of a 10 in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nYuri on Ice\u2019s animation in episode 1 is probably one of the most gorgeous things I\u2019ve ever laid my eyes on. Of course, that\u2019s because it\u2019s the first episode, but we can, for the most part, apply that notion to every frame after that for the next 11 episodes.\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to address the art and animation in Yuri on Ice in two separate categories: general art and animation, and skating art and animation.\\n\r\nFirst, as Yuri on Ice is an ice skating anime, naturally a lot of screentime is devoted to elaborate skating choreography and routines. Stay Close To Me is easily the best-animated, and if you\u2019re looking for something that properly represents what Yuri on Ice as an aesthetic piece of art is, then that performance in episode 1 is definitely the way to go. However, the quality of skating segments does falter sometimes as the series continues.\\n\r\nBut wait! Yuri on Ice isn\u2019t a Dreamworks Animation production with a USD 160,000,000 production budget. In fact, it\u2019s got a budget of perhaps USD 1,500,000, which is straight up 1% of what western blockbuster animation movies get. Now, add on the fact that figure skating is a sport where you\u2019re constantly moving, where you\u2019re basically dancing on ice - there\u2019s a lot more nuance the animators had to capture in their animation than, say, a jump for a smash-hit in badminton or a dash across the court in basketball. So the characters may have been off-model at times, so the camera pans might have come off as flat after a while- trust me when I tell you that Yuri on Ice delivers where it really, really needs to. It delivers.\\n\r\nMoving on, let\u2019s talk about general animation. Off the ice, the characters are generally well-animated and detail is given where it\u2019s needed. The series also plays with a lot of different lightings, using contrasting cool and warm color palettes generously to dictate the feel of a particular scene. Due attention is given to close-ups; you can always tell when a scene is important because of the sheer amount of effort that goes into animating every minute detail.\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not just generic detailing, you can tell they\u2019ve really thought things through and settled on what they want to emphasize in certain scenes. It\u2019s the little things, like the tremble of a hand, the glint of metal, the soft shine and faint pink tinge of lips in motion, that tell you that these animators care about what they\u2019re creating. Yuri on Ice is a series animated with love.\\n\r\nI\u2019m giving it a 9 in this category.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Yuri on ice is great. It features a wild array of instruments, music genres, and styles. I'm not an expert in music, but considering they had to have upwards of twenty, thirty individual songs made for the routines alone, each one is pretty well produced. If you include the simple, lilting piano OSTs that play during emotional scenes, then you're good to go on a trip that will bring you to tears. Either way, you're bound to end up with a favorite or two at the end of it all.\\n\r\nThat aside, for the sound effects that came from skating they recorded the sound of the choreographer they worked with\u2019s skating, so each scrape of the blade on ice, each sharp thud with a land, all of these are almost frightfully real.\\n\r\nThe tight sound effects and wonderful OSTs, combined with tasteful timing and appropriate music choices, add to the immersive experience of watching Yuri on ice. Sound gets a 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nSee: Katsuki Yuuri.\\n\r\n10/10.\\n\r\n\u2014is what I\u2019d like to say, but I\u2019m obligated to go in-depth into things, so I'll do that.\\n\r\nThe characters in Yuri on Ice may seem like cookie-cutter models at first, but as the story unfolds you learn more and more about their personalities and motivations, and (cliche though it sounds) they really will surprise you. Particularly Katsuki Yuuri, who is, I would venture to say, the most well-developed, realistic, and sympathetic character I\u2019ve seen in recent years. Don\u2019t let his weak narration in episode 1 fool you - you\u2019re in for a wild ride with him as the protagonist of the series.\\n\r\nWhile its characters have their fair share of strengths and flaws, Kubo takes it a step beyond so as to hint at what exactly led them to be the way they are today. Everything is deceptively simple on the surface and deep as Mariana\u2019s Trench when you look closer. I think what really makes these characters work is that they\u2019re genuine. They\u2019re real. Katsuki Yuuri may have anxiety, but he hates losing. He\u2019s headstrong. He\u2019s bad at dealing with fans. Viktor Nikiforov may have lost his way in life but he\u2019s still fighting, he\u2019ll still do things on a whim and try his hand at everything and anything. He has a dog. The dog is his best friend. He took the dog with him when he leaves on that whim.\\n\r\nOur main cast is lovable, but the side characters, too, get far more development than you would expect from a one-cour anime. Yuri on Ice treats every character with respect, with love, as though each one deserves all the time on screen in the world (though they don\u2019t get it).\\n\r\nBeing an anime about the international figure skating scene, we\u2019re introduced to a lot of characters from different countries. None of them fall into the pitfalls of stereotyping by nationality, thankfully, and they\u2019re all lovable and have their own quirks and personalities. When the series hits its peak, we also learn that they have their own motivations for winning. You can tell that Kubo hasn\u2019t slacked on anything, not even with writing so-called minor characters.\\n\r\nOf course, when we put this all together, the dynamic between everyone is sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartwarming. Yuri on Ice succeeds here by making the rivalries between everyone friendly rather than toxic. There\u2019s no murderous subplot or decade-long grudge hiding under some amicable smile. They\u2019re just a bunch of teens, young adults, adults, that want to win, but want to stay friends through it all. The consistently supportive atmosphere means things almost never turn sour between anyone (though for story\u2019s sake we do get to see some conflict break out between our main cast), and we can enjoy the series the way it is without unnecessary drama or conflict.\\n\r\nTo put it one way, Yuri on Ice has no antagonist, but it still manages itself so well because Katsuki Yuuri is his own antagonist. He is his biggest hurdle. He is what\u2019s holding him back. And a lot of conflict stems from how he views himself and those around him, which is not only a very organic way to create character-based conflict, but also painful to watch, because Yuuri is painfully relatable to almost everyone. He\u2019s an incredible character, and the growth he sustains throughout these twelve episodes is awe-inspiring.\\n\r\nOf course, not forgetting our world champion Viktor Nikiforov! He\u2019s the hot foreigner who is s whimsical and smooth and, well, hot. But he\u2019s a lot more than just hot, as the story eventually reveals. Viktor\u2019s growth is shown in a more quiet, subtle way than Yuuri\u2019s, but it still happens, and the landmarks for it are Big. He\u2019s also another breaker of anime character molds, though because his growth is tied into the narrative I can\u2019t say much on the specifics.\\n\r\nIn short, Yuri on Ice\u2019s characters are genuine, relatable, and crafted with love and care. While being a diverse group of people, they avoid both racial and general anime stereotypes, and for the main cast great care is put into the development of their multi-faceted persons. These are not flat characters, they are the sum of their experiences and memories and imperfections. Also, Katsuki Yuuri should win an award. Some kind of award. Anything\u2019s good.\\n\r\nSo, a 10 here, too.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI have not followed an anime week-by-week through its airing season since Kekkai Sensen happened, and even then sometimes I forgot that the subs were out and would watch it two or three days later. Every night for ten weeks now I have stayed up until 4 a.m. to catch the live broadcast of Yuri!!! On ICE. It\u2019s ridiculous how much this show has affected me. It\u2019s made my life 300 times better and ruined me. To see a world where homophobia doesn\u2019t exist, where mental illness is treated as something normal, and not a weakness, is something I never thought I\u2019d see in an anime in my life. Kubo Mitsurou is a blessing to the world.\\n\r\nHow could I give this anything but a full 10/10? I\u2019d be lying if I cut the score any lower than that.\\n\\n\r\n(BONUS- messages Yuri on Ice carries with it because I\u2019m a sap:\\n\r\n-you are more than your mental illness\\n\r\n-your failures do not define you\\n\r\n-it\u2019s never too late to pursue your dreams and turn things around, whether you\u2019re 15, 25, or 50\\n\r\n-love does not complete you. It makes you a better whole\\n\r\n-true love exists\\n\r\n-there is a place you can\u2019t reach unless you have a dream too large to bear alone)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nYuri on Ice\u2019s opening theme, History Maker, is a more accurate summary of the series than I could ever come up with myself. It\u2019s really made history, in so many ways that I couldn\u2019t possibly list them all at once. It\u2019s taken what might be considered a niche sport and turned it into something wonderful and beautiful and, importantly enough, possible to appreciate for a bunch of anime-watching folks that probably were just looking for a good time.\\n\r\nThis is a review, but it\u2019s also a request. If you\u2019re here, on this page, reading this right now, and you\u2019re sitting on the fence with the spikes digging into your butt, wondering, \u201cshould I watch Yuri on Ice?\u201d then I implore you with all my heart to give it a chance. It\u2019s so much more than what the horrible people who call it shameless pandering and fanservice will ever be able to understand. The reviews here are not an accurate reflection of how the fans of Yuri on Ice feel about the series as a whole, and I am willing to bet majority of those who laughed at it for being \u201cyaoi\u201d have seen exactly three and a half seconds of the first episode.\\n\r\nThis series is a work of art. It saved 2016.\\n\r\nSee, Yuri on Ice is that best friend you never knew you had. You\u2019ve been looking for them all along, you just never knew it.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "People who do not like Yuuri!!! on Ice have obviously missed the point of the series.\r\nYOI is phenomenal. It shows, doesn't tell. The characters are complex and deep, realistic, and the narrative touches on issues such as anxiety and depression, but only if you are paying attention.\r\nYou see, this is not a series for those who are expecting a casual watch. This is a series for those who tend to analyze, and think deeper. I REPEAT: THIS IS A STORY FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO ANALYZE AND THINK DEEPLY. If you want a series where the answers are handed to you, THIS IS NOT IT.It is a narrative where a lot of things are supposed to be connected by the viewer. They will not tell you Yuuri has an anxiety disorder. The will not tell you that Viktor was battling major depression. They will not tell you why Yurio wants to beat Yuuri so bad. They give you clues and lead you there, but connecting the dots and knowing what is happening is YOUR responsibility, and much like a lot of Eastern media it is not meant to be viewed through a Western lens.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, people will argue that a series SHOULD tell you things. And it does. Yuuri on Ice tells us Viktor Nikiforov is a well accomplished figure skater, yet he was willing to give it all up in an instant, in any way, to get out of it. We know that Yuuri Katsuki panics on the ice and the things he says don't quite add up to the things we see. We know that Yuri Plisetsky is a hot headed, young, talented skater who can't seem to grasp the notion of unconditional love. Why? Sometimes you get straightforward answers (i.e. the amazing plot twist in episode 10) yet sometimes bits and pieces are sprinkled within different episodes. Sometimes you will learn something, which makes information from multiple episodes ago make a lot more sense. This series is MEANT to be looked at from every angle to understand characters ambitions, thoughts, actions. Just like real life. And it's GOOD that way. That is WHY it's so amazing. Rarely is there a series where I am excited for the next, next, next episode because I want to understand the characters more. Because I want to know what the motivation for this decision was. Just like in real life, you do not know everything right off the bat. You have to be patient and attentive, and you are rewarded for it.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll see I rated this series a 10, and that's because it truly is a masterpiece. There will never be any series that surpasses YOI. I will never be satisfied with another piece of media as much as I was with this one. I will never be as excited weekly for another show to come out. I will be hard pressed to find better, more fleshed out and complex and realistic characters than I did here. There is nothing about Yuuri on Ice that I do not adore. The music, the animation, the characters, the kinds of love shown throughout the series, everything. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't want to take the time to have a deeper understanding of the series, then this is not a show for you. But if you're willing to pay attention, then you will be rewarded with likely the best series of this decade. And this isn't an over exaggeration; I truly believe nothing will be better than Yuuri on Ice for a very, very long time.",

            "content": "WARNING: This review contains (some) spoiler elements \u2014 without which the problematic aspects of the show could not possibly be discussed \u2014 and makes use of language that is not entirely PG-13.\r\nProceed at your own risk.\u00a0\r\n---------------\r\nAhh, Yuri!!! on ICE. Possibly the highest-praised, most-watched anime of this season.\r\nSo popular it is, I\u2019ve had to blacklist like eight different tags on tumblr to spare my eyes of it. This thing is fucking everywhere. And don\u2019t get me wrong, its popularity is not the problem here; hell, I was expecting to be right aboard the bandwagon, right at the front, driving the goddamn train.\r\nWhen I made my list\u00a0forstuff I\u2019ll chew this season, it was right at the top in terms of anticipation; from the synopsis alone, it sounded exactly like my kind of thing \u2014 figure skating is an old love of mine, and the promise of beautiful animation drew me right in. (Though IRL I prefer watching female figure-skaters, it\u2019s still a novel thing in anime, and, well. You take what you can. Discounting Onna\u2019s brief figure skating scene in Death Parade, and maybe some romantic \u201clet\u2019s go skating\u201d type of dates in shoujo, I legitimately cannot remember seeing it elsewhere off the top of my head.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd I tried to stay optimistic about it. An optimism that lasted about two episodes, until the crass, bleak humor (weight jokes, really? frig right off, mate) and the wildly fluctuating quality of animation began to make it jet-pack right outta this mess.\\n\\n\r\nLittle did I know, those two things would end up being the more minor of my issues with the show.\\n\\n\r\n---------------\\n\\n\r\nSTORY & CHARACTERS \u300c 1 / 10 \u300d\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t let the synopsis fool you; this is not an enjoyable tale of sportsmanship and high-voltage rivalries that make sparks fly on the rink. Russian Yuri gives up on winning back Victor\u2019s tutelage before the season is even half through (and he never had it to begin with, turns out).\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nEven if that doesn\u2019t particularly bother you (and you\u2019re here just for the hot guys and the homoerotic subtext that \u201cisn\u2019t subtext at all\u201d), the whole thing is extremely ill-paced: important plot (ha, plot. what plot?) elements are only mentioned as an \u201cOh, yeah, by the way---\u201d kind of afterthought, while moments which are supposed to be either tense / suspenseful or dramatic fall flat. It\u2019s very shoddy work, and while I was still willing to forgive it, the show did two things: fucked up in the animation department, and then the...\u201dromance\u201d happened.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s be very clear on one thing here: if you\u2019re straight, you write gay relationships \u2014 especially those involving characters of the sex opposite yours \u2014 at your own risk.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nBecause 99% of the time you will fail, and you will fail hard.\\n\\n\r\nPeople like to praise the show for being \u201cprogressive\u201d (and about a bajillion other terms that mean the same thing and are mindlessly thrown around) in including (and centering its focus on) a canonically gay, canonically engaged / soon to be married couple, they fail to recognize (or willfully ignore, and I\u2019m not sure which is worse) the problems with Victor and Y\u016bri\u2019s relationship. In plain English: this is a gay couple written by a straight woman. A gay MALE couple which has your stereotypical heterosexual dynamics.\\n\\n\r\nI feel the need to stress this.\\n\\n\r\nStereotypical. Heterosexual. Dynamics.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, despite what you\u2019d think, relationships between people of the same sex don\u2019t work the way stereotypical straight ones do. Hell, most healthy relationships of any kind don\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t work like that. It\u2019s a common misconception that gay people mimic straight ones and it bugs the shit out of me. Most depictions in media (which are not written by actual gay people, that is) give in to this misconception, and from thereon it becomes clear at who the product is aimed at. A little like lesbian porn, if you will.\\n\\n\r\n(Hint: it ain\u2019t for the lesbians!)\\n\\n\r\nLet me put it another way: this is little more than veiled yaoi, and it\u2019s not particularly tasteful yaoi at that.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does Y\u016bri refer to himself as the \u201cwoman\u201d who seduces the playboy, they even fit your standard seme/uke stereotypes, with Victor being a hetare/wanko seme (a devoted loser, basically) dressed as a \u201ccool\u201d type at first glance, and Y\u016bri being the sasoi (seductive) uke dressed in an \u201ceveryman\u201d type\u2019s clothes. Hell, these combinations of character types, as well as the dynamic between them, literally form one of the two most basic, stereotypical types of  relationship found in the genre.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAnd, you know, this would\u2019ve been less of a problem if at least the characters were interesting beyond this. It wouldn\u2019t have made it forgivable \u2014 I hold the opinion that you should be honest about what you do and especially about what you write, and trying to sell me yaoi labeled as a \u201cgood romance\u201d is a filthy, filthy lie \u2014 but it would\u2019ve made it bearable. Perhaps even slightly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the characters weren\u2019t interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s like the author opened up tvtropes, cracked her knuckles, and set about finding and writing the most basic characters she could, structuring each of them around a particular trope or \u201ctype\u201d. Everyone in this show is flat, and I don\u2019t mean in terms of breast size. There\u2019s no character development, either, despite what some fans of it will try to tell you (though this doesn\u2019t particularly bother me in a show, to be honest, so this at least is a neutral point in my book); it\u2019s all one big onion, making me more frustrated with every layer I peel and put aside.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a parade of stereotypes, flattened to absolute thinness.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy, what little of it is there, is...lackluster. Downright terrible at times, really. And not in a good, shitty pun kind of way. Likewise for the dramatic moments, which manage to be boring rather than induce an \u201coh no my babies!\u201d reaction.\\n\\n\r\n---------------\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION \u300c 2 / 10 \u300d\\n\\n\r\nOh, god, where do I even begin.\\n\\n\r\nLook, I know I cannot expect ridiculously HQ animation in every episode of an anime, not every studio is ufotable \u2014 who at this point can probably open their own damn bank \u2014 but if you know your budget is not that large, you generally do two things: conserve it so it\u2019s steady throughout and bring out the big guns on moments that truly matter. You\u2019d think those moments would be the skating montages and maybe the Big Damn Kiss moment, but...they aren\u2019t. I mean the kiss itself was decently animated, if cowardly camouflaged, but the skating montages? No. Instead we got HQ animations of Victor\u2019s (admittedly shapely) butt.\\n\\n\r\nWonderful.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not even that big of a loss, in retrospect, which is where another big problem arises: whoever choreographed and thought up these routines did a very shitty job. Sorry not sorry about the language but, honestly, subtlety can\u2019t convey how bummed I am about this. Part of me was glad to not see this much bad choreography in HQ, even though that would probably have helped it be at least somewhat better.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering they got an actual former figure skater in on the job, this is a huge let-down.\\n\\n\r\nThe moves are repetitive, and the fact that frequently the animation wasn\u2019t at least half as good as it could\u2019ve been, made pretty much every skating montage \u2014 except perhaps the one Y\u016bri does when copying Victor\u2019s old routine, which I begrudgingly admit was nice \u2014 extremely disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the character designs are poorly done (beyond every character fitting a certain Character Type\u2122, so that the myriad of fangirls can Pick A Favorite \u2014 which is unimaginative, but not bad by itself). I expect a certain flamboyance and creativity when it comes to figure skating, but here the costumes just ended up looking either badly sewn-together or silly, the kind of thing a kid would wear for Halloween, or both. Kitschy, for all its oddities, is not a word I generally associate with the sport. And it\u2019s one that I frankly wish I don\u2019t have to associate with it ever again.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of consistency in animation, the bad choreography, the designs that alternate between ridiculous and boring, make for an absolute cringe-fest. Surprising, considering the director, but I guess all of us have bad days.\\n\\n\r\n---------------\\n\\n\r\nSOUND \u300c 5 / 10 \u300d\\n\\n\r\nThe voice cast was...nice, I suppose (I don\u2019t remember anyone\u2019s VA but Victor\u2019s, and that\u2019s because I\u2019m a fan of Junichi Suwabe). The soundtrack on the other hand is extremely forgettable \u2014 I genuinely only remember the opening, and even that very vaguely; I didn\u2019t particularly like it and thus tended to skip past \u2014 so I cannot pronounce myself there. Generally sound doesn\u2019t matter much to me past the VAs\u2019 performances, as this makes for a huge part of the characters, but in a show that is (supposedly) about figure skating, this did come off as something of a disappointment. Music should complement a routine, even add to it, but here it did a big whoop of nothing.\\n\\n\r\n---------------\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT \u300c 1 / 10 \u300d\\n\\n\r\nIf it wasn\u2019t clear enough \u2014 I did not enjoy this. With every new episode I felt my horror increase as the show kept getting worse while at the same time somehow amassing an even bigger fanbase and even more praise it was, in my opinion, deeply undeserving of.\\n\\n\r\nYuri!!! on ICE is not a good anime. It\u2019s not even a mediocre one. It\u2019s terrible, even if only because it tries to pretend it\u2019s something it\u2019s not: an effort to be inclusive. I\u2019d call SJW bullshit on this, had it really been aimed at actual gay people and not at the hordes of gullible fangirls who want to feel good about their fetishization of homosexuality, who have found in this series a virtual gold mine that they can point at and present as proof they \u201csupport the gays\u201d when confronted or otherwise called out.\\n\\n\r\nActually, you know what, I\u2019m gonna call SJW bullshit on it anyway. Many of its fans, from what I\u2019ve seen, tend to fall into the category of straw, third-wave feminists. The author (Kubo) strikes me as one, too.\\n\\n\r\n---------------\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL \u300c 2 / 10 \u300d\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d sooner shoot myself in the foot than go near this again. I\u2019m probably going to eat my pride and beat my completion OCD into submission when the second season will air. And it will air, don\u2019t doubt it \u2014 this has birthed a franchise that has the potential to become more milkable than SAO.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nI guess there\u2019s some sort of sweet, vicious sense of retribution in the capitalization off of its thirsty fans (anything can become popular if there\u2019s a plain enough self-insertable MC or the chance of two guys touching dicks \u2014 and YOI manages to deliver both, as switching Y\u016bri\u2019s gender does fuck-all to change the story, so really, in a sense it\u2019s a show for everyone), but it\u2019s a small comfort that cannot wash out the bad taste I\u2019ve been left with.",

            "content": "Pardon any typos below. If you're one that appreciates character development, you'll find yourself relating to many characters in the show.\r\nYuri!! on Ice is a beautiful and moving story with a main character that's capable of relating to anybody and everybody in the slightest.\r\nHe's unique in that he he showcases vulnerability and holds doubts about his abilities to achieve gold medal. He's not perfect and he knows it. He holds doubts, but still keeps his determination (although not at first). \r\nWith the help of establishing an intimate relationship with Victor, it was refreshing to see Yuuri develop more interpersonal relationships with his opponents alongside strengtheninghimself on the intrapersonal level.\\n\\n\r\nI appreciate how fleshed out the characters were (main and minors), it was consistent in foiling/juxtaposing against the healthy relationship between Yuuri and Victor. Each opponent had a unique character to them as well as their own strengths and weaknesses which kind of shines light on what Yuuri himself needs to hone in.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it's good and the animations are your standard animation. They emphasizes more detail in more significant scenes but the level of detail is inconsistent when it comes to performances. It can be choppy and awkward but it's not horrific.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few iconic sounds in here (other than the OP and ED) and most of the soundtracks for the main characters are accompanied by their own personal taste and compliments their personalities. Perhaps the most beautiful track is Yuuri's free-skate (also titled \"Yuri on Ice\")\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the storyline, the anime is highly enjoyable and I appreciate the production's take on portraying intimate and mutual love. The love portrayed in the anime is multi-dimensional (friendship, mentorship, romance, companionship, and more). Yes, one can say that his anime is very gay, but it does so without attaching that \"shounen-ai\" tag to normalize gay/bi characters/relationships or at least mutual relationships. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I liked this anime because the characters and relationship dynamics are fun. The story is inspiring and holds sentiment that makes you connect with the emotions of the characters. The characters are hard to dislike as each have their individual strengths and weaknesses (all of them are highly commendable). There is a variety of music that goes from fun-loving to intense and gorgeous. I highly recommend anyone to watch this anime.",

            "content": "The most difficult challenge a reviewer faces when writing about this show is choosing if it should be initially referred to as \"Disappointment!!! on Ice\" or \"Queerbait!!! on Ice\". Both names are equally hard-earned and both unfortunately represent it well.\r\nBut how such a promising show ended up being so underwhelming? It has an interesting premise, very appealing character designs, previews suggested strong visual direction and great sports scenes combined with a quality soundtrack. The first two episodes were perfectly watchable. What went wrong? Well, honestly, quite much.\r\nFirstly - Yuri on Ice is surprisingly cartoonish - it heavily relies on exaggerated goofiness and chibi faces. Itdefinitely isn't a serious sports drama - its general tone is rather light-hearted and inconsequential. In itself it isn't anything wrong (although I admit it isn't what I expected), but it heavily damages its ability to create tension. And tension is something which this show sorely lacks - during ice skating performances there wasn't a single moment I felt on the edge of my seat, feeling pressure of important things being at stake. So I felt exactly the opposite one should feel watching well-executed sports anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also significantly struggles in the writing department - the script seems devoid of ideas of how to outline key events and where to go with them. It's also very repetitive - the typical episode goes as following: someone does a skating program (with all important points of it explicitly explained to us in an off-screen commentary), he is scored and then the show proceeds to the next skating program. Repeat several times. Most of events, characters backstories and development are narrated to the audience by internal monologues of skaters during those programs. It comes off jarringly unskillful. All the more the show has a penchant for introducing number of new skaters per episode, telling their stories only during their skating programs, and forgetting about them the moment they get the score. As a result the show is extremely unfocused. It jumps between skater to skater, with little connection to the main narrative, as if it wanted to fill up the time the writer had no idea how to spend better. If we combine that with questionable quality of individual lines, the fact most of side-skaters are boring and with the annoying tendency of the show to reiterate the same points over and over again we have to come to a sad conclusion: the writing is bad.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the second episode the anime doesn't excel in animation either. Quality takes a big hit, ice skating programs lack frames and key animator's polish. It makes one wonder even more strongly why this show decided to include so many of them. The soundtrack helps to save the situation a little - some of those skating programs are still quite pleasing too watch - but it's by no means enough.\\n\\n\r\nTHE NEXT PARAGRAPHS CONTAIN VAGUE SPOILERS\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally we've come to the show's main selling point - M x M romance(?). What this show plays with its main pairing is probably the most self-aware, obnoxious and dishonest baiting game I've ever seen in the medium - the anime is constantly devising the scenes building up a serious, honest, for my taste even tad too conventional, romantic relationship between two guys. But all of that in either a tongue-in-cheek or very fuzzy way. It does it so intensely at the end of the show the main pairing is almost undeniable, but at the same time as a relationship it remains totally ambiguous.\\n\\n\r\nUsually I don't mind ambiguous relationships in anime that much, I even frequently find them offering interesting storyline perspectives. Not in the case of Yuri on Ice though - this show suggests non-straight relationship in so utterly unsubtle ways they make sense narratively only if they lead to a conventional and clear romantic pairing. They don't. As a result the show ends up being extremely disingenuous and deserves only to be booed off for that.\\n\\n\r\nEven ignoring the above dishonesty the show still isn't a particularly good romance - it spends too much of its energy on setting up those little moments suggesting (never confirming!) the characters are in love to accurately capture the magic and emotion between too people drawn to each other. Since it also isn't a good sports show nor a character drama it ultimately isn't worth even a tenth of the hype it currently gets. The show might not be atrociously bad, there were clearly refreshing and interesting ideas behind it. But they were not enough.\\n\\n\r\nAll the more it doesn't really end conclusively - it only offers more promises and tells us we should wait for them to be delivered in the second season. I am not forcing anybody to do the same, but personally I'm not falling into that trap again.",

            "content": "There's probably a big diff between \"quality\" and \"thirst quencher\" and I'm gonna have to say YOI - definitive - belongs to the latter. I don't see how this should be rated so high otherwise.\r\nViktor indeed threw/temporarily stopped his career for Yuuri but that doesn't point to how big-hearted/grand act/in love he is with the guy (if in the first place they ever showed Viktor suffering from having withdrawn temporarily from his career). Viktor along with Phichit are simple creatures who take delight in life -- and this if anything really illustrated the fact for me.\r\nPlease don't be quick to throw story artistry away? Spoilers- if Yuuri's and Viktor's narration in ep 1 and ep 10 respectively didn't show you how dirt poor the production team treats storytelling as an art I don't know what might. They are very literally telling you word for word what is happening in their story. It's so blatant you can even miss the fact you're being spoonfed. They don't care about storytelling. YOI just wants to show you how enjoyable and recreational life can be. Viktor can probably just narrate \"And that's how I met the Japanese beauty, Katsuki Yuuri, and came to be engaged with him. Love, life and peace.\" and fandom will still be screaming their lungs out w/o prior context. What...\\n\\n\r\nAs some of the reviewers have put it, Yuuri's character is a joke. A complete mess. Know why? He was only born to fulfill the role of guy lover. Have we ever heard of what he thinks about ice skating w/o bringing Viktor not even seconds into his monologue? You can be influenced, sure, but if *every* monologue winds up being about Viktor I think we've got another problem coming...\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing worthy of praise is how we're missing Yuuri's actual position in the story - which we automatically assume we aren't, bc he's the protag and anything he sees is by default true. We're misled into thinking he's a rather lousy and cowardly skater but each and every ep reveals otherwise. He's got decent to great skills and if ep 10 revealed anything he's not the persona that's been presented to us on screen. Though that still doesn't make his characterization any less confusing (or maybe he just isn't thinking about anything at all) except accepting love and life as it comes? Really, YOI is ultra bland. If you walk the streets today or sit in a cafe you can see the same thing (and that's everything) that's happening in YOI. People, connections, fun, laughter.\\n\\n\r\nIt can appear to be great on the surface for portraying rl well but you guys are losing a lot of focus. Character development, plot, anguish with the sports -- there's absolutely nothing going on in YOI other than a bunch of ppl getting to enjoy their lives. It's no different from Tamako Market, Flying Witch etc in genre and you have to ask me, YOI can't even pass for a love story, not bc it doesn't have love but it's not a /story/. You don't just slap two people together and then skim right to the end saying they're in love before we have the chance to watch it happen.\\n\\n\r\nFor an ice skating show the routines are gorgeous eh? (lmao) How many times has Yuuri repeated his Eros routine now? Are they, idk, skating or flapping their arms? The frames, oh man. Do these athletes even care about ice skating beyond a recreation and a naive, selfish pursuit of getting to enjoy life?\\n\\n\r\nYOI's good enough as a slightly above mediocre, slice of life about inherently nothing (maybe lofty starlit adventures?). No it's not even about ice skating, it's about how the athletes as people /make use/ of ice skating. I think Ginban Kaleidoscope had a better focus on ice skating and it's main theme is a /love story/.\\n\\n\r\nSo... guys, please stop. Sword Art Online, Kimi no Na wa, now this. You guys are really... (coddles forehead with hand)\\n\\n\r\nYes watch it, watch YOI if you want bc it can bring you up in a bad mood (humans are so easy to get entertained) but for the love of, don't go around throwing it like some monumental trophy bc facts:\\n\\n\r\n- No. 6 did the first gay anime trope\\n\r\n- Samurai Flamenco had fun fucking with itself but had a better proposal that wasn't even intentionally gay (perspective of the guy proposing)\\n\r\n- Just go watch Ginban if you're thirsty for ice skating\\n\r\n- Watch any yaoi if you want actually, they can be unexpectedly deep (tho dramatic) for all they're worth\\n\\n\r\nYou know ppl applaud that Viktor and Yuuri are met with no resistance but I'd rather say that's the problem. Are they not gonna be met with resistance in the real world? The problem with YOI is that it pulls all these moves, have Viktor stop his career or be met with relative non-prejudice and these acts invoke a phenomenal reaction from fandom bc of the implied meaning.\\n\\n\r\nA meaning which shld only come to fruition after you've worked hard for the outcome. YOI has done nothing but skim over /any and everything/ and you get happy just from a single line narrated by a character. Next episode they're gonna goof around again and if Viktor just says \"And we got married!\" I think fandom is gonna spontaneously combust.\\n\\n\r\nYOI is almost like a fanfiction at this point -- not because it's so fantastic and unreal but wish fulfillment. Fandom is so thirsty they'll probably eat anything up. I can see what YOI's good for, but fandom has to realize they're pushing their expectations onto this show and making it sound 100x better than it really is.\\n\\n\r\nBafflingggg. I won't ever agree, letting Kiseijuu or the likes sit in the same rank at this.",

            "content": "For starters, I'd like to say that I'm not really a fan of sports anime, but I feel like this one can be appreciated even by the ones who aren't in the genre at all. \r\nSo, before I start talking about the anime itself, I would like to point out that Yuri on Ice is suuuuuper gay... To the point that is easy to understand why many nickname it \"Yaoi on Ice\". I however decided to ignore this factor of the show ( which I'm positive Yaoi fangirls will love )  and focus on pretty much anything else that it is about. Being aman that loves Yuri ( I'm talking about girl-on-girl romance/action, not the main character of this anime ), I can't show bias and let it influence my judgment. \\n\\n\r\nSo, as for the plot not really being the most original ever, Yuri on Ice has a very good narrative and overall pace, without too many interruptions or filler-like moments, although I can detect a couple of ones that lean towards fanservice. However, the development and deliver of such plot is very well done and doesn't make the viewer questioning it at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation, despite not being always as detailed as I wish it would be, remains fluid and clean, with enough frames and speed that it will make it look almost on movie level of quality. About the animation, it's noticable how it switches from a very cured style to an extremely chibi and Slice of Life-like one, very often in comedy moments, but also in more serious ones. It feels put in place well, and despite it may appear lazy, I like its use. \\n\\n\r\nThe strongest point that this anime has, is in my opinion, the music. From the opening to the ending, to the themes and songs accompanying the fabulous executions of the skaters, I found the music absolutely amazing, which is also a key factor in some performances.\\n\\n\r\nI also like how a realistic approach is used in this anime, without any special powers or eternal slow-motion moments with thousands of words of thought, it's simple and straightforward, yet it doesn't make it any less impactful. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a nice variety of characters, which have their own ways and motives to push them in what they do. We often hear their thoughts and experience their personalities that sometimes feel even deeper than the main character himself. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think that Yuri on Ice nailed perfectly its objective as a sport anime, and I honestly found it enjoyable thus far. It's admirable, since this year and for the next, there are a certain number of anime  that are also very good, with this one sharing some space in the spotlight.",

            "content": "Review, cause I'm mad, and not even at the show but this fandom for being so thirsty that they scream groundbreaking even for a pointless mess. That's what yoi is, a pointless mess, a terribly failed attempt at best, that is on the level of \"I dont even think you tried at all\". \r\nYou call it groundbreaking, I can't even call it sport anime, so I kind of wish they would erase it from the genres here, because new people might think this is what sport anime is. \r\nBut to what to put there instead? I DO NOT KNOW. Because this show is just amess. The comedy probably stands if you like this kind, it just made me hate everything even more. Sport anime? Shounen ai? NONE OF THESE HAPPENS. There is some figure skating with awful art and repetitive themes that will bore you to hell after half of the show, and then there is a flamboyant probably bisexual - as I dont really believe he was ever with a man before - who forces himself on one of his admirers. \\n\\n\r\nI can't tell you how creeped out I was with Victor after like three episodes when it became clear, the show runners suck at writing, and they won't ever tell you about their(especially HIS) real feelings. Because without discussing their real feelings for each other, Victor was a bored millionaire who came to play with this poor japanese boy OUT OF BOREDOM OF HIS OWN LIFE. He took a break from figure skating to go and fool around, pretending to be cheerful - he was so fake ohmygod - and outgoing. Like wow, ok man, there is so much to love about you. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there is Yuuri. I wish I could have a 2hours long video of that five seconds when he shouts ITS NOT LIKE THAT for the people around the table after they got their NOT-engagement rings. That is his character. I am only here to repeat It's not like I'm gay. His whole struggle to be a better skaters from episode one is gone with Victor showing up and starting to fool around with him. Everything is just Victor Victor Victor/It's not like that It's not like that. And that is not what sport anime stands for! But also not what a supposed groundbreaker anime with gay line should be. It shouldn't be VAGUE if it's groundbreaker. There shouldn't be room for doubt for anyone, but that can't be right? Because Japan is too conservative. Oh please, then what's the point of doing an anime with EXAGGERATED AND WITH THAT ANNOYING gay in it, if you will just back out at every last second? This is not how you change people's opinion about gay people. Not with making them flamboyant and fake without actually talking about their feelings so people could see love between two men can be just as sweet as any other. \\n\\n\r\nThis story was a mess. You can't take it seriously for the sport or the love, but not even for the comedy which sucked. And no, I won't talk about the other characters as they did not matter for the show. Poor Yuri was supposed to be a main, and he was just mostly ignored because they added unnecessary showing off scenes for Victor instead of cutting some extra minutes to make his character deeper. But still, he was the only sport anime like character. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there is also no point of talking about a story, as there is hardly one. The show and with that you all who liked it, only care for the gay so what's the point? People'll watch it for the gay that everybody shouts about, then if they know not much about anime/sport anime they'll scream it's great, the others who saw way too many queerbaiting already will probably be creeped out like me - because just how could the makers go so overboard and still be freaking chickens, I do not understand. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, listen to people who say the art sucks. It is like the whole show. At first glance you see it's something shiny and good, but then you go deeper and it's ugly and undetailed. Also the repetitiveness will bore you to death. There was more creativity to SWIMMING in Free than to the skating here. And I was so hyped for the skating, so I just want to shout into the makers face for not even satisfying me with that. \\n\\n\r\nAnd just please. PLEASE. Stop comparing it to No6, you are utterly disrespectful to everything that story stands for everytime you say they are on the same level.",

            "content": "Yuri on Ice is, in my opinion, a mediocre anime that was held back more by its topic of choice and the 12 episode limit than the overall directing. It does, however, bring issues from both.\r\nWhen animating other sports such as ping pong, tennis, and even football, you can often make short-cuts and get away with occasional stiff movements. However, ice skating is a much more visual sport, requiring the animator to be skillful in translating every body movement in order to capture the same sort of magic. As a result, the technical mistakes made in Yuri on Ice leave more of an impression thanthey would otherwise have in any other show. This was especially apparent in many of Yuri\u2019s earlier skates where many scenes were often choppy and Yuri himself was barely even recognizable at certain points. Is this the studio\u2019s fault? Overall, I would (mostly) say no. MAPPA did an overall excellent job, particularly in the performances in the last two episodes, even including details like Victor spinning around in tandem with Yuri during his skates. The fault here lies more with how demanding ice skating is to animate rather than the incompetence of MAPPA\u2019s well-known animating team. Nevertheless, the oscillating quality of animation still undermines the impact of some of the individual performances, and I can't help but imagine that if MadHouse embarked on this same project that the animation quality and the number of sakuga-worthy scenes would increase.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, as someone who is not familiar with ice skating myself, Yuri on Ice left much to be desired. Many skating techniques such as the triple salchow and quads were shown throughout the course of the show, but the show never fully explained why the moves were so difficult and demanding other than showing skater errors (which helps convey an image, but can only go so far). While the skaters practice as demonstrated by their montages, they never practice individual techniques and only serve to create a general picture, so the viewer can only vaguely assume how hard the jumps are and what sacrifices the athlete had to make in order to compensate for it during the actual performances. It removes much of the emotion and thrill that would be there otherwise. Additionally, the development of Yuri\u2019s skating ability was primarily done through a combination of self-monologue and superficial errors. While the latter element was conveyed well, as a viewer I was more interested in seeing more improvement in the overall choreography rather than just in the jumps; I often had to rely on the commentary rather than the visuals in this regard, which is counter-intuitive for a sport like ice skating. Admittedly, Yuri demonstrating his first skate and free skate eventually felt repetitive, and the differences between each skate became less noticeable. This is indicative of real competitions, but it can eventually get droning to watch given how often we see Yuri skate. The monologues is a directing choice that I\u2019m more split on personally. It distracts from the actual performance taking place, but it is in many cases unavoidable given the 12 episode limit and ergo the small pockets of time the characters are given to develop outside of the competitions. I personally felt that certain monologues often interfered with the show, but I can\u2019t think of many ways to address the issue.\\n\\n\r\nThis ties into my next point, which is that I found most of the characters to be boring. I didn\u2019t find them visually unappealing since many of them (for the most part) had distinguishable and vibrant designs (and as a Korean, I am grateful that they didn\u2019t design the Korean representative horribly as some anime/manga occasionally tend to do). What I found boring were their personalities, or rather the lack of development and background given to each of them. Whether it\u2019s Otabek, Leo, or Christophe, we\u2019re often granted only momentary backgrounds into each of these characters, during the performances themselves no less when we\u2019re supposed to be focusing on the visuals. I would\u2019ve much preferred that Yuri on Ice follow the footsteps of other great sports manga/anime like Ping Pong and Eyeshield 21 and focus more development outside of the competitions rather than only during them. Yurio\u2019s development was especially affected by this as well despite being the secondary protagonist. Much of the screen time was given to Yuri, so a good chunk of Yurio\u2019s development came from during the skates than outside of it. Even in the last two episodes, both Christophe and Phichit were barely given more than three minutes of screen time for their routines, which is barely acceptable. I can\u2019t wholly blame the director for this though as the 12 episode limit cripples the potential for a variety of possible character development. Regardless, I found it hard to care about many of the supporting cast and what the medals meant to them with only brief, momentary expositions.\\n\\n\r\nTo highlight a character, I had trouble figuring out whether or not I liked the inclusion of Victor. It\u2019s certainly an interesting twist to have a role model and former competitor suddenly impose himself on to the main character as his coach, and it is what originally hooked me into the show in the first place. However, Victor is an extremely unrelatable character. The majority of his development is conveyed by his coaching ability juxtaposed by his perceived skating ability. However, the element is already lost since many people have very little experience being placed on a pedestal like that, much less in an area unfamiliar to many such as figure skating. In fact, the setting itself only takes place because Victor was not entertained as his status as a competitor since his ability was so far ahead of the rest. That is a feeling and emotion that already cannot be properly conveyed to the viewers. As a result, while I enjoyed the companionship between Yuri and Victor, I did not find his personal development nor the one shared with Yuri as viscerally evoking as I thought it would be.\\n\\n\r\nTo highlight another character, I greatly enjoyed the inclusion of JJ, despite having as much exposition as the rest of the minor characters. Initially portrayed as an unbeatable figure with unshakable pride nailing every jump skillfully without fail, he is the first one to be crippled by the pressure of competing on the grand stage. The difference in the two is so massive that I couldn\u2019t help but be taken slightly aback by the character\u2019s emotions. JJ initially served as a great antagonist through his sheer ability as a skater and his endless confidence, but the director chose to show an interesting development by exploring one of the many elements of being a skater, and what better way to do it than by tearing down the most powerful opponent? This was one of the few developments I greatly enjoyed (though I was miffed that his performance still allowed him to receive a 3rd place), and I would have liked that the show tried to explore more personality diversity this way than through the aforementioned expositions.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to highlight the third and final character, who in my opinion is one of the better characters in the anime. This character does not exist. What I mean to say is that Yuri on Ice does not have a forced antagonist that is meaninglessly vitriolic. While it may occasionally work in other genres, it often does not work in the sports genre as such characters are usually overdramatized and don\u2019t push the narrative forward in any other way other than to be unnecessarily obnoxious. I realize I am harping on this trope a bit too much when I think it can be done well with proper care (Agon from Eyeshield 21 is a good example of this). That being said, I\u2019m glad that such a character did not exist as he would have run counter to the overall atmosphere of the show and surely would\u2019ve had dragged it down further.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few things I want to mention before I close out this review. This anime had a fantastic soundtrack, and for the international aspect that this anime tried to capture, it was done wonderfully, extracting all types of music ranging from classical to rock. Many of these were not sung by Japanese (or at least I couldn\u2019t tell the difference) which is a great attention to detail that helped make the setting feel more genuine. If there is one minor thing I really disliked, it was how Yuri\u2019s Love Eros skate was designed to model after a katsu-don than actual love. Even for Yuri on Ice\u2019s standards that\u2019s just a bit too silly, and never in any of my times witnessing that skate did I ever receive an image that even vaguely reminded me of a katsu-don. The material for stolen love was even right there in the form of Yuuko. That\u2019s just one example, but the point is that I really didn\u2019t find the Katsu-don imagery that appropriate, an impression that I only grew more confident in each time I saw Yuri skate Love Eros.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend Yuri on Ice? Sadly, no I wouldn\u2019t; despite being clearly well-thought and superficially well-made, there are too many core issues ranging from character development to pacing for me to confidently call this a solid anime. The average animation is subpar, almost all the characters are not worthy of any note, and the overall momentum of the plot leaves much to be desired. It is however original, both in the sense of its concept as a whole and the fact that it does not derive from any manga, light novel, or etcetera. It is impressive in that regard, and Yuri on Ice is not anything MAPPA should be ashamed of for such an ambitious project.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Note: There's a lot of complaints about how \"gay\" this anime seemed. While it's certainly suggestive and appeals to the female audience, it's not that bad, and I didn't think it impeded with my assessment of the show.",

            "content": "They removed my review for some bullshit reason so here it is again.\r\nOne thing I can't understand for the life of me is why so many people enjoy Yuri on Ice. I understand. Art is subjective. But so many of the comments talk about how \"great the animation is!\" or \"how great the characters are!\" Bullshit. I feel like Digibro with Re:zero. I feel like everyone else just fast-forwarded through time and is on a completely new level of meta. Shit.\r\nFirst off, the story and the writing. Garbage. Experiencing the comedy in this show is like having a warm bucket of expired milk thrust untomy face. The three kids are so out of place in every scene they're in and do nothing that any other character could have done in a less cringeworthy way. What's even worse is how the anime fails to build up tension. It's like, they don't even attempt. The show, instead of at least attempting one of its quadruple salchow axel toe shitters and landing flat on its ass, just cruises on the smooth ice as if that's satisfactory. There's no slow motion or increasing music intensity to hype us up. On episode 6, there's so many skating matches in one fucking episode I just get desensitized to them. And on top of that, there's some skating routines that actually look so repetitive and mundane and forgettable, they could fall into a background of a white wall and I still wouldn't notice them. Also, the gay moments are so high key and try-hard that it's more cringey than sexual or funny. Most sports anime with good-looking guys have very low key gay moments that don't get in the way of whatever is actually happening. Look at Haikyuu or Free Iwatobi Swim Club. Haikyuu had some overly bromance moments, and Free capitalized on shirtless guys. This anime could have capitalized on beautiful looking men, and it did with Christoph, but it looks like their only desire with the gay moments is to punch you in the face.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the animation. Supposedly the best part of this show, but it's not nearly as good as a show that depends around good animation should be. The vast majority of the good animation is during the skating matches, and even then it's not good. You'd expect a lot of fucking sakuga moments from these scenes but the only thing moving is the skater. There's not enough colours or background movement to keep me entertained. The background just zooms in and out as if that's a substitute for actual dynamics. This makes what would otherwise be an amazingly animated scene into an awkward looking movement of character designs. It's like watching a gif move on top of an image that someone is vehemently zooming in and out of. And also, a point to note here between the animation and the dialogue. The show tries to make most of its points with dialogue and internal monologue as opposed to showing us with visuals. This is fine for the educational parts of the show where they explain the technicalities of skating, but when they want to tell us that Akatsuki is struggling or that he's tired, they make Victor have an internal monologue, as opposed to showing us visuals of him wearing out and getting tired. This makes the dialogue kind of heavy-handed (for lack of a better word).\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the characters. I'm sorry, but good character designs do not make up for a lack of consistency in the characters. The cheap comedy they try to use with the characters gets in the way of their development and, personally, my connection with them. Victor looks like the kind of character I would connect with on a personal level, but the way they write comedy in random spurts gets in the way of me taking him seriously when I'm supposed to. It makes him seem less sincere. You can't just alternate between comedy and sincerity like that. Akatsuki is probably the only well written character. I feel his pain and I like the way he develops and I'm going to continue watching the show for the sole purpose of watching him develop. The Russian Yuri, however, is like Shadow the Hedgehog but far less interesting and with no superpowers whatsoever. It's like they felt the need to make one of the other main characters an edgy shitlord, and based his whole personality around that. This makes him an incredibly shallow character. You'd think we'd have more background on one of our MAIN FUCKING CHARACTERS, but nah we're good. His angst and rebellious nature are used primarily for comedic nature, so when they try to pass it off in a serious moment, it is cringe at its finest. Oh, did I mention, Akatsuki and Victor are the only real \"main characters.\" Even the Russian Yuri, at this point, is a side character who was only main for the first few episodes. I hope he never comes back.\\n\\n\r\nNow, finally, the music. Obviously shit. The OP is an EDM track that sounds like an aspiring teenage DJ tried to be Calvin Harris. The ED is another EDM track with garbage autotune, and this is coming from a Future and Chief Keef fan who also adored 808's and Heartbreak by Kanye West. The music they play during the skating scenes is so underproduced it sounds like I could have made them from Garageband loops alone. Some are alright, I guess, like Minami's, but I could have made a better soundtrack throwing filters on masturbation noises.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could sum up this show in one word, it would probably be \"cringe.\" Maybe \"lackluster,\" would also come up.",

            "content": "Yuri on Ice! is a series I never would\u2019ve given the time of day to if it weren\u2019t for other surprisingly good sports anime like Haikyuu! Or Ping Pong The Animation. However, I\u2019ve come to realize that sports anime can be some of the most relatable, since they place the viewer into a more realistic setting rather than transporting them to a mystical fantasy world where one could only dream of existing. This causes the hardships the protagonists are going through to be moreso empathized with, and their overall growth throughout the series to be better understood. The same could be said about Yuri, butthe show does have some yaoi elements that could make it less relatable to the majority of anime viewers.   \\n\\n\r\nProduced by TV Asahi (Shinsekai Yori) and Avex Pictures (Noragami Arogoto), Yuri on Ice pretty much had a precedent set for it from the beginning. The pilot episode contains some expert levels of animation and a likable cast of characters. The humor was well timed, and the skating segments were entrancing to watch. Yuri Katsuki, a once famous Japanese figure skater, has fallen from grace and decides to retire in seclusion following an abysmal performance at the World Grand Prix event. It\u2019s not that his love for skating died, it\u2019s more or less what he thought he had to do after being so embarrassed at the competition. Instead of sucking it up, Yuri does what all of us would\u2026 eat pork cutlet bowls and watch the wheels fall off on his pride.\\n\\n\r\nHis once idol and Russian skating champion, Victor Nikiforov finds out about Yuri\u2019s retirement after a video is posted of the him skating Victor\u2019s winning program. Naturally he takes it upon himself to become Yuri\u2019s coach and help him get back to form by winning the World Grand Prix the next year. Yuri on Ice is a great tale of redemption, told mostly lightheartedly, and connects the viewer to the minds of the skaters through inner monologues and flashbacks. Unlike a team sport like Haikyuu or Kuroko no Basket, this series draws heavily on the strength and focus of the individual to tell its story. Each character\u2019s ice time can almost be seen as a vignette; a glimpse into the individual\u2019s internal strife or what gives them the motivation to skate at all. It\u2019s short and sweet, allowing viewers just a taste of the sport without having much time to get boring.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest compliment I can give the anime as a whole is that it doesn\u2019t really pander to its viewers. The fujoshi themes are there, but never really seem to go overboard. Having the peculiar relationship between Victor and Yuri can be offputting to some (including myself who dropped it at episode 4 initially), but it\u2019s meant to be. Yuri doesn\u2019t even realize he\u2019s gay when he first sees Victor, causing the blossoming of their relationship to be awkward at times. Yuri as a character is obviously flawed, but through Victor he develops some \u201creal\u201d motivation and ends up reaping the benefits and takes risks to impress him. I can't say that I cared for the copious amounts of man service showing up in the anime. Chiseled, half naked men loafing about in hot springs are not high up on my enjoyment list.\\n\\n\r\nVictor, on the other hand is a character who I didn\u2019t necessarily enjoy. Serious and sensual one moment, while silly and flamboyant the next. He seemed to be a necessary evil for the thematic relevance of a yaoi relationship, but didn\u2019t strike me as \u201crelatable\u201d on any level. He certainly didn\u2019t emulate the impression I had of a world figure skating champion. The writers made up for it with Yuri Plisetsky, the Russian teenager who embodied every cutthroat high school jock whose parents pushed them to the limits. He was immature and often showed it externally, and was too young to realize how unimportant what he did really was in the grand scheme of things. His jealousy and envy of protagonist Yuri was humorous based on how unnecessary it was. The rest of the characters didn\u2019t make much of an impression to me. Many had their own backstory, but existed as little other than placeholders in Yuri\u2019s story.\\n\\n\r\nPS- I\u2019m not really sure how old those triplets were, but they sure were mature for their age\u2026 using smart phones to post videos online and explaining the rules of figure skating? Yep, seems legit.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned the animation is on point in this anime. My knowledge of ice-skating is solely from watching the Winter Olympics but the intricate detail involved with the skaters movements during their individual segments are breathtaking. i've also been told that it is technically correct as well, adding to the realism of the show. normally a focus as intense as this show has would detract from the animation in other normally a focus as intense as this show has would detract from the animation in other scenes, but Yuri on Ice does not falter here. The character models and emotions are emblazoned on their faces quite accurately, which is nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects in this anime are well timed and realistic for the subject matter. However, the music was very hit and miss for me. Some songs (especially the English ones) were hard on the ears, though most of the orchestrated tracks were well developed and presented. The OP, although catchy, was not a track I could get onboard with for some reason. The ending was much better in connecting with the anime in general, and showed the lighthearted flair Yuri on Ice is known for. Voice Acting was superb all around, and the various nationalities of the skaters in the show were illustrated effectively here.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Yuri on Ice? I'd say at least give it an episode or two of a preview. The series doesn't shy away and it'll be apparent whether or not it is a series for you. I enjoyed it for what it was, and tried not to get too wrapped up in the yaoi business, as I feel like it detracted from the overall presentation through no fault of its own. It certainly wasn't a series I thought I'd even get through, so that should speak for itself. If I could break it into a sentence it would be: \u201cA beautiful story of redemption, though not without blemishes, that takes you on a lighthearted and fun journey back to the top.\u201d An anime best viewed with less than serious intent. I'd recommend it to any fans of the sports genre looking for something new, and who aren't put off by a little more than bromance.

            "content": "There isn't really a plus side to Yuri on Ice beside being an ice skating show with guys. Although there are a few good moments and the ingredients for a sport anime are here, the love story overwhelms everything. As it unfolds, you quickly notice nothing else than romance matters: rivalry, friendship, family, other skaters and even competitions lose most of their appeal fast, sometimes to the point of becoming trivial. It doesn't help that the protagonists are a bit shallow and rely too much on surface caricature to build a personality; the story rapidly becomes a weak excuse and a routine for romance, joiningthe routines on the rink. Sadly, the performances on ice are also repetitive and bear no thrilling, giving you the feeling you've seen one, you've seen 'em all!\\n\\n\r\nWithout the support of inventive and stylish art and animation in its execution, Yuri on Ice ends up as a failed souffl\u00e9. Lacking in every aspect of its writing, breathless in the artistic ambitions that could have redeemed the show, it falls short of everything. Not bad enough to fall below the appreciation of \"average\", but there's nothing more to expect from it.",

            "content": "My very first review for a very special anime. Yuri!!! on Ice is a show about Yuuri Katsuki, a 23 years old top figure skater from Japan. He trained in Detroit and  qualified for the Grand Prix Final for the very first time in his life, but he became last place with a very low score due mental and physical problems. His idol, Russian champion Victor Nikiforov takes the gold once again. Yuuri doesn't know whether to retire or to continue, he feels like his career is over but he also wants to skate on the same ice as his idol again. He visitshis home town to think things over, and suddenly Victor Nikiforov himself appears at his home and tells Yuuri he'll become his coach and will take him to the Grand Prix Final. And that's how the heartwarming story about figure skating begins. \\n\\n\r\nPlease do not compare this show to anything BL/yaoi/shounen-ai related because it's not what this show is about. Sure, Victor and Yuuri share an emotional and romantic bond but it's very subtle handled. The romance is there to make Yuuri stronger as a competitive skater and to accomplish his goal to win a gold medal at the Grand Prix Final. Yuri on Ice is enjoyable for both male and female audience. The main theme of the show will always be sports, so you won't hear any love confessions from either of them but you'll definitely notice there's something going on between them. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9/10\\n\r\nYuri on Ice is very realistic to the real figure skating world. The creators of this show are big fans of figure skating, and they definitely know a thing or two about how the skating world works. That's why this anime has been praised by many real life figure skaters. Figure skating is a very beautiful and passionate sport, where people can express themselves in routines, music and glittery outfits.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very simple and the pacing seems a little off here and there. There is a time skip of five months or something between episode 4 and 5 while the last three episodes happen in three or four days. The story is very rushed near the ending, and the dynamic between Yuuri and Victor changes drastically (read: they give you the feeling theyre dating) but no one in this show talks about it, neither the main characters or the side characters. They all just kinda let it happen. This felt a little frustrating to me because I wanted to have a deeper look into their relationship, but the show is all about the sports and their relationship will be up for interpretation until the very end. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this show is actually funny and very solid, but that's just my opinion. I think the comedy doesn't work for everyone, for example manservice is used for comedic purposes in the first 4 episodes. Yuuri's family runs a hot spring and there will be a few scenes where Victor appears butt naked. \\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice has a few sudden twists and turns during the story, and all of them are positive and mostly heartwarming. There will be moments you'll feel shocked, extremely happy, sad and you'll feel for the characters, even if they're not that important to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending left lots of people unsatisfied, but personally I didn't feel that way at all. Many things happen in the finale and I had to rewatch a few times to fully understand what's going on because it's a little bit rushed and fast paced. The ending hints at a season two and that's why I liked the ending: everything you wanted to happen in the finale can still happen in season two! \\n\r\nI can assure you the ending of season 1 is a happy ending, even though things won't go as you expect.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\r\nYuri on Ice has a huge cast of lots of international figure skaters. They all have their own reasons to win, different outfits, routines, music and lots of personality. The characters aren't stereotyped and are unique in their own way. Some of them skate for love, some for their country and some of them just to beat Victor off his throne. \\n\\n\r\n- Yuri \"Yurio\" Plisetsky, Yuuri's main rival from Russia is a 15 year old, very talented but rude character. I didn't like his character at all in the beginning, but I came to like him because his skating is absolutely wonderful. It's a treat for your eyes, the music he uses for his program is phenomenal and his outfits are the best. Yuri fricking Plisetsky, a cold hearted lil tsundere crawled his way into my heart. \\n\r\n- Phichit Chulanont from Thailand, Yuuri's rinkmate in Detroit, is an extremely likable character who skates to make history for his country,\\n\r\n- Flamboyant Chris from Swiss who wants to beat Victor no matter what and doesn't feel motivated because Victor isn't skating this season,\\n\r\n- JJ \"the King\" who wants to take over the whole skating world but he realizes the pressure of being number one can be overwhelming,\\n\r\n- Michele \"Mickey\" Crispino who skates for his twin sister and breaks his personal record by a mile when he realizes his love for her is unhealthy and let's go of her. Mickey isn't a very important character but his free skate performance made me cry like a baby\\n\r\n- Yuuri's family, childhood friends, ballet instructor Minako-sensei and his fellow Japanese ice skater and fan Minami-kun who supports Yuuri no matter what. They don't appear a lot, but they are likeable and they add a good amount of comedy to the story\\n\r\n- The two characters who nestled their way in my heart are Yuuri and Victor. Yuuri gets an immense amount of character development, he has major anxiety problems, (sometimes so bad it's unpleasant to watch). Luckily he has Victor by his side who'll support him as much as he can and together they'll work things out. He grabs on to Victors love and rises himself to the top. Victor may seem like a mysterious character with unknown reasons to coach Yuuri, but near the end of the series it turns out he's nothing but a big sweetheart who had no inspiration left to surprise people and felt imprisoned by skating. He took a break to coach a failing Japanese figure skater and found his love and life in the boy and his home country Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThere are even more characters, but these are the ones who left the biggest impression on me\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art itself is amazing. The realistic scenery which includes different countries (Japan, Russia, Spain) and real life ice skating venues is amazing to see. The outfits were designed by real life figure skating designers and Yuuri's free skate outfit was even made in real life. The routines are choreographed by Kenji Miyamoto who is a figure skater himself. \\n\r\nThe characters all look great on the ice, but the animation was rushed and felt incomplete. The expressions of the skaters looked awkward and unfinished. The body movement is amazing to see though and the jumps are awesome. Overall, most skating routines didn't really grab my attention, but it didn't affect enjoyment one bit.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\r\nYou know why lazy drawn routines didn't affect my enjoyment? Because the music is absolutely outstanding! The show uses both real life music and new created music for the show. On Love: Agape and Allegro Appassionato in B Minor (Yurio's music) and Stay Close to Me (Victors Free program) are the ones who just left me speechless. Another favorite is \"Theme of King JJ\" which is an incredible catchy song, you can see the public singing along while he skates to this music and even I had to sing along because it's just too good! Yuuri's free skate \"Yuri on Ice\" is the most memorable, it's a song which expresses his entire career in a beautiful way. \\n\r\nThe mix between classical and pop music is great, and it's one of the best aspects of this anime. \\n\r\nThe OP is catchy, and don't even get me started on the ED: it's perfect. One of the best and unique ending songs I've ever heard!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nWhen I first started this anime I had very low expectations but it turned out to be my absolute favorite. I love the OST, the characters, the story, the comedy, the art style, the realistic and professional view of a very beautiful and interesting sport. Everything just works for me. The gay romance was such a treat since I like yaoi slightly more than yuri or straight relationships, but I would've rate 10/10 anyway. You shouldn't shy away from this anime just because it has a few gay moments! \\n\\n\r\nEverything about Yuri on Ice is just so satisfying. The creators put so much effort in this show and their hard work has payed off. I really think this show deserves its hype.",

            "content": "Probably the most overhyped/overrated anime since Sword Art Online.\r\nNot only are the characters pretty flat, not only is the story really really bad, not only does the animation of this series become so bad that Studio Deen would have to start blushing, not only is the world building some of the worst in any anime but people also have the nerv to call this anime a good represantion of a gay relationship.\r\nIs this what straight women think what gay men would behave like if they'd be in love?\r\nThe relationship of Yuri and Victor is some of the battiest Yaoi shit I've seen in any anime.They don't kiss - They just hug in a way to make it look like they're kissing. They don't get in a relationship between lovers - They are just master & student who really like each other. They don't get engaged - They just buy lucky charms for each other, that look like engagement rings. \\n\r\nAnd don't come to me claiming that the kiss had to be cencored for the japanese audience. There were plenty of anime where gay characters had kissed each other in a clear way (Sakura Trick, No.6) so please just cut the bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character is flat and cringy and every potential that they might have had is wasted, because every episode had to have at least 3 ice skating scenes instead of actual character building through some relationships. The cringiest and worst character is Christophe and his presence probably describes the best why Yuri on Ice has such garbage writing. Yuri, the main character, is every sports protagonist of every shitty sports anime. He's such a blank slate that new story tools like a second dog dying have to be created to give him some new reactions. Victor is the stereotypical gay character. Every line he says has to be ambivalent and no real strong motivation is given as to how and why he quit his career.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the story. Most of it is spend in the ice rink and instead of giving the viewer some eye candy through some cool shots of Russia or Japan we mainly get some of the worst sakuga animation you will see in any anime. 90% of the characters could be cut out completely and nothing would change. Motivations are explained through inner dialogue in the ice skating scenes which just is lazy. There is no subtlety to anything in this piece of garbage story. One thing I can give credit to this anime though is, that the humor most of the times works and the first 2 episodes were pretty okay. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation like I've said is pretty bad. The first episode had some really beautiful scenes but then the director decided to use this exact animation again...and again...and again...and again but only worse.\\n\r\nWe never get an explanation as to how who is better than who. The only visual indication we ever got as to how someone was doing good or bad during their skating scenes is when they tripped. A talented director would have cut out some of the skating scenes to save some of the budget for a few important story scenes.\\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice fails in every way. It fails as a sports anime. It fails as a love story. It's fails a character study.\\n\\n\r\nThe only enjoyment I got from this anime was how this whole mess of a story crumbled apart near the end.",

            "content": "As an ex-competitive figure skater myself, this anime has brought me to brinks of tears beyond comprehension and inspired me to write my very first review (please bear with me). To quickly summarize the show in few words that will definitely do the show unjust: this is an anime about passion, failure, inspiration, human nature, and love. Regardless if you are an avid protester against shounen-ai or someone who dislikes sports animes, Yuri!!! on Ice will bring to the table a multitude of other elements you are sure to love.\r\n**Story: 9 & Character: 10**\r\nI might appear to be biased (and perhaps I am), but therealism of the characters' struggles and emotions are highly relatable and really draws your inner empathy. What sets this apart from other sports/shounen animes are that it does not aim to show unbelievable global success whilst in a beginner's shoes, but rather aims to show progress from a professional's point of view (it starts with Yuri failing phenomenally at the Grand Prix Finals and overcoming struggles to compete in the Grand Prix series again).\\n\\n\r\nAnd because of the dynamic characters and their development through merely 10 episodes, I give this a solid 10/10. There are no antagonists that you will never come to agree with, but only dimensional characters who each have their reasons for being the way they are.\\n\\n\r\n**Art: 9**\\n\r\nThe art is 10/10 true to the sport, with the programs' actually being choreographed by a professional figure skater. From the kiss & cry, scoreboard and even the details of freshly resurfaced ice, everything is accurately detailed and there is never a \"wtf-is-this-even-real\" moment in its artistic depictions. (In fact, if there were no copyright issues, the very blades that Yuri Plisetsky skates on are most likely \"John Wilson, Gold Seal Revolution\" blades.)\\n\\n\r\nBesides on-ice moments, the soft yet vibrant tones also brings much of the surroundings alive and leaves a picturesque aftertaste. That said, the occasional lack of fluidity in character movements while on-ice could be slightly distracting to those who regularly watch figure skating performances / competitions.\\n\\n\r\n**Sound: 10**\\n\r\nThe OP and ED itself uses electronic themes, which would somewhat satisfy EDM fans. Yet the variety in music really brings the figure skating world alive. The original song \"Yuri on Ice\" that Yuri skates to depict the journey of his career is unbelievably melancholic, heartfelt, heartbreaking and tender; if no one told me, I would think it jumped out of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso.\\n\\n\r\n**Enjoyment: 10 & Overall: 9**\\n\r\nPersonally, I rate this show a 10/10. But taking into account my background as a retired figure skater and the moments I saw my experiences laid out in the show, due to my inherent bias towards the show, I give Yuri!!! on Ice a 9/10 in this review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely give this anime a try--it has the power to send you flying from a rut in life, and inspires you to accept your failures, and to get up and try again.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is life, anyway, without ups, downs and a journey to tell?",

            "content": "Obviously spoilers. Don't see how a review could be written for this series without them.\r\nAlright, so here we go. Blah blah blah Crunchyroll anime awards blah blah x series deserved this award blah blah blah blah blah. I kid, of course. No mention of those in this review. However, I do think that some things really do need to be talked about as to why this series is as overrated as it is, and why those things are absurd. So watch close as I get into them.\r\nLet's start by discussing the premise.\r\nFunny enough, one thing most YoI fans can agree with is that the premisewas nothing too amazing. It was somewhat unique in its own way, as it does remain a fact that up to now, a sports story being started the way it was in YoI hasn't really happened in anything that's been significant/at a moderately blockbuster level. That being, a star athlete wants to quit but is visited up by an even bigger star athlete who wants to become his coach. Usually, in most sports anime, what we're typically given is the protagonist being motivated by something else, not somebody else putting motivation into them.\\n\\n\r\nI originally watched YoI from the very beginning. It wasn't anything I viewed with high regards, but I made it through 3 episodes initially because that's what I promised to give it even prior to when it started airing. Ultimately, I thought nothing of it. Or should I say initially. Nah, that doesn't work because I still really don't feel anything towards it. The predominant thing about it here was the fact that a fair amount of \"manservice\" was involved, similar to Free!. I had almost instantly assumed it'd be that way; homosexual innuendos, abs, and a massive fujoshi following, so I gave up on it. Same way as I did with Free!.\\n\\n\r\nNow, inevitably so, I was begged by quite a few people to continue it because of \"how amazing it gets eventually.\" Seeing the scores it was plastered with all over the internet, I thought maybe it had been an unexpected surprise and would turn into a huge hit one day in the future... so I continued it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOnto continuing plot development.\\n\r\nUp to episode 6, the series had very little change besides what you'd expect from a sports anime. More about the actual sport was talked about, and the development was cliche and nothing special. The funny thing in the situation of figure skating, however, is the plain and simple fact that if you've never followed figure skating before in your life, you really won't have any idea about the actual fine details of what's going on. You'll be JUST as aware of what a toe loop, flip, and salchow are on the 12th episode as you were before you even started the first. And to be entirely honest, that fact is just, simply, sad.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is it sad? Not for reasons you'd think, such as it being detrimental to the series and your enjoyment is hindered from not knowing what it all means. Though that COULD possibly be the case (I wouldn't know since I know nothing about figure skating), there's another huge problem behind the audience's lack of understanding: how the series tries to get you to understand what everything means.\\n\\n\r\nWhat YoI does is something that happens a fairly decent amount in anime, but really shouldn't ever happen. Its methods of trying to get you to understand things, and I mean actual things canon to the story (not JUST the things about figure skating, or recaps, or any one specific thing), are done on a 1:1 talk-type of basis. Ever heard of the term \"show, don't tell\"? YoI does the exact opposite in many situations. And in a medium of entertainment like anime, one that's based more on visuals than anything else, this kind of thing shouldn't be happening. If novel authors are able to show their explanations without directly telling them to you, anime writers should definitely be able to do at LEAST the same thing when it comes to select crucial moments.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, YoI is filled to the brim with annoying infodumps.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the exact case with literally every single situation when it comes to figure skating explanation; instead of trying to show you each jump, presentation score, technical scores, competition layouts, and everything else, they just infodump all of it through a method that makes it seem like the main character, Yuri, is talking directly to you. It really is annoying, a huge sign of poor writing quality in an anime, and finally, it really makes a show difficult to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there are a few things you're able to understand while going through the series, and that is the value and importance level behind the performances. We're given the ideas that more stunning visuals behind their outfits, general step sequences, and appeal towards the certain criteria/genre that they're working in are all good things, in addition to more successful jumps and better jumps are overall better for their performance as well. It's obvious that there isn't a ton to take in as a spectator when it comes to figure skating, as most things can just be taken at face value directly from your eye and don't really require complicated evaluation unless you're actually a judge of the competition. But a problem lies within that as well.\\n\\n\r\nFigure skating seems to be very limited in how great it is to spectate it unless you're EXTREMELY knowledgeable of it, like to the point where you could be a judge. And I say this all despite what I just said in the above paragraph. Things CAN be taken at face value, but they obviously won't be all that enjoyable if there isn't already a level of knowledge about ice skating as a whole in your brain before even watching the first episode. Without the knowledge I speak of, you're pretty much missing out on every single thing that makes spectator sports fun to watch in the first place; no thrill, no sense of competition, and no way to really prove your self worth. Of course, 100% of all of this changes IF you're extremely knowledgeable in figure skating. But I get the feeling that even if you are, seeing it in anime form will still be a bit boring since things can change completely at the discretion of the animators/writers, thus removing all of the 3 things that I claimed make spectator sports enjoyable in the first place. Overall, the plot development alongside a premise like this was just not good, ultimately because of how difficult it is to create something enjoyable out of something as niche as figure skating.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo far, we have a failed first 3 episodes that were just unnecessary fanservice, and a failed following 3 episodes that were just badly formed infodumps and a lot of boredom. What's funny, however, is how YoI's first half was actually significantly better than the second. How could it possibly get worse? Here's how.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"most heartwarming scene of the year\" (sorry, just had to make that small reference) happens in episode 7, aka a really lackluster kiss that wasn't even fully shown and also lead to absolutely nothing in the long run. This really is when the series took off in terms of popularity and how much the people who watched it from the beginning began to brag about \"always being a fan of it\" and started to claim themselves as huge/hardcore fans of the series. However, what it did was spelled a major hint of inevitable downfall of the series, which is exactly what it ended up being. The series reached its peak at episode 4, when it started to be quite enjoyable just for what it was. At this point on, all it was was pretentious fujoshibait.\\n\\n\r\nAs sad as it was, it's true that YoI from episode 8 and on literally was JUST fujoshibait. Despite the kiss, absolutely nothing happened between the two main characters (Yuri and Victor). The continuation of their false relationship was limited purely to hand holding, snuggles, and rings that were really just meant to be mementos of their promises to each other, and the fact that they were each placed on each other's ring fingers by each other as if they were wedding rings, and the FACT that Victor claimed that they're getting married to a group of friends was just... coincidence? Literally not even TRYING to hide such an absurd amount of bait. It was all just pure cringe, from start to finish, and it made me question what had ever caused this series to become as popular and beloved as it is. Makes no sense to me whatsoever.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCould it get any worse? Maybe just a bit.\\n\r\nThe final 3 episodes were absolutely nothing of importance. It continued on in a cliche way, had a very significant yet obvious and mildly unimportant goal from the eyes of the viewer, and was just so incredibly boring.\\n\\n\r\nAs Yuri is close to fulfilling his promise of winning a gold medal in the figure skating Grand Prix, he's off to the final competition with Victor. What we get for the next 3 episodes is a bunch of mindless animation scenes of skating that look NO different from the last scene of the same skating program; like, you CAN tell that it isn't reused animation, but the animation we are given is like the Endless Eight in the Haruhi series... it's the exact same thing, just with different money poured into it from the last time. The only differences are if there's mistakes made by the skaters that weren't made last time, or vice versa.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, all of these skating scenes are boring. They fall into the ideals I stated earlier of making very little sense and having no sense of thrill or anything else you'd expect from a spectator sport, just because animators decide what happens as opposed to actual human beings being the ones who perform. And it's just, simply, depressing.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's also depressing is how little there is to say about the series at this point. To me, it feels like I almost rushed through this review in the last couple sections, but after multiple re-reads I realize I haven't... there just is so little to say overall. Regardless of how acclaimed a series is, even if it's bad, there should at least be a lot to say about it whether in positive or negative light... why is YoI not this way? Was it really that badly written? I can't even be 100% sure in this case.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict on the story, after my very general analysis of it, is that there really is absolutely nothing that comes from it that's anything special in any way possible. It just makes no sense; what is it that people see in this show that causes them to love it so much? If only I could understand for even a second the answer to that, I'd be more than satisfied with my spending 4.5 hours watching this show. However, I get the feeling that I really never will understand simply because there is nothing there to truly enjoy, and that the entire fanbase of this show really did fall straight into the traps that the show set from the very beginning.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were just a bit different, but not completely in a good way.\\n\r\nTo me at least, there wasn't a single positive thing about the main character, Yuri (apparently his name is spelled Yuuri, though subtitles spelled it Yuri. I'll just continue to say Yuri since that's what I've been saying this entire review), that stood out enough for me to say he's a good character. He's extremely bland, and his anxiety seemed to be one of the most forced mental disorders that I've ever seen in anime. He would act like he was more nervous than he's ever been in his entire life, despite the fact that he's just going out to do something he's done hundreds of times with even LESS on the line than some of his other performances... he has nervous wrecks, cries, acts like he can't do it, but then... goes out and gives an amazing performance? At least stick to your roots, YoI writers, or at least give Yuri bipolar disorder instead of anxiety.\\n\\n\r\nVictor was without a doubt more charming and enjoyable to watch on-screen than Yuri was. However, he really does fall into the same cliches as Yuri in the end; his character feels extremely flat, doesn't have any huge personality traits that cause him to stand out more than another similar character, and feels like he only exists because of the plot, as if this kind of person would never exist in real life. That is a MAJOR red flag in an anime that obviously needs to feel realistic to even sustain itself. So overall, Victor still doesn't feel like a good character, despite being enjoyable to watch. Not a lot to say about him in the end since his character formula is so similar to Yuri's.\\n\\n\r\nThe best character in the entire series was actually the second Yuri, the Russian one who everyone thought was a huge douchebag. Which, yeah, he definitely was. Without a single doubt. The reason why he was the best character in the series was simply because of how refreshing he was as a whole. He was a guy who refused to ever be looked down upon by others, which a lot of people did because of the fact that he's 15 and already claiming he'll win a Grand Prix gold medal. You also have the fact that Victor broke a promise he made to him and he just simply didn't wanna just take that like he was a little bitch, and he stood up to him and completely destroyed every ounce of main character Yuri's confidence when it truly mattered. Then he actually DID what he claimed he would and man, that honestly was the nicest feeling part of the series just because it felt like the main character wasn't AS plot armored as a typical sports anime protagonist would be. Russian Yuri for the win, without a doubt the best piece of this entire series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about other characters? There were a few other skaters but the thing is, their entire existence was yet again just another flaw in the formula of this series. Their entire personalities were shoved down our throat faster than we were able to chew them, and their overall importance to the plot was very little over time because of how they were basically just a bunch of mindless robots meant to serve the purpose of being in the competition with the two Yuris, like they didn't even exist outside of those select situations. Now, this kind of writing is a problem no matter how you look at it, however it could've been a MUCH smaller problem had it been handled differently. If the plot calls for people to compete against the two Yuris in the competition, it'd be fine to just insert characters that mean nothing in to fill those roles. The main source of problems with the side characters ultimately came from the fact that they actually tried to give them all distinctive personalities and a fair amount of development. It was all unneeded; all it did was take up more time that could've been used to make the series better just to make it worse in the long run.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, the presentation behind YoI as a whole was pretty well-done.\\n\\n\r\nThe art lacked a bit for a typical 2016 anime, as there weren't a whole lot of well-animated still scenes. They were mostly just blurs or silhouettes that were only really there for the sake of minor distinction of things. What did need to look good, however, was the characters themselves in their situations, and I can promise you that all did indeed look very good. Also, the skating scenes themselves were extremely well choreographed (apparently from actual live-action skating programs) as well as very well-animated with no CG at all. The art and animation of YoI wasn't perfect by any means, but was still pretty good for what it was, and great when it truly needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was also very good. The music chosen for pretty much every skater's program sounded very well-composed and generally was of higher quality than most music you'll find in a sports anime. The generally calm yet tense atmosphere of everything helped with that as well, since there was never any reason for forced rock music or anything. Everything sounded nice and chill, and I can't really say I have any direct complaints for any of it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell, time for my final verdict. At this point, for the most part at least, I feel like I've gotten my points across pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Yuri on Ice is ultimately just a huge plate of the highest quality bait to ever exist on the anime market. There is very little more to it aside from one good character, a lot of female-friendly fanservice, fujoshibait, and boring sports with seemingly reused animation.\\n\\n\r\nI was hoping for more when I began to hear the reasons why people loved it before getting back into the series at episode 4. However what it ended up turning into was pretty much just more of the same. TONS of bait that was literally nothing more than total bait for fujoshis to fangirl over, boredom, and a lot of really forced emotions. It really does sadden me to say that Yuri on Ice had a fair amount of potential, because the fact of the matter here is that every single ounce of it was wasted in every possible way.\\n\\n\r\nI loved seeing the Russian Yuri on-screen just because of how good of a character he was, however how quickly he was kicked off almost entirely of the show until the very end really did show you exactly what the creators of the show had in mind for it. The rivalry behind the two Yuris was supposed to seem important, but it didn't feel important at ALL because, like I said, it was made extremely obvious from very early on what the creators had intended this show to truly be. If only things had continued on in a good way, and not a way that they knew would just simply guarantee them a lot of easy money.\\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice is a beautiful looking, even better sounding failure. A very nice, pretty decorated box with a tag saying it came from the most important person in your life... but the box itself is completely empty.\\n\\n\r\nI don't at all look forward to a second season, because with Russian Yuri completing his goal, I'm almost positive that very little attention will be given to him until the VERY end... almost exactly like the first season, just somehow worse.\\n\\n\\n\r\nScoring:\\n\r\nFinal score - 3.8/10 (sorry, not bothering with full scoring this time)",

            "content": "Let's get this out of the way. \r\n1) This is the most mature and tasteful anime about romance to date. That said, it is my own personal opinion that your enjoyment for this anime hinges heavily on your own emotional and social maturity. Yes, it's homo. Yes, it's about adult men doing their feminine sports. Yes, it's ~*gay*~, and these people exists in real life. Wake up.\r\n2) This may be labelled as sports, but you would be a fool to think it'll get your blood pumping. Ice skating is about making things look as deceptively easy as possible. The amount of finesse and strength requiredto pull these moves off in the show is so incredibly high, the skaters can probably crush your skull with their thighs!\\n\\n\r\nHope that explains some of the jarring divide plaguing most debates. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance is of two males. The amount of respect the writers have given to a relationship of that nature is something I have not even seen in BL/Yaoi works. It feels extremely human, realistic and powerful. It is not fetishized, never once poked fun of, and has never treated this romance less than a relationship between a male and a female. Although indirect about the way they tell they romance, you can feel their adoration for each other oozing out and rotting your teeth. These characters never tell you why the specific reasons why they fell in love with each other, but they do show you lots of vague ideas about why they are. It's also a completely healthy, functional give-and-take relationship on both ends. I'm mindblown!\\n\\n\r\nHands down the best writing in terms of representing people, one of the best animation put together for complex movements I've seen. In short: holy f*cking sh*t. This anime really, really shouldn't be possible given all the social stigma, pressure and workload. Yet  here we are.\\n\\n\r\nI am giving this a solid 10/10 for simply doing all the things that other animes have failed to do. This. This is the only anime I have seen where it doesn't treat the emotional and social maturity of the audience like a child's. It handles a romantic relationship so damn well I'm actually having trouble believing this anime even exists at all. Some days I wake up and it's like, \"wait, is Yuri!!! On Ice real?\". \\n\\n\r\nThis should be on Cowboy Bepop level in terms of importance in anime. Why? Because we've been getting loads of BL/Yaoi baiting that stayed stagnant and refused to push the boundary, refused to step out of that fetishized hell and embrace actual human relationship. Hell, it's better than 99.9% of the BL crap I've to sit through. It's human. I can feel these characters. Yuri!!! On Ice is a HUGE game changer in romance storytelling. It has set the bar so high, it oozes out so much good directing, I'm afraid nothing will even come close given the current standard in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of the characters and their relationship with each other is so incredibly well done and strong. There hasn't been a single moment where they throw you the typical annoying drivel of the relationship tragedy drama, and the characters, imperfect adults, mind you, just... make do with what they have and progress. It sends out a really good message, and I love it. It is absolutely positive. It's okay to find your niche, your passion, your life and love in your late 20s. This show seems to tell you that, and we do need more anime that sends this message as the active anime community's median age inches ever more closer to the early 10s.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters aren't given that much spotlight, since this is an anime about ice skating competitions and realistically there is only so much screen time you can give to all of them. This is acceptable. It really is the same with a lot of other sports anime if you think about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only flaw of this anime is the animation. Yes, despite my crazy praise earlier, this anime is still made by human beings probably overworked to their bones. Studio MAPPA is nowhere near I.G Production levels in terms of sheer man-power. There are some parts where the motion looks off, and a few where there's errors in the animation, details or coloring. But! That is still a minor issue. These problems usually strikes the minor scenes, and unless you really paid attention you will not see it. It is not a major problem, but amusing to highlight nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nExpect mindblowing levels of respect, acceptance, maturity, feels, details, comedy and emotional connection. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, should you watch it? Yes, absolutely, but read 1) and 2). I have shown this anime to various adults who are either homophobic or do not care about anime, and their unanimous opinion is that Yuri!!! On Ice is an amazingly good show! Watch it!",

            "content": "As I write this, I have official watched all 12 episodes of Yuri!!! On Ice and boy what a spectacle it is. I\u2019m pretty sure Yuri broke tumblr\u2026\u2026..anyway. There are a lot of things about Yuri!!! On Ice that make it different compared to many of the other mainstream sports series out there.\r\nFirst off, this story is based on actual competitive figure skating like the kind that could take someone to the Olympics.  Secondly, the series makes figure skating look BAD ASS and BEAUTIFUL all at the same time. Its animation is flawless and the skating just takes your breath away. It was choreographedby a person who works in the figure skating industry, so it\u2019s definitely not half assed. It portrays a realistic depiction to the lives of these athletes not just on but off the ice as well. One of our main characters Victor is based off an actual figure skater named Johnny Weir \u2013 who you should check out because he is beautiful!!! This series as it is based on international competition has characters from around the world, Russia, Kazakhstan, Canada, Japan, etc. and they don\u2019t have any of the stereotypes implemented. My representative J.J. from Canada certainly does not behave like the typical Canadian stereotype (no invisible Canada here). \\n\\n\r\nThis show also implements two very important things, first the anxiety and pressure athletes face as well as an actual homosexual relationship. You see the death grip that anxiety has on our main protagonist Yuri throughout the competition but as the story progresses, Yuri learns to deal with his problems, though they never go away completely, like actual anxiety.  You also learn the pressure that these players end up facing and how their mental state on the ice, affects their performance. This doesn\u2019t mean that an emotionless skating performance is the best option, in many cases, it is that emotion while skating that helps them achieve greatness which you will see throughout the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow to my favorite part VUCTURI!!!! These guys well I\u2019m not going to spoil anything but each episode is like a new piece of the puzzle towards unraveling their relationship. Yuri and Victor do not portray a stereotypical gay relationship what\u2019s so ever and it\u2019s actual quite refreshing to see such a mature, deep relationship between two people especially in sports where most of our couples tend to be just head canons, even the heterosexual ones.\\n\\n\r\n However, Yuri is not the only main player we have, Yurio (Yuri), the kitten becomes a sort of rival to Yuri and friend, who together help each other grow and become better skaters. In each of the performances we learn a little more about the characters, so it isn\u2019t just our main trio that gets the spot light.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is freaking great. You can\u2019t help but want to listen to it all the time. It\u2019s a nice mixture of lyrical and classical, nothing to modern. The opening itself is in English and god is it beautiful to look at. Pay close attention to it in each episode because it\u2019s never the same opening twice ;)\\n",

            "content": "I felt like doing Yuri on ice some justice due to the number of low reviews, but please remember that this review is biased and will contain minor spoilers. There is a 'should you watch this' at the end.\r\nStory 8/10:\r\nFirst things first, this is a sports anime, so it's undeniable that you're going to escape the 'underdog gets epic development and achieves goal' trope anytime soon. Yuri on ice, however, takes this a different direction. Instead of purely focusing on skills and growth as a figure skater, it centers on Yuri developing confidence in himself as a professional skater and the the world of professionalsin general rather than your classic 'highschool sports club lice of life' kinda feel. However, in addition to this, we are given not so subtle hints of Viktors and Yuris ambiguous relationship, which is implied to go beyond that of coach and student.  This is a hit and miss concept for many- hit for the fujioshis and those open to the idea of lbgt, miss to those uncomfortable with homosexual themes. For alot of people who claim that the show is 'queer bait' or feel as if it takes up the majority of the show's screen time- The show offers so much more than that. But if you continue to protest, then I guess theres nothing I can do about that. I feel, personally, however that it ties in with the story quite well as their relationship has a strong contribution to Yuuris confidence and Viktors motivation for teaching him.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nIf it weren't for the fact that the art was visibly a bit inconsistent at times and had a few coloring errors, this would've been a solid 10. I really felt like Studio MAPPA was finally able to show the extent of their animation capabilities through this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nEver since Yuri on ice started I still haven't been able to get over the opening, ending and ost songs to this very day. Honestly, the sound was magnificent, considering that they have to create up to 10 different soundtracks for each character's skating routine, I was absolutely amazed by the quality, and freshness of the mix of classical, pop and future bass(?) in the ost.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well created and unique, making each one easy to remember. The main 3; Yuuri, Viktor and Yurio sall have distinguishable characteristics and all express clear character development.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri- Appearance wise, one can argue that he's a character you've probably seen in 10 other anime: shy, glasses, nerd looking and easily embarrassed. But Yuuri's so much more than that; he's emotional but not sensitive and can be rebellious. He's not a character designed from scratch and I can say for sure that he was not intended to fit any stereotype.\\n\\n\r\nViktor- I'm genuinely surprised how they've managed to create a character so flawless yet so flawed. Viktor is perfect as a bachelor without appearing to be *too* forcibly bishounen and has a very charismatic feel to him. However, he has a hard time handling emotions, bot his own and others, and struggles with the idea of coaching Yuuri and being his mental piller. He's definitely one of the male Anime characters to stand out the most this season.\\n\\n\r\nYurio- I have mixed feelings about Yurio; on one side he is downright rude and I hate the way that he treats Viktor and Yuri, but on the side he's so loveable that I can't hate him. Yurio's hot hotheadedness and arrogant behavior is difficult to overlook, however, the show has ingrained in the idea that he DOES have a compassionate side to him and that maybe we should cut him some slack since he's 15 and already has to face the trials of being a competitive skator. \\n\\n\r\n(bonus) Christophe- Alot of people seem to hate him and I don't really get why. Sure he's kind of weird with his whole 'nutting on the ice' nature, but I feel like that was added to express his sexual nature in general. I felt like this phrase was used to empasise his 'release' of the pressure felt when performing to keep him in character; as opposed to the other skaters, whom cried after their performance due to relief or strain. Not that I'm saying that hes incapable of crying, but to me I felt like this was his way of feeling 'relief' after finishing a performance.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: \\n\\n\r\nDefinitely a series I will not forget, as a long term anime fan, It's been a long time since I've been this invested in an Anime since Naruto.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhich begs the question- should YOU watch this?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is unusual- It has seinen themes but it's main demographic is females (not statistically proven, just and assumption) So:\\n\\n\r\n-If you've enjoyed sports anime such as Free!, haikyuu, and Kuroko no basket and are a full time fujioshi\\fundashi, then this is 100% the show for you. Invest in it enough and every episode will get more exciting.\\n\\n\r\n-If you want something fresh out of the anime market, modern and unique, then Yuri on Ice is something you should get your hands on. I would personally describe it as being very 'tumblr-like' since it deals with lbgt themes, mental issues and flower crowns. \\n\\n\r\n-If you hate the idea that two guys are crossing the 'no homo' line and focusing on improvement, emotional stability and a prominently male cast, then this is NOT for you. Avoid at all costs before you submit to becoming a hater for no reason. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "In short : If you love being a fan serviced by males, this show is for you. Not recommended as a sports anime.\r\nNow, I know many things have been stated, from one extreme to another, as well of various shades in-between. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to read each one of them and I\u2019m sure most of what will be stated already have been, in one way or another, stated over and over. That shall not matter, I will repeat what has been said if necessary.\r\nThis pseudo-review also contains slight spoilers, so you\u2019ve been warned.\r\nStory :\r\nMany things can be stated regarding the story and I\u2019ll mainlyfocus on its issues as well as a bit of an extra.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, let\u2019s remind us this is a 12 episodes long show, and if it can be enough for some stories, this isn\u2019t the case : the writing wasn\u2019t able to develop itself within the accorded length. On one side, because there\u2019s too much content and on another because a good portion is used for fanservice, taking away time that could have been allocated for other things.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, a better pacing. The erratic pacing is especially noticeable in the first episodes, and while it gets better after a while, the pacing is never fixed up and starts getting worse again in the last two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that plays against the pacing is the overuse of ellipses. While I can partially understand it due to the amount of content it wants to add and the limits of 12 episodes, it\u2019s also true the show should have compromised, and it didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that plays against the pacing is the constant tonality switch, bad tonality switch. The show seems recalcitrant to let emotions sink in most of the time. More times than it should, it is too quickly replaced by action or humour, and in writing\u2026that doesn\u2019t work. As the saying says : \u201cthere\u2019s a time for everything\u201d and that includes the amount of time you allocate to one scene. To create a metaphor that is understandable for most : a well-written story, or episode for that matter, is like a roller coaster, parkoured with ups and downs ; a YoI episode could be summarized as falling during 23 min straight with some one-second stops every now and then. Which isn\u2019t only bad in terms of writing, but also exhausting.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the reason why, for example, when in the first episode hyperactive chibi-Yuri is supposed to represent Yuri purposely \u201coverhyping\u201d to deny/repress his real emotions, it doesn\u2019t work. Because the humour or the action arrives too quickly afterward. \\n\\n\r\nIronically enough, the moments that are the \u201ccalmest\u201d tend to be the sport sequences, which\u2026for a something that was advertised as a sports anime, or would want to be a sports anime primarily, is surprising. There\u2019s rarely built up or tension, both preferring to revolve around Yuri, Viktor and occasionally Yurio. In that aspect, as a sports anime, it is failing at one of its core.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to get a bit \u201caround\u201d the show rather than the writing itself, I\u2019d like to point something out : according to the writer of the show \u2013 whether or not you\u2019re the type to put value in the creators words are up to you \u2013 the relationship is supposed to be open to interpretation. And, why not ? Written like that there\u2019s no issue with it, right ? Well\u2026usually\u2026when you try to write something \u201copen to interpretation\u201d\u2026you don\u2019t have overt fanservice as a dominant trait of your show ; it\u2019s \u201calmost\u201d contradictory. But I\u2019ll keep most of my words regarding that in the \u201ccharacters\u201d section. I just shortly mentioned it here because in the end, that played against the story writing as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, I\u2019d like to diverge from the pure writing and to come back to two events, the hug/kiss and lucky charms/engagement rings scenes.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, a kiss or a hug ? Well, the first part of that scene possesses all the indication for a classical kiss scene, the only thing that opposes that reading is their body position once they are on the floor which wouldn\u2019t allow a kiss to occur. Contradiction or a misleading scene ? Well, when you put it in the perspective of the whole show, it is neither of the two. Actually, the show repeatedly comes up with cover-ups, and this is scene simply is one of many. One endorsed by the almost immediate transition to another sequence, a complete absence of mentioning of it by anyone later on and its absence as a step stone in their relationship. And the latter is the biggest issue : relationships are made of steps stones. This step stone is denied, and instead, the kiss is turned to a pseudo-\u201cinterpretable\u201d kiss/hug scene, a scene which is basically treated as none existent within the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the reason why it would possess cover ups to begin with, the answer is quite simple : they don\u2019t want potential viewers who aren\u2019t comfortable with homosexuality to drop their show, which is quite silly, actually, in the face of its fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019m not done with this kiss. Of course, I came across people justifying it as a form of censoring. And it could be, of course, a creative censoring from the writer herself, pressure from the producer or studio (which wouldn\u2019t exactly be legal), but due to Japanese law ? That would be a fairly recent law then, to the point the English translation of it hasn\u2019t yet been updated. Thus, this justification feels unlikely credible.\\n\r\nHowever, let\u2019s admit for a second such a law existed, there would still be a question arising : \u201cwhy Yuri on Ice ?\u201d Because it isn\u2019t tagged as yaoi ? Fair enough\u2026if males kissing outside of yaoi tagged animes couldn\u2019t be found up to 3 decades ago as well as in fairly modern shows. Making this claim as little credible as the one above.\\n\\n\r\nTo switch to the second part \u2013 and let\u2019s be shorter - the exact same type of cover-up can be applied to the engagement rings (presentation, visuals, etc.) turning to \u201clucky charms\u201d to cover it up (dialogues and humour). The only difference is that people acknowledge it \u2013 because, this time, it really worked as a step-stone - but just as a means to reinforce the cover-up : being asked whether or not they are engagement rings, for Viktor to joke about it and Yuri promptly denying it. And from then on, it is exclusively referred to as \u201clucky charms\u201d to burry up the visuals that narrated otherwise. And it isn\u2019t the oral endorsement of Vikturi as purely coach/apprentice \u2013 third biggest cover-up \u2013 throughout the show that makes it any better.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, it is more than time to proceed to the next section.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\\n\r\nIce-skating is an art, a sport. And this show tries to reciprocate that, but not where it should have been. It is a sports show, advertised as such, and my minimal expectation when coming to those is for their sports sequences to be decent.\\n\\n\r\nAnd\u2026the ice-skating sequences are for the most part, the lowest in quality. I do not possess any knowledge regarding ice-skating, so I\u2019m unable to properly judge the performances of the various skaters, but such ignorance doesn\u2019t prevent from perceiving the incredible amount of deformation as well as, too often for the show\u2019s own good, each separate keyframe, leading to \u201cstuttering\u201d performances. The visuals of those sequences being too low in quality to transmit emotions through performances, it is unsurprising the show has each performance accompanied with inner monologues from the performer. A writing issue I shall come back to in the character section.  \\n\\n\r\nThat doesn\u2019t mean, however, that there was close to no budget given to the art department, there can be beautiful visuals, but you\u2019ll have to look in a different direction. A direction called \u201cfanservice\u201d. Yes, the fanservicing interactions between Yuri and Viktor can be visually beautiful. And the difference with the rest, be it in colours, drawings or composition is striking enough you can easily see where the budget went.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, it isn\u2019t a 100% truth, some backgrounds are, in their design, sometimes noteworthy, but this is in the first episodes as they eventually turn to be sometimes even lower in quality than the performances.\\n\\n\r\nAnother note is how sometimes the choreography doesn\u2019t suit the song. Now, it\u2019s just an assumption of mine, but when you perform ice-skating, the song you choose and the choreography created has to fit together and not appear disconnected (unless on artistic purpose, but that\u2019s an exception this show neither acknowledge nor does it seem to follow). Positively enough, there is a few suiting choreographies.\\n\\n\r\nA second note regarding the choreographies is their general lack of variety. From the protagonist, the rival and the others. They may be different between themselves, the various cast keeps repeating the same performances without any noticeable alteration or progression (which could have been interesting to see). Instead the show mainly relies on reused animations (that they won\u2019t slightly modify so the lighting and colours fit in properly in the new background). Thus, the risk of getting tired of the repeated choreography is high. Not only that, but through the internal dialogues of the cast, it\u2019s obvious they are supposed to be different each time, but with no visuals to back it up, it can\u2019t properly work.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the contract, as a sports anime, is broken artwise as well. The budget for the visuals not being dedicated to the right sequences. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack :\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the soundtrack, it is varied in styles, beats and tones, which fits the \u201cice-skating\u201d part featuring various skaters and styles, but it has to be noted a good portion of them aren\u2019t music produced specifically for the show. And of course, since the characters keep using the same songs, there\u2019s a risk for potential boredom.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters :\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice is overt. Whether or not you find it something positive or negative, I will let you judge, but one thing is clear, it underlines most of the characters\u2019 interactions and Yuri and Viktor are the most obvious examples. No\u2026scratch that. Viktor. From right off the first episode, the show made it clear he\u2019d be a fanservice provider, not because he\u2019s flirty, but because of the way his attitude was portrayed, from visuals to dialogues : his physical closeness to Yuri, his nakedness, his teasing, his lines, they aren\u2019t performed as coming from a person \u2013 none of them are innocent (or rarely) - but as fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nThat Viktor embodies fanservice isn\u2019t an issue in itself, but will probably serve as a tolerance tester for many. It\u2019s fully understandable why people wouldn\u2019t stand fanservice \u201cthrown in their faces\u201d, whether or not you\u2019re the marketed audience and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\\n\\n\r\nThere can be a real issue, however, when the fanservice ruins the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here we are in front of two equally possible outcomes regarding this specific show :\\n\\n\r\n-yes, yes it is a case of ruining it, because it is a sport anime and the fanservice\u2019s place in this show is way too big\\n\\n\r\n-no, no it isn\u2019t because, while it was targeted as a sports anime, the core of it is clearly Viktor and Yuri and their interactions are fanservicing in nature\\n\\n\r\nIt is debatable, especially since both perspectives need their respective reading of the show, but I shall avoid taking a step in one or another direction. What I can do instead is point out at a relation between the two : the bromance. Sports animes are nothing new and bromance \u2013 voluntarily or not \u2013 among them isn\u2019t either. The main difference is that the \u201cbromance\u201d of YoI is too \u201cextreme\u201d to fit into that category, flirting with yaoi in its treatment and yet eventually avoiding it through so-called \u201cinterpretation\u201d. And that, maybe, is a sincere achievement of Yuri on Ice : breaking down the usual \u201cbromance\u201d you\u2019d expect in sports animes and going full force into the fanservice, hardly holding back.\\n\\n\r\nBut here I am, writing and writing, but not really talking about the characters. Well, Viktor is the fanservice provider, fine, is he more than that ? Well\u2026yes\u2026he\u2019s as fleshed out in few minor details \u2013 that won\u2019t have a huge impact on the grander scale - as stereotypical in his fanservicing, and if you\u2019re familiar with yaoi, you\u2019ll probably tag him as \u201cseme\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nIf one complaint had to be formulated regarding this character, it\u2019d be toward an event that occurs in the last quarter of the show. His motivation to become Yuri\u2019s coach. It basically is the equivalent of a \u201cretcon\u201d. It\u2019s a contradiction to the first episodes, be it through the dialogues and attitude or the way the charas interacted, but from that moment on, everyone will suddenly act as if that always existed. An incoherence whose source most probably find itself in a last-minute add decision, as another fanservice. An incoherence that weakens the character of Viktor and even impacts the Vikturi relationship negatively.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of \u201cVikturi\u201d, it is time to actually speak about Yuri ? The \u201cobvious\u201d \u201cuke\u201d of the pair in name as in attitude ? Well, whereas Viktor\u2019s attitude never falls off the tree, the same cannot be stated for Yuri. His character isn\u2019t written as a fanservice provider as Viktor does, he\u2019s the \u201creceiver\u201d of the pair and yet, sometimes, he\u2019ll fulfil the role of \u201cgiver\u201d, when it contradicts his established traits. It\u2019s not the only moments he\u2019ll contradict his traits as a way to fulfil the fanservice, he does too as a \u201creceiver\u201d, but from the two positions, the latter is the least questionable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here I have a perfect transition for the next part, another hot debate : Yuri on Ice : gay or yaoi ? Well, if you think it as a \u201cgenre\u201d, then\u2026no it isn\u2019t either of the two. The presence of romance between characters, regardless of the gender of the pairings, doesn\u2019t de facto make a show a romance (genre), something you should be aware of if you came across a few fictions in your life.\\n\\n\r\nNo, what this question is referring to is rather the\u2026depiction of the same sex romantic relationship. And if you think that means I perceive \u201cVikturi\u201d as canonical, the answer is : no, it doesn\u2019t imply that. Bromance doesn\u2019t need any canonical romantic feelings. Romantic friendship doesn\u2019t either. If anything, since the writer seems to lean toward \u201cinterpretation\u201d and the show toward cover-ups, I shall lean toward \u201cromantic friendship\u201d, after all, I too can play with blurriness, but let\u2019s get back to the subject.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yes, gay or yaoi ? Well, maybe it should be pointed out what I mean through those two terms as I\u2019m sure for most it means the exact same thing. And well, technically it isn\u2019t, as \u201cyaoi\u201d is an acronym for \"no climax, no point, no meaning\" which\u2026\u201dgay\u201d isn\u2019t, but I think most of you understood I was referring to those words in terms of homosexuality.\\n\\n\r\nIt is anything but rare among the manga/anime community to see people use the term \u201cyaoi\u201d to refer to real life homosexuality. And my issue with that is\u2026yaoi, as a genre is anything but a faithful depiction of gay people, even less in terms of relationship. And Yuri on Ice fully resorts to codes typical of yaoi. Which is\u2026unsurprising, really, its marketed audience are females, and Japanese writers are well aware \u201cyaoi\u201d sells much better than \u201cgay\u201d (which, I hope you understood, I use in the meaning of \u201crealistic homosexual people/relationships) \u2013 it isn\u2019t the dominant depiction in animes/mangas for nothing. And in itself it isn\u2019t an issue, until the moment the readers/watchers assume those fantasized, unrealistic depictions are \u201ccorrect\u201d (the same goes regarding \u201cyuri\u201d). So, no, YoI isn\u2019t gay, but it is fully embracing its yaoiness, and this from episode 1, whether or not they are canonical as a pairing doesn\u2019t contradict the codes used. You can celebrate the show as bringing full fanservice in the sport anime genres, and \u201cprogressive\u201d in its attempt to \u201cmainstream\u201d yaoi, but progressive regarding LGBT ? No, definitely not.\\n\\n\r\nOk, I write and write again, is there anything else I can still add regarding Viktor and Yuri before focusing on the rest ? Well, yes, because if their relationship is primarily coded as yaoi, reducing them exclusively to that would be reductive. Sports codes also define their relationship, and sometimes \u2013 even if it is a minority compared to the other two \u2013 they can be\u2026\u201dcredible\u201d, \u201ccasual\u201d, the correct term escapes me, but they can interact like normal, real people would. In a way, it could be concluded that their relationship is a \u201cmixture\u201d. And if I had to form one complaint regarding them, it'd be the quasi inexistence of tension in the development of their relationship as well as the cover-ups regarding their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nSo what about the rest ? Well, let\u2019s keep it short since there isn\u2019t much left to state.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, our second Yuri \u2013 the \u201clove rival\u201d ? \u2013 also known as Yurio. While all signs put him as Yuri\u2019s rival, and if his competition with Yuri is the only sport-related tension provider of the entire show, those moments can be reduced to 2 maximum. Making his status as a rival a failure.\\n\\n\r\nThat aside, his role in the narrative\u2026isn\u2019t as important as to be expected, and considering the overall lack of tension of the show (the other charas not making up from it), something that could have been acceptable turns into an issue.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the others ? What could possibly be said ? Do they try to build them out ? Yes\u2026by telling\u2026by lots, lots, lots and almost exclusive telling, through inner monologues\u2026 If you are a little familiar regarding writing, you may have heard of the \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d rule. Well, these characters are \u201ctold\u201d through and through. The characters each possess superficial traits that never get out of the superficiality spectrum and their arcs are rushly/briefly told without any type of development/exploration all while talking to themselves. And that\u2019s not writing. That\u2019s an attempt to make up for a lack of time because of the show\u2019s focus on Vikturi. It\u2019s a stigma from failing at making compromises. They should have focused on a few instead of going into every direction to obtain a convoluted result. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I shall end this part by adding that the most unpleasant thing regarding those inner monologues is that they are successive and that their \u201carcs\u201d can come out of nowhere. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\\n\r\nDespite what one may think, I did enjoy the show. It was fun, despite all its issues. And I genuinely understand why it entertained so many people. Aside from the last two episodes, I was entertained as well. Annoyed, frustrated, felt like being slapped by the pacing and cover-ups and filled with headaches, but entertained.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\nIt feels like it would have worked more as an intimate Anime (which then would have to have less overt fanservice to not be too off). The \u201csport\u201d tag seems to be yet another sort of cover-up regarding what the writer really wanted to do (I repeat, as a sports anime, this is a failure). Not that it means the ice-skating part should have been taken away altogether, but making it a setting rather than the core would have been better. Because the writer\u2019s aim seems to have been the relationship between Yuri and Viktor, whether or not their relationship is canonically romantic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s my biggest issue with this show, it doesn\u2019t concern the art, it doesn\u2019t concern the story, it doesn\u2019t even concern the characters \u2013 despite the numbers of issues being enough to rightfully question the quality of the show - but its lack of honesty. If it wanted to be sincerely an \u201cinterpretative show\u201d, it would have relied on subtlety rather than overt fanservice. And if it wanted to be sincere regarding Vikturi, it wouldn\u2019t have hidden in \u201cinterpretation\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI am already aware this show will have another season, and I hope it will be able to improve itself by learning compromise and honesty.",

            "content": "Yuri!!! on Ice, one of the most talked about series of the 2016 Fall Season. It introduced a sport that was not that much seen in anime series, ice skating, and complemented it with a fun set of characters that combined the seriousness of their efforts/goals and the comedy that existed everywhere. Unfortunately, that good mix was not enough to make it into a great series.\r\nFirst of all, there is no actual story and the pacing is all over the place. Despite the fact that the show brings us a seasoned athlete, so there is no focus how he gets to be a hero fromzero, which is a welcome change, the show just jumps from one place to another in a matter of seconds, while in between there is mainly just dorama between Yuri and Viktor. That is pretty much the gist of this. We get to see other ice skaters too and see parts of their past and thoughts, but considering the show covers 8 months, everything just feels rushed; jumping to a new scene, dorama ensues, other characters just say their piece, they dance, there is tension and repeat. It is a shame, because the focus on the competition could have been handled in a more balanced way and bring out the best in everyone.\\n\\n\r\nSecond of all, while the show starts with an upbeat vibe and successfully achieves a balance between disappointment and comedy and tries to procure a story, it pretty much fails at its premise. While they try to showcase a trio of main characters that are intertwined, Yuri \u2013 Yurio \u2013 Viktor, Yurio did his own thing after the first couple of episodes and seemed to have no relation to the other 2 other than forcibly connecting them with lines \u201cI will not let him beat me\u201d, etc. It seemed liked there would be a more serious rivalry or drama, but Yurio went down his own path and seemed as though he was battling himself to surpass his limits and only as a secondary thought he wanted to prove himself to the rest. But that just might be my personal gripe.\\n\\n\r\nThird of all, the worst part was the excessive fanservice of the BL baiting, because it took precious time that could have been used for smoother transitions or fleshing out characters. The biggest hook of this series is, of course, the relationship between Yuri and Viktor which from the start was controversial to many. Up to the end, the subtler hints became full throttle baits, but only baits, with every single episode. It is understandable since fanservice can garner more audience, but if they kept it in a subtle way, it would possibly have the same results (apart from the rabid screaming) and at the same time it would give it a higher quality. Unfortunately, that never happens and with each episode you will probably wonder \u201cWhat more can they do?\u201d Believe me, they can and they do!\\n\\n\r\nAs already mentioned before, the characters do not have the depth they should have. Undoubtedly, Yuri and Viktor and then Yurio are given the most attention, but only Yurio turned out well. Yuri and Viktor, because of all the fanservice, their characters remain in a state of limbo trying to create more dramatic scenes between them rather than care for them as individuals. There is a personality underneath, but as their core is their relationship, it falls rather flat and while they are both very likable, they are not much more. Yurio on the other hand has some development, because he only focuses on himself and although we do not see much of his thought process, the bits here and there portray his troubles much better. The rest of the characters are given some attention and we see their thoughts, stress and weaknesses, but it feels half of what it could have been.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, it is also disappointing in the ice skating section. The first 2 episodes are truly beautiful and there is detail in almost everything, which of course set the bar too high for the rest of the series. Naturally, a series with that much movement can hardly keep up with perfect animation in every episode, but there is barely any improvement from the 3rd episode on. They reuse animation without trying to polish it in some places at least, it can look very awkward and overall, it just takes away from the experience and considering this is part of its selling point, it is a shame, especially when it seems more attention is given to Yuri and Viktor scenes. Other than that, the show has vibrant colors and the art often takes a more comedic approach with exaggerated features to portray various emotions or entire scenes. There is much detail on the uniforms they all wear, which are distinct and always fitting the music they are dancing to and generally, the art definitely matched the show\u2019s style. Also, the opening sequence is truly beautifully made with flowy colors all around and sketch-like characters ice skating.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good; voice actors did a very good job, the soundtrack was on point and everything fit. The opening song can be addicting and combined with its animation, it makes a really great opening that not many would skip.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did enjoy this series, just not outside the rink as much. I liked seeing them dance and hearing their thoughts while dancing, but there was chaos outside with badly handled situations and forced drama/fanservice to keep up the ship between the 2 main characters. It was disappointing, because it had a strong start that seemed like it could offer a solid journey, but the priority was not that so the excitement kind of wears off in that department. But it is a great watch for someone that truly can enjoy the 2 main characters\u2019 relationship!",

            "content": "Story & Characters - 3\r\nSo, i've been following this anime from the very beginning and I'm not gonna deny, i did get charmed quite fast. Viktor was adorable, Yurio was adorable, Yuri and Viktor's relationship was funny and started to be quite adorable as it progressed and it's a friggin story about skating ! How awesome is that?? But ultimately it's just a story that tries too much with an absolutely atrocious pacing.\r\n It doesn't always manage to express what it wants and there is also a lot of telling insteadof showing in the second half (which I have no big issue with if it isn't redundant or taking me for stupid, which this show sometimes did, though I imagine it was cutting corners in this case for time purposes and I can understand that). Sure, it also manages to convey certain performances and motivations without the need of dialogue, which is commendable, but couldn't escape the bad pacing by trying to cramp together several performances without letting us view them in their mightiness and with no time dedicated to the actual development of these characters besides what they tell us they feel, which seriously, in story-telling is just tiresome to follow, which brings me to one of my main problems with this show: the competition isn't really felt. I never really felt tension during the skating programs, I never really felt like cheering for Yuri or cheering for anybody; at parts, it almost seemed like the anime wasn't a sports anime at all because it tried too hard to push a certain element that I'm gonna get to later. One could argue and tell me that it was a sports anime that wanted to focus on self-confidence and pressure, how nobody really has it easy even if they look like it: today you can perform and come out 1st, but tomorrow you can perform and come out last just because of a mental slip in confidence or fear creeping in and yes, I can totally see that, but it still didn't really make me feel any more attached to who I was following. Some developments also really came out of the blue and certain conclusions were narrated to me, but it expected me to shrug with just that one line information. They didn't have enough time to do it? Well, this ties with another issue this anime has: it's overly ambitious. It wants to be a sports anime, but it also wants to be psychological and it also wants to be a bromance story and the later takes a very big portion of all this...which is my ultimate problem.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I was like 3 episodes in, I really liked Yuri and Viktor and I was okay with the BL shades, but then they started talking and I came to believe that maybe, just maybe, they were trying to go for a naturally developed gay romance (and I say gay, not yaoi or BL, because I hope that most of you are aware of it, yaoi isn't an actual depiction of a gay relationship, it's mostly leaning towards fanservicing girls/ and the potential guys that are into it, but mostly girls.) Well, some would say that I'm wrong and there was really something there even with all the \"censoring\" explanations I've heard (you know what I mean :/), but come on. By episode 7 it was starting to become clear that it was baiting the fujoshis and the last episode pretty much confirmed that for me (I gave it the benefit of the doubt, so maybe, just maybe, i might hear the potential \"I love you\" from one of the two, but nope, I never did. It even enforced the couch x skater type of relationship instead.) But believe what you will, I'm not delusional enough and hey, there will be a second season, maybe they won't be as cowardly anymore if \"love\" is really what they were going for. I'm just gonna shrug deeply right now. \\n\r\nThis \"baiting\" stole too much of the show that I wanted and if it was going to go nowhere, I would have rather just have it toned down a notch instead of continuously getting distracted and wondering whether one of the two would confess yet without making it a joke or somebody denying it with blushy cheeks or make it look like something when it was actually another context, because it does that a lot, a really really friggin' lot. \\n\\n\r\nFor the characters as an overall, they were...I don't know. Who are they again? I liked Yuri's confidence building in the first half and the pressure he felt in the beginning of the second half, but I still feel like it could have done a lot more. Yurio had the most potential and it showed, but it was more dealt with off-screen, Viktor being trapped between being a skater and being a couch and overall working on his own person through another perspective was also dealt with off-screen; I can't pretend it didn't happen, though I'd have wished that something more to make it more memorable, and I say that for all characters. I can see there was a great dealt of effort put into defining some of the characters' personalities, even non-main ones, I can see they weren't really trying to stereotype either, but tried to work around it (like the Italian guy being a pessimist, but it's okay, it's actually generally correct at least for South Italy and most of them do have the family mentality...not to the point of being a siscon, of course haha) and they were all fun to watch if you just manage to shut your brain off, but  I don't think I'm going to remember anybody besides the main 3 and maybe Pichit, at least till the second season comes around, which..i'm not gonna forgive if it pulls the same meh-ness.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound - 5\\n\\n\r\nI really don't know what people were saying when they were talking about beautiful animation and if they noticed the myriad of re-used scenes and disfigured characters or the facepalming moments when it's obvious they put budget in instead of the actual skating (yes i'm looking at you, ViktorxYuri). The opening had a beautiful animation, despite being also re-used, the style and fluidity was beautiful to watch, the first and last episodes also had really good/fairly good animation respectively which is probably the reason why it was spread that the whole show has good animation. But, seriously, it's obvious when they cut corners. I do praise, however, the imagery during some of the characters' first performances, trying to explain the stories of their dancing. It was an interesting visual touch. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the ost, i'm going to hum those opening and ending songs for a long time lol The choices during performances were also quite interesting and I praise Pichit's initial choice of Anna and the King, knowing that movie was banned in Thailand. It was beautiful symbolism and maybe the one that touched me the most. JJ's world and Yuri on ice theme will also stay with me for a long time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\\n\r\nI am not walking away from this anime completely unpleased, I do give it the credit that I think it deserves, but I definitely don't think that this anime should be rated for the relationship that it tries to establish as I saw so many reviews do. Let's not forget this is a sports anime. It didn't play itself like Free were the fanservice was the heart of it, it tried to be so much more and it can't just be all of it.\\n\\n\r\nSo....Less baiting and more sports in the next season please?",

            "content": "I want to warn you beforehand that this will most likely contain spoilers integral to the plot and to the main characters. Do not read this until after you have watched the show or if you simply do not care about being spoiled about the show.\r\n-\r\nYuri!!! On Ice is just like its protagonist: while it is full of emotion, it does not give away everything you want or need it to. It does not directly tell you the true motivations of your main characters (specifically, the deuteragonist and the tritagonist) and it does not immediately give you an explanation behind the protagonist\u2019s own actions. Weneed to piece everything together if we want answers, and that means cross-referencing the dub, the subs, the language, the animation, the soundtrack, and even the show\u2019s writer and staff (from animators to voice actors to choreographers.)\\n\r\nThe plot is, essentially, Katsuki Yuri finishes last place in the Grand Prix Finals and feels as if he is lost. Months after his failure, his idol, the figure skating legend Victor Nikiforov, turns up at his family\u2019s onsen and promises to be his coach so that he may win the Grand Prix. \\n\r\nThe story is simple enough, isn\u2019t it? Clean and straight to the point, except that it\u2019s not.\\n\r\nThroughout the whole season, Yuri constantly belittles himself for his alleged failure in the Grand Prix Finals. Not only does he think of himself as incompetent and a failure because of this event, but he lets it become the reason as to why he eventually believes that he isn\u2019t worthy being a skater and that he shouldn\u2019t even continue. He should just retire and think of something else. (He doesn\u2019t want to, though, because figure skating is his passion.)\\n\r\nThis is where it gets complicated and this is where we first experience a recurring theme within the anime: Katsuki Yuri, the protagonist, is not a reliable narrator. \\n\r\nHe sells himself short one too often, and puts down the fact that he even got into the Grand Prix Finals in the first place. That, in itself, is a huge feat. Yuri was able to win regional and local figure skating competitions until he was able to compete at an international level; that\u2019s hard enough as it is, but to qualify for the Grand Prix and even make it into the Finals is a more difficult feat. Pulling in last would not have mattered when you were one of the final six of your category that got into the Finals. (And the Grand Prix Finals is one of the most important international figure skating competitions, only after Worlds.) Sure, it would be nice to be on the podium but you\u2019re one of the six finalists, that\u2019s still a feat not most can do.\\n\r\nYuri putting himself down and being a bundle of anxiety is not a one-time thing, either. It happens every time he thinks about skating, about the Grand Prix, and his mind will always go back to his failure in the Grand Prix Finals. It doesn\u2019t tell us, outright, that he has an anxiety disorder (except for Episode 7, but only in passing and not him actually admitting that he has a mental illness) but we can infer that from his monologues, his performances, and what his former coach, Celestino, tells Victor in Episode 4.\\n\r\nThe reason why I pointed out Katsuki Yuri\u2019s anxiety disorder and lack of credibility as a narrator is because these two things heavily affect the story. His anxiety is what ultimately keeps him from him accomplishing his goal, why he regresses after he develops as a character, and him being an unreliable narrator affects how we see the story, the narrative, and this takes a blow on our understanding of the characters around him as well as the situation he\u2019s in.\\n\r\nIf we want to find answers regarding Yuri Plisetsky\u2019s background and his motivations, we have to look for it and guess. If we want to find answers regarding Victor Nikiforov\u2019s background and his motivations, we have to look for it and guess and pray we\u2019re right (yes, we go for that extra mile because this man is an enigma). The two of them are main characters, they\u2019re integral to the show and to Katsuki Yuri, but because we barely get to hear their side of the story -- we are kept largely in the dark of who they are and what Yuri means to them or how Yuri becomes their catalyst for change. We don\u2019t know why they are the way they are, why one acts like the embodiment of rage and anger and the other one is childish and eccentric.\\n\r\nThe amount of effort people put into analyzing each episode is overwhelming, and the reason is because the storytelling is not clean cut. It\u2019s messy, unreliable, and you have to  shift the angle of how you perceive things if you want to understand the story even better. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s frustrating but also very, very endearing. Because the writing of the anime is very meticulous and very consistent all throughout, even if sometimes it feels lacking or even frustrating that these characters make the same mistakes again or they\u2019re too antagonizing or the like.\\n\r\nYuri!!! On Ice does not waste a second in any episode. Even lighthearted scenes somehow reveal tidbits of a character\u2019s life or the inner workings of their mind, or even a quirk. It reinforces what we already know, reveals things we don\u2019t yet know, and tells us which particular factoid is so important to remember in this crucial moment in each skater\u2019s life.\\n\r\nIt may be true that Yuri!!! On Ice is generous with the intervals in which they have a time-skip. They gloss over months\u2019 worth of character and relationship development, but it is important to note that the events that are shown in the anime are the ones that matter the most in Yuri\u2019s career when he\u2019s reimagining himself and creating a whole new image and reputation for himself after the previous year\u2019s debacle. We don\u2019t need to see a random day of him and Viktor training in anticipation for the Grand Prix. We didn\u2019t need to see the aftermath of the Cup of China, of him and Viktor talking about their kiss on the way back to their hotel room. We don\u2019t have to see them on the train ride back to Hasetsu once Yuri returns from the Rostelecom Cup and we don\u2019t need to see the night they go to sleep after they get engaged. They aren\u2019t integral to his journey to the Grand Prix Finals, even if each moment would have deepened his relationship further with Victor, Victor who is the catalyst for Yuri\u2019s skating.\\n\r\n(Before anyone asks, the Episode 7 kiss had been confirmed to be canon by the writer herself and their engagement in Episode 10 is not only solidified by the onscreen label of Maria Dolores, but by the receipt that blatantly displays the name \u2018Wedding Rings\u2019 and Victor\u2019s own clarification of them being engagement rings.)\\n\r\nThe story, ultimately, is about Yuri\u2019s personal journey as he tries to overcome his anxiety disorder and take a shot at the Grand Prix Finals. It\u2019s about him growing as a person and as a skater. That\u2019s why it\u2019s labeled a Sports anime.\\n\r\nThe careful detail and thought put into the writing is reinforced by the art and the music, as we will come to learn for ourselves. \\n\r\nThe art has the tendency to drop hints even bigger than what the writing offers, especially in regards to the expressive faces of the roster of characters. \\n\r\nI think the first clue that comes to mind for a fan and/or a viewer is how the lips of either Victor or Yuri are drawn with more detail when there is the intention to either touch it or be intimate. This happens in Episode 2 and Episode 3, when Victor openly flirts with Yuri and brings their faces close together as if they are close to be kissed. This happens in Episode 5 again when Victor puts balm over Yuri\u2019s lips. With this emphasis, most easily draw the conclusion that Episode 7\u2019s Kiss really was a kiss as, in that moment, both their lips were once again highlighted.\\n\r\nAnother clue from the art itself would be Victor and how closely he guards his emotions and his true self. People will point out that his vulnerability and sincerity in scenes can readily be seen by how much of his left eye is covered by his fringe -- or if the shot has it that the fringe is not in sight at all (at the expense of framing it to only the right side of his face.)\\n\r\nThe most obvious clues, however, lie in the OP of the anime, as with every passing episode, the OP becomes more vivid in color and in detail. Every hue of color that appears by their  sides often attribute to their emotions, drive, and relation to one another over time -- which certainly helps in understanding the main characters even better.\\n\r\nOf course, meticulously going over the animation is not just the reason as to why it is so well-loved. While there is light-hearted, well-intentioned teasing of why sometimes the figure skaters look like elongated figure sticks, the animation can be beautiful and even mesmerizing -- especially in the performance of Victor\u2019s FS in Episode 1 and any memorable and important performance of either Yuri later on.\\n\r\nThere is something so mesmerizing about how the animators portray each program, each sequence, as it (usually) mirrors footage of actual figure skaters in-competition. The choreography of each program is never less than thrilling to watch (I can never get tired of Yuri\u2019s SP, although I\u2019m still sad his final performance was not like his first entry into the GP) and is absolutely beautiful, especially On Love: Agape and Eros, Shall We Skate, Stammi Vicino, and Yuri On ice.\\n\r\nAs for the voice actors -- they each give their all with every line they deliver, always doing their best to capture the emotions their characters have in the most crucial of scenes. The main characters\u2019 voice actors (Toshiyuki Toyonaga/Katsuki Yuri, Junichi Suwabe/Victor Nikiforov, K\u014dki Uchiyama/Yuri Plisetsky) deliver their lines with a lot of emotion. Whether it\u2019s exaggerated happiness and joy, annoyance, or pure frustration and despair -- they deliver, beautifully. The recurring cast are just as great and they never fall short of fulfilling their roles and their projected emotions (added with the beautiful writing) pull you into this world of Yuri!!! On Ice that is somehow different yet so similar (and somehow, a bit better) than our own world.\\n\r\nAnd now we turn to the characters, which is very much racially diverse (although there aren\u2019t as many female figure skaters prominent within the anime other than Mila Babicheva and Sara Crispino, but that is expected when the protagonist comes from the men\u2019s figure skating category and isn\u2019t even social within his own category in the first place.) There are, of course, characters added only to serve as competition (Kenjiro Minami, Seung-gil Lee, Emil Nekola, Guanghong Ji, Leo de la Iglesias, Georgi Popovich, Michele Crispino) -- but they were all very lovable in their short screen time, even if some were a bit uncomfortable to watch because the dialogue can either come off as intense familial love and duty or co-dependent incestous relationships (but this is subjective and depends on how one expects family members should display and prove affection to one another.)\\n\r\nYuri\u2019s family and friends back in Hasetsu are lovable and, frankly, adorable. Even if we don\u2019t get to see them as much after Episode 3, we are still always reminded of their unconditional love and support of Yuri as he goes through the Grand Prix. There seems to be an emphasis on how the women in Yuri\u2019s life has helped shape him (his mother, who has done nothing but be supportive; Yuko, who had introduced him to Victor Nikiforov, the figure skating legend; Minako, his childhood ballet instructor who encouraged him to pursue skating and becomes a second maternal figure, and Mari, his sister, who is most likely the one who had silently supported him and reached out in her own way, always looking out for him as seen in Episode 8, when she gives him the call regarding Makkachin\u2019s condition that implies that she may also be the one to who had called regarding Vicchan the year prior.)\\n\r\nThe Final Six, however, seem to garner the most attention when it comes to character development -- including Victor.\\n\r\nFor Phichit Chulanont, his character is one that is simply there to have fun. That isn\u2019t to say that he doesn\u2019t take the Grand Prix seriously, because he does, but he isn\u2019t as aggressive as the other finalists in their conquest of the gold medal in the wake of Victor\u2019s absence. His goal for the Grand Prix is simple: to be able to represent Thailand in an international competition and reclaim a song made sung by a Thai actor as his own. Much like Yuri\u2019s family in Hasetsu, Phichit is a confidant and a source of support and love in times of distress and anxiety. His SP and FS are both fun to watch (and listen to) and seeing him is always a delight. \\n\r\nHe doesn\u2019t get as much character development as, say, JJ or the two main characters who are in the Final Six, and that\u2019s fine because, in Yuri\u2019s story, he isn\u2019t quite as strong a presence as before when Yuri was still a student to Celestino. They\u2019ve separated paths for now, and that explains why he isn\u2019t that much in the focus.\\n\r\nChristophe Giacometti is very much the same, and his own goal is to simply claim the gold -- like almost every other finalist. He\u2019s perceived as a threat at first since he is Victor\u2019s rival and had always been the one to take silver when Victor won gold. That changes, quickly, even after Christophe strives to improve himself upon seeing Yuri\u2019s SP in the Cup of China. He isn\u2019t perceived as a threat in comparison to JJ or Yuri Plisetsky, and that may be because of his own age.\\n\r\nHowever, in Episodes 11 and 12, we see that Christophe has a conflict of his own. It is true that, beforehand, he laments that a season is boring without Victor. However, we learn that his feelings of Victor leaving is more complicated than that. Like literally everyone else in the Grand Prix, he too seeks to usurp Victor by claiming the gold medal while the man is still competing. He feels as if he was deprived of that chance once Victor slinks off to Hasetsu. But at the same time, Victor leaving meant that he too would have to leave. He\u2019s old, he\u2019d be retiring soon.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a struggle he (and countless others) deals with and even after the Grand Prix Final, when we have no ending for Christophe, we can assume he will try to usurp Yuri in place of Victor until Victor returns to the ice next season.\\n\r\nOtabek Altin isn\u2019t worth to note much, although he is a very intriguing character. I do think he\u2019ll show up in the next season (should there be one) and he\u2019d have a bigger role there. For now, he is the character that fulfills the space of a competitor within the Final Six, but he is also a plot device used to help move Yuri Plisetsky\u2019s character along, if just a little bit. I don\u2019t think his SP and FS were very entertaining, but that\u2019s my own taste. They were beautiful, I\u2019ll give him that, but it\u2019s not as alluring as, say, Shall We Skate or On Love: Agape/Eros or Yuri On Ice. (I\u2019d say he\u2019s the most forgettable, but I remember his name easily compared to Christope.)\\n\r\nJean-Jacques Leroy, however insufferable, is there for two reasons. The first is that he is competition to beat, that\u2019s why Yuri (and Victor) has his eyes on him ever since the Rostelecom Cup. He sees JJ as a bigger threat than Yuri Plisetsky and that makes sense -- this man has won nothing but gold in this season alone and in his performance in the Rostelecom Cup, he is able to land four quads cleanly. He\u2019s a threat to Yuri, who is a bit inconsistent with landing his quads (since he gets out of it easily.)\\n\r\nWhile he\u2019s annoyingly arrogant and a bit narcissistic, it\u2019s important to remember that JJ is a more tangible reminder and a TL:DR; version of Yuri from the GPF in Sochi. He is one of the greatest -- a surefire winner -- and people sincerely expected him to be the one to grab gold in the GPF. While we can\u2019t say for sure that people expected Katsuki Yuri to win in Sochi, the sentiment that both men are one of the best that they\u2019d been able to enter the GPF as finalists is there. Yet he screws up in Episode 11 and panic consumes him. He messes up his SP and has the lowest SP score he had since his debut the previous year. He has a bad day, it eats at him and he thinks he\u2019s a failure, but his fans (and his fiance, aw) cheer him on despite his low score. His personal worst. They sing his theme as they encourage him and it\u2019s what makes JJ pull himself together.\\n\r\nThe support he has from his parents, his fiance, his fans, is what ultimately makes JJ to pull himself together at the end of his SP.\\n\r\nDay 1 of the GPF JJ is basically Katsuki Yuri from the GPF in Sochi. You can do great but sometimes you mess up and that\u2019s okay, people have bad days of their own. A lesson that resonates within many people, no doubt, just as it is for Yuri. (When he later admits that he can\u2019t think lowly of JJ because of this -- since JJ and he, Yuri, are both finalists for the GPF. That meant they fought, tooth and nail, against all other competition. And Yuri includes himself in that line of thought, which is very important to him in Episode 12.)\\n\r\nHe comes back for his FS and it begins, well, terribly. Still, JJ pulls himself together and his family and fans still cheer for him regardless. It\u2019s a promise of what Yuri can do, a way of summarizing Yuri\u2019s journey so far in the season. He fell but he got back up, fighting to land a spot on the podium and he shakes off of yesterday\u2019s mistakes.\\n\r\nJJ\u2019s fall in the GPF is what finally humanizes him in the eyes of the audience as he was nothing but an arrogant prick who was rather overconfident in his abilities before. Did he deserve to be taken down a peg? Maybe, maybe not. We don\u2019t see JJ as a person the way we do Christophe or Yurio because in Yuri\u2019s eyes, he\u2019s competition and nothing more; we can\u2019t say for sure that really deserved to be taken down a peg. (He\u2019s never openly antagonized his fellow figure skaters in which he demeaned them for their skating the way Yuri Plisetsky has before. The worst he\u2019s done was a slight taunt at Yuri Plisetsky and calling the fifteen-year old out back in Episode 9. Maybe even claiming he\u2019d win the gold in Episode 10, but he wasn\u2019t saying it as if he expected Katsuki Yuri or Yuri Plisetsky to do bad.) \\n\r\nHis downfall is a wake-up call, a slap to the face, to Yuri just as when he needs it the most.\\n\r\nJJ\u2019s story is one of my favorite things in Yuri!!! On Ice, but that\u2019s because I\u2019ve liked his character from the get go (as frustrating as he was.) He\u2019s another way of looking into the \u2018failure\u2019 that haunts Yuri to this day.\\n\r\nYuri Plisetsky, however, is a far more complicated character. He\u2019s angry, he\u2019s loud, and after Episode 10 I gave up on him already. He\u2019s at the point where his frustrations and lashing out shouldn\u2019t even be excused by his age or the stress he goes through. It\u2019s one thing to be bitter, it\u2019s another to demean and degrade people in an effort to prove yourself.\\n\r\nYet we can\u2019t say for sure that he\u2019s a completely horrible person; we just need to know why is it he adopts a whole different personality around rink mates and rivals in comparison to his presence around his grandfather. He\u2019s still a little kid, with the little kid tendency to idolise adults and expect them to keep their end of the deal. He\u2019s a little kid who still has that childish tendency to demand on a whim and throw a fit when he doesn\u2019t get it.\\n\r\nBut he\u2019s mature enough to understand when he\u2019s being used (see: Episode 3, Onsen on Ice) and that he really does have to give it his all if he wants to win the GPF. I can only assume the number of times he fell on himself attempting his jumps with his arms above his head, and that\u2019s incredibly painful and dangerous. He may be one of the few of the Final Six who worked himself to the bone, poured all his blood and sweat into his SP and FS. Who exhausted himself even after he\u2019s hit the limits of his body.\\n\r\nThere are little quirks of Yuri Plisetsky that we get to see over the course of the series: like how he dislikes being trivialized and would rather be complimented for his hard work and sacrifice (see: Otabek and Episode 10) how he\u2019d only be kind and open to fellow figure skaters once he\u2019s assured that his goal is, in fact, within his reach (see: Katsuki Yuri, katsudon pirozhki, and Episode 9) and that he had once idolized both Victor Nikiforov and Katsuki Yuri (see: Episode 2, Episode 12.) \\n\r\nHe has a dream of beating both his idols even though, in his anger, he claims as if Victor is no longer someone he idolises or looks up to. (Which is doubtful, based on their interaction in Episode 12.)\\n\r\nHe\u2019s still young and he has twelve (or fourteen) more years to continue to make a name for himself. He still has the chance to develop his character, to humanize him and fleshing him out, and while I am proud of his own achievement -- I feel as if he does not really deserve it.\\n\r\nI will concede to the fact that this is the only way to convince Katsuki Yuri to stay in the competitive world of figure skating. I will concede to the fact that Yuri Plisetsky is a very intricate character who copes and expresses himself in a very different manner, but he has to mature, eventually, and realize that his grandfather isn\u2019t the only person he can lean on for emotional and unconditional support. I\u2019m still a bit bitter about his win, but I am proud because he\u2019d worked so hard and, honestly, I do understand his need to give his all in his final FS out of spite that his idol plans on retiring once he wins gold.\\n\r\nVictor Nikiforov is just as difficult to read as Yuri Plisetsky, and that\u2019s partially because he doesn\u2019t openly speak his mind and his actions are rather guarded, and also because Katsuki Yuri still has this certain image of Victor he can\u2019t simply undo from his mind. What we do know is that he loves to motivate people to do their best (see: Christophe Giacometti, Katsuki Yuri, Yuri Plisetsky) and that he genuinely loves ice skating. His love for it is so great that, in an effort to take much of it as he can, he devotes his whole life to it and ignores other facets of his life. Fate rears its ugly head on him, though, as the rewards of all his hard work eventually becomes the reason why he feels so trapped in competitive figure skating.\\n\r\nHe is pressured to always be the best, to always win and surprise people, and in an effort to keep on delivering that, he slowly loses his passion for skating and ultimately loses his will to live. It\u2019s heavily implied in his brief narrative moment in Episode 11, supported by Episode 10. He has depression and he no longer finds joy in something that was once his whole world because he fell in love with it.\\n\r\nThis was something I easily picked up on in the early parts of the season, something I was expecting because I know that feeling, too. I understand that, and he ignores it with his simplistic, over-the-top, larger than life personality as if to say that he\u2019s still okay and he\u2019s fine. That\u2019s something I admire about Victor -- it\u2019s not a healthy thing to do, honestly, but to know that someone was able to capture that feeling and that coping mechanism is something that made me tear up. I relate to him and why he\u2019s one of my favorites.\\n\r\nI still feel as if we need a bit more backstory on Victor on a more personal level and perhaps a more active role as a main character with his own narrative like Katsuki Yuri. Doing so would give the audience a better grasp on what\u2019s happening within their universe as they would have two (or three, if we include Yuri Plisetsky) narratives to compare to one another.\\n\r\nKatsuki Yuri is a piece of work. He really, really is, but that\u2019s what you get when you\u2019re a bundle of anxiety who sincerely thinks they won\u2019t ever be good enough. That\u2019s something I personally relate to, especially because I am just as competitive as Yuri.\\n\r\nI think that him being an unreliable narrator makes the show feel more real. Heck, having Yuri as flawed as he is -- or any other character as flawed as they are -- makes the show feel more real and close to home. Like I said, Yuri!!! On Ice uses competitive figure skating as a medium for the story they\u2019re telling, which is actually a very personal and very troublesome journey a lot of people go through.\\n\r\nAnd having put Yuri in this situation is actually a great way to explore that. He falls in love with skating because he was inspired by Victor and it grows into him becoming a competitive figure skater. Yuri is great, both Victor and Yuri Plisetsky concede to that, but for him that\u2019s not enough. He can\u2019t land a quad-Sal properly, most of the time, and he still remembers how he flubbed every jump in his performance back in the GPF in Sochi. Mind you, Yuri Plisetsky said that his step-sequence was beautiful to watch and didn\u2019t mention anything about Yuri messing it up. That meant his step-sequence was perfect -- it was just him jumps he couldn\u2019t seem to nail down.\\n\r\nIt does cost him points, of course, because that\u2019s the scoring system for you.\\n\r\nStill, it eats at Yuri that he Messed Up when he was having a bad day. His sister had just called, his beloved dog had died and he couldn\u2019t even go to see Vicchan one last time. You couldn\u2019t blame him for falling apart the way he had, but he blames himself for not being able to put it away for a minute.\\n\r\nHe lets that one day define his whole skating career and where it should go -- to the ditch, in small Hasetsu. \\n\r\nYuri needs to believe in himself more, be more assertive in things he believes he knows how to work his way around to. He needs to stop depending on people because he thinks they\u2019d do a better job than he would. He needs to stop depending on Victor\u2019s physical presence to calm him down.\\n\r\nYuri\u2019s a piece of work because he doesn\u2019t really know how to properly express himself when he\u2019s not crying in a parking lot after his heart was broken by a low-key threat. He\u2019d avoid confrontation, altogether, and it eats up at him because he\u2019s just second-guessing everything and all the guesses and possible scenarios he thinks of are all quite negative and it leaves him frazzled.\\n\r\nIt has him thinking and he\u2019s out of it every time he skates and it becomes a cycle. It happens again and again and maybe Yuri is a bit better at communication and expressing what he wants and what he needs, but he still has that problem.\\n\r\nBy the end of the season, Yuri still has this (wrong) notion that Victor will leave once he wins gold and when he retires. We know how much Victor means to Yuri (whether platonically or romantically depending on your own view of their relationship) and the prospect has him distraught and afraid. In turn, Victor already thinks that Yuri knows, for sure, that he will always be by Yuri\u2019s side no matter what and so he doesn\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s this kind of miscommunication that I\u2019m expecting in the next season (and many more to come, if we even get a second season) and it\u2019s this kind of miscommunication that eats up at the both of them throughout.\\n\r\nThe two were, essentially, having very different conversations with one another a lot of the time and Yuri\u2019s inability to properly express himself doesn\u2019t help their situation.\\n\r\nYuri is selfish and very, very determined because he\u2019s so competitive. He wants to win the gold in the GPF, in the Worlds, maybe even the Four Continents as well. He wants to keep Victor all to himself (see: Episode 6) but at the same time he is selfless.\\n\r\nHe\u2019d let himself be alone in Russia if it meant Victor could see Makkachin one last time and not have the burden of your lifelong companion die and you can\u2019t see them in their final moments. He\u2019d retire if (in his mind) it meant Victor was free to pursue competitive figure skating again. He\u2019d willingly compromise himself for the happiness of Victor and countless others, too, but the thing is--\\n\r\nHe\u2019s under the assumption that he knows what Victor wants, what Victor needs. He made Victor\u2019s decision for the man without even asking him beforehand.\\n\r\nYuri is caught up in his own world, too closed of and silent to properly reach out to those around him and realize that he has his head up his butt. That he\u2019s not taking into consideration that the people around him give him unconditional love and support, that they will always be there. Yuri\u2019s mind always makes up some kind of excuse as to why he\u2019d even be sympathized with -- when it comes to Victor, he reasons that it\u2019s because he is Victor\u2019s student so the man automatically cares for him.\\n\r\nHe\u2019s flawed like that, he\u2019s complicated and it\u2019s frustrating but he\u2019s real. He\u2019s someone you can relate to because we all make these kinds of mistakes. We all have our heads up our butts at some point in our lives and there are times when we\u2019re knocked down a peg or two. We all have that one Bad Day that we let define us.\\n\r\nYuri\u2019s anxiety doesn\u2019t dissipate once he and Viktor kiss and are in this relationship, either, and that\u2019s true because that won\u2019t fly away once you have a promise of getting laid or whatnot. That\u2019s not how it works. Getting your idol to be your coach and then your boyfriend and then your fiance won\u2019t chase it away.\\n\r\nEven then, you still need to communicate and be frank in what you need and what you want to tell the other person. He has to learn that -- he can\u2019t just leave it up to Victor to guess because he assumes the man should already know (see: Episode 7, Yuri\u2019s FS), which is just like Victor\u2019s problem of not telling Yuri his intentions of being with him forever (see: Episode 10 Engagement Rings.)\\n\r\nHe\u2019s flawed, he\u2019s not perfect. \\n\r\nThat\u2019s what makes him a brilliant and memorable protagonist.\\n\r\nThat\u2019s what makes this show a phenomenon, a thing of beauty.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s messy, it\u2019s flawed, it\u2019s human. It doesn\u2019t shy away from showing how ugly anxiety can get, how bad it can get you. It doesn\u2019t shy away from showing how much sacrifice it is an athlete will make for their goal. It doesn\u2019t shy away from the imperfections of relationships (from romantic to platonic to familial) and it doesn\u2019t shy away from portraying that anxiety as something that you deal with everyday, with some days worse than the others.\\n\r\nBut at the same time, Yuri!!! On Ice isn\u2019t afraid to remind you that it\u2019s okay, because there will be people by your side ready to catch you when you fall. There will be people who try their damndest to help you out and bring you back out there.\\n\r\nI do wish that the anime wasn\u2019t as rushed as it was, but they had only thirteen episodes to work with. I do wish they didn\u2019t cram so much time into the Crispino Twins\u2019 dilemma and compromising Seung-gil Lee\u2019s and Emil Nekola\u2019s characters. I do wish that they addressed the current miscommunicating issue of Victor and Yuri. I do wish that they flesh out Yuri Plisetsky. I do wish we get to see and understand Otabek Altin even more. I do wish to understand the scoring system in the anime\u2019s own version of the ISU (ISO, in the yoi world.) \\n\r\nBut this anime was great as it was, and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything else. It\u2019s a personal kind of anime you\u2019d get to appreciate when it hits so close to home, when it hits you in the face with a bat. I\u2019d watch it again and again and I have, so many times, and I still see a new detail every time and I understand it even better. I understand the characters and their motifs.\\n\r\nSo I recommend it to non-fans who\u2019ve watched it to give it another try. I recommend people who read this but haven\u2019t even watched it to go and watch it. I recommend it to fans who\u2019ve watched it to watch it again.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a great anime, though far from perfect, because it\u2019s writing is real and meticulous -- it\u2019s art and audio just as so. There is so much love and effort poured into this anime, and it shows in every passing episode.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s heartfelt and it is endearing.\\n\r\nYOI is easily my favorite anime from the past few years. It\u2019s really, really great.\\n\r\nAnd if there are non-fans who still actively dislike the show then fine, it\u2019s not your cup of tea. But don\u2019t go around telling people that they shouldn\u2019t bother because it sucks -- say why you don\u2019t like it in a review and that\u2019s it. Kubo and the staff will hear what you need and address it as best as they can. But don\u2019t try to swat potential viewers away because that\u2019s not fair to the creators, who worked hard on this, and the ones who want to watch out of pure curiosity. Who knows what it will bring for them? A wake-up call? An anime that validates them and what they feel? A genuinely interesting anime? Figure skating in general?\\n\r\nx",

This anime tugged at my heart and made me cry both tears of sadness and tears of joy. \r\nThe plot was very well written, the characters had great backstory, and the animation was gorgeous. They did a great job with the skating, and were even very accurate on how an actual competition goes; they even had real announcers do the announcing parts. \r\nThe main plot is the guy who hit rock bottomin his career as a skater, so he does an homage of his idol and skates a perfect program of the other guys performance. This man sees it and decides to drop everything and go be his coach. Let the hilarious antics ensue as we watch them work towards the main characters goal of winning gold at the GPF! \\n\\n\r\nAlso there is a real love story going on between the two male leads, and it isn't queer baiting!",

            "content": "This anime uses the most typical and generic and uninspired and annoying of anime tropes. Like, showing physically abusing men as something casual and even comedic. Or like expecting a man to prove his worth simply because he happens to be a member of the male gender, while a female isn't expected to do anything more than what she feels herself like doing and should always be protected and taken care of regardless and is excused from doing anything, while a male must always do what is expected of a man to do and preferrably also more.\r\nThen there's the BS romance between Yuri and Viktor,which is entirely dependent on them being a trainer and a competitor. For some dumb reason, they couldn't just be a couple regardless of anything - no, god forbid apparently. And there is no bonding process or them just hanging out unless it's related to the competition. No cuddling or chilling out - all about the training and competition all the damn time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd SOOO much focus on them skating on the ice with the same recycled skating animation repeated for each character over and over and over AND OVER AND OVER again. Not just for the protagonist, nope. It's also for all the other competitors. No montage or anything, just dragging each segment out for forever and ever.\\n\r\nThey try to give us backstories for every single one of them, but there is just no reason for us to care about them. And there's this disgustingly pretentious tone over the whole thing with ice skating meaning more than life or something.\\n\\n\r\nI just don't get why they can't make an honest romance out of this instead of this pseudo-romantic stuff with them only MAYBE eventually getting together if the protagonist succeeds in achieving something. It's the same stuff like in other poorly written animes like Love Hina, where they postpone them becoming a couple over and over again because the protagonist must make sure he doesn't fail at succeeding some sort of test - in Love Hina's case, getting through the exam.\\n\r\nIn fact... Yuri looks and acts an awful lot like Keitaro. SOMETIMES. They don't seem to make up their mind on who or what Yuri is. Sometimes a spineless nerdy twat, other times a generic uke from a yaoi, other times a shounen-esque \"I'm gonna be the best!\"-character. It doesn't make him more complex, it just makes it feel like it's more difficult to know who or what Yuri really is.\\n\\n\r\nJust like all other animes with male gay romances in it, this was a pure disappointment. And being a gay guy myself, that is extremely depressing to have to realize.",

You will not like it. \r\nFree spoiler. \r\nBored of Highschool sport show? Angry because some sluts are around you babes? Love male fanservice and gay characters in non-bl series? Love skating anime? THEN THIS SHOW IS FOR YOU!!! \r\nPlot 10/10\r\nOriginal and not a copy paste from other series, YOI is about a guy called Yuri (Yuri IS a Japanese, Russian, Greek, Hebrew and Korean name according to Google-san) who wish to be the best skater in Japan/or in the world just like his rolemodel \"Victor Nikiforov\" \\n\r\nAt the very young age, Yuri loved skating with his friends (Specially Yuuko Nishigori) and he was trained by a baley dancer Minako-san (since she was his trainer, he use to dance and run to lose weight and to skate properly in the ice cuz ofc no fats are needed \"no offend to over-weight/fat people, please take it as a joke\" XD) Anyway, Yuri enter the competition (as shown in 1st episode) and after that he went back to Japan. Sadly he was sad but, what happened is that after he showed to  Yuuko his sexy dance (the dance which Victor danced when Yuri was young), Yuuko daughters took a video and by mistake (I laughed at this part so much) uploaded it in YouTube. At that time millions of people saw it in social media and Victor was one of these people. At that time, he ran from Russia to Japan to become Yuri couch. Now, when both of them agreed, Yuri Plisetsky who is know \"Yurio\" went from Russia to Japan for Victor to bring him back to Russia. But what happened is Yurio and Yuri are rivals. And yes, the story become more and more Joyful. Would like to explain more but I don't want to spoil. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat? The animation is bad? ARE YOU SERIOUS? God bless Mappa, Kubo sensei and Hiramatsu for taking care of the art and the animation. The characters are hot/cute and beautiful, JUST LOOK AT VICTOR *drool* I mean *cough cough * let's change the subject. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nNo way, even Yuri on ice haters loved the OP/ED. God bless the seiyuu's for making the best voice for each characters. The atmosphere, the winds, and the skating sound. ALL OF THEM ARE DONE MADE WITH FULL HARDWORKING. Characters voice definitely suit them all specially the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNo way, I won't score it 9.9/10 because THE CHARACTERS ARE MY TYPES YESSS!!!! The characters are all loved, yes I even like the girls. All of them have a nice suitable characters with each nice storyline. Definitely my favorite is Victor but STILL I love them all. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThank you so much to all the staff, studio and specially to Kubo-Sensei. These people made me in love with the series, for me, it's one of the best series of 2016. Yuri On Ice is definitely a new series to Fujoshies and Sport anime. This anime made me laugh from their comedy sense, made me cry for their sad story and sad theme and me happy for everything. \\n\\n\r\nNow to the end, I'm going to buy the anime 100% once it's out from FUNIMATION. Thanks for reading my review, feel free to comment on my review.",

            "content": "People say that the anime industry is in decline, and that a lot of stupid anime series come out. Well this anime sends that thesis into oblivion. This show has been such a breath of fresh air, and in my opinion one of the candidates for anime of the year. What makes me sad the most is that a lot of people are not even wathing this, because they think it's IN YOUR FACE Yaoi, without any redeeming qualities, which is so wrong, that it's not even worth my time to explain. So I plead that people would give it a shot with open mind.It really is a gem.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a figure skating anime, which is a sport that not a lot of people are familiar with, and not very popular except for mostly in Russia and Japan. However the thing that separates it from other sports anime out there, is the fact that it is a very character driven story. Every episode we learn something new about our characters, and they evolve through their interactions with others. The beauty of figure skating, that is portrayed in this anime, is that the characters are dancing based on their emotions. Every movement, every glare has a significance, and you can't help but get closer and closer to them as the story progresses. It does not follow a linear path, where the only important thing is the victory, they struggle through their performances, there is doubt, exaltation, suffering, and most of all there is no one that you can hate. Everyone has their own reason to want to win, and there are no cheap shots. The other thing that makes this anime a true diamond is the artwork. Studio MAPPA has went all out, to present to us an eye candy, with which you lose track of time, and every episode feels like it is five minutes long. All throughout these 12 episodes, there has never been bad frame, anything to suggest that they didn't give their 100 % to make this into a groundbreaking show. The music as well is stellar. Since you hear the opening, titled History Makers, you can expect greatness. I have never seen Yaoi, because I am not a fan, however if every Yaoi is as good as Yuri On Ice, than I will watch everything I can get my hands on, nevertheless I don't think that there will be something as good as this. The music during the performances is incredible as well, in a way that it makes you stand up and dance as well. I have enjoyed this anime a lot, and I will be the happiest man if there is another season. It has been a hell of a ride, hopefully, this is not the end, but a see you soon.",

            "content": "Yuri on Ice is one of those shows that hype you up with a trailer that promises if not outstanding then at least appealing animation and a premise ripe for drama, and... that's about it. At no point does the actual show get better than or even live up to its promise, which is a telltale sign of poor execution. \r\nIt ultimately doesn't matter how much research you do about the sport you're writing about if the athletes you're writing make no sense in any universe, real or fictional. Victor Nikiforov, the world's best male figure skater who - at the age of 27 -can't possibly have much more left to give his sport, loses his \u201cinspiration\u201d and decides to take a season off. As in, up and leaves Russia, apparently with not a word to the public, the skating federation, the sponsors... you know, all those people who make it possible for him to be nasty rich and famous. So there goes realism as Victor leaves home to become the coach of a guy who's a perfect stranger to him, for flimsy reasons to be explained later on, and that's possible because... he's Victor, I guess. That's all the explanation we ever get when it comes to him, which is unfortunate since he's supposed to evolve from the protagonist's unreachable idol into a flesh and blood human being the protagonist is personally close to. He's supposed to be an important main character who's slowly but surely humanized in the eyes of the rest of the characters who all look up to him to some degree, but that never really happens. Oh, there's a halfhearted attempt to explain away his lack of a personality but honestly? It just feels like weak storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nWeak storytelling reminds me, the show wants to be so many things at once, it ends up being none of them but a schizophrenic amalgamation of poorly constructed sports drama (you know things are not going well in a sports anime when you'd be okay with just about anyone winning, you just want the repetitive sporting sequences to end already) and lowbrow comedy populated by a jarring mix of characters who are \u201crealistic\u201d and characters who are insufferable caricatures (the triplets? JJ? Give me a break.) This mess is peppered with character and relationship drama that never really gets explored beyond a few scenes which, at their best, suggest complexity (Russian Yuri and Victor's bittersweet mixed feelings towards each other, while largely unsaid, are perfectly understandable and thus far more compelling than any other relationship on the show) and at their worst are really just fanservice taken to a distasteful level. It's been said before but it bears repeating: gay characters and relationships have been done well by mainstream aka non-BL anime before. Not often but it does happen. It doesn't happen here.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, YoI is far from the best or worst of the medium. The animation, script and sound are all safely in the 'average' range. It's not the kind of bad I'd warn people off of \u2013  if you're interested after seeing the trailer, give it a try. Maybe you'll find it enjoyable entertainment. Just don't expect anything life-changing, because \u2013 despite promises to the contrary \u2013 no history gets made here.",

            "content": "Sports anime don\u2019t come very often, let alone skating anime. However, 2016 has been a year for sports anime. With anime based on volleyball, rugby, soccer, and\u2026 water jousting with butts and boobs(?), Yuri on Ice needed to prove that it can top most of the sports anime and make theirs more intense. Or maybe they don\u2019t need to compete with other with the sport. Maybe Yuri on Ice doesn\u2019t need to compare itself to other sports anime and maybe compare itself to other series like Ping Pong \u2013 where the sport isn\u2019t the main focus. In Yuri on Ice, the skating it simply thebackbone that holds the series in place. The real focus of the series is its characters and their relationships. And does this formula end up holding up well? Luckily is does!\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nIn most sports anime, the story is never the selling point for the series, but rather the sports and the characters are what pulls the series through. Yuri on Ice is no exception as its overall plot is quite simplistic and gets the job done. But despite all that, the writing still manages to be intriguing and exciting, primarily because it\u2019s not completely predictable. This isn\u2019t the type of anime where the protagonist ranks first in everything. It\u2019s never really clear who the winner of a tournament can be, and that\u2019s what makes the writing feel stronger than it is. Other than that, it\u2019s a typical underdog story of how the protagonists idol becomes his mentor and coach and helps him in becoming a better skater\u2026 with a lot of fujoshi-baiting of course. And that\u2019s another reason why the series ends up feeling a little more unique in its writing is because the series focuses on its characters more than anything and spends a lot of time in creating relationships. The skating is the background stuff, while the characters are in the foreground. It\u2019s the moments with the character and the development in their relationship rather than the development in the competitions.\t\t\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, Yuri on Ice is more of a character-driven anime rather than a story, or sports-driven anime. For the most part, the series focuses on the interactions between the characters, particularly Yuuri and Victor\u2019s. The tone of this series is a nice balance between seriousness and lightheartedness, just like many other sports anime. And Yuri on Ice\u2019s style is definitely worth mentioning. It has a modern feel to it with its use of social media in the anime and it maintains an elegant and traditional feel during the skating moments. During more of the slice-of-life segments of the series, the series maintains a more lighthearted feel and simply focuses on making the series feel fun by using its characters to its potential. However, during these breather moments, there\u2019s also moments of seriousness that focuses on the character relationships. And the series is at its most serious during competitions and maintains a more intense tone. Despite it being a sports anime, it\u2019s main real focus it its shounen-ai moments, and that\u2019s not a bad thing. There\u2019s a lot of sports anime where fujoshi-baiting is one of their selling point, or maybe the anime was designed to be normal, but the fujoshi fanbase went crazy on Tumblr. Yuri on Ice is more than baiting as it\u2019s quite genuine, and that\u2019s what makes this series succeed. With it actually having the will to go all out with its character relationships, it makes the series stand out more. One issue with the series is that not all buildup pays off, particularly the finale. Arguably, it\u2019s the buildup moments that are more enjoyable and they keep the standard high, and when the result of the buildup arrives, it feels a bit underwhelming. That isn\u2019t to say that they lack impact, but with the inconsistent production values, some of its effects are lost.\\n\r\nPresentation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nWhat Yuri on Ice\u2019s biggest selling point is its characters. For a character-driven series, it\u2019s important for the characters to feel complex, or at least interesting. Luckily Yuri on Ice manages to succeed in doing that. The protagonist, Katsuki Yuuri, is a great character, despite being built up from an initial clich\u00e9 characterization. At first, he starts off as a character who is lacking in skating abilities, but with the help from his idol and coach, he\u2019ll try his best to win the gold medal at the Grand Prix. What started as an simple character ended up being more enjoyable and felt a bit more complex. This is primarily due to his relationship with Victor Nikiforov, the deuteragonist of the series. Victor is consistently fun to watch due to his humor, style and personality. His and Yuuri\u2019s relationship feels more than just fujoshi-bait, and that\u2019s what makes their relationship feel stronger. Nothing feels forced, despite the fact that the sole reason this relationship exists is because of its fan-base. There\u2019s a misconception that Yuuri is the titular character of the series, when it\u2019s actually Yuri Plisetsky, despite him not being the main character. Yuri is a grouchy, ignorant and selfish person who is somewhat easy to tolerate despite his attitude. As a matter of a fact, he\u2019s one of the more enjoyable characters of the series, and they fact that even he gets character development by the end of the series is a well addition. And there are other enjoyable characters in the series that make the cast of characters feel more violent. From the overly narcissistic JJ, to the logically composed Otabek, this series has a wide variety of characters that get enough spotlight to be likable.\\n\r\nCharacter: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art in Yuri on Ice, for the most part is very good-looking, however, there are moments when the art quality drops, especially when it\u2019s sacrificed for more fluid animations. When Yuri on Ice looks good, it looks really good. Character models are well detailed with great lighting effect being used. Background look fairly detailed and has a modern look to it.  The character designs are also quite pretty and attractive and it feels unique. However, due to its art looking really good during these moments, it makes it even more distracting when it doesn\u2019t look good. During many of the skating moments, character models will lack details and sometimes the character bodies would be disproportional. And sometimes the backgrounds (in outside areas) would be done with a water-paint design. Though some can argue that it might be used for artistic purposed, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s just done that way to save effort and time. However, Yuri on Ice still looks good for the most part and these quality drops aren\u2019t terrible enough to ruin the experience. \\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animation quality also suffers the same problem as the art quality, as it is quite inconsistent. During its high points, Yuri on Ice looks really good and very fluid. As seen in the first episode and during the most important skating sessions, the animation quality feels very top-notch. Character motions look very fluid and it adds a greater impact to the performances. For a sports anime, it is very important for the production values to be top-notch inconsistent. Since characters are in constant motion in most sports anime, it\u2019s important that the animation quality is fluid so the character motions don\u2019t end up being distracting and more engaging. Anime with poor production values may end up making their series look like a slideshow, especially during the sports part (I\u2019m looking at you Days). And for a skating anime, where characters will move constantly in a fluid motion, good animation quality is necessary. Yuri on Ice\u2019s animation is consistently fluid during these skating moments\u2026 in sacrifice for some other stuff. As mentioned before, the art quality ends up being undetailed during most of the skating moments, but also the series fails to create a proper depth in perspective. Sometimes characters would look farther than they are and this is because of a failed sense of depth. However, these moments are distracting, but luckily they don\u2019t happen too often.\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting cast also does a great job in representing their characters. The seiyuu cast for Yuri on Ice is filled with well-known seiyuu with great track record. Toyonaga Toshiyuki does Yuuri very well, even if he sounds a little younger than he should be. But he gets both the comic timing and serious moments right. Victor\u2019s seiyuu, Suwabe Junichi, is a well-known one and he does an extraordinary job as Victor. He makes his character hilarious and passionate and overall makes his character feel more enjoyable. And whenever he says random Russian words, it\u2019s pretty damn funny. Yuri\u2019s seiyuu, Uchiyama Kouki, is one of my personal favorite as he\u2019s able to do both serious and lighthearted characters. Yuri is more of a serious character, who at times you can\u2019t take seriously, and Uchiyama manages to capture the characters rough personality very well. There are other really well known seiyuu that play important roles, such as Hosoya Yoshimasa, Ono Kensho, and Miyano Mamoru, and they all do a very good job in voice acting their characters.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music in Yuri on Ice is one of its biggest strong points. The OP, \u201cHistory Maker\u201d, is simply put on of the best openings of the year. All of the lyrics is in English and they have a really good meaning to it. Plus the music used in the opening is brilliant and complements the vocals. The ED, \u201cYou Only Live Once\u201d, is just as good as the opening and the song has a very upbeat and modern vibe to it. Complemented with Instagram-style visuals, the ED feels refreshing and it\u2019s something you\u2019ll rarely hear in an anime. However, the background music is also really good, particularly for the ones used in the skating performances. \u201cIn Regards to Love ~Eros~\u201d and \u201cYuri on ICE\u201d are easily my favorite soundtracks from this series. And there\u2019s so many other well orchastarted music used in the series that makes these skating moments feel more impactful.\\n\r\nMusic: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nYuri on Ice ended up meeting my expectations and satisfied me. It never goes beyond to something special, but it manages to consistently entertain with both its lighthearted and serious moments. Some of the buildup doesn\u2019t pay off as well as I was hoping to be and with the inconsistent production values, some of the skating programs can feel a bit unsatisfying. But Yuri on Ice makes up for that with its character development and interactions, and its modern feel and tone. Most of the competitions feel enjoyable and the humor is really good in the series. The most entertaining part of the series is Yuuri and Victor\u2019s relationship and without it, Yuri on Ice wouldn\u2019t have anything too special that could make it stand out. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Yuri on Ice manages to be what it originally promises; however, it never goes beyond that. The unique and fun cast of characters makes this series have more fun to it and the relationship between the two main characters is well handled. The skating moment are really enjoyable to watched due to great background music being used during these moments. However, some of the impact is lost due to inconsistent animation and art as characters can look undetailed or deformed at times and the lack of proper depth can be distracting. Though not all buildup is payed off, the series still manages to be quite satisfying and it ends in a way where it\u2019s open for a second season. Hopefully we get to see a continuation of Yuuri, Victor and everyone else\u2019s journey. \\n\\n\r\n+ Great characters and Yuri and Victor\u2019s relationship is well handled and doesn\u2019t feel forced. \\n\r\n+ Nice blend of lighthearted and seriousness, complemented by a modern style used for this series.\\n\r\n+ Outstanding OP and ED with the background music complements the skating moments well. \\n\r\n+ Great voice acting from a cast filled with well-known seiyuu.\\n\r\n- Average production values lead to inconsistent animation quality and undetailed characters at times\\n\r\n- The pay-off for all the buildup isn\u2019t completely satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4/10",

            "content": "Before I start, I would like the preface this by saying that a 6/10 means I deemed the show as \"fair\" or \"fine\". Many people think of anything below a 7 to be bad news, but that is not the case in my reviews. As always, you are free to agree or disagree with my own views as you like, but I always do my best to review a project in totality, and not just based on enjoyment as many reviewers tend to do. Now on to all the technical stuff!\r\nYuri!!! on Ice is Fall 2016's most popular anime, with an interesting take on therarely touched field of professional figure skating. Originally I passed on starting this show as I figured it would be a fairly average sports anime with a fair amount of yaoi bating for all the fujoshi's out there. However after hearing positive opinions on the show I figured I'd give it a shot, alas it was about what I expected: alright.\\n\\n\r\nStory: ~5\\n\r\nA five according the grading criteria on this site is described as \"mediocre\" or \"average\", and I found this to be a fitting way to describe the writing of Yuri!!! on Ice. I'll avoid summarizing the show here in an effort to avoid spoilers, as well as avoid repeating information that finished viewers are already aware of. To be straightforward, the writing wasn't particularly impressive, and ended up falling into a more predictable sports anime type of plot. Main character loses his passion for the sport -> In getting a new coach his spirit is revitalized and he struggles to reach the top and win 1st place. Through Yuri and Victor's little adventure towards the 1st place in finals, we find ourselves subject to many story telling issues.\\n\r\n1. Weak characters that last an episode and then just make cameos that serve as a time filler or attempt at comedic relief \\n\r\n2. Forced romance (if you even want to call it that)\\n\r\n3. Mild melodrama to make things seem like plot points\\n\r\n4. A story that is crammed into twelve episodes and finds itself struggling to keep up with and develop all of the main characters.\\n\r\n5. A final episode that felt extremely cramped and rush as they tried to fit too much info to properly end the show. (And I can't agree the show was properly ended either. Sure there might be a second season coming, but it still felt rushed and we barely saw any of the performances compared to usual, and saw basically nothing in terms of conclusive material)\\n\\n\r\nAlthough many of my points seem like complaints, the story itself was still follow-able, and served as a fine background for people to indulge in the animation and sports drama. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nA seven is likely low enough to get me punched by plenty of people, but I still think it to be a fair assessment. The animation was good, but there are two main reasons this score isn't higher for me. One reason would be that there often seemed to be a severe contrast in animation between different scenes. For example, it was obvious most of the budget was poured into the skating scenes, but in turn the scenes outside of the skating rink oftentimes were comparatively weaker. My second complaint is that I found it obvious that this show did not have enough time every week to produce the art they wished for. By this I mean that because the artists are restricted so heavily by time restraints and deadlines, it often seemed like the art felt choppy even in the skating scenes. To further illustrate this, in the earlier episodes I often found myself annoyed with some of the skating scenes because it was obvious they were drawn apart from the backgrounds on which they were drawn for. The skaters themselves were drawn to show disparities in depth from the camera, but they still seemed out of place compared to the constant picture of the rink behind them. I can't really fault the artists for this though, as drawing every single frame of an ice skater and their respective rink would take immense amount of time and budget. And here's where we end with my rating of 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good, but it was obvious that the art could have been better if the show had more time and money behind it. Alas it was a single season show with an episode weakly, so it's hard to ask for much more. Thus we end with a good rating of 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nI plan on keeping the sound section on the shorter side because I don't have a ton to say about it. The music across the whole series was good. Oftentimes it felt like the staff chose good songs for the respective performances. Apart from just the music, the voice acting was good as well. The VA's did perfectly well for most of the characters, and the voices were cast well for each individual character. Another positive note here is that the foreign voice acting were better than most anime. A good example of this would be the French reporter seen in the last episode, who was voice acted by someone who obviously spoke fluent French, whereas in anime it is very common for companies to just have a Japanese individual attempt speaking a language in which they are not comfortable in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, good sound in general. Nothing absolutely amazing, but nothing I can really hate on either, so the safe rating of 7 was given.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s): 5\\n\\n\r\nTo be abrupt, many characters were very simple and one-dimensional, and as discussed before in the story section, were undeveloped and under-utilized. The rating 5 means average, and I found that very accurate in describing the characters of a show. No characters stood out as very interesting, but instead fell into very common tropes. The main character, Yuri, was the average wimpy MC who has to change who he is to reach the top. Victor was a fairly average bubbly flamboyant male. Yurio was an angry teenager. And most other characters could be described in one or two words.\\n\r\nOne more thing to comment on would be the awkward forced romance between Yuri and Victor, but I won't complain too much about that because if I do I'll likely just be called a homophobe.\\n\\n\r\nFor a short summary : The characters were average. Not much else to say there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment I found this show pretty average. I didn't particularly enjoy or not enjoy the show, so an average score of 5 would likely be the best option here. It's worth noting however that I did tend to enjoy the skating scenes themselves because I found them interesting as a person who has never been into figure skating, but this enjoyment was counteracted a bit by the fact that many performances were just repeated. To be conclusive, in terms of enjoyment, I found this show to be average. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts. Overall Rating is a 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe show wasn't awful. It was alright. Generally a 6 or above on my list means I consider the show recommendable. Objectively I don't think this is a great show by any means, but I can understand it's appeal to specific people or audiences.\\n\\n\r\nWas \"Yuri!!! on Ice\" overhyped? Yeah, I think that's perfectly fair to say. Is it an awful show? By no means. It's just alright. \\n\\n\r\nThis concludes the review. If you'd like to further discuss anything, or have any questions, you are always free to add or message me. Thanks for reading the review guys and gals.\\n\\n",

            "content": "After watching the Crunchyroll Anime Awards 2016 and some Youtubers reactions to it I decided to give Yuri!!! on ICE a go. At first I quite liked it, then it became less and less enjoyable with every episode...\r\nI generally don't watch sport animes nor BL so the show was new to me in these aspects, but did not capture me in the slightest because of these elements.\r\nLet's start with the sport aspect... For the first 5 or so episodes it felt like I was watching the Olympics. I did not really understand how difficult the performances were but it felt good to see them. Afterthat it just became more of the same with more and more forced personal struggle. The last 2 episodes were really really boring because of this....\\n\\n\r\nFor the BL part it felt like it was there to be there so our main character could improve for a reason and that's all. It was obvious from the start but there weren't enough screen time for it to feel entirelry right with me when the establishment of the relationship happened. There were tears, anxiety, happiness after that but all of it felt forced and it got more screen time than necessary...\\n\\n\r\nThe story was like this: Get somewhat familiar with the characters > Competition > New characters > Competiton > New characters > Competition and that's all. Because of this the characters were vague for me. All had some kind of a dream but nothing I would remember after some days. Especially Yuri's character was bad. It was all over the place. Agressive, submissive, brave, cool, crybaby, anxious, etc. Inconsistency in it's finest.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was alright but a lot of short clips were repeated more than once. I did not like the skating bits however. They felt too much like cheap green screen parts from older live action movies with unmoving backgrounds... The character designs compansated for it though, they were quite good.\\n\\n\r\nThe one part I praise is the sounds. The OP and ED were good especially the OP as far as the music goes (The animation for them was kinda meh...). The songs the skaters were skating to were diverse but enjoyable and really set a mood for the skating. The voice actor selection for the skaters were really good as well amd they did a fine job with their lines.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I would like to rate is the fanservice. It was definitely for the female watchers. Asses, musculine (half-)naked men, shiny and tight costumes for the performances, and some close up lipshots...I still can't get over those....\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it was watchable, even entertaining to some degree. I expected far worse than what I got because of the Youtube reviews.\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend it to everyone but if you like ice skating or shipping male characters with each other then give it a go.\\n\\n\r\nBtw I'm a straight man in his early twenties with an acceptance to homosexual relationships. Maybe someone can better understand this review with these informations.",

            "content": "I'm honestly amazed how much I love this series.  I am not generally into sports anime (out of the 5+ sports animes my friends have tried to get me to watch previously, I only actually liked one) and actually hate the vast majority of yaoi/shounen-ai with a burning passion.  However, this is actually one of my favorite series and I love practically everything about it.\r\nBefore continuing with my review I should probably clarify that the reason I hate the majority of yaoi/shounen-ai is because its almost tailor-made for the \"female gaze\" (and I'm saying this as a heterosexual female).  Thecharacters personalities and their development exist solely within their relationship.  Said relationship is also hypersexualized to the point of absurdity to appease the female viewers and the homosexuality is fetishized to hell and back.  Not to mention that said relationships meet practically none of criteria of a healthy romantic connection.  This fetishization even leaks into other shows in the form of queerbaiting, showing just enough to imply a sexual relationship for those that want to see it, while outright denying any actual queer representation.\\n\\n\r\n   Yuri on Ice exceeds my expectations by subverting and countering both of these things.  Not only are Yuri and Victor confirmed on screen as a couple, their relationship is beautifully done.  They have a genuinely healthy romance that is a major focus of the story without being the only aspect of it.  Both characters are well developed and have their own agency both within and outside of their relationship, which is something that media has problems showing even in heterosexual romances.  \\n\\n\r\n   This brings us to the characterization, which in my opinion is phenomenal.  Yuri and Victor are, as I mentioned, fully realized and multi-faceted characters.  Unlike many other shows, this also extends to the other characters.  Yurio is just as well developed and shows just as much evolution as a person as the main couple.  Even the side characters, although not as developed as the main trio, are multifaceted: they all have their own goals and personalities, without relying on 1 dimensional tropes (yes, even Chris).  I would also like to add that I love how none of the characters fit the stereotypical \"rival who sabotages others to get ahead\" role  because the character reactions feel so much more genuine and realistic.\\n\\n\r\n    In terms of the \"sports\" bit of the sports anime, I am not an authority on figure skating.  Besides watching bits of the Olympics, this show is basically my only source.  However, the show has gotten a lot of positive views from actual professional skaters, so I'm gonna take their word in terms of the accuracy of the portrayal.\\n\\n\r\n If the amazing characterizations and relationships weren't enough, the aesthetics are also great.  The designs are good, and animation looks really fluid (not perfect but we sadly cant have an infinite budget. Itll be touched up more for the DVD release anyway), the competition outfits eyecatching (Yurio's are my personal favorite), the scenery is well done (and a lot of them are real places), and the art style and movement in the opening is gorgeous (I like watercolor and ink type art way too much).\\n\\n\r\n   Speaking of the opening, it was stuck in my head for like a week.  The opening and ending songs are so good and the music used in the skating routines is just as good and fits amazingly with the animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Yuri on Ice has a wide array of amazingly well developed characters and interactions, does a great job showing a healthy non-fetishized queer romance, the animation and designs are aesthetic goals, the music is beautiful, and the show surpassed all of my expectations and I love it so much for it.   \\n\\n",

I never thought that you could make a good anime about figure skating but Yuri on Ice proved me wrong. \r\nThe plot is one of a typical sports anime: the protagonist fails at the beginning and tries to succeed again with a lot of obstacles on his way to the top, (very simplified version).\r\nIt is beautiful animated, you can see how much effort and time they put in to the animation. \r\nThis is one of the rare anime that you can watch the first episode and decide ifit\u2019s for you or not, it\u2019s that simple. \\n\r\nIt has a lot of sexual innuendo between the protagonist and victor, this is one of the main reason you should watch it. It makes literally every person a little more \u201cgay\u201d, in a total positive way.\\n\r\nOne of the \u201cnicknames\u201d is on purpose: yaoi on ice, although you are left alone with your imagination. :-P\\n\r\nThe intro and ending songs are just beautiful, every episode I sing them along (or at least I try). \\n\r\nThe anime combines a lot of different animation styles, sometimes really basic \u201cstuff\u201d and then with a lot of \u201cspecialties\u201d. \\n\r\nI think you should give it a try, the first episode and then decide for yourself.",

            "content": "Warning: This anime is consider anime that everybody likes but I don't\r\nWarning: For this review I'm going to consider Russian Yuri as Yurio\r\nStory: The story is with Yuri Katsuki a professional ice skater that somehow flop at the final and meet his so-called rival Yurio as well in the journey of getting better in ice skating again with love thrown in as well with his coach Victor. That on paper sounds interesting.... However poorly executed. Why?? Let's find out\r\nCharacters: Now the main 3 characters are great. Yuri, Victor and Yurio. Those 3 got the most character development. Yurio start out as a prick but atthe end turn into a gentle, kind and just thought out person. Victor from a coach that was doubting on getting back on the ice but thanks to Yurio and Yuri that broke his records he is going to get back into ice skating. (Although felt last minute)....\\n\r\nYuri... Thank god he is the main character if not he will be boring and forgettable really. Now with all main leads aside let's look at the secondary characters in this anime and the main issue is TOO MANY CHARACTERS. Like seriously do any of us remember any of the characters??? Some characters are classified as what I would love to call them as \"characters there to be there\". some of the characters only show up for 1 or 2 episodes and we never see them ever again. Like remember the scary Russian guy?? No?? Though so.... The only\\n\r\nside character I remember is JJ. Speaking of JJ, he actually did something in episode 11 questioning why and how it happen?? JJ as been doing his best for the past 10 episodes and always reach #1 or at best #2 and in episode 11 he just fail epic. HOW?? I mean give us some reason why he mess up. I mean Yuri got into a mental breakdown once. He since fine... So what is his reason. Like give him some sort of reason to he felt the pressure. Is the same routine, same opponent, same ice. What is the reason???  \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: The art style is kinda iffy in some moment. Some look fantastic while some look like berserk 2016 or even Ajin animation bad... Stretch  that is worst. The 3D animation in this anime are worst than those two. Also, if you pause frame by frame you would see that their faces look like... To put kindly... off-model. I have to credit to MAPPA on making the ice-skating scene look like real figure skater. But other than that... Nothing stand out in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: I'm not a big fan of the opening and the ending. I just found it bland and dull. The visual are pretty and great but the lyrics were bland and just can't get into it. The OST... Some hits and some misses. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Overall some positive but a major let down at the end with \"characters there to be there characters\", Horrible 3D animation but that's not the biggest disappointment of the series are the filler performances. Performances in sport anime are great and all but what are you getting of the performances are the major key to the performances and I pray to the heavens no other sports anime will do that ever again. Also, Ice skating is such a great influences in those characters live so it should have some impact on me to try ice skating. It doesn't... In fact they make it felt boring with the same routine over and over again. Ok, you can argue that the sport is not the main focus but the love between yuri and victor but if you remove 70-80% of the filler performances it would have no effect on the relationship. Look, I have not seen ace of diamond yet but I would bet that it would make the most boring sport ever due date exicting and fun which is baseball.\\n\\n\r\nSo with the average score of 3.4 I would present yuri on ice a recommendation of a skip it. I love sport but this by far the worst sport anime I have seen due date that and battery\\n\\n\r\nOther recommendation include cheer danshi which highlight the sport with the fundamental basic and also give us great characters along the way. Next is a blind recommendation I have not try it but I bet is 100 times better than this chihayafuru.",

            "content": "Yuri On Ice was a show hyped up by many, and because of that I decided to give it a go. I'm a queer male, and enjoy seeing homosexual relationships played out well, and that was what I was looking for in Yuri On Ice. However, I was disappointed greatly by the show.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nFrom the get-go the story wasn't something I found remarkable, I'd never watched any other series, but figure skating isn't unheard of in the anime database. The whole story was incredibly predictable, beforehand you already knew what the outcome was going to be, and because of that it brought the story downfor me. There was never a point in the story that I was shocked by a decision made, as none of them were shocking, they were all predictable. The ending wasn't much better either, and in all honesty is very forgettable. It didn't give much enjoyment having made it to the end, as a lot of series do give you once you finish.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nEpisode 1 was amazing in terms of animation, the figure skating scenes shocked me with how fluent and smooth they were. They played around with different animating styles, the set-up shots of scenery were even enjoyable to look at. But this didn't last for long, it was very obvious the studio only focused on the first few episodes, as beyond episode 3 the animating dropped drastically. It is very clear that Yuri and Yurio were the main focuses of animating, and when it comes to the supporting characters they do not put as much effort into animating them. You can tell very easily the studio was in over their heads with the animating they wanted to do, and the time they had to do it. It's commendable they did manage to animate every performance, but it did come at a cost.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe sound is the one thing I cannot discredit in this anime, starting off with the amazing opening. 'History Maker' is the song used, and it was a perfect song to use. It got me hyped for the show, it really has a triumphant feel. \"We were born to make history,\" the lyrics really set the show up in the right way. The voice acting was enjoyable as well, there was never a time I heard a character and thought they had made a bad decision with it. They all fitted the characters they were playing. The OST was undeniably beautiful, the music in this anime was unreal, and something I'll praise Yuri On Ice for endlessly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe main characters (Yuri, Yurio and Victor) were all enjoyable characters, they each had their flaws that were shown and worked on. They are easily relatable characters, the situations they go through are ones many people can relate to and see themselves in. They are all extremely realistic, and are well rounded characters. Each one of the three are well developed in the show, and seeing them grow was something I did enjoy even though I'm not the biggest fan of the show. However, the one flaw I found within Yuri was his reasons for developing, more than not they were all prompted by Victor. It was a shame that this relationship had to be the cause of many changes in Yuri, and he couldn't develop on his own most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters are a completely different stories, they were so rushed and often we were introduced to a character made out to be so important and mighty. Only to never see them again; Kenjirou for an example. We were introduced to Minami Kenjirou earlier on in the series, and he was made out to be an up and coming figure skater. Only for him to be cast aside after an episode or two of being in the spotlight, it was things like this that made being introduced to the characters feel pointless. Especially when we were introduced to so many as Yuri went to different tournaments and competed against everyone. No supporting character felt completely developed and explored in the way it felt they were being set up for.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nOverall, I did not enjoy Yuri On Ice. As a queer male, it felt too much like queerbaiting for me to enjoy. The focus felt more on the homosexuality than the sport at times, which I feel it shouldn't have considering it is a sports anime and not Shounen Ai. It felt like just another series that Fujoshi's and anyone else interested in gay fanservice would like. Which is not a bad thing, it was just something that didn't appeal to me. This series could easily, and has easily, appealed to non-anime and manga fans, the homosexuality was a touch that interest many people. I would never consider rewatching Yuri On Ice, I did not hate it, but I struggled to make it through it once around. Watching it again would have no point, other than to see the characters that got discarded over the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave Yuri On Ice a 5/10, it was not horrible, I don't hate it. But it didn't have anything that I found special, which is easily a personal thing. I would recommend watching Yuri On Ice, as it can easily appeal to you. If gay fanservice and Fujobaiting is not your thing, I don't feel you'll find much enjoyment from watching this. But if it is your thing, you'll love Yuri On Ice.",

            "content": "After watching the trailer for Yuri on Ice I immediately added it to my \"plan to watch\" list. I was impressed both by the sound-design and the animation that really seemed purposeful and indicative of what would come. I also had high hopes after seeing Sayo Yamamoto's name attached to this project not only as the director but as the original creator. I'm a big fan of her work on Lupin the Third: Mine Fujiko to Iu Onna and Michiko to Hatchin and was sure that she would deliver in this show as well. Around the fifth episode, I realized that I was sorely mistaken.\r\n\tFirstof all, I'll address the one of the most important elements of the show, and probably my biggest source of disappointment: the story. The main setup for the show is that Yuuri wants to regain his confidence and find his inspiration for skating again and Victor comes in to coach him to be great. Along the way, their professional relationship blooms into a romantic one.  My main issue with the story less about the beginning and end and more about the journey in between. The pacing is awkward. The first few episodes were all set up and then around, episode five or six it loses focus entirely. Each episode consists of training montages which completely waste the opportunity to show more technical aspects of ice skating, Yuuri talking directly to the audience via internal monologue, and \u201cromantic\u201d scenes between Victor and Yuuri that are essentially the same fan service we see in every other sports anime. The side characters that are introduced don\u2019t really serve any purpose other than to fill the quota of pretty boys for the audience to ogle and to pad the episode\u2019s runtime since the plot can\u2019t support itself. \\n\\n\r\n\tAnother things that confuses me about the popularity of this show is the claim that the characters are well-written. I think people often confuse a well-written character with a character that they personally like. Typically, a well-written main character is one that undergoes some sort of change throughout the course of the story, usually by learning something new about themselves or their environment. Yuuri and Victor don\u2019t strike me as particularly well-written. Beyond their individual problems, their dynamic together is a bit problematic. I give the show kudos for attempting to make a world where same-sex relationships are destigmatized, but Victor and Yuuri\u2019s relationship seems to be more one of codependence rather than one where both people are equals. Yuuri idolizes Victor and needs someone to tell him to keep going. All of his internal monologues while he skates are about how much he wants to please Victor. After watching the same routine for the sixth or seventh time I began to wonder if Yuuri was doing any of this for himself. There is definitely a romantic spark between them but for the most part, their relationship is built on Yuuri\u2019s desire for validation and Victor\u2019s ability to fill that desire. \\n\\n\r\n\tAs previously stated, I was one of the people who was really excited about this show when the previews came out. As an animation student, the thought of seeing the beauty of figure skating translated to animation was reason enough to give this show a try. Even after the first couple episodes disappointed me story-wise, I was still excited for what the creators would do with the animation. That excitement vanished around episode four or five when I realized that the quality drop in episode two was here to stay. People are quick to dismiss the sudden drop in quality as something to be expected in animation, but I find that argument hard to defend when I'm watching about five other shows that came out this seasons that managed not only to maintain, but also, in some cases, improve their animation as the show progresses. Even if they couldn\u2019t keep the animation as good as the first episode, more care could have been taken in general cinematography. \\n\\n\r\n\tTechnically, the show fluctuates between rotoscoped 3d animation with moments of 2d animation cut in. The 3d, while obvious and a little unpolished, doesn't bother me that much as I can see why a television anime budget wouldn\u2019t allow for completely fluid 2d animation the entire time. Part of the reason I disliked the animation in this show is the overall poor use of timing. In the first episode, Victor\u2019s movements are fluid because each of his movements is given time to breathe. Each body part is moving at a different rate, prioritizing specific body parts for the sake of visual clarity. During the rest of the show, however, the characters seem to be flailing all their limbs around at the same time, making it look more like a random kicking and punching than like graceful movements leading from one to the next. The backgrounds always stay in focus while they\u2019re skating too, which makes them appear to be moving slower than they should. I could forgive the quality of the skating scenes if the non-skating scenes showed any sign of planning, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be any indication that any more care was taken in framing or animating the characters when they\u2019re off the ice than when they\u2019re on it. I watched an anime about making a dictionary that managed to be more visually interesting than this show ffs! The show doesn\u2019t take advantage of the fact that it\u2019s a visual medium to suggest more about the characters than what is said, Instead, whatever the creators want us to know about them, they just have the characters say it to each other or to the audience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n\tI wanted to like Yuri on Ice, I really did. What better way to show the beauty of figure skating than through animation. It didn't hurt that the show tried to focus on a same-sex relationship in a healthy way, something severely lacking in the anime world. But the execution is just barely mediocre. The story leaves much to be desired, the characters are bland and one dimensional and the animation, the only reason I even bothered to watch this show in the first place, vacillates between passable and clumsy. If you know you can look past this shows flaws for a bit of mindless entertainment, I would say go ahead and watch it. It\u2019s something that would be good to watch when you have nothing else and you're waiting for the next season to come out. If you\u2019re just here to fetishize a homosexual relationship (another reason I find the majority of this show\u2019s fanbase deplorable), I would say to go ahead and give it a watch as well. But even then, I would probably recommend Free!! before this show, at least it\u2019s nice to look at and entertaining in its absurdity. If you want something with emotional impact, well-written characters or a good story, keep looking.",

            "content": "You know, I'm starting to realize more and more how bullshit my policy on avoiding popular opinion of an anime before I make my own actually is. Between my desire to keep up with what's current along with my \"nerdy friends who take this hobby seriously enough to the point that they pay attention to the many in-between animators that KyoAni use\" flooding the social media sites with tributes to shows that haven't even come out yet, I'd have to seal myself in a bunker without wi-fi to avoid the impact that Yuri on Ice has had on the community. It's not as popular asRe:Zero or ERASED were in their prime, but the show benefits from more than just a little luck in regards to it taking the anime world by storm. With sakuga and anime production in general being an increasingly important part of a fan's life, LBGTQ issues being an increasingly important part of a regular human being's life, fujoshi making up more and more of the fanbase in general, and the opening flat-out stating that this show was born to make history, the only people who don't watch this show are the ones who state that it's too gay for them. I should know considering only one of my real-life anime friends actually watches this thing.\\n\\n\r\nSo what exactly is the plot of this legendary show, you may ask? Well it's pretty much just every sports show ever only with adult characters and it's not paced like Stephen Hawking trying to win the rocket-powered wheelchair race. You have a young Japanese dude named Yuri failing to make it big in the ice-skating rink and deciding to vent off frustration by getting fat and doing a routine in his free time that his Russian idol, named Victor, was famous for. However, said routine gets uploaded on the Internet thanks to Yuri's annoying friends, causing Victor - who's in a bit of a funk due to being past his prime - to spend his pre-retirement days training the Japanese youth to be the new star of the ice world. However, a snot-nosed kid who's also named Yuri (the Russian spelling) wants Victor to teach him himself, and from there on you see the two training to compete in the Grand Prix of Figure Skating as well as the thousands of yaoi fanfiction being written with every frame used to depict the journey.\\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice reminds me a lot of Damien Chazelle's films, particularly how most of the praise and acclaim comes from the actual production and directing, with the story mostly being a bunch of emotions that are handled in unexpected ways. Whiplash was a story about a student and a teacher having a mental war with each other in order to push the former to his limits, and La La Land is a story about two lovers inspiring each other to achieve their dreams whilst wondering whether they can be together whilst doing so. I'm not a fan of Chazelle's movies personally, but I know a lot of people are, and I'm pretty sure a majority of this show's audience intersects with that audience as well. You have to be into emotional storytelling to appreciate what Yuri on Ice goes for because that's really all it has beyond the gay jokes: men embracing their femininity in order to achieve dreams that can only be discovered through the rink. It doesn't actually say anything about ice-skating or LBGTQ issues beyond portraying it positively, and the characters are all either happy go-lucky or do such a good job of seeming happy go-lucky that you can't really believe they're facing serious personal issues even when they say they are.\\n\\n\r\nI will say though that even if you take into account what it's going for, the execution is kind of rough at the start and gets better over time. I understand the humor is not for me, but please explain to me the reason why characters have to be spouting exposition during the ice-skating scenes. When they're getting into the characters' heads like if Makoto Shinkai directed a sports anime, sure maybe you need to clarify some things to the audience. But why on earth do they have to describe moves that I can clearly see? For a studio as talented as MAPPA and a director as talented as Yamamoto, you'd think they'd understand the importance of letting the actual animation tell the story, but I think only the first and last ice-skating scenes of the series had people keep their mouths shut.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there are alot of performances in this show to the point that it starts to get silly. None of the characters aside from the two Yuris have any relevance to the main plot, so when the show devotes large amounts of time to their moves and arbitrary backstories, I realized that they only existed so that the animators could fill in the obligatory twelve-episode count whilst showing off at the same time. They're not bad or anything, but the only one I even remember by name is JJ, and that's only because it's a really easy name to remember. Well that's a bit of lie. He is also very memorable in regards to how the show constantly screws him over despite nothing really negative about him or his routines sticking out to the point that you'd swear that he signed some sort of devil's contract in order to make as many appearances as he did. But let's be honest, despite the show trying to give him some connection with Victor, he only exists as a convenient obstacle for Yuri and nothing else. \\n\\n\r\nThe large number of ice-skating scenes used to fill up the time brings it own annoyances as well. Animating even one of them would be a huge challenge to your average studio, and I'm pretty sure this show tried to fit in no less than twenty of them throughout the entire runtime. This leads to a lot of reused animation, noticeable choppiness, and convenient shortcuts like pulling in on the person's face at a critical moment or cutting to another character watching the routine after a few seconds, like a porno director who's clearly new at his job. And because the ice skaters only stick with one or two routines during the multiple stages of the competition because we're trying to keep some sense of realism to avoid turning into Prince of Tennis, I had to sit through Yuri doing the same Eros moves to the same music every week to the point that it felt like I was watching the same episode over and over again, only with slightly different plot details, Endless Eight-style. In a sense, maybe it's a good thing I don't care about the other characters and thus can't remember their routines after they finish them, because I'm pretty sure they got stuck with repetition syndrome too, and yet every time Yuri (that's the Japanese Yuri, not the Russian Yuri) wasn't doing the actual skating, it all felt fresh in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot-important characters, I can't really say much about them because whatever depth they have is drowned out by how much they conform to their initial stereotypes. Victor is occasionally wise, but mostly a naive gay jackass. Yuri is occasionally deep, but mostly a naive confused happy man. And the other Yuri from Russia is occasionally respectful, but mostly a shark-toothed rival who may or may not be gay. I didn't really care one way or the other whether they would succeed in their goals, since the only reason they have for doing so is because that's what they want out of life. That's not a bad reason, but when you compare it to the named extras who want to impress their loved ones or have a country's name to live up to, that's pretty damn weak. Yeah yeah, it can be argued that these characters are doing all this ice-skating in order for their gay marriage to come true, but given this show's high comedic tone in general, you could say that their goal in succeeding is to have a statue of themselves built in the center of a mountain and it'd have just as much impact.\\n\\n\r\nDisregarding the fanbase and other outside influences, my opinion of Yuri on Ice is that if you're willing to accept that anime is going to continue the legacy of Hetalia for a long time to come, like shows about male characters embracing their feminine side, aren't automatically opposed to bare-bone narratives, and enjoy staining your pants at what my female friends call \"vivid brilliance\", then I can recommend it. I don't think it's very rewatchable even by those standards, but like I said, I'm into this sort of storytelling, so you should trust me about as much as you'd trust your mother when she assures you that everything is fine despite the very sharp-looking knife in one hand and your father's dismembered head in the other.",

And, yes, I despise this anime with a passion.\r\nThe fact that this show has a higher rating than legitimate shows, and is even considered to be a good anime, physically pains me. \r\nThe plot in itself is inconsistent, weak, and unoriginal. The characters were designed as classical anime (incorrect) cliches. The animation was horrible, and the only decent part of it all, was the OST.\r\nNow, let us begin!\r\nYuuri is our protagonist that's a typical underdog character,that deals with anxiety, is obsessive over Victor, and deems himself to be depressed.\\n\r\nAs a person who deals with anxiety, I can say that we do not \"suddenly\" lose our worries when we meet that certain person. \\n\r\nJust as Yuuri suddenly became the homoerotic and confident skater he was once he met Victor, and began to get coached by him. Wrong.\\n\r\nAnxiety is not that easily overcome. It's a process, and does not immediately vanish once the correct person comes into our lives. \\n\r\nSecondly, his character isn't interesting in any way. Although he does fail here and there, he blames his anxiety for everything, and clings onto Victor far too much.\\n\r\nHe idolizes him to a point he named his dog after him.\\n\r\nHe has a double-personality, and is generally uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nVictor, the love-interest, over-confident, idol-posed and \"humorous\" character.\\n\r\nHe suddenly decides to coach Yuuri after remembering the night at the banquet when a drunk Yuuri dry humped him as he watched his routine copied by him.\\n\r\nAlso, pole-dancing with the same drunk boy. Ah, yes. How attractive.\\n\r\nVictor is played as an attempt at humour, as comes off as extremely extra, and frankly annoying. \\n\\n\r\nYurio, the tsundere ice-fairy. Heh. \\n\r\nHe's nothing but rude, obviously tsundere, a friendly rival that is a child prodigy.\\n\r\nHe's arrogant, constantly rude towards Yuuri and Victor, and honestly isn't likeable. I don't understand why so many people like him.\\n\r\nHe's way too cliche to be true.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters such as Christophe, Leo, Phichit, Minami, etc; are there as rivals and provide no plot development. Remove them, and the anime wouldn't change a bit.\\n\r\nChristophe is a character of attempted sexual comedy relief, yet fails terribly at so.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is confusing, mostly regarding Yuuri and Victor's relationship.\\n\r\nThey don't act as any couple would, with just occasional hugs, \"good luck charm\" rings, and an overall relationship that's paced far too fast. \\n\r\nPeople enjoy this anime solely on the fact that they're both males. If this was a normal romance show, it wouldn't have gotten much praise.\\n\r\nThe relationship is unconfirmed, and although they may have feelings for each other, for whatever reason, we, as the viewers, aren't given important details.\\n\r\nEverything is resolved with Yuuri's skating.\\n\r\nThe angst is cringe-worthy with the dilemma in episode 10 being fixed by Yuuri's perfect performance!!!!\\n\r\nThe ending was predictable, with an extra scene of a skating duet of Victor and Yuuri in matching outfits, with a slight rendition of Victor's theme.\\n\r\nYaaay, fangirls cry, I cringe.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is far below mediocre, with repetitive and uninteresting skating sequences. The camera shots are terrible, and the overall animation is one of the worst I've seen. Unlike Haikyuu's animation with interesting camera shots during the game, it simply pans in and out, focused on the majority of the rink, the given character's perspective (which occurs at least 3 times), and a focus on the character themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is simply a looped basic animation with some catchy song. The ending isn't good. The song OST's are enjoyable, to say the least, but are not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nWhat most ruined the show for me was the fandom. The obsession from fangirls that deemed this as the most incredible, and perspective-changing anime.\\n\r\n\"Wow, the first anime that allows the main couple to be gay that isn't yaoi!\"\\n\r\nMe, an intellectual, pointing at the No.6 manga/anime.\\n\r\nAnd the fact that anyone who disagreed with them was deemed as a terrible person.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, in conclusion, I despise this show, heh.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nArt: 2/10\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Skating rinks have always captivated me as a kid. Its misty aura has that alluring effect that makes one want to glide through the vicinity of the area, feeling that faint chilly breeze that swipes through your exposed skin. Figurative skating has always been a mysterious yet fascinating thing to me, especially males who compete in it. I\u2019ve always perceived it as feminine, but there lies within a beauty of making the ice your dance floor that goes beyond sexuality. \r\nYuri on Ice has come to be one of the spotlight shows of the season, for both good and bad reasons. First, it has apromising story of Yuri\u2019s tale of skating his way towards the Grand Prix with his coach Victor. While he faces a lot of problems like getting very nervous to the point that he messes up his routine, he manages to barely come through. He is a very believable character in terms of expressing anxiety and pressure, and seeing him gain confidence as the show progress is a satisfying one. The other rivals he encounters in matches are in the same realistic level as him as well, they have enough character as to be not forgotten as just a stepping stone for the main character. While the cast of figure skaters involved are big enough to the point that they don\u2019t get fleshed out, they are interesting enough as they display their nature in their performances in matches. A lot of monologues is present which aids the viewer in understanding the emotional condition of the character. The downside on this aspect is that they don\u2019t interact enough. Figure skating is a solo sport and unlike team sports, you can\u2019t easily develop characters through teamwork. Sure, having rivalries is a good way to connect characters, like in the case of the two Yuris, but it would have been better if the story attempted to connect them in other ways.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the over-arching plot, which is the Grand Prix, it\u2019s enjoyable to see Yuri rise his way to the finals like a breeze but I feel like it could\u2019ve slowed down a bit. Perhaps add a bit more subplots or side stories in-between which explores the cast and the nature of the sport they are involved in, but there is the issue of how much you can show within the limit of twelve episodes. The second-half may seem rushed as each event is getting overlapped by the episode without giving it time to settle down, but even with that it\u2019s a good way of gaining momentum story-wise.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue I\u2019d like to point out is Victor and Yuri\u2019s relationship. As I\u2019m aware that a lot of viewers of the show like shipping them and other characters, I feel like the scriptwriters succumbed and added a lot of gay undertones. There were just a lot, to the point that it\u2019s distracting. Is their relationship a purely platonic one, or is there something more? I personally think that their chemistry is good but there were just a lot of implications that makes me unsure of the current standpoint of their relationship. I understand that Yuri looks up to Victor as his idol and Victor in turn looks up to Yuri as a person with potential which is perfectly fine and evident in the story. However, the show attempts to make them something more than that which leaves the audience\u2019s imagination running wild. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Yuri on Ice is a very stylish sports anime. It\u2019s not as intense as most sports anime but it\u2019s more detailed, delicate, and even emotional. Many would probably watch it for its homoerotic tendencies but the show offers more than that. It clearly presents what figure skating tries to offer, and emulates its atmosphere well. The story has its shortcomings especially the ending, but nevertheless it\u2019s a refreshing one. It brings something new, a breath of fresh air, perhaps enough to motivate you to skate to the nearest rink in the area. Who knows, but give it a try.\\n",

It allows for a few twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat, but doesn't really make you think too much. A very light and easy story line.\r\nArt: 9\r\nStudio Mappa did an absolutely wonderful job animating YOI. The animation is smooth and choreography brilliant. I would give it a 10 out of 10, but there are some moments when the quality drops during less important skating performances.\r\nSound: 10\r\nAhh the soundtrack. The wonderful, beautiful soundtrack. Thisshow is filled to the brim with wonderful, memorable OST. The opening, \"History Maker\" is wonderful and as is the ending. The YOI soundtrack is one of the few anime soundtracks that I would go out of my way to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe main characters are wonderful. They're unique and lively. The show really focuses on them and allows them to develop in marvelous ways. There is a fairly large supporting cast for such a short show. The show does its best to give each character some attention. Of course, with the supporting cast, there is some much needed character depth and development, but the focus on the main characters more than makes up for it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nYOI was such a fun show. There was never a dull moment. The animation coupled with soundtrack made every scene exciting. I'm really not a sports anime fan. I've never been interested in any kind of sport, but watching YOI made me feel like I was watching and enjoying ACTUAL figure skating. It's the first show I've ever watched that made my friends and I actually GET TOGETHER multiple times to have a party about every new episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nNow, there's one part of the show that I haven't touched up on. Yes, it's gay. It is so freaking gay. Yes, I love that it's gay. But the reason I ignored that fact during the rest of my review is because the show doesn't even acknowledge that. There's no \"coming out\" drama. What I loved about the show wasn't that it was two hot guys in love. It was two PEOPLE who were falling for each other. \\n\\n\r\nYOI is a wonderful anime. Yes, it has its flaws. But the show makes up for it in stellar characters, stunning animation and a nearly perfect soundtrack. My advice: watch it.",

            "content": "Yuri!!! on Ice is not amazing unless you're a 14 year old yaoi fangirl. Or if you're Canadian. \r\nIt's a fun comedy mixed with sports anime made for women by women and there's no need to think it's anything more because it isn't. \r\nStory? What story? Yuri Katsuki's anxiety problems and homoerotic relationship with Victor? Because that's all you're getting. The plot progresses with the figure skating competition which sadly gets boring when the same formula for showing the skating and characters is had. It also doesn't help when there's only 12 episodes to flesh out such a huge cast of characters. \r\nThe character designis vast and diverse and the better aspects of the show thanks to Kubo Mitsurou's beautiful artwork but the animation tends to be stiff and the skating scenes which should be the most eye opening and exciting are boring and even embarrassing. You have to give them credit for never backing out and fully animating everything though. All the budget seemed to be wasted on the first episode so that left the rest of the show to be horribly looking and repetitive skating scenes where the only redeeming thing is the music. In the later episodes many backgrounds are unfinished but the scenery is nonetheless beautiful and the attention to detail on particular tourist spots is worthy of praise. \\n\\n\r\nNext to the character design the other good thing about this show was the music, from the catchy OP to the unique songs used by each skater in their programs. It has everything and you'll find yourself wanting to listen to them again, even JJ's narcissistic theme song. \\n\\n\r\nNow here's something not so good: the characters. The cast is huge and underdeveloped because the anime only has 12 episodes, which left even the main three to be cheap fanservice. The main two characters are Yuri Katsuki, a Japanese skater and his coach Victor Nikiforov who just so happen to also be the main couple of the series. The other main character, if you could call him that, is the rival and the Russian Yuri. Do these characters ever change and develop beyond what they are from the beginning? No, instead they sell what they are, a homoerotic love triangle made for fujoshi. Victor especially is grating since he seems to just be a bishounen character with no development or personality whatsoever beyond being perfect and beautiful. Some characters are unique and memorable like the Swiss skater and Miyano Mamoru's character JJ but they only serve as being jokes and space for the competition. The few female characters that appear are very good and what you'll find in any decent josei anime, since this is what Yuri!!! on Ice essentially is. It is refreshing to see a sports anime dealing with adults instead of high school kids for once and the overall cast is very fun and entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is cheap and boring, it's all fanservice for the lowest consumer, like the equivalent of panty shots and accidental boob groping in an ecchi anime. Just watch the first episode and decide for yourself if a beautiful Russian man appearing naked with a full shot of his ass is fanservice or not. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the worst part comes from how popular it has gotten and people praising it for having a gay couple. To me it's nothing different that what you will find in a common BL anime. It's not groundbreaking when they are constantly taking back whatever progress in their relationship is made; instead of outright stating \"WE'RE GAY\" it's ambiguous to the end in the most unsatisfying way that only fujobait can be. It is also not the first \"mainstream\" anime to have a gay relationship especially when it was obviously made for fujoshi. In a way Yuri!!! on Ice tries to balance itself between being completely yaoi for the otaku that will support it and waste money on it and the other mainstream audience that watched it for the skating, and for that it's obvious they held back even though they're supposed to be an established couple.  For a show that deals with finding love and doing your best we see none of that when the main character can never hold the end of his deal in neither his skating career or his relationship with Victor. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a fun show to watch if you need a laugh but nobody should pretend it's anything more or that it's groundbreaking. It's not that deep.",

            "content": "Yuri on Ice is a character-driven show that has amazing main and side characters that comes very close to achieving greatness, but decides to ultimately sacrifice this chance to tease a second season which, at the time of writing this review, has not been announced.  Regardless of this, Yuri on Ice still manages to reach great heights through fantastic characters and an amazing OST despite several pacing issues.  \r\nThe story is pretty plain and simple.  Yuri Katsuki wants to win the big ice skating competition, but he must first win smaller competitions.  He has to overcome low self-confidence, nerve-wracking anxiety, andrival skaters alike if he wants to reach his goal.  Luckily, he has the world-famous ice skater Victor Nikiforov to teach him, and loving friends and family to cheer him on his way.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is nothing new, but this is not the average sports anime with similar concepts.  Yuri is not a rookie, but instead an experienced skater that has come upon tough times.  All of the main characters are very mature for anime, with ages ranging from 19-27, and the characters act accordingly.  The one exception is Yuri's rookie rival, Yuri Plisetsky.  Plisetsky is an extremely talented 15 year old skater who is much more similar to the average sports anime protagonist, but he is designated to a mere support role in this show. \\n\\n\r\nWhile most sports shows relegate themselves to a more shonen routine, where the main characters start out at the bottom and work their way up through training arcs, hot-blooded rivalries, and huge character revelations, Yuri on Ice takes a more realistic, mature approach.  Yuri starts out as a very talented ice skater with a lot of experience.  He still improves his skills throughout the story, but they are all small improvements.  He ends the series as being only slightly more technically skilled than he was at the start.  The majority of development comes from dealing with mental hurdles that keep the skaters from performing their best or successfully communicating their emotions to the audience.  The lack of training arcs means that the show can spend more time in competitions.  Unfortunately, this is where Yuri on Ice makes a large mistake.\\n\\n\r\nThe constant pace of the competitions suffocates the show.  Every episode after the first three and another near the end are filled with skating performances.  This is unfortunate, because there is little time left over to properly explore the characters.  Side characters do not get much screen time.  They are often left with only short appearances outside of the rink after getting decent backstories during their routines.  There is, however, something to be said with how well established these characters become after just a couple of routines.  Almost every character has a distinct personality, a story behind their career, and a lot of room for growth of their own, but these well-crafted characters cannot be properly used if they don't have much time to bounce off of each other.  \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the development that Yuri and Viktor experience cannot be properly appreciated if they do not have enough time to talk or interact.  They still experience a good amount of development, but this is because any time not spent on performances is usually spent on the new personal conflict of the competition.  No attempt is made to bring the tension down and simply have the viewer enjoy the characters for who they are and how far they've come.  A few minutes every here and there for Yuri and Victor to talk with each other and the competitors without conflict would have done great things for the show's pacing and story as a whole.  This is evident in the sole episode of reprieve late in the show which did wonders for the characterization of both the main and side characters.  When the show is allowed to breathe, the characters truly shine. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the suffocation of the constant competitions is not just felt in the characters and dialogue.  The art and animation for many of the performances in the middle of the show are poor and unpolished.  This is understandable, since many of the episodes have several 3-4 minute long performances each, but it is just further evidence that a slower pacing was needed.  Outside of the rink, the art is fantastic.  The characters look great and there are some gorgeous backgrounds throughout the show.   The art and animation can be very impressive when it needs to be, though it is never quite as good as it is in the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nThough the performances lead to a noticeable decline in quality for the show in almost every way, the one aspect left untouched is the music of the show.  Every track of the show is very well done.  None of it feels too similar, and it does a great job of enhancing the mood of the scenes.  Even more surprising is that every single song used for the performances is utterly brilliant.  Of course, some shine more than others, but they are all an immense joy to listen to both inside and outside of the show.  A lot of care was clearly put into the pieces to ensure that they all supported the characters in performance and characterization.  So much is said through the music alone.  The OST is easily the best part of the show and can be enjoyed even without context from the show.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the show has many flaws, it still manages to pave a good story arc throughout the series that seems to be leading to a satisfying conclusion.  Unfortunately, in the last few episodes of the show, the story makes a clear shift from crafting a satisfying narrative to preparing for a second season.  To be perfectly clear, this show did not need a second season.  All of the characters were clearly reaching the end of their respective character arcs.  However, the last few episodes throw in odd decisions that run contradictory to the established characters and narrative.  This does not drop so low as to create melodramatic drama, but it does keep the character arcs from reaching a satisfying resolution.  \\n\\n\r\nNow to tackle the elephant in the room.  There is, in fact, a reason why Yuri on Ice is often jokingly called \u201cYaoi on Ice\u201d.  Two of the main characters (both men) pretty clearly have a growing, romantic relationship between each other.  This is not coming solely from the eyes of crazed fujoshi.  The relationship is fairly noticeable, but it is largely respectful.  While other shows would make unnecessary jokes and snide remarks about them both being guys, this anime does not devolve to that level.  It is treated as a perfectly normal relationship.  Unfortunately, the show is not entirely upfront with the relationship (no entirely direct exclamations of love or displays of affection), so it does not entirely avoid the trappings of such shows even though more affection is shown than usual fujoshi bait shows.  Additionally, there is a small amount of male nudity in the show.  If that bothers you, this show definitely is not for you.  However, if you are willing to look past such scenes, enjoyment of these aspects is not necessary for enjoying the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a great show with amazing characters and music.  The animation occasionally falters, but it is good when it counts, and the story would have been good if it had proper pacing and made strides to reach a satisfying resolution in the end.  Despite the flaws, it is a very enjoyable ride that is uniquely mature and respectful.  Hints were made to a second season, but there is not much more room for the characters to grow by the end.  This makes the ending of the show slightly less unsatisfying, but it does not bode well for any future installments.  Truthfully, the show does not entirely deserve such a high rating on content alone.  However, it can speak very intimately to the viewer if enough relatability is found with the main characters.  In the end, anyone who enjoys mature, character-driven stories should at least give the show a chance.",

            "content": "What does it take to revive a man who has suffered utter defeat?\r\nIs it a desire for redemption, or maybe support from their loved ones?\r\nMaybe in the end, all it takes is a few scenes of fanservice and yaoi baiting.\r\nI am clearly not the target audience for Yuri!!! on Ice but even so, it managed to pull me in and keep me hooked on what ultimately was an average underdog story that was uplifted by superb looking animation and a great soundtrack.\r\nOur story starts off with our main Yuri, Yuri Katsuki, suffering a crushing defeat at important figure skating competition. It is during this competitionthat we are introduced to our rival character aswell, this rival also happens to be named Yuri, Yuri Plisetsky, and he gives our protagonist the smack talk of a lifetime.\\n\r\nFast forward a few months and our now fat and complacent Yuri Katsuki is visited by his lifetime idol and figure skating legend Victor Nikiforov who wants to become Yuri's coach and train him in the art of figure skating in hopes of finally winning a gold medal.\\n\\n\r\nThe setup seems promising enough and the first half of the show focuses entirely on the way Japanese Yuri grows as a competitive figure skater (and shrinks in weight) with the help of Russian Yuri's presence as the rival character and Victor's everloving guidance. And when I say loving I don't mean the friend kind of love.\\n\\n\r\nThe first six episodes of the show are, in my opinion, not as entertaining as the latter six. This is mainly because personally I could not care less about Japanese Yuri. He is extremely mellow and lukewarm as a character and really does not grow until very late into the series. The show could not have picked a worse main character out of it's quite colorful cast of figure skating competitors, in fact, the episodes that have Yuri Plisetsky, and his direct interactions with Victor and Japanese Yuri are some of the most entertaining. I feel like they left Japanese Yuri as average as possible so that the viewers could more easily project themselves onto him and live the yaoi-bait life of their dreams, but if you're not interested in that then his character just falls flat. Though as I've mentioned before he does somewhat grow into a different kind of lukewarm towards the end of the series but he still retains most of the characteristics that make him a boring human being.\\n\\n\r\nRussian Yuri on the other hand is probably the most entertaining character in the show due to his somewhat over-the-top nature with his constant bursts of anger and violent reactions to basically anything happening to him. Which is what makes it even better when his skating style is calm and effeminate. He is a rival character through and through however and has a rather tsundere personality when faced with our main duo. The show tries to focus on him as much as it focuses on Victor and Katsuki Yuri, which has had the result of me rooting way more for him than for Japanese Yuri. Towards the end however we only really get glimpses of him rather than full-on focus which is to be expected I suppose, since the Yuri in Yuri!!! on Ice is Katsuki Yuri.\\n\\n\r\nRounding off our main trio is Victor Nikiforov who goes from being a legend-like figure at the beginning of the show to kind of, sort of, not really being Japanese Yuri's lover. The show, probably in a bid to keep as much of it's audience as possible, never goes full out on the yaoi and keeps it only on a baiting level. You can take that as either positive or negative depending if you're into that sort of thing. For me however, Victor's character was quite predictable. He has an overly carefree personality and constantly does what he wants. He is not quite as shallow as Japanese Yuri, but I can't help but shake the feeling that the only real reason he exists is because we needed an older male character to serve as Yuri's top.\\n\\n\r\nAs a sports anime Yuri!!! on Ice does several things well, while it falls flat on others. As I've mentione above Victor becomes Katsuki Yuri's coach but seldom do we see any real training scenes outside of the time when they did weight-loss exercises and we're just supposed to believe that Yuri is getting better with Victor's help. I think this aspect of the show could have been fleshed out a bit more with two cours but as it stands the show's pacing is extremely fast, going through an entire tournament in around six episodes. The fast pacing did manage to keep the more boring non ice skating scenes shorter and I'm thankful for that. You see, I wasn't there to see a relationship unfold between two boring characters, I was there because I wanted to see great animation accompanied by great music. And that is what Yuri!!! on Ice does best. As a sports anime it manages to portray competitive figure skating well enough that even someone who has never seen it, like me, can get it and through skillful animation and beutiful music manages to capture you for almost episode long ice skating scenes.\\n\\n\r\nStudio MAPPA has done a great job animating the entire anime and the animation stays more-or-less consistent even during figure skating scenes which are filled with movement. Aside from a few times the skaters seemingly teleported when the camera cut to a different angle I really did not notice much wrong with the animation here. The animation was a pleasure to watch and it was what kept me wanting more.\\n\r\nYou can't figure skate without music however and we get plenty of that. From orchestral arangements to pop-rock and folk we get a great variety in the music the skaters use. For the most part it complements the anime well and I didn't find myself disliking any particular song. I should also talk about theOP which was one of the few OPs that I watched at the beginning of every episode. It has a very memorable song but also some great and fluid animation done in a graffiti style, and it felt like something you would see as the opening song of a major sport event.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed Yuri!!! on Ice way more than I thought I would. I went into it expecting a lot of fanservice and not much else, but to my surprise it managed to supports it's average story with great animation and music coupled with some of the usual sports anime vibes to make it something that could be enjoyed even if you're not a fan of its particular brand of fanservice.\\n\r\nI'd recommend Yuri!!! on Ice if you want some eye-candy or if you want to see a more unconventional love story with the caveat that the anime is extremely shy about it. Or maybe you just want to see some man butt. If you're looking for any of this then Yuri!!! On Ice is sure to deliver on at least a decent level.",

            "content": "Let\u2019s get the recommendations out of the way first, because I feel like that might be the most useful thing in a review and I don\u2019t want people to search around for it: \r\n-\tI would highly recommend this anime to any art lovers. Anyone who likes good animation is bound to be impressed by the beautiful routines and fantastic choice of music that accompany this anime. \r\n-\tSport lovers might not necessarily gain the kind of kick out of this show as from most sports anime, and that\u2019s mostly because of the nature of the sport itself. Figure Skating is not the blood-pumping, adrenaline-rushing show thatmost other Sports anime are, not because the anime doesn't focus on the sport itself (it does, and portrays the sport rather well), but because Figure Skating is more like dancing on ice. So, unless you like those kinds of shows, I would not recommend this anime for the action junkies. \\n\\n\r\n-\tOther people who might like it are adults looking for a mildly compelling story with not too much drama and decent character development.\\n\\n\r\n-\tAnd of course, I would highly recommend this anime to all the shippers and romantic individuals out there who are just looking to see a well-developed love story.\\n\\n\r\nMy honest recommendation would be not to binge watch this anime, but rather take it in strides, otherwise the plethora of routines might end up wearing some people off, and it is a shame, because each of the routines are fantastic and memorable and they deserve to be enjoyed at a relaxed pace.\\n\\n\r\nWith recommendations out of the way let\u2019s start the actual review.\\n\\n\r\n1.\tTechnical side \u2013 8.4/10.\\n\\n\r\na)\tAnimation \u2013 10/10. I know the routines get repetitive (especially Yuuri\u2019s Eros, which is a pity, because it\u2019s a fantastic routine), but what the animation team does in the span of an episode, and the high quality of most of the routines as well as the consistency of facial expressions is enough to make me forgive any minor inconveniences or slack in animation at less than pivotal scenes. Plus, I was truly blown away by the fact that they could keep the trend up consistently for so many episodes back-to-back. So even though I don\u2019t think the animation is perfect, I think the effort and love for the show shines though, and, because of it, the routines are a wonder to behold every episode.\\n\\n\r\nb)\tSoundtrack \u2013 10/10. I love most of the songs used for all the routines, and even the songs that are not particularly flattering, manage to become captivating because of the beautiful animation on screen. Most of the background songs are nice, and there never was a song that I felt was too distracting or out of place, so this is an easy 10.\\n\\n\r\nc)\tOpening/Ending \u2013 8/10. I think History Maker has the most consistent and fluid animation in the whole show and is one of the most amazing opening sequences I have ever seen (the animators deserve every praise thrown at them, because it is masterfully done). I am not however that fond of the song itself. It has it\u2019s moments of levity, but it did not manage to stay memorable for long, and I found myself skipping it some of the times.  The ending however had a song I truly enjoyed and only skipped once while rewatching some episodes. However, the images used during the ending are static and generic. \\n\\n\r\nd)\tStory \u2013 7/10. I was hoping it would stay at an 8 or rise up to a 9, but it managed to stumble on episode 8 for me, and it never quite picked back up until the final episode, which kept its grade from falling lower. \\n\\n\r\nThe stumble was fake drama. I am not a fan of making fake conflict just to have conflict in your story and then not delivering on it (those who have already seen the anime will know of what scene in episode 8 I am talking about). That scene was particularly vexing because in my opinion, there were very few episodes of this anime I truly loved. \\n\\n\r\nAs of right now only episodes 3 and 12 are the ones that left a genuine and lasting impression on me. The rest of the show was okay to good, with only two horrible episodes that I struggled with. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 4 was incredibly dull for me, even if it was good character development, but that episode dragged like I could not believe. And the upper mentioned development for 8 not only ruined what I, up until those last few minutes, consider to be an episode on part with 3, but it plummeted it to the list of episodes I would never want to rewatch ever. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s the reason why I have a disdain for episode 8, because, for me, 7 was okay. I know that was the one that had the fandome exploding, but nothing had come close to episode 3 for me, but 8 almost did. And 8 almost surpassed it because of the amazing synergy and fluidity of everything else in that episode except for that 1 final damn scene\u2026 which ruined episode 9 as well. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why fake drama is the worse for me, because it has the potential to truly throw me off a show, and most shows barely recover in time to remain good (a 7 grade for me), let alone great (an 8 grade for me). \\n\\n\r\ne)\tCharacters \u2013 7/10. That grade was majorly influenced by the ending, because I thought the show was going in 1 direction, due to the opening narration and Yuuri\u2019s internal monologues throughout the series, and while I did not hate the fact that it changed direction in episode 12, I was not okay with how that left the characters (mainly our main trio). \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t love Victor, like most of the fandome does, I mostly consider him an okay character, but I truly feel like he is the only one out of the trio that has room for development considering the events of the final episode, so ironically, his is the character I have the most hope out of them for any future seasons. \\n\\n\r\nYuri (or Yurio) is the breakout character for me. He\u2019s the brat I was not fond of in episode 1, and the adorable kitten I came to love and admire by the end of the season. The only problem with him is\u2026 I see no possible interesting future development from him. He feels fleshed out and complete, so much so that I don\u2019t think they can bring his character to any further heights than this in any subsequent season. But for this season alone, he is outstanding.  \\n\\n\r\nThe break out side character for me was JJ, because I am biased towards Mamoru Miano, and his eccentric characters, and because he had an impressive development for a character who was introduced halfway throughout the season (and he has plenty of promise for any subsequent season). \\n\\n\r\nYuuri is the character that actually ended up lowering the grade for this show, because, he started off as an amazing MC, who unfortunately got sidelined by the figure skating and plethora of other characters that the second half tried to cram into 6 episodes, that by the end of it\u2026 I only cared about him because of the shipping. \\n\\n\r\nThis is of course not his fault, but rather the fault of the show being so short and so ambitious in its scope (it has way too many side characters). \\n\\n\r\nOnce the competitions started, even though he managed to hold on to the title of MC\u2026 he failed to leave as much of an impression as some of the other characters in the second half, and the ending of the show is the thing that kind of stabs him in the back, because he narrates one thing in episode 1, and then ends up in a completely different spot by the end of 12. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t feel satisfied with the way the show just kind of screwed him over like that, mostly because I feel like there was no conclusion for his character which we were promised all the way back in episode 1. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t hate the direction they are going with his character, but I do feel cheated. \\n\\n\r\n2.\tEnjoyment \u2013 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this sow very much because of the overly enthusiastic fandome which made ridiculous, amusing, amazing and bizarre theories about the show every episode. \\n\\n\r\nOther very enjoyable aspects were the ship, which is one of the most touching and well developed romances I have ever seen in Anime or TV/Movies, and the amazing animation and soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending made me feel cheated, mostly because of Yuuri and the lack of conclusion to his arc. But, at the same time I am excited for the possibilities that such an ending may bring for future seasons. \\n\\n\r\nOverall impression \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMy overall impression of a show depends on the Technical score and the Enjoyment I got out of it, which would be about an 8.2, so an 8. It was a great anime. \\n\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun being part of the community and following the show week by week, and for a short period of time, there was something smack in the middle of the week to make the time pass at a less then sluggish pace, which I appreciate. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this review, and have a great day!",

            "content": "Yuri!!! on Ice is the most popular anime of the season by a mile. It received endorsements from competitive figure skaters, it's not afraid to \r\ndisplay a gay relationship, and it's surprisingly engaging.\r\nYuri!!! on Ice is for all intents and purposes, a take it or leave it type of show. There is no shock factor, the show does not have any significant twist, \r\nand if you have not watched a sports anime before you more than likely do not know what you are getting yourself into.\r\nIt takes all the classic tropes of sports anime. An underdog who has potential but a fair amount of hangups is pulled out of that by some extraneous forces to reach his full potential. Yes, it is cliche. Yes, we have seen it done before by countless sports anime ( with varying levels of success). What is awesome about Yuri!!! on Ice is there is more to the series than those elements. \\n\\n\r\nI was consistently surprised by the emotional depth that this show was able to achieve, what felt like, episode after episode. The character writing is superb. The expediency and effectiveness of character buildup and the subsequent payoff was pretty much leaps and bounds above anything that I have seen all year.Characters are so well established and so  effortlessly, I get lost in the episode and forget that I am watching an anime. When critics\\n\r\nuse the phrase \"show don't tell\", this is what they mean. Everything has a greater degree of significance because you feel like you are \\n\r\nviewing it from said characters own unique perspective; and not your own.\\n\\n\r\nThe hallmark of a good sports anime is that it makes you care about said sport. The portrayal of the passion for figure skating and the motivations\\n\r\nfor each and every character was clear and concrete. Love Yuri!!! on Ice or hate it the characterization is masterful. The feelings portrayed are never\\n\r\nexpounded, they are felt, on a somewhat visceral level.\\n\\n\r\nI loved pretty much everything about Yuri!!! on Ice. The characters are easy to empathize with, the  show is well directed, it always will maintain your\\n\r\nattention without devolving into cliche territory. It is great. However, the show is not without fault.\\n\\n\r\nThe minor qualms I had were two fold. The first being the limited run time. Twelve episodes for a series of this caliber is criminal. Due to the characterization being so detailed and the overall plot being more vast then the runtime Yuri!!! on Ice feels incredibly dense. The audience is constantly bombarded with new characters, new plot points, new character development. That's great and I personally feel like it is one of the shows \\n\r\nstrengths,  it is also incredibly alienating if you are not head-over-heels about Yuri!!! on Ice past episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nMy next small qualm, is the rival character Yurio Plisetsky . He felt... out of place. Most of these characters are just average in terms of personality, I don't mean that as a criticism, but besides their one/two defining personality traits they act like completely well adjusted people(which is somewhat uncommon in anime). Yuri  on the other hand is a cliche. His only personality trait is that he is hotheaded and aggressive. Yuri had some pretty neat moments in episode 3, but in the full context of this show his character does not work.\\n\\n\r\nYuri!!! on Ice is not reinventing the wheel. The plot points are borrowed from sports anime that have come before it. Where Yuri!!! on Ice differentiates itself is great direction, pacing, and a fresh take on the same tired plot points that this show is inspired from. Yuri!!! on Ice is on the precipice of being groundbreaking and you should not let it pass\\n\r\nyou by. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

OUTSTANDING levels of pure boringness that it will put even the hardest insomniac to sleep in minutes! No joke. No clickbait. This is the only cure guaranteed to work!\r\nI am also proud to announce and welcome Yuri on Ice to my dropped list. Why waste my time with this shit when I could be watching good anime? Or okayish anime. Or really any other anime that's not Yuri on Ice. \r\nStory: 1/10\r\nThere's more character progression in Your Lie inApril than this crap. Yuri is supposedly a good skater who's in a slump. Or so we're told. Then along comes his gay lover and suddenly everything's perfect. Talk about no substance for a story. It's basically YLIA with ice skating and gayish lovers who don't die.\\n\r\nYou'll get tons of lengthy performances by poorly introduced characters that you neither know or care about. Exactly like seen in YLIA. It gets so old, you'll yawn and go to sleep.\\n\r\n(And in case you want to know my reputation for falling asleep during anime, I watched every single Naruto filler without dying of boredom. This, though, this is boring.)\\n\r\nAnd no, I'm not a fujioshi or a yaoi fan by any means, but if I were, this anime would have disappointed me. Is it gay? It's gay. But is it gay, gay? Who knows. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nIt's average. Nothing extraordinary. It's a 2016 anime so that sort of art is expected. I'm meh about it, but it's alright.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThis was the only part I enjoyed. The opening. In fact that was the ONLY part of the entire anime that I wasn't snoring through or tempted to skip. The opening is very catchy and also nostalgic memories for me. I could listen to it for hours. Also the character voices were great too. I watched in the dub, and for one reason only. Victor was voiced by Jerry Jewel,  the same voice actor who voiced Russia from Hetalia. And THAT I gotta hear. It was like gay Russia and I was 10/10 all in for laughing at that. But even that got old and I went back to snoozeworld. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nThey all sucked. Dick. Because they were gay.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nLike I said, it sucked. It all sucked. Besides that op and Jerry Jewell.\\n\r\nAnd making fun of Yuri for being a pathetic gay loser. That was fun.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\r\nPathetic. 100% pathetic. I dropped it because there was no way, no matter the ending, that this anime could be anything but a boring, crappily made snoozefest. No ending could convince me otherwise at the point of failure Yuri on Ice reached. And to the fujioshies who fangirl for this shit, I think ya'll can do better. -_-\\n\\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice? More like my snoring face on ice.\\n\r\nThe end.",

The story was lame and mostly boring with almost only tha championship in it. Not really a lot of other things happened, we hardly get to know the characters. Victor's and Yuri's realationship isn't really touching, there's no chemistry at all. They are two men, a coach and a skater, who are deep friends.

I only watched it to the end because of Yurio, who is the only normal character here. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was horrible! It's wasn't beautiful, it was mostly awful, but there were few times when it was okay. The music was good too. \\n\\n\r\nSo I have to say, as a yaoi-fan, I am disappointed in this anime.

During the series, Yuri starts to fall in love with Victor and they get together.\r\nSounds boring, doesn't it? Well it is.\r\nMy issues with Yuri on Ice:\r\n1. Its a sportsanime. Sports anime are kind of like sports games, boring as shit and they don't yield a lot of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n 2. It was way too sippy sappy. I know this might sound odd as I have enjoyed watching Fairy Tail, but this one crossed the line with how overly sweet it was.\\n\\n\r\n 3. It's so fucking overrated. The fact how overrated this anime is makes one factor why it is so garbage. I do understand though, it was kinda made for girls and gay men (nothing against gay men relationships btw). I did not enjoy it and honestly I would not recommend it either.\\n\\n\r\n4. Sexual scenes. I'm sorry, but I'm not the type of guy who want's to see men acting like that.

            "content": "After falling into great defeat in the Grand prix finale, Yuuri Katsuki, whom was Japan\u2019s figure skating representative, decides to return home to determine where his future lies. His opportunity for success in skating was looking dim as many obstacles were stopping him from returning to the world of skating.\r\nHowever, after being posted a viral video of him skating to a program that Viktor Nickiforov performed, this reaches to Viktor himself, leading him to the decision of being Yuri\u2019s coach and bring him back into the world stage again. But the competitiveness thickens as Yuri Plisetsky, a rising star, craves for the defeat of YuriKatsuki to prove himself of Viktor, earning back his mentorship. \\n\\n\r\nAt this extent, Anime was screaming for an all-male cast anime to handle their theme with subtlety and wasn\u2019t forgettable as hell, which is quite common among these animes, but finally Yuri on ice came and broke the dubiety that we long had for these sport animes. Moreover, YOI comprehends its theme like no other and executes that with lucidity.  I believe that they\u2019re other aspects of the show that boasted its popularity but its simplicity particularly is what made it relaxing to watch, it really screamed for diversity of its target demography as its plot undergoes basic elements tolerant to all kinds of viewers.\\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice may have a generic plot, but understands what to do with its mediocrity.  The value of the anime shouldn\u2019t be diminished for its choice of plot because it was clear what deliberate approach YOI was taking initially. Generally, Yuri on Ice has kept me exceptionally entertained till its very end and its plot was the last thing that stopped me from enjoying this show.  \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Yuri and Viktor was the foreground of the show. It just danced along so beautifully with the plot because it never felt overly exaggerated with its BL nature in contrast to shows like junjou romantica where they express highly stereotypical gay couples. No anime really attempted to convey the genuine personality of a gay couple without feeling the need to embellish it for the purpose of pandering. The relationship felt natural and was never enforced, it does make sense that both tutor and tutee grew affectionate for each other if they intended to get to know each other personally behind the competition itself, regardless of gender in which the anime never took into consideration. The show convinced itself that there were no needs to create two characters of opposite genders just to play the romantic segments of the show based on its media perception, and quite frankly, I like that. The show felt modern and the relationship of Yuri and Viktor massively contributed to that aura.  At this extent YOI has the most healthiest and pragmatic portrayal of a gay couple in an anime ever; there really isn\u2019t any competition. \\n\\n\r\nThe YOI soundtrack and music is absolutely remarkable because of how suspenseful and congruous it was with its concept.  As one stated, YOI from an international perspective done amazingly because of the variety in the music, all from many categories of music genres and sung in different languages to really define the show\u2019s diversity. The opening is ridiculously memorable and lasting. At first the opening captivates you and really takes on the characteristics of what it means for an anime to be sports. The opening is dazzled in tension as the orchestra raging from the background condenses, becoming more powerful and striking. The full song shows even more of that and just gives you the chills. The desire of wanting to listen to the opening is really consistent as I haven\u2019t skipped the opening a single bit, hence its endurance. The reason why I rated YOI a nine on the musical aspects however is due to the unfairness of the songs used for the skating sequences. The songs for the secondary characters weren\u2019t nearly as powerful and compelling in tempo and dynamics as Yuri\u2019s performances were, if anything they were quite forgettable, making most of the episodes boring to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly couldn\u2019t of thought of any other art style for YOI because the one used in the show was just downright perfection. The characters and the art style just went, completely reconcilable.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I have complimented the choice of plot beforehand and the path YOI chose to take, I can\u2019t say much more for the plot itself as it\u2019s embedded with flaws, particularly with its premise. The premise was a complete mess as it immediately starts off with info-dumping supported by lazily done chibi designs of the characters to express comedy, which was anything but humorous since it\u2019s an overdone way of exhibiting comedy.  Resuming to my words beforehand, the premise explains its sports through info-dumping, and if anything, only told me that they\u2019ve create a poor exposition rather than the sports itself. The whole basis of storytelling is to show rather than tell the story to its audience and by explaining the core constituent of the show to us rather than expressing the sports to us progressively throughout the anime really suggests the producers\u2019 inability to create a story. To summarise, the premise was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the majority of the characters initiated in the first episode have little to no actual significance to the plot and only serve for comical values despite being given a shortage of screen time and presenting nonsensical humour that the younger audience of the show may most likely enjoy. Some of the characters didn\u2019t necessarily needed introduction such as the brunette fan girl and were added just to make better of our protagonist despite many other characters playing that role. Yuri on ice should have most definitely cut down on the amount of characters it had because it deduced screen time for other stuff that came more crucial.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was just lacklustre since there was barely anything to develop for the characters to begin with, especially our main protagonists. Yuri was just too inconsistent. Yuri was only ever presented as the shy type for the first episode then 1-2 episodes later, he was a sudden confident badass on stage with no justification whatsoever; an episode later, he\u2019s timid again. Yuri\u2019s anxiety wasn\u2019t a genuine issue at all, Yuri\u2019s anxiety was a complete plot device as it is extremely repetitive and is solely used at times where the plot couldn\u2019t develop itself neither the relationship between Viktor and himself.  Overall, he just happened to be full of confidence ever since Viktor was his coach just because. He was practically told by Viktor to act provocative when doing his Eros performance and he just happened to succeed. Yuuri feels incredibly melodramatic as a character that other parts of his characteristics serve for the sake of cheap feels. When Yuri would convey his meek behaviour, the plot would always find a way to take full advantage of that and victimise Yuri because he\u2019s not nearly as \u201cgood\u201d as the other skaters, but this is only as a way to promote Yuri and make his mad skating skills of a surprise in spite of always having them in the early stages. \\n\\n\r\nContrastingly, Viktor\u2019s character was too consistent, the audience were never introduced another side of Viktor to develop at all as his flirtatious, cheeky behaviour was the only characteristics on display. I honestly wished they had been more in-depth with Viktor\u2019s love life when he was \u201ctalking\u201d about it for awhile in episode 10, we\u2019ve of gained something at least from Viktor because to me, Viktor is an shallow character who puts on an act of persistently being seductive, handsome and complete perfection but there\u2019s nothing contradicting to that to convey. Viktor\u2019s character isn\u2019t much left to be desired as an actual skater since he was a hardly explained character as a competitor, or better yet, how he invested into the world of skating that clarifies his prominence. As a reviewer stated, the setting itself takes place because Viktor was not entertaining as his status of a competitor since his abilities are way beyond every else to begin with. As the way the story is, I was in desperation of figuring out Viktor as soon as I knew most of the distinguished characters in the show were aspired from Viktor, making him the genesis of this show, so it would only make sense to know where the origins of the show stemmed from. Generally, we\u2019ve only seen the surface of what Viktor could be and his shallowness pretty much qualifies enough to be an entire flaw of its own. \\n\\n\r\n  Yurio was the only person who developed from the show because we saw how he conducted himself from the start of the show to the end; even the show was contrasting it from time to time, particularly highlighting how he modified his style in skating depending on his behaviour. Initially Yurio had an incredibly rude, aggressive nature but gradually, he became of elegance and beauty and that was heavily embodied in his skating sequences, making us more emotionally invested in Yurio\u2019s character.  \\n\\n\r\nNot only did the characters barely undergo development, but they were extremely stereotypical as there was barely anything distinctive about any of them, not a single unique trait. Yuri being the shy character in every single sports anime that doubts themselves just to make it seems like they won\u2019t win even though they always, Viktor being the handsome and famous that comes off hard to get despite picking the protagonist out of everyone they met ever, Yurio being the grumpy rival just because, Chris being the fan service, oh lord, I could go on. What makes this an issue is the fact that I\u2019m having a hard time figuring why did Viktor choose Yuri particularly, to which the anime never gets profoundly of. There\u2019s absolutely nothing distinguishable of Yuri that the producers emphasizes so why the choice of Yuri over everyone else that makes him worth choosing?\\n\\n\r\nAs maturely presented the shounen-ai is, it is to question as the relationship of Viktor and Yuri doesn\u2019t really come crucial to the sports, therefore the plot itself. What were they trying to demonstrate by expressing the relationship of Viktor and Yuri? Furthermore, I\u2019ve had trouble with which degree the relationship stands as it was never really fully fledged. Yuri on ice has only been showing hesitation with openly embracing the complete gayness of the relationship as it could never assure itself of the absolute desire both Viktor and Yuri had for each other. One minute, Viktor and Yuri are publicizing their relationship, another censoring their sentiment, hiding it and are ambivalent of each other. Each episode just didn\u2019t compliment and support each other and there were constant shifts regarding their relationship. The choice of this gives off a range of ideas of why the producers done this. Did they do such to lure in the audience till the end by using cheap tactics such as fetishising and not making the relationship canonical or does the relationship have a foundation that supports the vital existence of the passion Viktor and Yuri have for each other?\\n\\n\r\nWith a huge audience that doesn\u2019t actually do figure skating, I including, it was hard to feel engagement with the competition as the technical aspects of it were hard to grasp the feeling of. As one reviewer stated, which was a ridiculously good point, Yuri on ice doesn\u2019t clarify the complexity of some of the techniques and why some were treated with more astonishment than the other. Why and how is a quadruple loop technically difficult than a quadruple salchow? Why does placing your hands high in the air while doing triple techniques score you high scores despite the skill being easy independently? For a show that wants to emotionally connect to its viewers through the sports, it should be aching for profundity with the execution and how well explained their sport is, but clearly YOI wasn\u2019t looking for that. \\n\\n\r\nJust a quick note and minor flaw, the pacing of the show felt rapid, everything was happening in the blink of an eye that it was hard to tell how many weeks or months it\u2019s been between each episode or so. With only twelve episode to maintain with, everything was very time abusing and Yuri on ice just needed more episodes to space itself out. I can honestly understand why the producers would choose to end the show in Christmas week as Yuri on ice is excessively Christmas spirited and belongs to the winter season.\\n\\n\r\nThe real question is after all this though: What is the objective that Yuri on ice have always had in mind? What were they striving to achieve at the end of the series? You may think that the goal would automatically be there since the anime has a really basic concept and say that it\u2019s to win the Grand prix final, but after what happened at the last few minutes on episode 12 (I don\u2019t want to spoil) can we really say that\u2019s the objective? Now that they\u2019ve reach the Grand Prix final and the results were revealed and stuff, what is awaiting for this show now? Does the whole thing restart again just like that? The issue is the fact that I can\u2019t see where this show is going and where its future lies.\\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice deserves the publicity it got, but not how it\u2019s perceived, especially with those calling Yuri on ice a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d because it\u2019s most definitely afar from that. From a critical perspective, they\u2019re major flaws implanted in this series that stopped this show from embracing its potential it had, but to say that this show suffered from them? Now that\u2019s something else. Yuri on Ice was always conscious of the mistakes they\u2019ve already made but weren\u2019t bothered by them since being critically acclaimed was the least of their priorities, I\u2019d recommend watching this show with high expectations concerning its entertainment values rather than its critical values. It\u2019s stupid to go into this show with deliberate hate or high standards because it\u2019s laughably damn obvious that you\u2019ll receive not nearly half of that.\\n\\n\r\nGive this show a goddamn break\\n\\n\r\nFor a show that circulates around ice skating homos, constant fangirling, marriage and a guy that screeches \u201cI\u2019m gonna come!\u201d you\u2019d really expect a really well written piece of work? From this? As for my opinion, I\u2019m neutral with this show as entertainment-wise, it\u2019s just outright fantastic but that, alas, doesn\u2019t excuse the show from a critical stance, a lot having to do with why they chose this and that, etc. as Yuri on ice lacks basic clarification for what it does. I will definitely be looking forward to the second season as I will be sticking around for it but generally, Yuri on Ice will forever be a Christmas one hit wonder and the second season will never be as popular as the first because nothing will be like the first but itself.\\n\\n\r\nPositive:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tSimplicity\\n\r\n\u2022\tExecution of Viktor and Yuri\u2019s relationship\\n\r\n\u2022\tDecent generic plot\\n\r\n\u2022\tGreat and appropriate usage of music\\n\r\n\u2022\tRidiculously suitable art style\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tIrrelevant characters\\n\r\n\u2022\tPoor character development\\n\r\n\u2022\tReason for/Limited shounen-ai elements \\n\r\n\u2022\tStereotypical characters \\n\r\n\u2022\tViktor\\n\r\n\u2022\tMelodramatic/Victimizing\\n\r\n\u2022\tCheap and lacking in comedy\\n\r\n\u2022\tDisengagement in the competition\\n\r\n\u2022\tUnclear objective\\n\r\n\u2022\tPoor premise\\n\r\n\u2022\tInstability in pacing\\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice = 6/10\\n\\n\\n",

Anime is basically the perfect medium through which to put ones hobbies onto the screen.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, \"Yuri!!! on Ice\" doesn't really understand this. This is billed as an anime about skating. It is not. This is a mediocre romance anime that happens to have skating in it. And that's where it goes wrong. \\n\\n\r\nBear with me on this one.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the animation. While solid during most scenes, it dove tails into absolute shit during the scenes where people are actually skating...\\n\\n\r\nWhich is the part where there should obviously be the best animation. Since this show is about skating. Obviously.\\n\\n\r\nThe skating itself is often repetitive, and boring - and lacks any of the creativity and beauty of actual figure skating. This is coming from someone who only watches it during the Olympics.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what I was talking about earlier.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no passion for skating in this anime about skating. It's just used as a vehicle for driving Yuri and Victor together. There's no knowledge about skating in here that would require more than a few hours reading up on skating to know about. No little tidbits that let me know that the writers really fucking love skating. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a show written by people who don't give a crap about main element of the story - or who aren't able to translate that passion into the story, anyway. \\n\\n\r\nThe skating takes place - and the characters explain what the dances mean. Yuri's first major skating event tells the story of his career. His later ones are about his love for Victor.\\n\\n\r\nThat's how the characters explain it, anyway. To me it just looked like a bunch of random movements.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is why the passion for skating was sorely missed from this production. Because I have no idea what I'm watching.\\n\\n\r\nIn what way does Yuri's dance show his love for Victor? Which parts of his dance express those specific emotions? Can you explain it to me? While watching this anime, did you gain any understanding of how the characters were actually expressing their emotion? Because all I saw was a dance occurring, and people explaining what emotion it expressed. It was never presented in a way that allowed me to glean that emotion myself. \\n\\n\r\nThis mentality of telling instead of showing extends itself to the rest of the anime. Victor falls in love with Yuri. Why? Because he saw his dancing. Yuri loves Victor. Why? Because he looks up to him, and believes in him. Or something.\\n\\n\r\nDo you see what I'm getting at? The romance is so... one dimensional. The characters just lay out there reasoning, and then continue from there. There's no true, meaningful interaction between their personalities that explains to me why these characters love each other.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about Victor's personality does Yuri find attractive? What about Yuri's personality does Victor find attractive?\\n\\n\r\nIn a good romance, it should be easy to explain this. At least to some extent. Yuri!!! on Ice, however, just wanted the romance to occur, without coming up with any reasons for it. The drama is dumb, the relationship dull. The only thing interesting about the romance is that they're both guys, but that isn't enough to carry the story to a 10/10, y'know?\\n\\n\r\nVery disappointing anime. 4/10, though if I were rating this in comparison to what the first two episodes made me hope for, I would give it a lot less. \\n\\n\r\nI will admit I like the opening theme, however.",

            "content": "Yuri on Ice is one of those anime that I saved for a rainy day with nothing to do. The premise didn't seem too interesting, but to be fair I've never been one for sports anime. Although I'd been aware of it, I'd never really gotten around to watching it until a friend of mine heavily suggested that I do. TL/DR, I was not impressed.\r\nHowever, I will say I was happy with the first 1-3 episodes. Great music, fairly well introduced mc, good intro, decent character interactions, and a well established setting made the first few episodes an overall pleasant experience. If I were torate those episodes separately from the rest of the show I'd probably give it a solid 7/10. Unfortunately there was the rest of the show to consider, and I'll go through this step by step.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music:\\n\r\nThis is probably the most redeeming feature of the series. Each character and set of skating had its own music to go along with it, and often the music would fit quite well.  The issue, however, was that it was repeated far too often (although this really couldn't have been avoided considering the subject). After listening to a song often enough and watching the same skating routine over and over, anything would stale. Overall would rate a solid 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series, the art was really great. The characters were drawn realistically, the frames flowed nicely, and there was rarely a drop in quality. Unfortunately this didn't last, as is fairly obvious in the later parts of the show. The animation became jumpy, and the faces and movements of the characters became progressively worse. The animation had a great start, but at the end brought me to a point of wanting to skip most of the ice skating scenes. Art started good but really suffered as the show went on, 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is where the bone really starts to grind. Out of all of the many characters introduced in Yuri on Ice, there were only two or three that I would consider 'good' characters. Yuri is well developed throughout the story, Victor has many flaws as a character but is overall a charming addition, and maybe Yurio though he lost almost all relevancy throughout the middle of the show. Every other character in the show does not even come close to being something I would consider decent. Each of them are given introductions and backstory during their performances, and that serves as the only development for their character. These characters were so disgustingly developed that I found myself wanting their scenes to end just a little bit quicker. Their only redeeming feature is that each of them is 'quirky' or 'relatable', but that isn't nearly enough to make up for their lack of character. I would not rate the characters in the show higher than a 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nComedy:\\n\r\nTwitter jokes aren't funny, 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe realest and greatest issue that the show had was with its story. The introduction and 'get yuri back in shape' section was pretty good all things considered, but once it hit the tournament arc, shit hit the fridge. It was at this point where the show was struggling over whether it should be a sports anime, or a slightly forced romance anime. I forget which episode this started on, but most of the episodes of the tournament ended up like this: \"Yuri and co go to new place to skate -> light forced romantic tension between Yuri and Victor -> Yuri and other skaters skate to the same music from last episode while monologuing -> more forced romantic tension -> Yuri becomes a little less of a bitch-> event result, show next area\", repeat for 8 episodes. Every episode introduced uninteresting and forgettable characters that added nothing to the show other than a few skating scenes. The rival character, Yurio, was pretty much forgotten besides being thrown in every so often to react to Yuri's achievements. The issue with the story is primarily the fault of the subject matter and how the tournaments are laid out with repeating performances. All in all it was like I was watching the same disappointing episode 7-8 times with different unimportant characters sprinkled in. Even after considering the first few episodes, I wouldn't be able to rate this higher than a 3/10 story.\\n\\n\r\nRomance:\\n\r\nForced, but honestly far from the worst I've seen before, 5.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, I'd say Yuri on Ice is decent in its own right. Far from a great show, but decent. The show on the grand scale of things is incredibly overrated and far from anime of the year, but has some redeeming features worth considering.  I'd say watch it and get your own opinion, but stay wary of hype. Overall 4/10.",

            "content": "I kept hearing about Yuri On Ice everywhere, and as a gay guy I was very interested to see how a canon gay couple would be represented in a sports anime.\r\nI find it very disheartening that some people quickly dismiss the show as fanservice/queerbait because the creators respect the audience enough to not spoon-feed them every bit of information about the main couple. There's tons of suggestive dialogue (Episode 6 is full of it) and minor details (pushed together beds, subtle PDA, the jewellery story receipt) to figure out what's going on. Keep in mind that the 12 episodes cover about a year of Yuuri'slife, so a lot of things are left out but still hinted at. I understand that not having everything shown and explicitly stated on-screen might be unsatisfying for some viewers, but I actually love that way of storytelling. You just have to pay a little bit of attention, and you'll find that it's not necessary for the characters to go \"We're GAY and we're DATING\" in order to solidify their relationship. It's all pretty in-your-face as it is. The creator herself chuckled about the Western audiences asking for a confirmation of what went down at the end of Episode 7, while the Japanese viewers didn't seem to need it.\\n\\n\r\nI initially expected the skating aspect of Yuri On Ice to be kind of mundane and boring, but boy was I wrong! It turned out be extremely engaging (without the contrived drama that so many shows are notorious for) and kept me at the edge of my seat during the routines. Some scenes even made me sob uncontrollably, which is not something that I do often while watching anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this is also gorgeous. I've been listening to the main musical themes (Agape, Eros, and Yuri On Ice) non-stop, but there are also some earworms like Shaaaaall Weeee Skaaaaaaateeeee or Still Alive. All in all, The soundtrack is worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nThe only cons of this anime are that it was too short (24 episodes would've given the creators more time to explore certain things they had to cut) and that the animation took quite a nose-dive during the second half of the season. It feels like studio MAPPA bit off more than they could chew with all the elaborate skating routines, so scenes that didn't involve the main characters suffered as a result. There is some REALLY derpy and stiff-looking stuff in the later episodes, although the first 5 or 6 look fantastic. That said, I'm positive it will be fixed for the Bluray release cause there is a one-month gap between every volume, which seems like enough time to make the necessary adjustments.\\n\\n\r\nI took off a point for the uneven animation from the overall score, but it's still one of the best anime series I've seen in years!\\n\r\nNow we wait for season 2.",

For people who think this is a Yaoi and are turned off thinking it will show BL need to grow up, because it can't even be classified as shounen ai. Yeah it totally suggests it but this anime is much more than that and ultimately focuses on the sport of figure skating.\r\nAll the characters are likable and the musicfor the show is very nice to listen to.

            "content": "A beautiful story of overcoming!\r\n~ Contains spoiler ~\r\nYuri has a dream, this, is to become a great professional skater. This profession requires a lot of feeling, because it is something artistic. Yuri has a great love of skating, so much so, that he inscribes himself in a competition, but loses and stays in last place. This discourages you, of course. We always seek to do what we think is best for each of us, but when we even fail to do so, we feel completely desolate. I think this is the best definition. Soon, Yuri, desolate, loses the hopes of realizing his dream. He thinksthat this was the culmination of his career, which he hardly knew, was about to begin. The moral of this story is always persisting in their dreams, however difficult they may be, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. This light can be someone, or several people, who are always by your side, giving you full support.\\n\r\nAfter his failure, he goes to a rink, where he usually trains and there, finds his friend, to whom he shows a presentation of himself, a choreography of his favorite skater, Viktor Nikiforov. While he skates, he lavishes subtlety. His movements are all very sweet and subtle. While he skates, it is possible to feel all that he is also feeling; His sadness for having failed and also, the love for the choreography of his favorite artist, copying all the movements, he finalizes with grace the choreography.\\n\r\nBy chance, there were three children, who were also known to Yuri, who recorded their presentation and posted on the Internet, soon viralizing the video. And yes, this is real and can happen. The biggest and best way for an unrecognized artist to be known, is through the Internet. And what he did not expect, was that his video came to Victor Nikiforov. (Wow, this is a dream and what a dream). Yuri, remains incredulous about this, but happy. Especially when Viktor tells him that he has the pretense of being his coach. His hope that was over, at last, has returned! However, Viktor has unfinished business with another young man, this, Yuri Plisetsky. The smaller, more talented skater.\\n\r\nHe hoped that Victor would also do a show for him. And thinking of both, Viktor creates a choreography for both of them. There is a misunderstanding among the Yuri's, out of sheer jealous jealousy. But both, have the same interest, become a great skater!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 About the soundtrack: If there's something I love about Yuri !!! On Ice, it's the soundtrack. If I could define in a single word, it would be \"magnificent\". The songs, for the most part, are very engaging. It is to shiver anyone! And it has the opening, that could not be better! The letter talks about dreams, and we can realize them. Clearly the anime! Pure love! The video is also very subtle, the characters skating together, with bright colors and expressive.\\n\r\nEach character (there are many), has a unique presentation, with a song I theme different. The songs make beauty in each personality, exploring their personality, which are also very unique. And at first, when Victor decides to train both Yuri's, he makes each one choose one of the songs, and of course, purposely alternates in a way that makes the characters show a side that nobody knows. And in the end, incredible as it may sound, the songs identify the character very well. Yuri skims over \"eros\" a love, a charm, a romance. It's beautiful to watch!\\n\r\nAnd Plisetsky, about the sound of agape. Each song has a different story. It is lovely to watch the characters training, in order to learn to enter the character, like the art of theater. And that, has a great representation, because there are characters who skim to the sound of songs that participate in stories and famous fables. And your intention is simple, grace, purity, splendor, pain, love! All for art.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Art of anime: Overall, I found the art very simple. I must say, I waited a little longer, since it was an anime about such a simple subject. The skating scenes were magnificent, but somewhat bumpy. Sometimes the characters got huge body limbs, it was kind of weird. But this, only in scenes of longitude, because when I focused on the characters, the art was beautiful! The character traits are completely wonderful and the landscapes are also very well crafted. Overall, I enjoyed it, even with that little problem, which to me, does not matter much. Since it did not affect anything, in the anime. Something I just love is when the characters blush! Oh my God, this is the most beautiful reaction they have! The tip of their noses turn reddish, since they stay in the cold. Duh, but when they blush, the tip of the nose comes in contrast to the cheeks, it's so beautiful and enthralling! <3 in addition to reflect the innocence of the characters, I love so beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nFinishing here, the anime is beautiful and fun. It has a very good and pleasant comic content, has amiable characters and with completely different personality from each other. (Which makes it better when you watch), because each character has a dream, but executes it in a different way ... So when they skate against each other, we can feel the Win the final prize. This part of combat between the characters is very good, because we see characters always wanting to amaze the public, changing the choreography, or doing something eccentric! Something that kept me way above expectations always, and when they fell, I was so sad for them! But most of the time, they reimpose themselves in a \"wooow\" way doing three times better! The anime also has a great diversity of characters, because there are characters from several different countries, with several different ideologies. This is cool too! Apart from the costumes they usually wear, simply sensational.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I want to make clear is that, I was moved during the entire anime. And that's not a lie ... It's so beautiful, especially when Yuri wants them to believe he can do it! The least we ask, put your faith in us ... And he just shines when he's on the rink. So much so that Viktor gets emotional ... When they both run to hug each other ... Man, I cried a lot! The most beautiful anime scene, in my opinion. I was so happy, I did not know what words to express myself at this moment. I just know that I love the relationship they have with each other! Pure love.\\n\\n\r\nPhrase to you, if you have a dream!\\n\\n\r\n\"Love yourself a lot, really, learn to be more humble, and when you think of giving up what you want most, know that when we want something, the universe conspires in favor, as long as you truly believe.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnime 9/10\\n\\n\r\nStay with Viktor's voice in mind, speaking \"Aa-ma-zing\" <3",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nOn a hot summer day like today, almost nothing beats a cold, refreshing drink.\r\nI have ice to thank for this coldness. Tiny cubes of solidified water turn down the temperature of my Coca-Cola and turn up the smile on my face. Of course, ice does a lot more than cool down my beverages. It preserves other items. It creates entire continents. It heals wounds.\r\nI don\u2019t always think about it, but ice does a lot out there. Ice also happens to give figure skaters the \u201cstage\u201d where they wear \u201carmor\u201d and cross \u201cblades\u201d on their wayto gold medals and more.\\n\\n\r\nYuri!!! on ICE has a lot of skating and, perhaps obviously, a lot of ice.\\n\\n\r\nBut there\u2019s no gold in sight.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nYuri!!! on ICE begins on both sides of the emotional spectrum. Victor Nikiforov has just won the Grand Prix Final gold medal, cementing his legacy as the best to ever play the sport. Yuri Katsuki, in contrast, suffers a tremendous defeat, crying in a bathroom stall as he thinks maybe he\u2019s not cut out for the rink. However, when Victor arrives at Yuri\u2019s hometown several months later, proclaiming to be his new coach, Yuri gains a newfound passion to tackle the ice once more.\\n\\n\r\nWhen looking at the anime as a whole, it sadly ends up in quite the common category: a strong start that ultimately gives way to a crumbling, wobbly jaunt that leads to a poor finish.\\n\\n\r\nThe first three episodes kick off the narrative with a lot of power. They establish where Yuri is (in a mental rut) and where he needs to get to (winning the Grand Prix Final). They create an interesting dynamic between Yuri and Victor. They introduce the sport of ice skating and what it entails. Standard stuff, but these steps are important in providing the show\u2019s direction for the rest of the season.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, these episodes are not without their own problems. Yuri recaps unnecessary information about himself or the events thus far. And the tone shifts between super-silly comedy and ultra-serious drama. In hindsight, these issues may hint at the anime\u2019s eventual dwindling, but the show does more than enough all around during this time to forgive it of slight issues.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes four and five, though, begin Yuri!!! on ICE\u2019s wavering strength.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode four features Yuri struggling to form his free skate routine. To get him on the right track, Yuri remembers some music he had made for him in the past. But the anime awkwardly handles this plot point when it\u2019s given as a random aside. How he met a girl (whose face is never shown) who wrote a piece for him to skate to, but it was too subpar to use.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Yuri gets in touch with her to have her remake the piece, and this new piece from her becomes his main music. And that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no weight to it. No emotion. No importance. Especially when Yuri names the music literally after the title of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode five has Yuri competing in a regional competition. While there, a young skater named Kenjirou expresses how much he looks up to Yuri in much the same way that Yuri looks up to Victor. A nice throughput. If only the anime capitalized on the idea, for, after this episode, Kenjirou has no influence or impact on the narrative. Save for him cheering Yuri on while at Yuri\u2019s parents\u2019 place.\\n\\n\r\nThese shaky narrative moments already highlight the anime\u2019s weakness on a writing level. From episode six onwards, however, Yuri!!! on ICE melts apart.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime spends two episodes on the Cup of China, two on the Rostelecom Cup, and three on the Grand Prix Final. In doing so, a new problem pops up: pacing. The anime transitions from the Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu Championship right into the Cup of China. Which then jumps straight into the Rostelecom Cup. When then goes right for the Grand Prix Final. The anime glosses over the other competitions, moving the plot along weeks or months at a time to showcase the specific events that Yuri competes in.\\n\\n\r\nIn turn, this problem raises another by default: no downtime. In this string of episodes, only episode ten tries to provide more of the grounded, non-ice-skating events. Otherwise, Yuri!!! on ICE focuses solely on the skating. Yes, watching them skate is the point, but, without highlighting Yuri, Victor, and the other\u2019s interpersonal relationships off the ice, the anime loses out on a lot of important build up.\\n\\n\r\nRemember how that tenth episode was perhaps different from the others? Well, it has a glaring problem as well: exposition. Victor spends the first six or so minutes reexplaining to the audience the people involved, the events so far, and what\u2019s to come. On a writing level, providing information in expository format that the audience already knows \u2013 especially over three-quarters of the way into the season \u2013 is a big no-no. It\u2019s not only pointless to do so, but also it steals time away from focusing on those interpersonal moments.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that the anime puts all its focus on the performances, yet another new problem now emerges: the content itself. Individual ice skating is a very singular sport. There\u2019s no teamwork. There\u2019s no direct, simultaneous competition. There\u2019s no special rules or unique circumstances. What this structure means is that the sport is heavily reliant on what the characters say and do because there\u2019s almost nothing else to focus on.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it does its best to vary the approaches of the different performances, Yuri!!! on ICE chooses to go with even more exposition. And that\u2019s tough to accept. A major part to ice skating is how the skaters tell a story with their elegant movements and precise jumps. Instead, Yuri and the other characters continually spout the same thoughts about themselves or others, spelling out their feelings in the moment and refusing to let their programs speak for themselves. Almost as if the anime itself doesn\u2019t trust them enough to do the \u201ctalking.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThroughout almost every episode, the anime makes one of its biggest blunders: an unwillingness to fully commit. It\u2019s beyond obvious how Victor has romantic feelings for Yuri and vice versa. At least, it appears that way because the anime will not declare with certainty that these two are lovers.\\n\\n\r\nVictor embraces Yuri as he goes in for a \u201ckiss,\u201d but the two just fall to the ice instead. Yuri\u2019s program theme is \u201clove,\u201d and he skates to woo Victor, but his love isn\u2019t \u201clove\u201d but really an \u201cabstract feeling.\u201d The two have what can only be described as a wedding proposal, but the rings are only \u201cgood-luck charms.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nHaving a major part of the anime be this \u201cromantic love\u201d between Victor and Yuri, only for the show to constantly deny it the whole way through, is disingenuous to the narrative at best and ridiculous at worst.\\n\\n\r\nSimultaneously, the anime has a horrible tendency to use the same flashbacks without remorse as the characters think about or within their situations. It follows the same problem as the exposition in that the anime cannot stop itself from bringing up past talking points that either no longer need attention or can already be surmised through context clues.\\n\\n\r\nNot even the ending nails its landing. Despite what the narrative established in the beginning, the anime does not give the audience the satisfaction of Yuri earning gold. Even worse, it doesn\u2019t stick with its foreshadowing around this season being Yuri\u2019s last. Altogether, it creates an ending that doesn\u2019t provide an elated or poignant emotional sendoff, opting instead for this wishy-washy, everybody-wins finale.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Yuri!!! on ICE\u2019s story simply lacks overall execution. It may have begun in a strong spot, but, when the judges finish tallying up their points, it\u2019s only sad tears in the kiss and cry.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nYuri!!! on ICE\u2019s art and animation are a heated topic given the nature of the work and the noticeable hiccups as it proceeds.\\n\\n\r\nBefore anything else, the anime deserves props for tackling the finesse and the subtleties tied to an ice skater\u2019s dances. Spins, axels, Salchows. Swinging arms and coordinated feet placements. To be completely fair, the animation is never incredible let alone perfect. But there\u2019s enough variety and attention to detail in the performances to demonstrate their prowess.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also likes to showcase detailed moments involving the characters. More specifically, Victor\u2019s risqu\u00e9 actions with Yuri were almost always given extra attention. Getting up in Yuri\u2019s face, putting lip balm on his lips, pulling him halfway out of the sauna (while both buck naked). These scenes made super sure to highlight their features with extra detail. All to ramp up the sexual tension between the two men.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the anime\u2019s animation and art does well early on. Yuri scrambling around literally in midair or a quaint shot of a couple of cherry-blossom trees prove that quality was high near the beginning of the season.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, though, Yuri!!! on ICE makes questionable choices.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the anime has a penchant for reusing a huge chunk of its animated sequences. Arguably, it\u2019s inevitable that this repetition will occur because Yuri and the other skaters perform the same short and free programs over and over. Which would be a fair excuse if the anime tried harder to diversify its shot composition, angles, and orientation. Instead, rather than spicing up these performances, the show continually uses the exact same shots, frame for frame, an inexcusable number of times.\\n\\n\r\nThe same problem occurs outside of the performances, too. For example, during training, Yuri and other characters may fall over when failing at a jump, and, miraculously, they each tumble in identical fashion. Or how Minako holds up the same banner with Yuri\u2019s name on it in episode four in precisely the same way as she did in episode one (just with her in different clothes).\\n\\n\r\nThe worst, most obvious example is the audience in the stands at the tournaments. In episode seven alone, Yuri!!! on ICE reuses the exact same pan-over-the-audience clip several times over. Sometimes, it\u2019ll just mirror the shot to give the illusion that it changed, and other times it won\u2019t even have the audience moving at all.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets worse. Some of the shots only change the flags the audience holds. The show will then have a Canada fan running across the bleachers, to then showcasing off-putting mouth and clap movements as they try to sing along to JJ\u2019s routine. Not to mention how, in episode eight, the announcer literally says of Yuri that \u201cthe crowd\u2019s giving him a standing ovation,\u201d yet they are all sitting down in their seats.\\n\\n\r\nEven the opening track\u2019s visuals succumb to the same issue. In what should be one of the easier segments to include variation, Yuri and Yurio and Victor skate the same moves twice over with only on-screen colors changing. To its credit, it\u2019s well done on an animated level, being one of the most fluid sections in the entire show. But that nagging repetition prevails.\\n\\n\r\nThese problems would be a bit more tolerable if the anime didn\u2019t constantly mess up artistically. It has a tough time maintaining proportions. Very little in the way of animation off the ice occurs once it all gets funneled into the performances. Improper lip synchronization when characters speak. Even blatant background errors creep their way in, like how in episode six the rink seemingly phase shifts in the middle of Yuri\u2019s short program.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the positives, the anime does do a lot with its character designs. For instance, Victor\u2019s short, silver hair and striking blue eyes capture his masculine beauty. In contrast, Yuri looks a bit doofy with his cropped black hair and glasses, but, once on the ice, he slicks his hair back, ditches the glasses, and dons Victor\u2019s old attire, combining to make him less out-of-luck and more hunk.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters get attention, too. Yurio gets an androgynous appearance. Yakov and Lilia have chiseled features that match their Russian personas. Giacometti, Phichit, and Otabek receive cultural outfits while skating and geographic influences overall.\\n\\n\r\nDoes the strong start and the nice character designs make up for the numerous visual problems? It\u2019s hard to say. The workarounds and the missing frames and the blatant errors cannot be ignored. But neither can the immense difficulty that comes with animating all these performances.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nBesides the music, arguably Yuri!!! on ICE\u2019s greatest strength comes from a few of the characters the story focuses on. Namely, Yurio, Victor, and Yuri himself.\\n\\n\r\nYuri starts off in a rather rough spot. He loses horribly in the Grand Prix Final, he breaks down in a bathroom stall, and he lets himself go after suffering further defeats. When he gets back to his hometown, he\u2019s happy to be around his family, but his mental state is as low as it can possibly go. He has zero confidence in himself, and he\u2019s unsure of what exactly he can or even should do from here on out.\\n\\n\r\nYuri is in a prime position to grow as a character, and, as if on cue, Victor arrives, declaring his role as coach for Yuri and surprising the depressed man. He had always looked up to Victor as an idol, as a person worth striving to be. Going so far as to replicate his performances and own a similar breed of dog (which he named Victor no less).\\n\\n\r\nVictor, in contrast, is known by everyone in the skating world. He has dominated the sport for years now, and nobody can match his skills whatsoever. It\u2019s what makes his break from skating more surprising than the fact that he has chosen to coach Yuri.\\n\\n\r\nVictor forgets his promises, and he doesn\u2019t seem to understand just how much better he is than Yuri and the others. But that doesn\u2019t prevent him from stepping up when needed. He trains Yuri back into shape, cutting his belly fat right out. He encourages Yuri, explaining his reasons for helping. He befriends him like any good coach would.\\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, Victor gets Yuri out of his comfort zone. Rather than letting Yuri perform a short program that suits him, he forces him to tackle a theme that he\u2019s not very used to: eros.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cEros\u201d is essentially sexual love. The steamy, provocative, and hot form of love. Thus, Victor designs choreography around this idea. All to have Yuri express himself in a manner that both challenges him and pushes him to maintain the confidence he never seems to have.\\n\\n\r\nThis theme on love plays a huge part in Yuri\u2019s life. Early on, he equates love to his favorite food, but he soon directs his feelings towards Victor instead. He thinks about those who have loved him so far, like his parents and Minako, as he contemplates what to do for his free skate. He shows love for Kenjirou, a junior and mega-fan of his, by yelling out words of support for the impressionable teenager.\\n\\n\r\nThe basis for Yuri\u2019s love also morphs along the way. Especially so during his performances. At first, it\u2019s singular and only for Victor. Then it\u2019s for the whole audience to enjoy. Then it\u2019s selfish to prove that Victor belongs only next to him. Then it\u2019s undoubting as he does everything he can to win.\\n\\n\r\nThough it is Yuri\u2019s free skate that represents what his love means the most: a love for himself. Again, Yuri never truly had the self-esteem needed to skate at his utmost best. So, it makes sense that his free skate focuses on him loving himself. For confidence and loving one\u2019s self go hand in hand. His performance personifies him, his skating, and the life he has led \u2013 a life filled with nothing but love.\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, Yuri\u2019s arc takes on two forms. The first three episodes develop him as a person, and the remainder of the season explores what love is and means to him. It\u2019s an interesting format that, overall, has the audience see Yuri change for the better.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout Yuri\u2019s journey, Victor stands beside him (outside the rink). He\u2019s never coached before, but he\u2019s the best in the business, and he understands Yuri\u2019s predicament. He doesn\u2019t always get it right, like saying the wrong words at the wrong time or paying too much attention to the crowd before Yuri\u2019s performance. But he has the commitment. The care. The charisma. Sure, he trains Yuri and gives him the material means to take the ice with pride. But it\u2019s these traits, his own love for Yuri, that allow his pupil to blossom.\\n\\n\r\nWhen stepping back and looking more closely at Victor\u2019s character, though, it\u2019s not as pretty. A lot of his motivations for helping Yuri are oddly handled. He talks about how Yuri skates as if his \u201cbody is creating music,\u201d inspiring Victor rather than attracting him. However, at the end of episode ten, the anime seems to imply that Victor does, indeed, fall for him. The episode after that then goes a different direction entirely when Victor (through monologue) talks about how he felt as if he had to \u201cfind new strength\u201d all by himself. Then the episode after that makes his return more about rivalry and getting back what\u2019s his instead of anything from above.\\n\\n\r\nCobbling together his motivations stems from the fact that the anime doesn\u2019t explore his character enough. He coaches Yuri, and he occasionally has words about Yuri\u2019s current mindset. But a lot of his skating career before helping is ignored. And because so much of the season is focused on the performances and the large side cast, Victor gets even less screen time. It leaves him in a weird state of prominent cheerleader but depthless protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other mainstay character is Yurio. Compared to the other two, he\u2019s a bit different. He has always been extremely talented, and he knows it. However, his abrasive personality keeps not only other people away but also gets in the way of his performances. He simply cannot express himself without falling back on the anger within him. Like Yuri, his introduction \u2013 of telling Yuri to retire already while yelling at the poor guy \u2013 captures his initial state about as well as it could.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast to Yuri, Yurio is given a program centered on sincerity and lightness and care. It\u2019s love but not of the fiery, passionate kind. Expectedly, Yurio struggles at making this form of \u201cagape\u201d his own.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Yurio doesn\u2019t receive a whole lot of attention past the third episode. Which is, to some extent, understandable. It\u2019s not possible plot-wise for Yurio to always be around given the nature of the tournaments, and the anime must spend time providing tidbits of information on the other skaters as they make their climb to the top.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, the anime does what it can. It shows snippets of his training as a ballerina dancer as well as his embracing of his femininity. An edge that he has over the other skaters. While he lost to Yuri and no longer has Victor to guide him, he remains just as impassioned as anyone else. To prove his skill to Yuri, to Victor, and, most importantly, to himself.\\n\\n\r\nWhat helps Yurio the most, though, isn\u2019t Russian dancing lessons or feminine appeal. No, it\u2019s the kindhearted people he meets along the way. Yuuko looks out for him during his stay at Yuri\u2019s hometown. Yuri himself makes for a strong rival. His grandpa supports him with pork-cutlet-stuffed rolls.\\n\\n\r\nYurio\u2019s character arc isn\u2019t amazing. His aside with Otabek, where Otabek shares how he feels the two are similar and they handshake to solidify their friendship, is crammed into the narrative all willy-nilly. The show also cannot stop itself from pointing out this motif of his through more unneeded exposition. And he remains more or less a jerk to everyone, demonstrating that these relationships haven\u2019t affected him all that much.\\n\\n\r\nBut he still channels their love all the same. Their kindness softened his movements and outlook, granting him the final push he needed to win the entire Grand Prix Final. Yurio still has a lot of time and skating left in him, but it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s on thin ice no longer.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track \u201cHistory Maker\u201d is one of the best parts of the show. It\u2019s somewhat unique in the medium for its all-English lyrics, but it\u2019s the instrumentals, the echoes, and the mixture of both quiet and loud effects that support it most. The song itself is perhaps a bit too grandiose for the scope of the plot, but, nevertheless, it succeeds in generating hype to carry each episode. Even better, it instills a sense of personal optimism. That anybody can go out there and make their own history.\\n\\n\r\nIn comparison, the ending track \u201cYou Only Live Once\u201d goes for a different setup and a different feeling. It\u2019s much more computerized in sound \u2013 some autotuned vocals, a steady backing beat, a set of dropping techno notes \u2013 giving it much more of a party vibe. A vibe that fits the overall feeling of the piece itself (which the visuals corroborate): camaraderie. It\u2019s best to drop international barriers and enjoy what\u2019s happening all around since, as the title and saying goes, \u201cyou only live once.\u201d And this song captures this sentiment in a catchy, optimistic manner.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode ten features a new ED that goes for something much more lighthearted and wild. It\u2019s a lot of fun thanks to the shrill guitar, the yelling, and the emphasis on the music itself rather than the lyrics. Arguably, it\u2019s the best of the three \u2013 because it comes out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the background music doesn\u2019t impress too much, the chosen songs for many of the skaters provide a lot of variety and purpose in their composition. \u201cCarabosse,\u201d a thunderous orchestral that evokes heartbreak. \u201cStill Alive,\u201d a lowkey, hip-hop beat that shares the smoothness of life\u2019s wonders. \u201cRapsodie Espagnole,\u201d a meandering, fantastical piece that heightens the senses.\\n\\n\r\nThe clear winner, though, is the titular track, \u201cYuri on Ice.\u201d It\u2019s what Yuri skates to in his free skate program, and it\u2019s a beautiful song that does, indeed, capture Yuri\u2019s progress and the life he has led thus far both on and off the ice.\\n\\n\r\nOn the opposite end, Yuri!!! on ICE chooses to use a set of stock, dainty chimes to transition back and forth between many of its flashbacks. The sound-effect wouldn\u2019t be that annoying if the anime wasn\u2019t so bent on including flashbacks all the time. The anime at least has some nice ice-skating sound-effects that make the audience feel as if they are there at the rink.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, voice acting doesn\u2019t showcase anything superb, but a lot of people lend their talent. If nothing else, Junichi Suwabe as Victor deserves a shout-out. His not too manly, not too sultry tone gave him the perfect cadence for the unreachable yet alluring figure-skating star.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not the biggest fan of sports in general. I would much rather watch an anime or write or play my guitar before I would willingly sit down to watch a game of football or baseball. Although, I do like hockey. Mostly because of the quickness and the fact that the players do not approve whatsoever of any nonsense like flopping.\\n\\n\r\nSo, when it comes to ice skating, I can\u2019t say I was a fan of the sport before watching this anime. Sadly, the same is true afterwards. The repetition really didn\u2019t help, and I was never impressed by the jumps and technique involved. The only routine that I really liked was Yurio\u2019s free skate. It felt as if it had a lot more passion than the others, a greater sense of drive.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick my two favorite moments, they would be Kenjirou\u2019s short scenes and the ending of episode ten. Kenjirou got all excited when meeting Yuri and quite embarrassed as he watched Yuri and Victor act closer than he thought. As for episode ten, it was hilarious to watch the evidence of Yuri\u2019s drunken partygoing. Replete with exaggerated moves and underwear pole dancing.\\n\\n\r\nI still found myself irritated with the anime regardless.\\n\\n\r\nThe show makes it blatant. Beyond obvious. Without a sliver of doubt that Victor and Yuri have a thing for each other. It couldn\u2019t have put it more on the nose. And yet the anime just doesn\u2019t go all the way. Having Victor say he\u2019ll be Yuri\u2019s \u201cboyfriend\u201d in episode four only for Yuri to respond \u201cno\u201d literally five times in a row, all while, in the same episode, the two pose naked together and Yuri playfully touches the hairline on Victor\u2019s head, is just plain rude.\\n\\n\r\nMost off-putting, though, was the poor writing. Why not have Yuri spend more time with his parents, highlighting the support for their son? Where were Victor\u2019s performances given his stardom and vital role in the narrative? What\u2019s up with the lame dog-almost-dying subplot?\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m reiterating myself one last time, but the show did start off favorably to me. I liked the comedy bits and the setup and the potential to witness something I\u2019m not familiar with. Unfortunately, it does too much to make me dislike it. I couldn\u2019t take Yuri seriously when he tried to act sexy and commanding. JJ\u2019s music had me shaking my head. Yuri\u2019s family and friends cheering on and fawning over his competitors didn\u2019t feel right to me.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this entire season felt like one big first arc to a tale that is supposed to go on for at least another season or two. At the time of this writing, that may just be the case, considering the new film on the horizon. Until then, this one ends up in a rougher spot than Yuri did during his first Grand Prix Final.\\n\\n\r\nYuri!!! on ICE doesn\u2019t have the stamina to step and jump its way to victory. A cumbersome narrative structure and artistic inconsistency keep the points low. Some musical choices shine, and a couple of the characters have their moments, but, even then, it falls over. Altogether, no amount of ice can heal its wounds on this \u201cstage.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, despite the strong setup, the narrative encounters awkward plot points, incorrect pacing, no downtime, overused exposition, no follow through, and an unsatisfactory ending that leave it in a sorry state\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, tackling the movements of figure skating is commendable, it gets detailed when it wants to, and the character designs are varied, but too many repetitive shots and unacceptable artistic errors creep their way in\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Yuri grows and expounds on love, Victor doesn\u2019t receive enough exploration, and Yurio\u2019s journey falls somewhere between the two\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, good EDs, okay OST, nice variety in the programs\u2019 musical selections, mixed sound-effects, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, while it could be fun at times, it is unable to make the sport interesting, skirts around Yuri and Victor\u2019s relationship, makes poor writing decisions, and includes annoying details throughout\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "I've never written a review before, but this show inspired me so much that I had to review it no matter what. \r\nThis anime was really outstanding and imo it deserves to be the Anime of the Fall 2016 Season, and here's why I think so.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is not something unusual, the pattern is similar to many other sports anime where the main character starts to climb his way to the top, except for the fact that in this show what motivates the protagonist Yuri is the presence of his idol Viktor who became his coach. Since Viktor appeared, Yuri's life has been changingand developing, and so his dull skating skills. \\n\r\nThis is the story of a man who decides to cast off his wavering and unconfident self through the power of love for his coach. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 \\n\r\nThe animations in the first episodes were pretty good, but due to budget issues some animations in the later episodes were sloppy. However the art of the important and crucial scenes was top notch. \\n\r\nI hope some of the problems with the animations get fixed with the release of the BD.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 \\n\r\nThe sound was amazing: one of the best aspects of the show.\\n\r\nEven the opening is one of my favourites of all time, it really made history.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nI think the character development was perfect. \\n\r\nAt the start of the show Yuri was unconfident and we can witness his evolution throughout the series.\\n\r\nThe key point of the show is the relationship between Yuri and Viktor and I think it was a form of \"Agape\", unconditional love. It was touching and heartwarming. For me it wasn't homo, just pure love. \\n\r\nThe supporting characters are really good too. The Russian Yuri didn't impress me at first, I disliked him, but later on I really appreciated and kinda understood him, I could relate to his rebelliuos stage, I was troublesome when I was 15 too.\\n\r\nJJ, Chris, Phichit and many other characters didn't get much screentime but thanks to them the show had some changes of pace and it was refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI really did enjoy watching Yuri on Ice, it is one of the most beautiful sports anime that I've ever seen, it made me happy, sad and sometimes even frustrated, it was a roller coaster of emotions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 \\n\r\nIt's hard to find a sports anime that is so good but also so short: among the sports animes that I've seen Yuri on Ice is one of the shortest in terms of number of episodes (only 12). I really recommend it but you better not have your mind clouded by homophobic prejudices, because some scenes are a bit gay. Narrow minded people might not like it, as I can tell from the many negative reviews this show is getting.",

            "content": "I expected more from this anime, however I'm very disappointed in the story line. I like the overall music choice, the animation for the characters when their ice skating is amazing. When the trailer was first released I was really looking forward to it, the first few episodes of the anime was captivating and I really enjoyed it. I really looked forward for the episodes to be released every week. When the anime headed on to episode 6, I felt it was very rushed. The change of story line was very shocking.\r\nHowever, it feels that they are trying to squeeze the anime into 12 episodeswhereas they could have extended it to 25 or so to elaborate the story even more instead of the sudden escalation (gayness and all). Perhaps this escalation would have appealed to some fans, but I dare say that most fans would prefer to have a longer and more elaborate/detailed story line. The gayness level from episode 1 to episode 12 has increased so much over that short time frame. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has increased the popularity of ice skating among many of the watches, especially Japanese skaters. This is probably one of the most positive effect of this anime.",

            "content": "If people are still accusing the show of being a queerbait after as early as episode 4, have you even been watching the show with your eyes open?\r\nWe live in a world that is run by money and we all know that sex sells. Yes, there were tonnes of fan service in the earlier episodes but the fan service scenes were not 100% gratuitous. We got a glimpse into Viktor's personality and what he wanted with Yuuri.  I don't know if you noticed, but the number of fan service scenes decreased significantly after episode 7.  (fun fact: Suwabe Junichi, Viktor's seiyuu said thatthe first episode barely made it past the censorship laws in Japan)\\n\\n\r\nBack to the story.  Throughout the story, we follow Yuuri along as he learns about love.  It's in the title, Yuri on Ice. Ice is pronounced as 'aisu', which also means to love.  In his journey to the Grand Prix Final, Yuuri sees and accepts the love that has surrounded him in his life all along.  And it's Viktor who who helps him see that love and also find his self-confidence and self-love.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime made history just as the opening song says.  While this is not the first non shounen-sai/yaoi title to feature main characters who were in a homosexual relationship (No. 6, which is based on a light novel series), this is the first sports anime to feature canonically gay couple.  \\n\\n\r\nWe are all familiar with the sports genre and how the shounen sports genre is infamous for its yaoi fanservice and queerbaiting. Yuri on Ice is not like that.  Even compared to a typical romance title, the relationship between Viktor and Yuuri that develops throughout the show is far more realistic and healthier. It's not your shoujou typical love at first sight nor is it a yaoi typical seme-pursues-uke story. Viktor and Yuuri stand on equal grounds in their relationship and it makes them all the more memorable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let's not forget the characters'. It's not just the main trio whose characters grow in the show. We are shown lot of the other skaters' background story and they change within the episode or two that they are in.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: even if you don't like sports anime, watch this amazing show.  watch it for the beautiful character development. watch it for a shy boy who finds the meaning of love and life",

            "content": "I've watched this show, because my brother and I wanted to watch something random and he picked this show. He said that it was okay, but he thought that it'll be interesting for me. Dear God, is it more than interesting. \r\nTHERE WILL BE SPOILERS (SPOILER ALERT)!!!\r\n~Story~ (9)\r\nThe idea of the story is the typical sport anime sort of story, where the underdog becomes the best of the best and so on and so forth. But the way that they made this story made me pause. It shouldn't, because I see the same thing from All Out, which I'm watching (and not enjoying) right now.I don't know why this show is different, but I guess you can call it a 'charm'. Yeah, that's the right word. This show's story has a charm to it that makes it likable at least and amazing at best. The romance in believable. Nobody is picking on the main character (Yuri) for no reason (Goddamnit do you people know how many sports shows/movies that I see where this happens? IT DRIVES ME MAD!). In fact, the side characters actually befriend Yuri, because he's just a good, fun and shy guy to hang around with. The family of Yuri's is supportive of him and his choices through and through. Even I would like to hang out with him, and not just because of his looks and the other guys' looks. They also don't do the typical 'childhood sweethearts' that they show in the first episode. This alone shocks me, because it's overdone so much that I can't roll my eyes over it enough. The story also shows the struggles that everybody goes through. I'll talk more about it in the 'Character' section. And the humor- you people don't know how many times I nearly fell off the chair laughing. The humor comes from the naive responds and the unaware actions of the characters, much like Hajime no Ippo for references. Everyone teases the others and it's just heartwarming to watch. And I know that what I say about the 'charm' is rather unbelievable, but it's the best way that I can explain it. You'll just have to watch the show to understand that, even though the plot is overused, it does bring something new that other shows just don't explore as much. The only reason why I gave this section a 9 rather than a 10, is because of the weak first episode. I wouldn't be surprised if people were turned off because of it, since it has the typical underdog tone to it. But if you get passed that episode, then the story just gets better and better.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~ (10)\\n\\n\r\nDear God... the art style drove me mad, I'm telling you. Even though it has the typical big eye 2010's art styles, the animators put so much time and effort to make it look more amazing. The characters all have their unique looks to show their ethnicities. It makes you believe that when you see a Canadian, you're looking at a Canadian. That when you see a Korean, that it is a Korean. In many shows where ethnicities come into play, for some reason the animators always make them look the same. They all look pale as fuck and have the same body designs. But not this show. To me, this show makes a point to show other ethnicities as much as Hetalia does with its characters, without the stereotypes that come along with it, of course. Then there is the figure skating itself. It's beautiful. When there are sparkles on the outfit, they make it shown. They make sure that the outfits fit with the themes and the characters, which individualizes everyone even more and makes them more unique and memorable. Then they don't just skip or fast forward with the skating either. The animators take the time to draw each jump, spin and spirals so that you can follow along as if you're one of the members of the audience in the show itself. When the character is tired, you can see through the simple art of them breathing hard and sweating. There was even a moment when Yuri and Viktor got into a bit of a fight, because our favorite Russian was being a little dick. Just the scene of Yuri not moving, just staring, and all of a sudden crying while in a statue like state, makes it tug on your heartstrings because you can relate with the reaction. There's so much more, but I've talked enough about the art section. Now, onto the next part!\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ (8)\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about this section, as I don't really know what to say. As far as sounds go, I don't listen to the intro and ending, unless they catch my attention. So the only thing that I CAN talk about are the music pieces that each skater dances to. And oh boy did they pick the right ones. Each song piece, along with the dance, says something about the skater. It tells us their story, much like 'Yuri on Ice' song piece does with Yuri when it talks about his adventure and journey as a figure skater. They'd make a point to show a few clips from what the skater is imagining as they skate, and you can connect the music with the skater and watch them grow at the same time. The best example of a song showing the growth of a character is Yuri, the main character. The song is something that Viktor picked for Yuri, which is Eros. Yuri is a shy, not-so-confident 23 years old guy, and picking this song for him forced him to get out of his comfort zone, which in turn forced him to grow as a character. This is one part of the 'charm' that I talked about. It's unbelievable that something like this isn't really shown in other sport shows, where the main character is forced out of his comfort zone so that s/he can grow as a character. But there are songs that don't quite make sense as to how they connect with a few characters, which is why I deducted a few points. Maybe I just don't see it, as I can only skate normally and know next to nothing about figure skating, but that's how it is for me.\\n\\n\r\n~Character~ (9)\\n\\n\r\nOH... MY... GOD!!!!!!!!!! Can Viktor and Yuri make me blush anymore than I already am?!?!?! Like, how is it possible for these two dorks to be such believable characters, grow as characters with the help of each other and make such a good romantic relationship at the same time!? HOW?! Ahem... yeah... sorry about that. As you can see, I really appreciate the time and effort that the writers have taken to making Viktor and Yuri into believable characters as well as their relationship. But not only them. One of the biggest things that make this show are all the characters. I know, shocker! Even without figure skating, this show can be held together by these characters. Every character is remember-able.  They all have their issues that they have to overcome. They all have desires and wants. They all have their dreams. They all have personalities!!! Did you read that? P-E-R-S-O-N-A-L-I-T-I-E-S! I have seen a good number of sport anime, and I've never seen such good characters aside from Hajime no Ippo and a few other shows. They don't hate on each other just because. They get jealous, have egos, have humors and their quiet/scared moments. They also are rivals, obviously, since they're competing against each other. But you can see by their facial expressions, body languages and words that they're either happy for their competitors or are anxious. They don't have to talk to get across what they're thinking and feeling. You can see just from their body language and eyes what they're going through. This makes them feel so much like human beings, to the point that I almost cried in disbelief and happiness, especially when I see that Yuri doesn't become best of the best right off the bat (winning only silver in the end) and that every skater makes a mistake in their routines. I can't believe that I found such a perfect anime. I even told a friend that I almost cried, because lately every anime I've seen the characters, story, etc. just felt dull and... inhuman. Like they want to remind us that they're nothing more than a 2D animation. I wanted to be sucked into the story, the characters and everything else. I wanted to feel like I'm right beside them, laughing, worried, crying, happy and cheering. This show does that. It feels so human, so believable and something that you can feel like you've gone through the journey with all the characters, especially Yuri and Viktor. I haven't talked much about these two dorks much, now have I? What's amazing about their relationship is that they work on it as time goes on. They didn't fall for each other straight off the bat. Yuri was always inspired by Viktor's performances and became a figure skater just like him, but he wasn't an obsessive fan that makes you want to cringe. When you see the posters of Viktor in Yuri's room, you can tell that they were taken great care of and later on you understand where the inspiration comes from. But he has many issues and insecurities, but when you see how he skates you believe that he has the talent to reach the top and you want to encourage him. He feels human, because he shows his emotions like one. It makes you want to connect with him and it makes you fall in love with his character (not romantically, mind you.) even more. Then there's Viktor, the happy-go-lucky, sometimes-serious, Russian-like dork. Our favourite Russian was in a dilemma that he was losing inspirations and didn't know what to do with himself. But when he found the video of Yuri figure skating back home, he was struck with inspiration and went right away to Japan all the way from Russia to coach him. Yeah, a big, out of nowhere, jump from a figure skater to a coach, and you can tell that this isn't like him from everyone's reactions. But all he wanted was to be a coach and to be inspired again. Then there are the small moments, actions and words that the two exchange that make their relationship grow over 8 or so months. That's more than enough time to fall for someone, and when they exchanged rings you truly believed that they wanted to be together and that they earned the right to be together. They also push each other to be better, putting their own happiness at stake at times. This leads to one of the most heartbreaking moments, when the two fought over whether or not they should stay together as a student-teacher kind of thing. It makes you worried because if they broke that relationship, then their other relationship could be at stake. This, in turn, makes you want to watch the show even more. Though, the only complaint that I have about this show is that one of the character's having a slightly bigger ego than he should, but I don't have much other complaints to give about the characters.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ (9)\\n\\n\r\nThis show... I just... I just can't. The emotions this show gave me really make me happy, but cry at the same time. This is a gem among the average/bad anime (in general) out there. It feels alive, and I felt going through the journey together with Yuri and Viktor. I laughed with them. I squealed when I saw them do something romantic together. If I could, I would jump through the screen and hug Yuri and shout 'congratulations' to him and Viktor, because I knew that after all they've been through that they needed each other. I cried and was anxious with them, especially Yuri. I would almost jump out of my sit when I see even one of the characters manage to land properly, especially Yuri. After so many shows and manga that I sat through, where I felt nothing but boredom, then comes this show and it makes me feel so many things at once. How many people can say that about a 2D animated show? If I didn't make this clear, this show is worth to watch. As I said before, it's hard to get through episode 1, but once you are through it gets better and better. You will love every minute of it. Enjoy the show/manga!",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: After a crushing defeat during the Grand Prix Figure Skating Final in Sochi, Russia, a crestfallen Katsuki Yuuri (Toyonaga Toshiyuki) returns to his hometown in Japan. Unsure of himself and whether or not to proceed with his career, Yuuri\u2019s life takes an unexpected turn when a recording of him performing the routine of his idol and world champion figure skater Victor Nikiforov (Suwabe Junichi) goes viral. To his surprise, the video attracts the attention of Victor himself who abruptly flies to meet with him and offers to become his coach. With Victor\u2019s help, Yuuri redoubles hisefforts to win the upcoming Grand Prix and overcome the other accomplished skaters and his newfound rival Yuri Plisetsky (Uchiyama Kouki).\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Yuri!!! on Ice can best be distilled within two primary focuses. The first is the growth Yuuri experiences over the course of his journey, both as a figure skater and as a person. The second is Yuuri\u2019s relationship with Victor which matters a great deal in regards to both of the previous facets of the show. When we first encounter Yuuri after his defeat in Russia, he sees himself as a failure and a lot of his development and his interactions with Victor are aimed at overcoming this self image \u2013 of coming into confidence and self-worth. This transformation is very pronounced and you get a keen sense of where Yuuri is at each step of his transformation. In this way Yuuri is a fairly endearing character.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri\u2019s relationship with Victor is an interesting one. He idolizes him as a figure skating champion and is endlessly appreciative of his offer to mentor him however above all else there is unquestionably a romantic element to their relationship. In some ways this is well executed and in other ways it becomes rather problematic. The way Yuuri attempts to discern his feelings is very vague and is reflective of his own uncertainty. This feeds well into his meek personality and the unconventionality of the romance. Their bond has some charm to it and it adds meaningful depth to both of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nConversely, Yuri!!! on Ice opts to be far more suggestive than concrete in how it portrays their relationship. It leads the viewer along with insinuations and fan-service rather than truly committing to what in all reality should be an authentic relationship. The way the show skirts around a genuine portrayal of romance is profoundly infuriating and while some viewers might invest themselves in the show\u2019s allusions more easily, I found its execution to be rather irritating. Moreover, Yuuri and Victor\u2019s dialogue is very overt which means that they often speak their thoughts out loud. This approach of straightforward, internal exposition renders the dialogue a little plain and the show could have found a more tactful or artistic way to convey the emotions and thoughts of these characters to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri and Victor aside, Yuri!!! on Ice presents a rather extensive supporting cast. Some characters such as Yuri Plisetsky, Christophe Giacometti, Jean-Jacques Leroy offer fairly memorable characterization and stand on their own within the scope of the show\u2019s narrative. Yuri!!! on Ice is very interested in portraying a tournament scene full of potential champions and rising stars and to some degree it succeeds. Many of the other skaters and the remainder of the supporting cast leave a lot to be desired however. The way in which the tournament introduces them, provides them with an almost token backstory and motivation for winning, all before dismissing them felt awkward and forgettable. They exist for an ephemeral moment only to provide the audience with a less interesting story and the sense that Yuuri has some measure of competition before him. Some of these characters are better than others but many of them they don\u2019t feel like they exist beyond the story they are given \u2013 they are written in simply to lose.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking component of the first episode of Yuri!!! on Ice was its fantastic character animation and choreography. With figure skating sequences choreographed by professional skater Miyamoto Kenji and the visionary Yamamoto Sayo at the helm, the visuals of Yuri!!! on Ice sported a lot of promise. This potential manifests in full form during the show\u2019s first episode however it has a hard time ever rising to the same degree of execution afterwards. Yuri!!! on Ice was plagued by a variety of quality drops and issues and while they didn\u2019t entirely compromise the show\u2019s presentation, there were countless instances of very off-model character designs and awkward bits of animation. These things somewhat undercut the show\u2019s strong sense of choreography and otherwise fluid animation.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of animation, there was a great deal of reused animation throughout the show. This is spruced up in various ways as to not be too obvious however once the sequence makes its 3rd or 4th appearance it starts to wear on the performance. This is somewhat forgivable however as most of the reused shots and sequences can be seen as a necessary evil in how the figure skaters repeat their choreographed performances. Though the characters often don\u2019t look quite like themselves, their performances generally capture the kind of emotion they are channeling. There\u2019s a kind of integral emotion, sex appeal, and femininity within figure skating and the way this manifests within the routines of the characters and their personalities is an interesting element of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I\u2019ll touch upon are the character designs of the cast which were quite good. Yuuri is very average-looking and unassuming which goes hand-in-hand with his self-conscious personality. The dissonance between Yuuri\u2019s ordinary design and the person he becomes while skating is utilized well by the show to explore the changes within his mentality. Victor\u2019s design is sensuous and poised and although this often obscured by the show\u2019s crude sense of comedy, his design speaks well of his characterization. The other characters all sport both distinct and memorable designs as well and visually fit very well into the tournament setting though some fail to follow through on their individuality with their respective characterization. In a similar vein, the wardrobe of each of the skaters is flashy and dynamic and adds another visual element to their performances.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]: \\n\\n\r\nThe core narrative of Yuri!!! on Ice is pretty straightforward. The story follows Yuuri, Victor, and the rest of the competition as they work to improve themselves and subsequently compete within the tournament bracket culminating in the Grand Prix Final. What\u2019s interesting is that the show doesn\u2019t proceed as traditionally as one might expect. The first few episodes establish a fairly standard underdog story however this isn\u2019t the ultimate tone of the show. Though lacking in self-confidence, Yuuri really is a professional skater and is even more accomplished than some of the people he competes against. The story then becomes more focused on Yuuri himself as an individual and how he interacts with Victor rather than playing into such a conventional setup. It\u2019s a story of self-exploration and empowerment threaded together by themes of competition, love, and romantic discovery.\\n\\n\r\nAnother important element of Yuri!!! on Ice are the figure skating performances which dominate the show in its later half. To some degree, the way in which each character skates is reflective of their mentality off the ice and the way their mindset drives their performance is one of the primary ways the show imparts significance to each performance. This is especially important for Yuuri and Yuri Plisetsky whose transformations are most apparent in how they skate. The show doesn\u2019t allow for a lot of time outside of the competition and so the way it manages to explore characters is by using cutaways and flashbacks during their sequences. This can feel pretty disruptive at times and occasionally even felt like a means of cutting around animation corners. Rarely are the performances allowed the room to breathe and progress uninterrupted but when they are they are quite spectacular to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe primary issues of the show stem from its problematic portrayal of Yuuri and Victor\u2019s relationship and the lackluster characterization of the supporting cast. Given the numerous fan-service scenes and instances of suggestive dialogue, too often does Yuuri\u2019s relationship with Victor feel like it exists for the sake of the viewer rather than for the characters themselves. It\u2019s presented in such a way that, while their romantic interest in each other is genuine, the show skirts around ever actualizing what they are talking about. It implies that they are boyfriends, lovers, partners, etc. but only through the veil of humor and Victor\u2019s own levity. It\u2019s not as black and white as some of the relationship \u2018baiting\u2019 you might see in other shows but it certainly plays off of the viewer\u2019s own desired perception rather than offering something authentic. It has a handful of endearing scenes that attempt to sincerely progress their relationship however these steps forward are somewhat undermined by the other aspects of their portrayal. There\u2019s something legitimate in their attachment to one another but it would have been far potent had all of their scenes been explored as honestly as some others.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]: \\n\\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s a hard thing to find concrete value in, I thought Yuri!!! on Ice had strong sound design. Within the presentation of figure skating there are a lot of minute details that you can play off of to heighten the immersion of the scene and the show follows through on a lot of these. The acoustics of the skating, the crowd in the distance, and the way in which the sound of the performance seemed to fit the size of the venue were impressive details.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was decent but didn\u2019t present anything that stood out in my memory. The tracks to which the skaters performed to were varied and some were pretty engaging but others were far less memorable and distinct.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nOne aspect of the show that I enjoyed but wasn\u2019t able to highlight earlier was its use of social media. Through various media platforms and commonplace social networks, Yuri!!! on Ice is able to introduce characters, places, and events in a quintessentially modern way. The very premise of the show is derived from a video of Yurri\u2019s skating going viral. The characters feel integrated in a true-to-life way and it was a very interesting and fun addition to the show\u2019s presentation.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole Yuri!!! on Ice is a bit of a mixed bag. It\u2019s strength lies in the development of its protagonist and the various figure skating routines that attempt to distill the passion, personality, and drive of the show\u2019s cast. Yuuri\u2019s relationship with Victor, while compelling in several aspects, is somewhat tarnished by the underhanded way it is portrayed within the scope of the show. Art quality issues permeate the length of its run and the writing and dialogue is all a little too straightforward which leave a lot of the side-characters feeling uninteresting. The comedy feels natural within the tone of Yuri!!! on Ice however the gags and levity of the show somewhat upset the dramatic potential of its story and characters. The show\u2019s stellar first few episodes set an incredibly high standard that the show had a hard time surmounting afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 6\\n\\n\r\nI gave Yuri!!! on Ice a 6 because, despite its various faults, it still managed to present something both charming and at times even beautiful. Though it had its share of production issues, the figure skating was often graceful and while it wasn\u2019t executed to the degree that I wish it was, the way in which the routines of the skaters reflected upon themselves was engaging. At its core, the relationship between Yuuri and Victor was a good one and it worked well in regards to Yuuri\u2019s development however I think a less manipulative display would have gone a long way for the show. Yuri!!! on Ice was\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]: \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Yuri!!! on Ice to those interested in the premise of the show and in its sport. There\u2019s plenty of figure skating to go around and while it doesn\u2019t handle itself in the same manner as a traditional sports show, it should appeal to that interest all the same. An additional facet of the show that may attract some viewers is that in dealing with Katsuki Yuuri and Victor Nikiforov who are 23 and 27 respectively, Yuri!!! on Ice presents a more mature cast of characters. Those uninterested in the bond between Yuuri and Victor may want to stay away from the show as it accounts for a significant amount of the show and what it sets out to accomplish.",

            "content": "This is my first review but I felt the need to write one since Yuri!!! on Ice left me with a lot of emotions.\r\nFirst of all I would like to give everyone the advice to not let yourself be deceived by screaming yaoi fangirls or comments about fanservice.\r\nDo yourself the favor and start this show, take in the art, the soundtrack, the feeling you get while watching. And then decide for yourself.\r\nPersonally I think everyone can enjoy this anime, some more than others. I never fell so hard and so fast for a show and it's been forever since I sat nervous in front ofmy laptop every week, waiting for the new episode to be released. \\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWe start with our protagonist Y\u016bri Katsuki, a renowned japanese figure skater, right after his first Grand Prix Final. Devastated about his loss he returns to Japan, trying to get back his love for figure skating by reenacting the free program of his idol and living legend Viktor Nikiforov. The video goes viral, leading to said legend traveling to Japan and starting to coach Y\u016bri.\\n\r\nI don't want to spoil any more of the story than I already did but let me tell you the last show which surprised me as much as yuri on ice did was Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. The story flows naturally and is so well thought through it surpassed my wildest imaginations. I was left wondering if I just finished the same show which I started 12 weeks ago.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI had to deduct two points since on some episodes the animation is a little bit wonky. However to be fair we should consider the fact that figure skating is a sport highly consisting of a lot of fluent motions and trying to animate all programs equally is just not possible for an original anime. Even though some skating is a little bit off, the short and free programs of our protagonist are breathtaking to watch and my eyes were glued to the screen as soon as he set foot on the ice.\\n\r\nThe rest of the anime is absolutely gorgeous, the style itself is amazing but do yourself the favor and look up backgrounds in different episodes, they left me breathless. \\n\r\nOne of my absolute favorite things on yuri on ice were the costume designs, every single one was unique and fitted the character it was made for so well. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI fell in love with the soundtrack as soon as the opening started and every episode only made me fall more and more for it. The soundtrack accompanies the animation perfectly and underlines the emotions in every scene so well.\\n\r\nThe songs used in the programs vary a lot, may it be beautifully arranged classical pieces or modern pop music, yuri on ice has it all. I have been listening to the soundtrack for hours and I never grew tired of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEvery character in this show is diverse and unique, I am honestly not over the fact that this show managed to make me fall in love with all of its characters.\\n\r\nIf I'm honest here I disliked some of them when they were first introduced however their backstories changed my view of them forever. Yuri on ice grants every character depth and personality and nearly none of them feel like only supporting characters. I could go on forever why I absolutely adore the characters but it would take too long so I'll focus on the main three: Y\u016bri Katsuki, Viktor Nikiforov and Yuri Plisetsky.\\n\\n\r\nY\u016bri Katsuki functions as the narrator for the main part of the anime and introduces us to his life. His character is honestly so refreshing as he is not a typical sports youth trying to get into nationals or having a hidden talent which is suddenly discovered. He starts out as a professional with a lot of experience and even if he constantly belittles himself we can see how talented he really is. His struggle with anxiety and low self-esteem is sincerely portrayed and never made fun of.\\n\\n\r\nViktor Nikiforov is mostly seen through Y\u016bris eyes as the ideal skater, 5 time gold medalist, the legend completely out of reach. But as we get further into the story we can see Viktor as a normal human being, as a friend, as a rival, as a lover. I won't really go on about the lover part since I don't want to start a debate, but you have to be blind to not see it. Viktor himself narrates one episode, revealing a lot about his character and his own struggles.\\n\\n\r\nYuri Plisetsky most definitely had the best character development in this show and I am so glad his character turned out so well. He is 15 and the youngest skater in the bunch. As a teenager he is moody and demanding, arrogant even. However throughout the show and thanks to his encounters with Y\u016bri, a Viktor he never knew and so many wonderful people, he learns about the different forms of love and matures.\\n\\n\r\nAnd despite the fact that Y\u016bri and Yuri are rivals they respect each other, you can see Y\u016bri sincerely cheering for him and they even become friends.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I want to make it 100/10. I have never been so in love with a show as I am with yuri on ice. When I started I was a little doubtful as I have seen quite a few sports anime and other genres which queerbait a lot. I really adore the director Sayo Yamamoto ever since I watched her original anime Michiko to Hatchin so I was excited as well. I have been crying every week (but I'm a huge crybaby so that does not mean it was sad) and watched every episode more than once. Yuri on ice will forever be one of my absolute favorites. I wish I could experience it all over again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYuri on ice set the bar really really high and I hope the anime industry will take notice of its success. Everything played so well together, it is definitely my top anime of 2016. Please do yourself the favor of watching it.",

            "content": "OKOK I will now review \"Yuri!!! on Ice\", the anime that captivated people across the globe, though I'm sure most of this review will include a lot of unnecessary parts *sweating droplets in an apologetic way* please do read it :)  I can't guarantee that this is 100% spoiler-free but pretty much is so yeah. Just go for it!\r\nNOTE: \"Yuri!!! on Ice\" has ABSOLUTELY NO restrictions on gender (I've heard a couple of things here and there so I'm just putting it out there.)\r\nYou may have heard of Yuri!!! on Ice fans spamming the internet with yaddayadda saying how Yaoi!!! on Ice is gayetc. And some people might be like \"UGH\" (I do not approve of this behaviour but y'know. Some people are like this in the world) BUT my dear friends. This gay is a nice gay that brings lots and lots of happiness so give it a try even if 'it isn't your cup of tea'. I'm sure you'll like this tea anyways.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY-9/10\\n\r\nLike every sports anime, there is the protagonist ice skater, Katsuki Yuuri, and the whole plot is that he was a failure at first didn't win at all in competitions until his ice skating idol, Victor Nikiforov becomes his coach(not telling how cos I'd hate that part to be spoiled to me so I'm not gonna spoil it for you). The whole plot is rather basic for a sports anime but i think the ending and build-up to the ending made me give it a 9/10. \\n\\n\\n\r\nART-9.5/10\\n\r\nI LOVE THE CHARACTER DESIGNS AND COSTUMES and stuff, the most important scenes looked soo pretty as well. Thinking technically, obviously the ice skating scenes must have been too hard to animate- maybe if they didn't have enough frames, it wouldn't flow as well as its supposed to look etc., but it has such flow and I swear I could cry every single time Yuuri- not saying (ahahaha not telling youuuu we can fangirl/boy if you want but after you watch it only:))\\n\\n\r\nSOUND-10/10\\n\r\nOK I know i'm not the only one who's watched Yuri!!! on Ice and listened to the opening and ending endlessly and also all of the programme songs and even memorised most of the lyrics for lets say \"Shall we skate\". Basically for those who don't have a  single clue what I'm talking about, this show has great music, like every single programme song is addictive. I'm not even joking\\n\\n\r\nGoing off track a little, I'd like to tell you a story so read it if you are bothered or skip if you just wanna get on with the review. In my English class, my teacher likes teaching us all that new vocab that you need to get good grades in your essays and such. And the older students in my school were doing classes on Romeo and Julliet (I think...well it was some kind of Romance novel) and so the teacher put up on her vocab list *that all could see* the word \"Agape\" and \"Eros\"(they are types of love if you didn't know). So that triggered my inner Yuri!!! on Ice self and I started singing songs from Yuri!!! on Ice. Yeah. So these younger students were having class next in the same classroom while I was singing Yuri!!! on Ice songs outside and this girl starts shaking her friends shoulders and starts saying quite loudly \"its not just us who watches gay boys on ice!\" <NOTE- this is NOT meant in an offensive way. In fact why is \"being gay\" even considered an offensive thing? I take that back, it ISN'T offensive so it wouldn't sound offensive anyways>. Yeah that was hella awkward. Especially as she stared at me really like... a puppy expecting food?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER-10/10\\n\r\nYeah Yuuri looks too plain for a protagonist, but this anime is supposed to be realistic. It isn't shone and he is supposed to look Japanese. (Basically Minami is a complete exception, I wanna know the secret behind his hair...)VICTOR IS A CUTE LIL BEING, 10000000000 POINTS TO GRIFFINDOR, THANK YOU CREATORS.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT-10/10\\n\r\nI think you got that I love this show.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL-10/10\\n\r\nOK I recommend this to ABSOLUTELY ANYONE and there maybe you might be like \"...that show was meh\" or \"...it was ok\" *and maybe there may possible be the smallest fraction of a possibility that you hated this show but. In my opinion, this is one of my absolute favourite shows EVER. \\n\\n\r\nThank you to the people who actually read this to the end cos this took a while to write and its nice to think that your hard work paid off\\n\\n\r\nPLEASE WATCH THE SHOW AS WELL\\n\r\nAnd you might as well follow the Yuri!!! on Ice instagram account while you're at it!",

            "content": "A blade touches the ice, gliding along, scratching the white, cold surface as it moves. The skater jumps in the air on one foot, spinning once, twice, and once more as they land on the opposite foot, landing a triple axel. The crowd cheers loudly as the skater\u2019s arms fly out in happiness. Whoa, let\u2019s rewind\u2026this is no 1991 competition. This is an anime about a simple Japanese 23-year-old male, trying to find who he is in this completive world of ice skating. Back up now\u2026or better yet, let\u2019s flash forward.\r\nNow forget about history for once, or the fact Olympics exists for now, because inthis anime it isn\u2019t even about that. \\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nStarting off solid with a competition, a norm in the sports anime currently, and as a sports anime, the breakdown of the plot should be simple enough. It\u2019s one word: competition, competition, completion. Yes, this anime is filled with men going at it in a better wardrobe than anyone, and with pretty much the same routine, over and over and over and over again. Getting bored yet? Good. That\u2019s what I like to hear! Keep spinning around just like they do in the anime when they finish they\u2019re routine. Oh man, I\u2019m getting dizzy. Let\u2019s move on. \\n\\n\r\nNow, now, it isn\u2019t just about the fact these guys can spin like ballerinas on ice better then ballerinas can on normal flooring. These guys are Olympic worthy, but that\u2019s not the point. The point is the coming to age story of the 23-year-old man returning home after college and a hard defeat in the skating world. He\u2019s just figuring him-self out! The 23-year-old is still young, and anyone can make mistakes, change their course, and twirl into a different direction. Through this, the atmosphere of the work is fantastic. My heart is leaping after each episode, reaching for more and more. I feel my fangirl coming alive. The comedy, oh lord, the comedy! I laughed after each hilarious moment! However, something is missing. Something big!! Something more I crave after each and every single episode. \\n\\n\r\nWhere is my drama?? Yes, drama! There was a need for so much more drama! This anime would\u2019ve been amazing if there was a touch of drama in the plotline more than there was. There was only positive outlook, and although the meaning of it was well reached, I did need that drama for balance\u2026 to be able to reach out for that positivity. How could there be positivity without dark dramatic inspiration? Things that should\u2019ve been shown were not shown at all. Competitive sports needs drama for it to flow, for it to move freely. There needed to be that negative backstory for a positive comeback to happen! There was limited drama in this, not enough to label it as the genre it deserved.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\t\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I\u2019m defeated. The art wasn\u2019t that bad. Perhaps I was too enhanced on how well designed these men\u2019s bodies were, but honestly, the flow of the animation was really well laid. The speed of when the character\u2019s routines were in play, I would\u2019ve thought there would be some mistakes, but it was pretty smooth. But not all can be sparkles and glitter. There were a few tweaks and bloopers that humans made, which is normal. No problems. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design\u2026okay, guys, I love this design. It was great! This is the design. Although, I would\u2019ve liked better designs surrounding a few characters since this anime featured many multicultural characters. I\u2019m not flailing my arms like a madwoman, but I do wish a few of the characters were tweaked. \\n\\n\r\nSounds: \t\\n\\n\r\nSo\u2026please rise for the opening sequence. Holy cheese on a stick! Can I get anymore hyped about this opening? I was legit dancing. The opening for this anime is fun, exciting, and enough to get you on your feet to dance to. In addition, it doesn\u2019t show boring slideshows, but a splatter of skating dance moves of all three main characters. Beautifully well done! \\n\\n\r\nFor voice acting, the Japanese is really well done even though each character is speaking Japanese regardless of their nation. But it would\u2019ve been fun to have each nation to have their own language when spoken to each other. I did have a listen to the English dubbed, and I would like to give some good kudos to the English voice actors for trying to corporate the accents their characters were from. Although spoken all in English, the accents were fine enough to listen too. \\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAh the characters. Let\u2019s start off with the youngest shall we? Yuri Plisetsky, a 15-year-old Russian who is trying to be older than he really is. He\u2019s supposed to be a main character, and we don\u2019t get much. Oh how I wish we could\u2019ve seen more of him. Honestly, there can be a whole spin-off made from him. There is hardly no backstory on him, no history on why he acts the way he acts (although harsh coaching and parenting when he was younger could be the answer). There is a soft side to the boy, which was nice to see for five minutes, which is seen from his grandfather briefly. He\u2019s extremely lacking\u2026however, he is a main character for a reason. He\u2019s the antagonist obviously\u2026duh! But that\u2019s not just it\u2026he is the youngest person in the show who is competing with guys twice his age. He\u2019s inspirational, harsh for the others competing, and proves that anyone at that age doesn\u2019t matter. Well rounded character overall, but needs to be completed. \\n\\n\r\nVictor Nikiforov\u2026ah\u2026this handsome fellow. Oh how I wish you were real. I need a Victor in my life. One that holds pom poms and cheers for me when I do exams\u2026actually, no that would be distracting\u2026and for all the wrong reasons. He is what puts comedy in this show. He\u2019s a positive outlook on competitive sports and has a spirit that puts motivational speakers to shame. He inspires people to do their best after he knows he might\u2019ve not done so himself. He doesn\u2019t have a selfish bone in his body! And that\u2019s the problem. He\u2019s a bit too perfect. Not only is he a bit too positive, hilarious, and handsome, but he has no backstory, no weakness. How can a guy like this not have a reason to be who he is? I want to know his inspiration. What? Or better yet, who does he look up to? Before he met Yuri! That is the question. In addition, he needs a weakness. There is a sort of secret that he\u2019s keeping. One that will add the drama to the story. Oh, how I will dream of the day! \\n\\n\r\nYuuri Katsuki, the main man of the story, the story it is based around, the 23-year-old man I was speaking about at the beginning of this review. Our protagonist is a normal Japanese man just trying to figure himself out. He goes back and forth between struggling to find himself, fighting depression, finding love and happiness, and going through a journey that changes his life. He has great character development, one that really fits this story well. He is the coming-to-age character we want to see in the anime. But there he needs to start acting his age and not act so awkward like a 15 year old teenager. \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters really match up towards completive spirit. Shout out to the Canadian character! Good to see that! But I would love to see a tougher performance and competition in the anime. It\u2019s no Olympic games, but I do need some action. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nSo I\u2019ve figured out I have this thing for sports anime that makes me watch them at a really fast pace regardless how good they are in terms of content. I watched this show in less than 12 hours\u2026yes, you heard me right folks! 12 hours! This show had some really good moments were I screamed like a fangirl, and moments where I sat staring at the screen wondering if I should wait a few days until the watching the next episode. I found myself captivated in the way these men moved; although anime, felt like I was watching real life skaters. And in occasion of the Pyeongyang 2018 Olympic Winter Games, I felt it was right to watch. \\n\r\nIn short, I was inspired. As a retired completive athlete, I enjoyed watching these characters go at it, sharing their \u201cshort\u201d story, trying to reach the top of the world. I felt the nostalgia of competing. Although not in the same sport, I know the same anxiety of going out there, being under pressure, and seeing the disappointing look in the coach\u2019s eyes. I get it all. \\n\\n\r\nWhich is maybe why I have such a connection to these types of show. \\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice is a whirlwind of excitement. It shows the themes of love, support, and inspiration while mentioning that it\u2019s okay to have fun at what you love to do regardless of the outcome. Passion comes first when dancing the night away on thin blades. It\u2019s a slippery road, but as long as the path is clear what the hell, right?  \\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 65% on the skating scale.\\n",

            "content": "I'm giving Yuri on ICE a 5 star.... I'm not making many friends with my opinions here...\r\nSo, why the 5 star? Well, simply, way too much time was devoted to side characters. Victor, Yurio and Yuri? NAH! LET'S BRING IN KING JJ!\r\nI'm sorry, but if you want to do a show with good, in depth side characters, take notes from Chobits, they did it correctly WITHOUT taking main focus off the main characters. \r\nThe only side character I found tolerable was Chris, and that's only because he had an orgasam everytime he skated, which, I found amusing.\r\nI feel this got way too overhyped JUST becausethere was implied yaoi/gay couple in the lead characters. Honestly, I don't think it was done well. They could have really made their relationship special and stand out, with the whole coach and student relationship, Yuri looking up to Viktor, and so on, but they just.... Didn't. I was disappointed, their relationship wasn't fleshed out and was put on the side just for the side characters who couldn't even get fleshed out!\\n\\n\r\nAlso, while not quite as bad as your Lie in April's piano playing sequences, the constant ice skating with internal monologues with little to no character interaction became rather dull after a while...\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a good story with interesting side characters? Chobits or Fruits Basket. You want a cute romance anime? Chobits, Your Lie in April, Clannad are all fine. You want a Yaoi anime? I haven't seen many, but I'm sure that Junjo Romantica is better than this mess. You want more ice skating? Can't help you there.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend to anyone who really likes ice skating, implied Yaoi, though have your remote handy to skip the ice skating, or just someone who wants this on in the background. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone seeking thick plotted anime, if you want that, check somewhere else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[EDIT] Because I was talking about this with some of my friends, and something was brought to my attention... Did Viktor and Yuuri even love each other?\\n\r\nTHANK YOU RUB TO BRINGING THIS TO MY ATTENTION\\n\\n\r\nStarting with Yuuri; He clearly highly admired Viktor to the point of idolization and internet stalking. He has many posters of Viktor, he copies one of his acts move for move, AND named a dog after him, clearly this boy has an obsession, or some amount of unhealthy fascination with this man. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I don't think unhealthy obsession translates into love. Admiring someone doesn't make you have a personal relationship with them to such a point to call it love. They were acquaintances at best before Viktor became Yuuri's coach.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for Viktor; He seemed to take interest in Yuuri, due to the aforementioned Ice Skate routine Yuuri copied, and took up being his coach, likely being impressed with Yuuri and finding him to have some amount of talent or skill, or maybe it was because Yuuri did his routine and that alone interested him. Then of course, Yuuri because Yuuri is a freak when he got drunk. Viktor saw this, and probably began lusting after Yuuri, and then yuuri asked Viktor to coach him.\\n\\n\r\nNow, maybe they fell in love while Viktor was coaching, but I don't know, they focused so much on side characters I actually don't know if it really got to true love, or if it was just the admiration and lust. Either way, it started out as a one sided admiration, and I'm assuming the other side was lust.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDue to my further thoughts, I'm bringing YoI's score down to a 4. this is again, just my opinion, and you're allowed to like and dislike what you please, these are just my opinions.",

            "content": "I have no qualms with saying this: Yuri on Ice was an enjoyable show. I reckon this will hold for you regardless of who you are, whether you're gay or straight, whether you love or hate sports anime, whether you're a casual anime watcher or a hardcore otaku.\r\nWhy did I find it enjoyable? It introduced me and millions of others to ice skating, a sport that we knew next to nothing about and made us fall in love with it, all the while featuring intriguing character relationships, action, comedy, romance and drama. \r\nThe main character of Yuri on Ice is one of the main reasonsI love the show. In most sports anime, we first meet the protagonist at the start of his story, about to embark on the long and perilous journey to the top. In Yuri on Ice, we first meet Yuuri as a seasoned professional who has had a lousy season and is seeking meaning in his life and the motivation to skate again. Then one day, a trio of hardcore skating otakus post a video of him skating like a boss and things snowball from there. Yuuri is not a very confident individual, but he hates to lose and his efforts to end his career on a high note make him relatable and immensely likeable. His relationship with Victor, the show's other protagonist, is a fascinating one. I can't reveal more for plot reasons, but it is one of the main driving forces of the narrative and gives the show flavour. \\n\\n\r\nThe other skaters are all interesting and their interactions with each other are fun to watch. Standouts include Yurio and JJ, the latter being intensely amusing and one of the most divisive characters on the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in the show is very good overall. I have not much experience in this area, but the colours are vibrant, and the skating scenes are either the best animated scenes in the show or the worst, often both during the same skate (LOL). The first episode had noticeably better animation than the rest (presumably to hook viewers in, which I'm glad it did). The animation is bound to improve in the Blu-ray releases, and has the potential to become outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is absolutely phenomenal. Each of the skaters has a distinct theme, and you're bound to find a favourite among the many many glorious songs you'll get to hear (I myself am partial to Chris's fabulous \"Intoxicated\", which has me unwittingly humming along every time I hear it. Other standouts include the main theme, \"Yuri on Ice\", and JJ and Georgi's Short Program themes).\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, it definitely does not start off in a conventional way but falls into a familiar pattern during later episodes. Some episodes had me raging because characters I liked didn't do well while others had me crying from happiness or feels (mostly the latter).\\n\\n\r\nSkating-wise, the show uses skating terminology freely and you sort of catch on after a while (I still can't tell any of the jumps apart though, LOL). The skates themselves are hit-or-miss, animation-wise, but they're incredibly realistic. The commentary is similar to what you hear in actual skating competitions. There's a lot of skating trivia sprinkled in here and there, and a few actual skating figures make appearances in the show itself! It's all very cool and you find yourself completely immersed in the skating scenes.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, there is a homosexual romance in the show, as you would probably have heard already, but it is tastefully done and never \"in your face\". It is not actually mentioned by any of the characters in the show, but you'd have to be blind AND delusional to not notice it. The reason the show's creators don't spell it out explicitly for the viewers is, in very simple terms, because doing so would change the show's genre from sports anime to yaoi, which would turn off a LOT of potential viewers who would then miss out on the gloriousness and gloriousity that is this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Yuri on Ice is a really impressive anime, breaking a lot of common tropes in the genres of sports anime and romance. I noticed a lot of reviews were bashing it for not representing gay characters fairly, but I thought they did a bang-up job, and this is coming from a straight dude. Just give it a shot. I was not expecting to like it, as I am uncomfortable watching shows which are openly gay (I'm sorry) but this show wasn't that at all! There were a few scenes which had me looking away for a bit for the intensity of the moments between the characters, but that was it. It is a fantastic anime, and one that I cannot recommend enough, if not for its well-done romance, then for all those other reasons I listed above :)",

            "content": "I have been watching anime for about a year now... an otaku friend of mine suggested that I watch it and I don't regret it one bit if you like anime that connects with you mentally and emotionally then this is one for i highly recommend.. Its not gonna make you cry like {clannad or angel beats} but this anime deserves some type of recognition. \r\nNO SPOILERS !!!\r\nSTORY ~ 10\r\nTo sum the story up... \r\n\" YURI ON ICE, focuses on a 23 year old gifted Japanese skater who has met his defeat in the final of a grand prix competition. Which forced Yuri toput his skating career on hiatus, still inspired by his idol victor Nikiforov, one day Yuri attempted to mimic victors routine in a ice skating rink, which he then was captured on video instantly becoming a internet sensation which caught the attention and interest's leading victor to be his coach thus helping him persevere with his dreams and aspirations...\\n\\n\r\n This anime has a lot of concepts attached to it, if you are not paying attention and actually interested in the anime then you can find that there are certain psychological concepts that are not covered deliberately for instance the fact that Yuri has anxiety which tends to affect him while on the ice skating rink. Victor being depressed etc....A lot of people have a problem with the gay undertones that are in this anime which for me are quite enjoyable if very soft and its not forced however a person can watch this anime how ever they choose but its not sexual at all. If that's what your looking for this anime is NOT A YAOI!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART ~ 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was so beautiful and pure that I had tears in my eyes, the art was very heart warming especially {Yuri and Yurio's} rehearsal's / solos were to die for, I looked forward to the opening and the closing as well the opening was just amazing and I say that very strongly because it was, I watched the opening like a hundred times on YouTube before actually watching the anime, the art to me was the most captivating thing that caught my attention.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND ~ 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe music was flawlessly done, I liked the different variety's that was chosen during each of the skaters performances. My favorite songs in this anime would be {Yuri on ice , History maker and You only Live Once} I even gone as far to downloading the songs onto my computer, they were just that good. I also loved the accents and the voice actors that portrayed the characters in this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER ~ 8\\n\\n\r\nI'm actually surprised that there was a ton of character development which was incorporated in this anime over a short-timespan, which also revolved around the fact that it was a competition was well done. The Character development between the main characters and the supporting character and character's that weren't really apart of the anime at specific time frames. Was just amazing, being able to have this many characters in a anime and have so much character development is so surreal. Each character brings a unique persona to the anime which is really interesting... even the egoistical character {JJ & Yurio) where intriguing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT ~ 10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime the different genres of music and each competitor having there own underlying issues that they overcame which is pretty amazing. I liked how the competitor's got together and had dinner before the finals was just so amazing. The different styles and art was just so captivating and just understanding this anime could actually be inscribed into real life events.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL ~ 9.5\\n\\n\r\nI LOVED THIS ANIME AND I ENJOYED EVERY MOMENT!!!!! ... \\n\r\nThe art the music the character's the gay undertones, I loved every single part of this anime and I really hope for a season 2, the ended was so beautiful and I will put this anime in my archives to rewatch... even the anime touched and moved me... \\n\\n\\n\r\nCAN WE ALL FANGIRL ABOUT THE DOOGY TISSUE BOX... I WAS FANGIRLING LIKE HELL!!!!!",

            "content": "Ok, I absolutely LOVED this show. It was beautiful. I don't really know what else to say so I'll jump into the categories...\r\nStory:\r\nInitially, I wasn't sure what to expect with this show. The beginning is dramatic, then the show turns to comedy and Yuri is sort of chubby and not confident and I was like...meh. Then Viktor comes in and he is just a gorgeous and hilarious personality. Yuri failed at the national competition a year prior, and somehow (heheheh) a video of him performing Viktor's routine from years prior is leaked on social media. Viktor sees it and decides he wants to coach Yurithrough the new season. From there, it is a joy to watch. There's humor in yaoi tropes, but when the characters are actually talking about love, they talk about it with mature voices. These two characters develop this relationship and it's strong and beautiful to watch. There's no homophobia, there's no gender, they just are who they are and I think that is another reason why this show was so good. This is a sports anime, yes, but it is also a love story. It's a love story between a man and his skating, his coach, and his want to grow as a human.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nA big fat 10/10. It was gorgeous to watch. As with Your Lie In April, the animation during the performances tell the story. The performances themselves were beautifully choreographed, and during some, we get flashbacks and dreamscapes that make them all the more vibrant. I couldn't look away. The characters themselves are beautiful to look at as well. Bravo animators.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I can't give it less than a big fat 10/10. The OP theme was PERFECT and was stuck in my head long after the last episode. I also enjoyed the ending theme. Very electro pop and went with the theme of following your dreams. They had some opera music in the performances which SCORE I loveeee opera, they had Beethoven, themes from Sleeping Beauty...you get the jist. All lovely to listen to. The show stopper here though, is the OST. The in-anime music during the performances were wonderful (though some aren't OST music), and the \"Yuri On Ice\" theme was nothing short of breathtaking. Even JJ's theme was good. I will be purchasing all of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the 12 episodes, we are slowly introduced to a variety of characters. The main three are Yuri, Yurio, and Viktor. Initially, I was leery about character development, but by episode 3, I was in love with all three characters. They all had depth and pain and life to them. Developing personalities in such a short span of episodes is hard to do, but even some of the latter characters were developed enough for me to care about them. I am hoping to delve in more next season with some though like Otabek and JJ. Otherwise, I was happy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis is an original anime. Most anime that aren't derived from manga (that I've seen) aren't all that good in my opinion. The story here is straightforward and the conflicts are resolved easily, but damnit if it isn't a joy to watch. Free! sort of paved the way for sports shows to come back into light, and I hope this one will open even more doors for them, as well as doors for lgbtq anime to become more mainstream. Everytime I watch competition anime, I am brought back to my competitive days and it's such a great nostalgic feeling. So maybe I'm biased, but I don't care. All I know is that I thought this was a really funny and joyful show to watch in between all of my super dramatic and death filled anime I usually watch. I can't wait for season 2.\\n\\n\r\n10/10. Watched subbed.",

            "content": "It's really not often that I give an anime a 10/10 rating, but I feel like Yuri!!! On Ice deserves it for everything it's done. This show gave me the sweet representation that I'd been craving ever since I found my love for figure skating (just kidding- I'm gay, though the figure skating is also cool.) Also, I would go into the whole queerbaiting debate but, at this point, those who still deny sweet Victuuri (get it??) are really stretching to the point where they could literally get married and people would say it was a 'friendship pact' or a 'promise between a coach andstudent'.\\n\\n\r\n(I'll be trying a new review style this time where I simply talk about the five most standout characteristics of the show, whether good or bad, so I hope you enjoy this!)\\n\\n\r\n1 - The characters\\n\\n\r\nCan we just take a moment to appreciate the diversity in this show? We have a Thai skater skating to a piece of music from a movie that showed him representation, a hispanic skater to represent the USA (instead of the stereotypical white guy), and a skater from Kazakhstan! Tell me, when was the last time you watched an anime with a character from Kazakhstan?\\n\\n\r\nAnd the best part about these characters?\\n\\n\r\nThey're all fleshed out. Most of the skaters (excluding the main three) only get two episodes to shine (while the finalists get four, it's still not much). But, it doesn't matter. I found myself learning about and supporting them anyway because, during their short screen time, they got more development than some characters do throughout their entire anime. Props to Kubo-sensei for managing it because writing strong minor characters can be pretty tough (I should know, I'm an author.)\\n\\n\r\n2 - The story\\n\\n\r\nOh boy. I've seen people complaining that we don't know anything about Viktor's backstory but, honestly? After episode ten I stopped caring: we know him well enough already. Yuri!!! On Ice (or yoi, as I will abbreviate to from now on) is one of the best uses of the unreliable narrator I've EVER SEEN. The show manages to take any confusions and preconceptions about the characters and smash them into little pieces with one, minute long sequence during the credits. A plot twist so good, I had to go back and rewatch the entire show with my new understanding.This is what good writing looks like, take notes, YA authors.\\n\\n\r\n3 - The music\\n\\n\r\nI'm not talking about the voice acting or the backing tracks here, no (those weren't stand-out, personally), I'm talking about the music the skaters skate to. At the beginning of the series, Viktor skates to 'Stammi Vicino', a song pleading a lover to never leave, while not having a lover to speak of- representing his unfulfillment. The track Yuri on Ice, represents Yuuri's entire journey as, not just a figure skater, but a person. The changes in the instruments and tune of the song can actually be aligned to events that happen LATER in the show. It's really quite clever. In yoi, music has about seven layers of meaning- and that's just the title of the piece.\\n\\n\r\n4 - The hype\\n\\n\r\nThis show is insanely hyped, I know, but there's good reason. I haven't ever contributed to an anime forum before unless if it was a subject I cared strongly about- with this show, I contributed just because. I felt like I was part of the community build around it- heck, I was one of the ones building the community. As someone who has a hard time enjoying things with even small problems (and not critically taking them apart) for this show, I managed to simply watch it for what it was. And I loved it. I loved it so much that when Wednesday comes and there's no new episode I might cry.\\n\\n\r\n5 - \"Viktuuri\" (a.k.a. look, mama, spoilers!!)\\n\\n\r\nHey, here's a radical idea, yoi is not 'shounen ai'or 'yaoi' just because it features a loving and respectful relationship between two male characters. Oh, wait, that's right; yaoi relationships are never respectful (or, heck, even loving.) This might be a bit of an unconventional comparison but let's think about Iron Man 3. It features a relationship between main characters through which they change and better themselves while also finding motivation in other aspects of their life. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's take a look at yoi: It features a relationship between main characters through which they change and better themselves while also finding motivation in other aspects of their life. \\n\\n\r\nWait, did I just type out the exact same summary? Yes, because the two relationships have the exact same effects on the characters and plot. And do we consider Iron Man 3 a romance? Hell no! (I'm also trying to remember if they kiss at all and I don't think they do so I guess we'll just say 'not canon' right? Because that's how it works, right??)\\n\\n\r\nThe Summary \\n\\n\r\n You don't have to like this show. You don't have to ship the main characters. You just have to respect that the people who do, feel that way, not because they are massive fujoshi watching another yaoi show, but because they connect with the characters and enjoy the plot and subject matter. \\n\\n\r\n(Because I can already tell that you're wondering: 'why didn't she mention the animation?' The reason, my pals, is that less than half of the skating sequences even come close to living up to the 'Stammi Vicino' sequence in the opening episode. Yes, I'm disappointed. No, I'm not surprised. That high standard was always going to be hard to maintain. It's not bad, though, just not noteworthy.)",

            "content": "[Long Review] Yuri!!! on Ice - Why You Shouldn't Judge It Like A Common Sports Anime\r\nLet's admit that 2016 isn't the best year for anime and Fall 2016 isn't the best season of the year. And then, out of left field, came Yuri!!! On Ice.\r\n\"The project was finally green-lit around the time of the Sochi Olympics (2014), when public interest in figure skating was running high.\" - Kubo sensei's interview with PASH! PLUS in October 2016\r\nYuri!!! On Ice (YOI) is an original sports anime (with no original manga/novel to base on) dedicated to figure skating and of course, the relationship between Victor and Yuuri. Assomeone who had a little bit of knowledge about figure skating before YOI, I had my fair share of apprehension and skepticism before watching. However, if you're looking for rants about how YOI is \"over-hyped\" and \"unrealistic\" and \"disastrous\", this is not the place. I am unabashedly full of praise for this anime series - which took two years to make - that has rekindled the joy of anime watching in me. With a solid story line and fulfilling characters, YOI truly deserves to be called one of the bests of 2016.\\n\\n\r\n*MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD*\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, we need to recognize some differences competitive figure skating has as a sport as compared to most sports anime (e.g. Yowamushi Pedal, KnB, Haikyuu etc)\\n\\n\r\n1) It is an individual sport.\\n\\n\r\nCompetitive figure skating, to be specific, Men Singles, is a single man sport that only one best skater can take the title of the World's No. 1. This means that there will be no \"team bonding\", \"team play\" and \"team fun\" that producers always laid on thickly to establish characters and progress plots. Men figure skating is all about competitions after competitions, consecutive practice sessions and adjustments/improvements to programs that are repeated throughout an entire competitive season (lasting a year). It is a very lonely sport on the ice where you constantly pit yourself against yourself, as well as you against your competitors.\\n\\n\r\n2) Skills, confidence and the friendship between competitors. \\n\\n\r\nQuoting J.J in the final episode, \"Given the current totals, I might just be able to claw my way onto the podium if the others mess up, but still...me? Win out of sheer luck? That's not like me at all!\"\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, competitors often share very close relationships with each other in real life (just look at the quad battles and ice shows and banquet dance battles XD), since most likely you'll see the same handful of athletes again and again competitions after competitions (chuckles). Competitive figure skating is of course about gunning for the gold, but they also turn to each other for guidance because ultimately, its more about perfecting your OWN program, about how to land another quad cleanly in competition, and less of tearing down the immediate \"enemy\" right in front of you. This is very aptly reflected in YOI through the relationship between Yuuri K. and Yuri P, where Yuuri asked for Yuri's help in his quad and Yuri complied, though he may lose the competition if Yuuri did land the quad. Same goes for Minami cheering for his skating buddies (despite competing in the same competition), where similar camaraderie is reflected in multiple friendships, as between Victor and Chris, Yuri and Mila, Leo and Guang Hong, and of course Yuuri and Phichit. More often than not, competitors are often rink mates (think Yuzu and Javi) whom they have stuck through tough times and straightened out heartbreaks together. They may be skating on the ice alone, but lasting friendships are definitely forged on and off the ice. \\n\\n\r\n3) The explanation of technicalities (or the lack thereof) and the role of coaches\\n\\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia, \"The Salchow is normally approached from a forward outside 3-turn on the left foot for a counterclockwise jump. On the left back inside edge after the 3-turn, the skater checks the rotation momentarily with the right foot extended behind and then initiates the jump by swinging the right leg forward and around with a wide, scooping motion. The rotational momentum for the jump is gained by the swinging movement of the free leg and the coordination of the free leg and arms at the point of takeoff.\"\\n\\n\r\nUnderstand the above paragraph? Not really? Adding on with the knowledge that skating blades has two blades commonly referred to as the inner and outer edge? Still no? My point exactly.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main complaints I hear from most people saying that YOI has failed as a sports anime is that they did not explain technicalities, like what axels, loops, lutzs, salchows and flips are. The thing to keep in mind is that YOI is not your common sports anime - these are adult men competing on a professional level for the top spot in figure skating, this is a career, not a beginners after school sports club where you'll have introductory lessons on how to skate circles on the ice. Click on any figure skating commentary on youtube - be it Eurosport, CBC, NBC, Universal HD or individual skating analysts - and that's exactly what they'll say. When they see a biellmann spin, they'll comment \"Biellmann Spin\", if its a quad toe, they say \"Quad Toe\" and maybe add on a little about the entrances and exits and whether if the rotations were enough or short. Besides, YOI did touch on important technicalities that we do need to know about, such as the GPF and the point system, although they came across as info dumps in earlier episodes just so to get them out of the way and focus on later competitions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I don't think that whether or not you know how an axel is landed affects the story very much, as the programs often speaks for itself. Surely most can recognize  at least an Ina Bauer by now : D\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of my chest, lets start with the proper anime review : )\\n\\n\\n\r\n*MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD* \\n\\n\r\nStory - 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nYOI starts off with Japanese figure skater Katsuki Yuuri, who at the start of the season, busted his chances at the podium with an error-filled Free Skate and is seriously contemplating about retiring. Defeated, he retreats to his hometown Hasetsu, where his underpopulated but extremely supportive townspeople welcome him home to onsens (hot springs) and katsudons (pork cutlet bowls). There, he skates to his five peat champion/idol's program \"Stay Close to Me\". To his utmost surprise (and horror), this leads to a viral video and the said idol, Victor Nikiforov, to his doorstep and announcing that he'll be his coach for the upcoming competitive season.From there, they meet with different competitive skaters from different backgrounds, who compete for different reasons, but all for the same goal - the ultimate top spot in the world of competitive figure skating. \\n\\n\r\n1) \"Who told?!\" - The Impressive Homework Done \\n\\n\r\nYou know that good work has been done when not one, not two, but a staggering seven real life figure skaters expressed their love and appreciation for the show, and that's only those who've made it known publicly. Evgenia Medvedeva (huge Victuuri shipper XD ), two-time Grand Prix Final champion, received official art from Kubo sensei and figures of YOI after her recent skate in Russia Nationals; Johnny Weir (salutations to the blue rose crown, the feathered costume and the slight reference to his ex-husband Victor Voronov), filled his twitter with YOI updates; Kazakhstani figure skater Denis Ten, who often exchanged YOI tweets with Evgenia, coincidentally rides a black bike;  not to mention Nobunari Oda and St\u00e9phane Lambiel, whose voices made cameos in YOI episodes 10, 11 and 12. Even Evgeni Plushenko, whose achievements so impressive that could drop anyone's jaw once they skimm throgh the first paragraph of his wiki, posted a Japanese tweet on his Facebook page directing readers to Yuri!!! on Ice's Crunchyroll page.\\n\\n\r\n\"There have been many strange moments watching a fictionalized version of our world, so much so that I\u2019ve had times when I say to myself, \u201cWho told!?\u201d  There are so many secrets in in the show that only skaters or people very close to them, would know about. Sometimes a character will remind me of a dirty little secret that even hardcore skating fans don\u2019t know about, and while it may not be completely played out in the show, the pink elephant has entered the room.\" - Johnny Weir interview in December 2016\\n\\n\r\nIt is obvious that the creators had really done their homework over the past two years which all in all culminates into this 12 episode anime ultimately names as Yuri!!! On Ice. It took a very simple story line, painstakingly and lovingly, gave it bones, flesh and skin, and finally a breath of life, and sent it to the October screens as an anime to make history.\\n\\n\\n\r\n2) Victor and Yuuri - Friends or Lovers?\\n\\n\r\nYOI Fandom Before Episode 10:\\n\r\n\"Something round and golden.\"\\n\r\nIS IT A RING? Or is it a medal? I mean, I really hope that its a ring, but I guess, I guess, its probably, ehnn, probably a medal... \\n\\n\r\nYOI Fandom After Episode 10:\\n\r\nWHY DID I BELIEVE IN THE MEDAL INSTEAD OF LOVE\\n\\n\\n\r\nFrom start till end, YOI challenges our norms and things we take for granted, where they put forth questions that we would never have thought twice about:\\n\\n\r\n- Why should there be a yaoi tag when we don't demand the same from anime depicting hetero relationships?\\n\r\n- Why are people so hung up about a clear indication of \"relationship status confirmation\" between two men when the couple has already 1)been staying together for about a year, 2)confessed in front of national TV, 3)hugged and cuddled all the time, 4)kissed (as confirmed by the official team), 5)proposed, 6)exchanged engagement rings in a country that recognizes gay marriage and 7) pair-skated in an exhibition event of the Grand Prix Finals, and when their sheer closeness and intimacy clearly says it all?\\n\\n\r\nLove need no words when it is in the air.\\n\\n\r\nAnd about the issue of how real life gay relationships are definitely not this smooth sailing:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cRegardless of how people in the real world feel about this work, inside the world of this show, there will be absolutely no discrimination toward the things one loves. I will absolutely protect this world.\u201d - Kubo sensei on twitter\\n\\n\r\nBless you, Kubo sensei.\\n\\n\r\n2) Who are you skating for?\\n\\n\r\nAll six skaters want the gold medal. But they do not just skate for the medal.\\n\\n\r\nThrough their programs, we hear their inner thoughts. For Yuuri, its almost always about Victor. Victor would like that, Victor would do this, Victor this and Victor that. This is actually one of the parts which make YOI very realistic. When the person you've looked up to all life suddenly came over to your home country and offered to coach you, that would be the most possible reaction from anyone. Of course you'd want to impress him, not to mention that he'd become your fiance in the near future. Competitive skating is very consuming and extremely draining, and as a professional athlete, it is already a given that you're going for the gold of course. The difference is the motivation behind your skating, and for whom you are skating for. Yuri P. skates his Free program thinking about his grandfather, so much so that he fumbles when he's not around; Phichit skates for his home country, to be the first Thai skater to make the Grand Prix Finals and hold an ice show in Thailand; Otabek skate to do his home country proud and to realize his dream and ideals by jumping quads, quads and quads. Yuuri skate to Victor and to his own almost-ending skating career. If he didn't want the gold he wouldn't have made that bold statement \"I'll prove it with a gold medal!\" during the press conference. To draw an inappropriate parallel, I apologize in advance, there are hardly any voices against Michele skating for Sara even though Sara is all he thinks about in all of his skates...\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation - 9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI must give credit to the key animators of YOI because the animation in YOI, albeit imperfect, was on point. There is just something about how the human body moves when they skate - the twirls and the jumps and the landings that all happen under 0.7 seconds - that is impossible to replicate in the limited amount of frames a 13 episode anime season has (It is painfully obvious when you compare it side by side with, as per say, Yuzu's 2016 Gala/Exhibition after the Worlds Championships, my favorite of all time). YOI went all the way out to choreograph all music and programs from scratch, and boy did they deliver splendidly. I am not going to deny that there are parts that needs polishing (please, if you're gonna stop in the middle of a less-than-a-second spin/jump/sequence, of course everything will look poorly animated, duh!), but the aesthetics are pleasant to the eye and some scenes are just straight up beautiful. A lot of attention are paid to the background, especially in episode 10 when they go around sightseeing in Barcelona - just straight out of a postcard. Scenes are believable and wonderfully animated, which pulls up the overall for me to give a 9.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nSountracks are memorable and meaningful, and this is what a lot of anime are lacking these days. Songs like \"Still Alive\", \"Theme of King J.J\" and \"History Maker\" roll right off my tongue, Phichit's \"Shall We Skate\" invigorates the soul and \"Tales of a Sleeping Prince\" never fails to remind me of Georgi's desperate plea for Anya. \"Stammi Vicino\" and \"Serenade for Two\" were on my playlist for a while, and of course, \"Yuri on Ice\", my favorite piece out of all programs. That piece is pure storytelling with music itself.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\\n\r\nPhichit himself deserves a 10/10 XD Full marks for our Captain!<3 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is slow but steady, ever evolving while keeping close check to the story line. It is established that Victor and Yuuri were conversing in English, as Kubo sensei said, since Yuri studied in Detroit for 5 years apparently he's very fluent in English : D Overall, Yuuri and Victor has the best development, although I feel that Victor has grown more than Yuuri as a character. In the case of Yuuri, its more about a discovery than a development of character - he has a heart of glass, but the inner strength within is remarkable. We just had to take a couple of episodes to find it and let it shine. Yuuri is, in my opinion, a very surprising person. He seems like the plain-est person in YOI but turns out to take the most surprising actions all the time.  Victor, on the other hand, matures into a better coach over the season, as well as a better lover. We also gain insights to Yuri P. and feels greatly for his desire to succeed and how hard he presses himself to improve, improve and improve. One may be put off by his attitude, but it is undeniable that his spirit is admirable and is indeed a good kid at heart. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just about the anime - its about the fandom, the author-watchers' interaction and everything else. YOI has, by far, the most supportive and friendly fandom I've found myself in. It's been a roller-coaster of emotions. I feel like I've been spoilt by Kubo sensei. Kubo sensei really takes the effort to engage the audience at a very personal level and that is really sweet. She is really the best sensei ever. \\n\\n\r\nI arrived looking for an anime about figure skating. YOI gave me professionally-made programs and songs, complicated step sequences, extensive training sessions, back-to-back competitions, improvements and adjustments, confidence shattering and self discovery.\\n\\n\r\nI arrived looking for an anime with friendship and love. YOI gave me the best best best friend ever (Phichit), everyone's son ever (Yuri P.), most emotional skater ever (Georgi), for-some-reason-everyone-is fascinated-with-him-although-he-rarely-speaks Seung Gil, cutest skater ever \"Jiayou\" Guang Hong, and the best song ever J.J and Leo. And of course the OTP that actually became canon, we were born to ship Victuuri :\"D\\n\\n\r\nI had simple expectations for YOI.\\n\\n\r\nI left them at the door and YOI blew my mind.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSidenotes:\\n\r\nThe only dampener I've experienced in YOI is that someone apparently changed Yuzu's wiki from Yuzuru Hanyu to Katsuki Yuri, although it was taken down ASAP when it was known. That was really disrespectful and unfortunately sparked off a war between fandoms, where Yuzu and YOI fans were hurling insults at each other for a time. To be honest, both were at fault. As a part of both fandoms, its really saddening to see that unfold but I'm just glad that this is finally behind us.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who had seen Yuzu skate before could tell that Yuzu is definitely not the reference for Yuuri. In fact, I was reminded of Yuzu when I saw Victor and Yuri P. skate, being the technical beasts they were XD My first comment to my sister even before this whole spectacle, back in October when I first started YOI, was that \"This Yuuri is not Yuzu right?\" \"More like Victor is\" was my sister's reply. That should speak volumes. Maybe Tatsuki or Takahashi, more Tatsuki if we just talk about the background settings (Ballet dancer on ice, confidence issues, messed up FS to place 6th in Grand Prix Finals etc). And J.J definitely reminded me of Javi this GPF 2016/2017, I just can't get it out of my mind. Definitely looking forward to his comeback in the 2017/2018 season, my younger sis is a huge fan of him : D\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something different, for some proper romance with focus on the sport itself, do try out Yuri!!! On Ice! It has been a very thrilling ride and I'll definitely miss the squeezes and clawing and breathlessness in my heart when waiting for a new episode every week. Bless you guys who can marathon it in a single sitting now, so jealous but so happy its unexplainable. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Why should you watch Yuri!!! on Ice?  \r\nIt's a sports anime for people who generally Don't Get sports anime.  Ice skating is a combination of art, performance, as well as technical ability, it's not a sport based off of teamwork and cooperation. It's like, Extreme Ballet to put it in layman terms.  If you love ballet and dance, then I think you will love the premise. Every character has a theme for their routines and each song is chosen to express how they feel.  The anime will repeat performances but every time a character performs the same routine, how they feelwill affect their overall achievement. There is an artistic beauty to ice skating which I personally find more interesting than the power of friendship securing victory over a rival sports team.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason to watch the show is how refreshingly modern it is. For one thing, even though the MC is Japanese, the rest of the cast is international, and not even in a conventional way. The American ice skater is Mexican American, there's skaters from Thailand, Italy, Korea, Russia, Kazakhastan, China, & even Czech. The obnoxious arrogant ice skater is Canadian. The MC is Japanese, but his coach/love interest is Russian.  Another thing is the brilliant use of technology and social media.  Yes this is a sports anime, but the cast all have smartphones, and they all post photos and status updates to various media websites. The show also pokes fun at social media fan gossip, which is common in the world of competitive ice skating. This is what the 2016 looks like right now, and its lovely to see it represented in the show.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people are interested in this show because of the gay romance between Yuri (the MC) and Victor (his coach). This is a very subtle romance, and their relationship isn't just romantic, its more complex than that. Victor is Yuuri's coach, and Yuuri is Victor's muse. Their love for each other is tangled in between the two. I'd say that while their eventual romance is very important to the development of the story, its not going to be satisfying if that's the only reason you're watching it.  They are both professional ice skaters, so their relationship, naturally, revolves and grows around that. And because of that, the romance between the two of them is told through the story of ice skating and their performances, not through declarations of love. When push comes to shove, this is a sports story which has romance in it, not the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I want to say that the finale is kind of rushed, and that is why I give this series a 9/10 and not a 10/10. The finale basically throws in a twist to set up for season 2. At the time I am writing this review, the actual date for season 2 hasn't been announced, but please keep this in mind.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the finale, the show is very entertaining and full of love, and it does a wonderful job at displaying all kinds of love, from Yuuri & Victor's romance, to the love of ice skating that binds everyone else together. It's a passion project I haven't seen in a long, long time, and for that reason I think you'll like it too!",

            "content": "This review is spoiler free, so please enjoy.\r\nThe sports anime 'Yuuri!!! on Ice' is a new addition to the plethora of sports anime out there. At the time of airing it's extremely popular with both those in the anime community and 'beginners' in anime. Here's my take on it.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nIn my eyes, most sports anime story lines come off as generic, to say the least. And I'm saying that as a person who really likes the genre. With YOI, however, I saw something a little bit different, though it follows the same basic outline as other sports shows. In short, it's Yuuri's journey to tryand win some sort of national ice skating competition coached by Victor who Yuuri has been a complete fanboy of for ages. I like how it's very relevant and most of the people who watch it can relate to Yuuri. Not only is the show funny and at some times quite bizarre it can be very serious at times. The pacing of the show is not bad, though I think I'd like to see more of Yuuri's practice sessions. The story's pretty solid overall, though it's the other elements of the show that make it really shine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the art in the show, for the most part. Firstly, the opening theme art was beautiful. It was cinematic, subtle and fit the mood of the whole show which I thought was done very well. Art in the show was above average for sure - there was detail in all the right places and I didn't have any problems with  it. The only real art problem, as I'm sure many are aware, was the actual skating animation(ironic, it being a skating anime)which had some under done parts. The skating tended to be quite choppy which could have been fixed possibly with a bigger budget. However, it's bearable, so don't let that put you off the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in the show is on the whole great. It always fits the moment and is well chosen for the genre it's based on. It's very uplifting and compliments any scene it's put in. The theme music for each skater fitted their personalities. I didn't like some of the skating tracks, but that's overshadowed by the sheer brilliance of the other ones. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThough some of the characters were quite unforgettable, some really shone. There's quite a cast since there's lots of people skating and it seemed like the show wanted you to remember everyone, which of course was impossible. However, they delivered well on lots of aspects in characters, mainly the main characters Yuuri and Victor. Of course, extremely memorable characters, well designed, likeable personalities, etc. What I found quite interesting was the LGBT route tackled in the show. I'm extremely glad that the show does not lose touch of the fact that it is a sports anime. It'd be very easy to leave all the ice skating behind and turn this whole show into a giant yaoi fest, but gladly it does not(though I do enjoy a bit of yaoi now and again). It's very interesting and is one of the reasons I actually picked up the show, though I won't say too much so you can enjoy it yourself. But yes, lots of diversity and memorable people there for you to enjoy whose characters are quite well developed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOh, how I loved Wednesdays. I'd sit in my chair, counting down till Crunchyroll posted that fateful episode. Though the show had little flaws, and wasn't my favourite show in the universe, it was certainly exciting, keeping me entertained every week and giving me lots to talk about with those who had seen it. I really did enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI could overlook the flaws in this show just because it was great. It showcased well the comedy, drama and romance that comes with ice skating competitively and infatuated me in something that I may have not been interested in before. Well done, Yuuri!!! on Ice.",

            "content": "It's strikingly obvious how the reviewers giving this more than 8 are all fangirls into yaoi.\r\nYuri on Ice(or rather Yaoi on Fire) isn't crap by any standards, but seriously, the flood of 9s and 10s for a show that just isn't impressive past the first one or two episodes is unsettling.\r\nIn short:\r\nStory: 4 :\r\nA gay romance between an ice skating coach and his trainee. Lots of skating competitions and the romance gets deeper in a super straightforward way.\r\nArt: 5 : I find the animation to be sorely lacking in ice skating scenes, which to their credit is very very hard to do dynamically\r\nSound: 5 :No comment on the music since it's always in the background of the commentary, but from what I could hear it doesn't fly high\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 : A very solid and interesting lead, a fantasy man, some rivals in love and a whole lot of other pointless characters. But the lead drew me in by himself so deeply that I felt like finishing the entire anime, so high mark.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 : The competitions tend to drag due to poor animation and uninteresting rivals, and the rest is mostly nice. It's mainly Yuri though, I want to see his story end.\\n\r\nOverall: 7 : A very well done schlock romance at the start that devolves into a well done schlock romance after the first two-three episodes. I certainly enjoyed watching it but it's by no means amazing.\\n\\n\r\nIn long, let's just compile a short list of qualities:\\n\\n\r\n-It's a novel subject, I never paid attention to ice skating before this\\n\r\n-It's got a very well developped protagonist in the first episodes\\n\r\n-It's generally well made and has characters and tropes you just don't see often in anime\\n\\n\r\nPast these few, I don't think YOI offers much or anything else.\\n\\n\r\nI expected a lot of gay entering this and it was way worse than I thought. And when I say worse, I mean two men putting twin rings on their 4th fingers in a church worse. No it's not a manner of speaking. It happens.\\n\\n\r\nDid the gay bother me? Not beyond anything more than a laugh, honestly. Despite this being obviously written by a gay male, or at the very least a female very much into yaoi, it never got overbearing to a breaking point. I shielded my eyes from some \"crying on shoulder\" scenes and some kiss/loving hugs a few times, but it really never bothered me, else I'd just have quit.\\n\\n\r\nWhat bothers me with YOI is that there is very little PAST the gay romance.\\n\\n\r\nIt all started quite well frankly, with a novel protagonist that was pretty well written and lots of elements that felt new or just well made. It was another lonely hero that's on the lowest part of the ladder, with everyone despising him or ignoring him, but he wasn't acting like a Naruto about it. He was crying in the bathroom like a bitch. He also was 23, and had most of his skating career behind him. And it wasn't a pretty sight.\\n\\n\r\nI liked that. I liked the idea of showing a completely earnest protagonist who also happened to be in a bad spot, lacking confidence, not being a brat or some over-optimistic kid. It was just a dude down on his luck crying because he got kicked in the face by life and his own mistakes. It got me interested.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the interesting spin on main characters, the writing was quite solid and I felt that YOI was going to take me for my favorite kind of ride, the kind where I slowly like the people I'm watching more and more till I just can't help but become a complete fanboy and scream internally that I want them to win.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that feeling went away quite quickly.\\n\\n\r\nYOI just cannot keep its plot and characters interesting past the gay romance. And in case you think the romance is enough, well, I'll have to say that no. Yuri himself is well portrayed yes, but I didn't find Victor to be anything else than a half-schlocky crap romance novel hero, the kind who's just here to be the author's wonderboy. He's not awful or anything, but if Yuri's interesting as a person, Victor is only there as a fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nWorse than that, past the first two episodes where Yuri's personality is well built and deepened, there are no new characters that really come in to pile on and build a powerful cast. You just have Yuri, who's sort of done by then and doesn't give much more till the end of the anime, Victor is just a fantasy, the other Yuri is just a rival, and none of the side characters are all that fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just a typical fangirl yaoi romance. I'll even be a little mean and say that it was probably written by one of these high-selling romance authors who just write 50 shades of grey-tier schlock.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ice skating, I seriously think that the animation just doesn't click. In the first episodes I was stunned that while I was shown something that was supposed to be beautiful, it was clear that technically, it was lacking. Yuri often ended up too deep in the background after a jump, making it look like he jumped 5 meters away from the camera. It took me out of the majesty of ice skating reaaaaaaally fast. It got better with later episodes, but to be blunt, I think you'd need a crazy amount of technical talent and effort to portray it perfectly. I just didn't feel for what I was watching because of all the animation impurities.\\n\\n\r\nBut instead of just complaining, here's my take on how to fix YOI:\\n\r\n-Make victor a lot less shit. He's such a blatant fantasy man that I can't even care about his story with Yuri, at all. Make him more human, and more than that develop how he became so talented and what his story was. You can't show me Yuri and Russian Yuri and all the others suffering through months of effort and then show me Victor doing it all seemingly effortlessly and expect me to buy this guy.\\n\\n\r\n-Deepen the other characters and give them stories too. Apart from the annoying Canadian at the end, I don't think anyone in this show has an actual story and goals apart from winning the Final. Time spent on the Italian siscon guy is wasted IMO, since I don't know him, her, and don't care about them. Either develop them properly, either don't waste time on them at all. They build-ish something with Russian Yuri, but it comes around episode 9 and he's stuck in the rut of the \"rival in love\" for far too long.\\n\\n\r\n-If they wanna focus equally on romance and ice skating, fine. But then do it like Horimiya, which had the intelligence of building the two leads, then very slowly building two, three more couples along. It's a great mix to put competition and love together, but if all they have is one couple, then the competition rivals just end up being jobbers. And nobody cares about a competition of one or two guys and ten jobbers.",

            "content": "As anyone who follows anime on a seasonal basis will know, Yuri!!! on Ice (often shortened to YOI, as I will in this review) quickly became a huge hit and sensation, with some even claiming it was going to be the Anime of the Year. Admittedly, it wasn't one of the series I initially picked up when the Fall 2016 season began since I already had a sports anime in my queue (Haikyuu!! S3), but when I dropped one series that failed to pique my interest and caught up with everything else I was watching, I decided to give YOI a shot to see whatall the hype was about.\\n\\n\r\nNot gonna lie, I was hooked after watching the first couple of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nYuri!!! on Ice is the story of 23-year-old Yuri Katsuki, a professional skater who has failed to win competitions over and over again and is on the verge of retiring. Then, in drops Viktor Nikiforov, the current star and living legend in men's figure skating, as well as Yuri's idol. Viktor, having his attention caught by a video of Yuri copying one of his programs flawlessly, offers to coach Yuri in his last season of professional skating, promising to get him gold in the Grand Prix Final.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story seems pretty cut and dry, it's actually a rather fresh take at the sports genre. Most sports-focused anime start with the underdog, someone new to the sport, showing their struggle to the top. In contrast, Yuri is actually considered Japan's best male figure skater and one of the best in the world overall. He has the talent and the work ethic, but his critical weakness is his lack of confidence. Added to that, at the age of 23 going on 24, he isn't as young and spry as many of the other top competitors he must face, and as a result, is facing the prospect of retiring without having achieved anything of note in his career. To any young adult, this is a huge weight. So, while Yuri is still something of an underdog, we as the audience know better - he's a world class athlete in his sport, so he skates with other athletes in the same level of competition.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, the maturity of the characters shown in this series is a breath of fresh air. Of course, younger characters like Yuri Plisetsky act like a bratty kid and some of the older characters will act goofy for comedic effect, but for the most part, the characters act their ages. They are competing on national and world stages, spend hours upon hours practicing and training, and must have the mental strength to deal with the immense pressure that comes with high-level competitions. When they lose, they are disappointed and crushed, as expected, but are still gracious enough to thank their supporters and wish their fellow competitors luck.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of maturity, let's move on to the elephant in the room: the same-sex relationship between Viktor and Yuri. One of the more interesting aspects of this anime is how normal their relationship feels. No one makes a huge deal out of the fact that they're two men who love each other. Their families and friends are supportive. And best of all, Viktor and Yuri have a healthy relationship. Sure, there's the occasional misunderstanding or points where they have their doubts, but in terms of relationship drama, it's far less than most other romance anime out there. When one says something that unintentionally hurts the other, they talk about it, learn more about each other, and move on. Again, it's just a nice breath of fresh air.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the anime falls short is all the other characters besides Yuri and Viktor. YOI is unfortunately only a one-cour series, even though it would have done much better as a two-cour. YOI boasts a huge supporting cast, mostly due to the sheer number of other competitors that Yuri skates against. This is inevitable given the nature of competitive figure skating. However, the writers tried to squeeze in in-depth characterizations in addition to showing all the skating routines, and then this is multiplied by the three (yes, three) official competitions shown in this 12-episode series. This means that a character is often introduced in one episode, gets a quick explanation of who they are and why they're skating, and then if they don't move on to the next level, we never see them again (at least, not in a meaningful way).\\n\\n\r\nIt almost begs the question: what was the point of dedicating so much time to them, then? I would have much rather the writers focus on a select few characters to develop them further than try to develop some twenty but only at a surface level. Character development feels rushed, and the writers often just tell the audience about them rather than show, which just feels contrived and forced. Having YOI be a two-cour anime would have definitely helped in this regard, though, which is a shame. A lot of the supporting cast are genuinely interesting, but a lack of screen time really hurts them in the grand scheme of things (and by extension, hurts the development of the main cast, as well, since the show takes time away from them to develop side characters that barely affect the narrative).\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the animation. The first three-ish episodes of YOI were a feast for the eyes with skating routines being shown with exquisite attention to detail and the skaters' movements smooth and flowing, just like a real figure skater's. After that, it becomes painfully clear that MAPPA had reached its limit and could not continue that level of animation for the entirety of the series. Skating routines became clunky and choppy, with more moments of characters looking off-model. As with characterization, I then have to wonder why they didn't just pick and choose more carefully which skating routines to animate? By the time the series was three-quarters over, it was starting to feel tiring to watch a bunch of skating routines back-to-back, especially when the animation wasn't as fluid and the characters barely make any impact on the story or the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, I have to give credit where credit is due. Animation is time-consuming and difficult. There's a reason why slice-of-life anime series are so common - they require relatively little animation (and thus, time and budget) compared to the intense animation sequences found in action or sports anime. Animating figure skating - and numerous instances of figure skating, at that - was an ambitious project to take on, and considering what they were working with, MAPPA did well overall. A lot of attention to detail was put into knowing their jumps and spins and animating them appropriately. Geographic locations are also spot-on in how they were drawn. The opening credits backgrounds change as the series progresses. Personally, as a Canadian, I got a kick out of seeing the upside-down Canadian Tire logo on J.J.'s jacket (as well as the fact that they pronounce his last name, Leroy, correctly). The studio clearly put a lot of work and passion into this series.\\n\\n\r\nAnother feather in MAPPA's cap in this series is the soundtrack. The soundtrack is fantastic, featuring a variety of different genres to reflect each character's preferences and personalities. The OP is an uplifting pop song entitled \"History Maker\", which is about, well, making history - Yuri's goal to take gold at the Grand Prix before he retires. The ED, \"You Only Live Once\", is a catchy electro-pop song that had me playing it on repeat for a few days, and perfectly captures the feeling Yuri has about his desire to accomplish something before he retires, as well as enjoying the time he has with Viktor. Scattered between these are the numerous songs the characters dance to - from Yuri's sultry \"On Love: Eros\" theme to Yurio's soft, angelic \"On Love: Agape\" to Phichit's bombastic musical number, \"Shall We Skate?\" You are bound to find at least a couple of likeable tracks.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, YOI is a highly enjoyable anime and popular for a very good reason. I really do wish it had gotten a second cour to further flesh out its huge cast of characters, but considering its subject material and the fact that it's an anime original series, I imagine it would have been difficult for the studio to get funding for two whole cour without proving it could be successful first. In that case, I wish the writers had chosen more carefully what to spend time and animation budget on more wisely. Even despite these flaws, the series still feels compelling and fun, as well as groundbreaking in more ways than one. If you're looking for a feel-good sports anime and don't mind two normal male characters loving each other, then I'd highly recommend Yuri!!! on Ice.",

Well enough for someone who only cared about one of those to still enjoy it. It certainly doesn't reveal any deeper humane philosophical purposes but contains enough mental stimulation to certainly rise above any other Sports anime. This is a Sports anime for people who don't like Sports anime.\r\nThe character design is very appealing. They also develop somewhat realistically. We can see Yuri's journey from despair to confidence, from emanating a pork cutlet bowl, to wanting to be attractive to Viktor. There are certainly however many unrealistic momentsin the character's behaviour.\\n\\n\r\nGraphics and animation quality is generally relatively high, albeit flawed. Russian Yuri's skating is animated terribly despite being apart of the main cast. There are also a few issues such as colour switches in the jackets between frames.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is is nice, especially the opening. It would have been nice to have Yuri maybe skate to one more different song.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall enjoyment and entertainment value is this anime's strong point. It gave what we wanted and didn't get from other sports anime like Haikyuu and Free to keep the fujoshi watching. (I really wanted one more kiss though!!)\\n\\n\r\nLet's hope it doesn't pull an AoT, and we get our second season soon!",

Too much movement and they were done smoothly.\r\n+ Avoided a school based setting and took the world stage. This is rare in anime.\r\n+ ........that's it?\r\nCons :\r\n- Too many fangirl service.\r\n- Charecters were not well developed. There wasn't a single charecterthat makes you wish : \"I want to be like him!\"\\n\r\n- The relationship between the coach & player could be a good point they could work on, but they blew it away.\\n\r\n- The storyline was way too predictable. There was no shocking result.\\n\r\n- They used the same fixed songs which got boring in the end. They even danced the same way, well of course if it's the same song the base will always stay the same. But at least you would expect something new in the final, unfortunately there is none.\\n\r\n- The main dish of a sport anime is struggle. We would want to see a relatable charecter who grows up in front of our eyes. Yuri was not such a charecter. The only problem he had that he lacked confidence. Still did the coach actually did something about that? No. He was the role-model of yuri, victor staying by his side was enough for him. Yuri ended up consoling his own coach. I won't call that coaching, victor was just an inspirational charecter to yuri.\\n\r\n- No showcasing of sportsmanship, no real details about the figure skating world was given.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, if you are wishing to watch this anime to see figure skating only then don't watch it. Watch real life pro figure skating if you have never watched before. You will be stunned. Only reason to like this anime is figure skating itself is a beautiful sport.",

Hand movement, legs, everything that I as a not-obsessed-fan-person know about figure skating. \r\nSecond were the people in the anime. At first you have the annoying person Yuri Plisetsky but you learn to deal with all of themand there are far more annoying people in the world. As for Yuri Katsuki and Victor, I can't imagine two better people to be the main characters of this show. The student and the teacher and the story around them is funny, yet emotional to watch. \\n\\n\r\nTogether with the music, the tension of the matches this show was very enjoyable and thus highly recommendable. It doesn't matter if you are a boy or a girl, it's a sports anime. Maybe girls like it better but I would still suggest it to my male friends who are open minded enough to start new things, so why not. \\n\\n\r\nI was very glad to see that the ending of episode twelve said: See you Next Level. Because this anime deserves a second season and I'm very interested to see what will happen next and if there will be more development in the characters. For they already showed so much.

            "content": "So I have so much to say about this show that, to keep from rambling, I'm going to organize my thoughts into different sections. I'll try not to be too spoilery, for those who haven't seen it because this show needs to be seen.\r\nStory: \r\nFirst of all, I came into this show knowing NOTHING about competitive figure skating. But the amount of detail and passion the creator, director, and staff had for the sport was very apparent to the point where I got very interested in learning more about the sport itself while watching the show. That was something that surprised me about the show;how invested it could get me into a sport I'd known nothing about. The story of the competition was well paced and I love that you could never tell how each competitor was going to place. Yuuri Katsuki wasn't guaranteed first or second or third JUST because he was the main character and I liked that the show didn't resort to cliches. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the romance in the show, I LOVED how it was handled. I'm usually very picky about romance in anime. I usually check out of it if the romance is TOO sugary-sweet or filled with too much unnecessary drama. Yuri on Ice didn't have that. I got to enjoy a simple romance between two characters who clearly cared about each other and there was little drama about it. I know a lot of people went crazy over the fact that the romance was between two men, but as someone who doesn't care about making a big deal out of orientations (hey, if you love someone, you love someone), I was glad the show didn't make a big deal out of that too. Again, it wasn't super cliched and made me very invested in seeing them happy in the end, which doesn't happen often for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved that the story was well-written in both major aspects of the show, I liked how it handled its various themes throughout the show and didn't leave plot threads dangling at the end. I liked that I could go back to the beginning of the show and watch the first few episodes after episode 10 and find that certain lines held a completely different meaning the second time around, because that shows layers in the writing. Anything I can go back and analyse, I appreciate a little more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: After watching Terror in Resonance two years ago and then hearing that MAPPA was doing Yuri on Ice, I was interested in seeing how the art/animation would be for this show. I was not disappointed. I can admit that there were a few sup-par frames from time to time and a few frames were reused, but the show overall looked very beautiful.  The ice skating scenes, especially, were choreographed and animated quite well (good job Kenji Miyamoto and the animation staff at MAPPA) and I loved that the skating scenes were animated slightly differently so you could actually tell if a skater was getting tired or was panicking or feeling down and the performances didn't look stale. But outside of that, I loved how the characters were drawn. What really struck me was how easily you could read expressions on faces. It was always very clear how a character was feeling, even if they weren't speaking and that level of detail impressed me. I also loved that, with each episode, the opening animation had a little bit more color added to it. That was a nice extra touch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Now, I love music so, even if I wasn't going to enjoy the show, I knew from the beginning that I would watch it JUST FOR THAT OPENING THEME. It was so inspiring and so powerful that I immediately downloaded (and later bought) it to listen to over and over. The rest of the music in the show was also great. Each piece that each skater had to perform to had its own energy to it and matched each character perfectly, either to them directly or to the theme they were trying to convey, and I never felt like skipping any performance. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: In sports anime, I think its really easy to fall back on cliched characters so you know who to root for and who to boo at. Yuri on Ice, again, doesn't do that. It speaks volumes to me when the final six skaters go into the Grand Prix Final and I cannot genuinely cannot tell you a single character that I think deserves the gold medal over the others. Each character has their own unique motivations and personalities and flaws that make them endearing. There was only one character I disliked AND EVEN THEN, I could see how other people would like seeing a character like him and, by the end of the show, I came to at least respect him. That speaks volumes to the writing of the show, again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well I'm still riding on the high of the finale, but I'd definitely make this my show of 2016. It was going to be Mob Psycho 100, but I've changed my mind for all the reasons above. I loved watching the skating and getting invested in each performance at every step of the competition. I loved fawning over Yuri and Victor's relationship as it developed in every episode. I laughed at all the character interactions. I cried at the ending. Yeah, I loved this show and I'd definitely recommend it!",

Like other sports anime or anime that deal with competitions, there will always be moments where it's too intense, & were the reason why I wouldn't watch it again. But Yuri!!! on Ice was perfect, & I will rewatch this again sometime.\r\nArt- The animators try their best during the ice skating, & we do see the animation develop. It's not the best, but it continues to grow. The animation for the opening and ending is amazing, & there's beautiful scenery.\r\nSound- God, the soundtrack is amazing. Infact I'm listening to it right now. The music used during the skates are perfect, my favorite being Yuuri's free skate music, Yuri on Ice. \\n\r\nCharacter - There's many likeable & developed characters here. The most developed characters have got to be Yuri & Yuuri. ive adopted so many children dear lord. they hot as fuck too mm boii.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - SIGN ME UP FOR VICTUURI MMM BOIII \\n\r\nVictuuri - c'mon, we can't leave it out. Yuuri & Victor's relationship is just...perfect. Kubo-sensei is a amazing person for creating this natural & realistic relstionship. This isn't meant for fujoshis, nor is it a yaoi anime. It's a ice skating anime with a natural relationship between two guys. Victor & Yuuri's love for each other is just a blessing.\\n\r\n/Season 2 Please!/",

            "content": "Yuri!!! on Ice is a beautiful display a passionate and heart, arguably one of the best animes of this season. It displays love and affection on a level above physical expression showing the viewer that love is complicated and love is open to all. Have it be passion towards any form of self-expression or a person. You may or may not see the two main characters as having a budding Romance that's okay, but you cannot deny they have an intimate and deep relationship. The end of episode 12 you will see you at this whole show is about following passions and not giving up(in less of a Naruto corny way if you will). In the end, I have a feeling it's truly about finding love in every form, in Yurio\u2019s case, he must find his \u2018agape\u2019 love by interacting with others. One of the clearest cases Yurio finding his \u2018agape\u2019 is with Otabek, is finally able to find someone you connect with on a deep seeded level. As for Yuri, he must find a healthy mix of \u2018agape\u2019 and \u2018eros\u2019 love, this we see in Viktor. Now let's wrap this up, Yuri!!! On Ice is full of heart-warming characters each with real struggles and flaws. Making them a beautiful mash of Humanity and passion, something I think you should get the try.",

Theanimation is nothing special and quite frankly the ice skating while pretty at times did not serve as a principle point of enjoyment. Perhaps this show was never for me, as I dislike sports anime as a whole on principle but that can't stop me from pointing out it didn't deserve half the awards it received on the Crunchyroll anime of the Year awards.",

Sure there were some squealing parts but really nothing special.\r\nArt: 3\r\nok. Have you seen the animation? The ice skating is choppy, the legs get longer, their entire body gets stretched, and it is not pretty. Literally the worst art in the anime was the skating part,TALK ABOUT IRONY.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nBoth the openings and endings were good, and the yuri on ice ost was pretty well done... just JJ and like some other skater songs were just (._.???).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nI don't know how to rank these guys... Yuri is depressing, Yurio is like the ass of the whole thing. and  Victor is, lets just say an angel. Definitely some good interactions going on but not really worth a 10, maybe 7 at most.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nThe plot of the whole thing is kinda loose and stuff, the interactions were good, but the thing that gave this a 3 was the holy crappy art.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nI'm sure there are many better sports animes you have watched before, aka :haikyuu, knb, yowapedal, days, etc. And honestly I HAVE 0 IDEA WHY PEOPLE LIKE  THIS SO MUCH? I mean i get the Yaoi idea (not against), but like even the above mentioned sports animes had better interactions, i would reward haikyuu for winning that, at least the friendship bonding idea. But anyway, I would not recommend you watch this anime, I mean if you are gonna watch it, just watch for the music and really the lovey dovey scenes, other than that, this anime is kinda crap.",

            "content": "I finished this anime a while ago when the final episode aired. It took me awhile to have the courage and write a review to one of the animes that I love the most! \r\nOverall Yuri!!! on Ice took took me by surprise due to the relationship development as well as character development. The show introduced a underconfident ice skate who is indeed one of the top figure skaters in Japan and who admires one of the top figure skaters in the world (Viktor Nikiforov!). As the story progresses, Yuuri learns to be confident in himself as well as his skill while Viktor supports andbelieves in him all the way. \\n\\n\r\nI totally started shipping Viktor and Yuuri since episode 3 probably and thought this show was like most sports anime where the creators tease the fans with fangirling moments of the two. I think by episode 5 or 6, I started thinking wait, they might actually be dating each other and I was totally convinced by episode 7 for sure! \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the show, I decided that this is one of my all time favorites since it helped me realize that believing in yourself and relying on others helps you see your true potential and you then can strive for your best while using your skills to your own advantage. Also, developing close relationships with other people is important in not only team sports, but in individual ones such as figure skating singles as well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I rated this show a 10, it may be a very biased 10, but I believe this show deserved it since it took a lot of effort to even create a show like this as well as presenting a relationship as beautiful as Viktor's and Yuuri's. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 9\\n\r\nThe art of the backgrounds and characters were super amazingly drawn. The only reason why I gave it a 9 is because for anime, there is always room for improvement and everything cannot be perfect such as the animation for the skating routines, but I do understand it is difficult to create movement through art. I think most of the frames through each episode looked beautiful and I always found myself taking screenshots all the time haha.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10\\n\r\nThe music and sound overall was beautiful!!! I loved the music for each skating routine as well as the opening and ending songs. I found myself everyday and even now listening to these tracks all day and all night. I loved the instrumentals, especially the piano such as the one in Yuuri on Ice. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 10 \\n\r\nThe characters in this show are very unique and interesting as well as everyone having their own kind of special personality. No skater in the show had very similar personalities and everyone was different in a good way which got the watchers interested in every new character. I absolutely loved the character development as well as the show being from Yuuri's point of view most of the time. Also, every skater's thoughts were reflected and heard through their skating too which I liked so viewers could connect more easily with all the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\r\nI totally enjoyed every single second of this show two or three times since I always find myself rewatching each episode and noticing new things every time! Every week while the show was airing, I couldn't wait for my Yuuri!!! on Ice Wednesdays! I always went on tumblr straight after and started reblogging all kinds of post on Yuuri!!! on Ice. \\n\\n\r\nI do recommend it to people who love heartwarming sports anime such as this one and being someone who is not very open to showing their thoughts to others, this show helped me be a little more realiant on others as well as having confidence in myself!",

To my absolute surprise, I was hooked by episode one, spam refreshing for updates by episode two, and dreading when the plot would go downhill. I mean, when's the last time an anime started off strong and didn't run into issues (pacing, predictable plot, bizarre/wtf)? \r\nWell I'm glad I was proven wrong. The plot kept me on my toes, the animation was amazing (minor inconsistency), the original soundtrack was beautiful, and the characters brought so much life, fun and drama. I think people canreally relate to the main character Yuuri. He is awkward, hard-working and finding his way in life through his love of ice skating. And yes, the boys love component was definitely a bonus. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, there are an overwhelming number of haters. So, stay away if fanservice for girls is just not for you. Stay away if you can't stand boys love. Stay away if the boys love is the only reason you're watching, cause this is not actually yaoi on ice. Also, be cautious if you're looking for a mainstream sports anime. There are hints of the slice of life genre and feels, plenty of feels.\\n\\n\r\nNow that this season is over, I'm dreading the proposed second season. The plot must get boring at some point, and a part of me will shrivel up inside until the next masterpiece comes along. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I reviewing this anime assuming it is meaning to be emotional and have hints of shounen-ai.\r\n\u25cf Story \u25cf\r\nYuri On Ice has a simple plot line. Yuri, a male figure skater, is down on his luck and returns home. This is where the simple story line turns into it\u2019s own unique adventure. Similar to many modern stories, Yuri goes viral with his routine in which his old friend\u2019s children uploaded to a video site. He meets Viktor after her takes notice of Yuri\u2019s perfected performance.\r\nIt\u2019s similar to when people would go viral and get a contract, well that happened here as well.\r\nViktor ditches his own careerto coach Yuri to Yuri\u2019s surprise. With hard work and effort, he manages to get back on his feet.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the rest of the story, there are many ups and downs. Yuri goes through very emotional moments when the pressure of the competition begins to weigh on him and it is very humbling.\\n\\n\r\nThe story may make one feel nervous of the outcomes of the characters\u2019 performance and leave you on the edge of your seat wishing them the best as they go out to the ice.\\n\\n\r\nI personally got nervous whenever they were making a jump, but when the successfully did I cried out for joy. I was really rooting for them.\\n\\n\r\n\u25cf Art \u25cf\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is nice. The animation has nice line work and coloring, especially in the scenes of downtime (when they aren\u2019t skating). The skating animation is very awkward, but it is very hard to animate the programs of consecutive 2-3 minutes scenes with animation deadlines of course. I assume they will fix some of the more awkward frames up before the DVD release.\\n\\n\r\n\u25cf Sound \u25cf\\n\\n\r\nYuri On Ice\u2019s soundtrack is very good. The sounds vary from character to characters. Surprisingly, the majority of the sounds are in English. As you would expect in an international competition, all of the characters have different tastes in music and performances. The opening \u201cHistory Maker\u201d begins the triumphantly and really gets your heart racing for the beginning. The other tracks are rather spam-mable. Personally, I can\u2019t get enough of \u201cShall We Skate?\u201d, \u201cStill Alive\u201d and \u201cIntoxicated\u201d.\\n\\n\r\n\u25cf Characters \u25cf\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are different. I could not really define most of them into a single archetype.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about the characters is that they are not very over powered, and everything doesn\u2019t go they\u2019re way.\\n\\n\r\nThe author could have easily made Yuri land all of his jumps and step sequences, and even compete against Viktor to win gold at the Grand Prix Final. The same goes for every other character. The characters who have an even better game plan and land all of their jumps could suddenly be on a losing slope, and dark horses emerge.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u25cf Enjoyment \u25cf\\n\\n\r\nI love Yuri on Ice. It was a lovely adventure to follow all of the characters as they chased their dreams, whether they succeeded or failed. It was also very lovely to follow the relationship(?) of Yuri and Viktor. It gives the anime a lot of shounen-ai vibes. I am personally a fan of the shounen-ai and yaoi genre (as well as yuri), so the scenes with them made my inner fangirl burst out. Even so, I will not let that affect my review.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t like a bit of shounen-ai, then you might be a bit uncomfortable when it is presented.\\n\r\nAnd if you don\u2019t like sports anime, then how did you get here?\\n\\n\r\n- plumapplejuice\\n",

            "content": "[OUTDATED OPINIONS]\r\nI know nothing about skating and this anime gives me no inside to skating. Half the time I have no idea what's going on. The competitions seem to come out of no where and really feel out place when they come on. The skating scenes look ugly half the time and good the rest. I can't tell what's a good skater and what's a bad one, they are all just the same. Instead of using the sport as an advantage in the story it's just kinda left to the way side for the gay. It seems so out of place for a sports animewith half of the cast giving being in love with skating and the other half not even knowing what skating is. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the cast their one of the best parts of the show. Each as a striking personality that you can understand easily. Yuri's shy and is lacking self confidence, Victor is his caring elder who is more than he seems, Yurio is the blonde tsundere who who can become the show's cinnamon roll at will. The supporting cast are well established as well with the gayest character, Chis and hilarious actions of Gerogi. All the characters do grow as the story continues. Becoming slightly more complex characters but they never lose the simple joy of watching all of them interact.\\n\\n\r\nI will be referring to Yuri on Ice as a shounen-ai because it really is that. The\\n\r\nrelationship between Yuri and Victor is like a perfect relationship. Yuri is quick to fall in love withVictor and give his life for him which shows how much a child is and how mature Victor is. It makes the relationship feel less grounded in reality like a perfect yaoi fantasy.  \\n\\n\r\nBut still I can't help but smile at it but that might just be from the gorgeous character designs and fantastic facial expressions. Each boy in the show is feminine and fills my inner desire for very girly men. Sometimes they did take the femininity too far and made the men not men. Which might sound sexist but when you make a character you have think about everything that includes gender but when you throw aside such an important part of a person it seems lazy. If the intent was to make the characters graceful or more appealing to a female audience it fails that too as the characters are divided between two genders that the show's established and it makes them seem very very undefined and boring. Much like abstract art.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the gender stuff let's talk about the animation and music. The animation ranges from great to bad. Sometimes the characters move so freely and cartoonishly it's blast to watch compared to the static and jarring movements which make me want to puke. The music itself is nice. Well not my cup of tea I enjoyed it quite a lot. It was hard to tract down but what I did find was mostly piano pieces that were romantic and tragic. For the songs of skaters they all matched to the skaters simple personalities so they're not very interesting. My favorite track was On Love Agape which captured Yurio's beauty and later built into his personality as he became more calm overtime.  \\n\\n\r\nStill it being a nice show to look at defiantly isn't worth a watch for anyone who hasn't seen better. If you want a better sports anime that uses it's sport to support it's characters and doesn't drag them down, Haikyuu has it characters be defined by their love for volleyball or Ookiku Furikabutte which has baseball for the character to grow from. If you want a some boy on boy action Doukyuusei is much more sweet and Love Stage is much more sexual and trashy. And for some manga Aitsu no Daihonmei is funnier and more romantic and No.6 has a plot along side a decent romance. What if you just want beautifully animated men? Kuroshitsuji does a lot more with it's beautiful men and Free has more beautiful and sexy feminine men. If you want just ice skating Ginban Kaleidoscope and Sugar Princess are about that subject but I can't recommend them because I haven't seen them. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want beautiful men ice skating watch this, but that's not my style.",

            "content": "Okay, I have to admit that YOI was a bit of a guilty pleasure that grew on me. And the show isn't perfect, neither does it pretend to be - but some of the negativity here is pretty appalling. \r\nFirst of all, the story. I actually enjoyed it \u2013\u00a0everything from the pacing to the writing in my opinion was quite good, and beat a lot of sports animes (or romance animes, if we're going to count YOI as one). Sure, I would have liked better development, but when a show only has 12 episodes, some corners have to be cut. I adored the fact thatYOI had so many settings and that some of the moments were paralleled again and again. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good when it wants to be. There's no such thing as an anime with amazing frames all around. The art will improve with the DVD release; but due to budget limits, of course some of the skating frames are gonna suck. It's natural and it happens in all anime (including stuff like SNK and OPM which are apparently a gift from the animation gods, according to most people). \\n\\n\r\nThe music is very good. History Maker is my jam, but most of the skating songs were memorable and fun to hear. I loved Yuri on Ice, both of Phichit's songs, and even King JJ. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters were stereotypes, but they were less of stereotypes than they would have been in other anime and you know it. Japanese people are quite racist when it comes to anime production (case in point: Durarara, Black Butler etc.), so this amount of positive representation was great. Yes, Yuuri is all over the place - but that's how anxiety works, people!\\n\\n\r\nI loved this show, I waited for every single episode with trepidation, and I really want a second season.",

            "content": "Six or so episodes into this anime, it felt like I'd finally found it: a sports anime that was more than just queer-bait, something that was well directed with good pacing, and avoided worn tropes of sports anime (something about a start-up high school club that's just trying to make it in the big leagues), and also with well-developed characters. Unfortunately, however, in the end, Yuri on Ice proved itself to be somewhat of a disappointment.\r\nFor the first four or five episodes, we get the set up to a somewhat not believable but highly engaging plot. Professional figure skater Yuri Katsuki has just had adisappointing failure at the Grand Prix finals in figure skating do to his inability to handle anxiety under pressure. However, during the off-season, a video leaked of him perfectly skating a routine the legendary Viktor Nikiorov had broken records with the previous season. Viktor comes all the way from Russia to meet Yuri, and in the process upsets his home-country protege, also named Yuri (Plisetsky). Yuri (usually called Yurio in the anime) travels all the way to Japan too and him and our main character Japanese Yuri compete to have Viktor as their coach by skating to sets that oppose their personalities choreographed by Viktor himself. I won't spoil what happens in this, but this was far and away the best part of the series. We had fluidity between the artform of skating and character development, we got to know a relatively few amount of characters but they were thoroughly well developed. \\n\\n\r\nThe only somewhat disappointing part of these first few episodes were what appeared at first to be simple queer-baiting for comedy, however it very quickly turns out to be more than this as several hints (some subtle, some not so much, but I'll avoid spoiling) develop for an actually meaningful relationship between Viktor and Yuri. Fortunately, this never becomes the main focus on the anime and is normalized as a background development rather than used as a gimmick to attract a target audience, which earns it some marks, although at times it got awkward trying to balance this part of Viktor and Yuri's plot with everything else going on at the end (more on that later). Though at the end of the day it got awkwardly shoehorned in, Yuri and Viktor's developing relationship early on was one of the highlights of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, this is sounding like a good review. But along comes episodes six and seven, and now some of Yuri on Ice's flaws come to the forefront. We begin to follow Yuri, Yuri-o, and Viktor through the core of the competitive figure skating season. In these episodes (and throughout the series, but especially here), the beauty of the show's stellar animation comes to life as we see wonderfully directed scenes of all the skaters doing their routines. Unfortunately, this is all we see--with the exception of one episode--for the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, it becomes clear that trying to fit this much into 12 episodes was too ambitious. We meet too many characters too quickly who are all extremely under-developed, their entire backstories are just told with voice-overed thoughts while they skate in competitive matches. Most are not developed at all, and if they try to make them dynamic (such as the favorite to win the gold, a bombastic skater from Canada named JJ begins to get nervous), they do so in a contrived, rushed fashion. The development of our main characters becomes almost a distraction from just trying to fit as many somewhat monotonous, albeit beautifully animated, skating performances that are overly dramatized with characters just spoon-feeding their emotions to the viewer into each episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe few moments that we aren't just watching figure skating performances with over-acted dramatic voice-overs and flashbacks, we're seeing somewhat contrived drama in Yuri and Viktor's relationship where they'll randomly threaten to leave each other for no good reason that are immediately resolved for no good reason. By episode 9, the last three episodes have blurred together as they were all nearly identical; Yuri starts out crying, him and Viktor have a little pep-talk/hugging and crying session, all the skaters do performances where they try to dramatize some portion of their backstory with voice-overs and flashbacks while they're doing their performance, we see the skaters get their scores and react, the episode ends. Episode ten is a welcome break from this formula, but it unfortunately gets full of randomly rushing Yuri and Viktor's relationship at a much faster pace than is at all believable and ill-fated attempts at humor to humanize the other characters who, up until this point, we have no reason to sympathize with at all. Most of them we've only spent five minutes with watching them skate up until this point, and I realize at this point with some amount of disappointment that there are only two episodes, and I'm probably never going to have a chance to give a damn about any of these characters except for Yuri and Viktor, whose entire development has been so sidelined and rushed to cram everyone else in that I'm beginning to not care about them either.\\n\\n\r\nBut maybe, I think, this can redeem itself in the next two episodes. And, nope, the last two episodes are virtually indistinguishable from the 6-9, except now it's the final so all the characters can act a little bit more dramatic. By the end, it just kind of feels monotonous and hollow.\\n\\n\r\nIn sum we have a well-set up plot with a handful of good characters in the first few episodes marred by obnoxiously faced pacing halfway through the series and sidelined by a bunch of half-baked characters whose entire subplots are spoon-fed in an overused, rushed, formulaic fashion, with only contrived drama and bad humor to break the monotony. But not all is lost, though the skating routines got very repetitious halfway through, they were gorgeously animated with an amazing attention to detail, and certainly those who enjoy figure skating will appreciate the amount of effort that went into depicting their sport. Some of the cinematography and camera angles that went into directing these scenes is gorgeous and innovated, even though they're overused and worn by episode 9. The first few episodes were, if a bit overbearing with the humor, still really good and the way Yurio, Yuri, and Viktor interact in those episodes is some fine character development. Further, the character designs (purely in terms of animation) are top knotch, among the best I've ever seen (if only they had some substance behind the pretty faces). The soundtrack is, also, for the most part really good, with a healthy mixture of emotional original tracks, peppy pop music, and great classical music for the skater's performances, as well as decent background music that matches the era of the transition scenes. But the fact that I'm thinking of anything that isn't a performance, where the characters are actually supposed to interact and develop as a \"transition scene\" is evidence of how rush and monotonous this anime got at the end.\\n\\n\r\nStill, if you're going to go for a sports anime, at least this tries to step out of the cliched tropes of queer-baiting with bishounen high schoolers. Further, it earns some points for developing a gay relationship that wasn't the somewhat insulting and abusive shounen-ai variety, or just hinting at it to bait the fujoshi (ahem, Free!), and consequently, I'd recommend it over most of the close substitutes in its genre. Perhaps if they had tried to do what this did in 25 episodes it could've been salvaged.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10",

            "content": "Yuri!!! on Ice is one of the best sports anime in recent years. It managed to have an engaging story with interesting characters, good animation and great music. I came for the cute guys ice skating and stayed for the story and characters.\r\nThe concept is nothing new, it's about a sport tournament with behind the scenes drama just like any other sports anime. However, the take on it is what makes it stand out. First of all, it is NOT set in highschool (WHAT A TWIST!) which makes it feel a bit more mature. The main character is a professional trying to restore his damagedcareer, not just a highschool student in a sports club. His struggles as a professional and his relationships with his friends and rivals is what drives the story, rather than just a motivation to \"win for the senpais\" that would graduate next year (like in almost any other sports anime). Also, since this anime is not about a team sport, the creators had a lot of room to bring out individual characters to drive the story rather than teams of characters. I think choosing figure skating was a smart choice because it's an unpredictable sport. You always have a chance to redeem yourself after an off performance, but an off performance can also kill your winning streak and destroy your season. You can never tell who would win or lose until the very last moment, which added a lot of suspense to each and every performance.\\n\r\nBut sports anime are not just about sports! There is also drama, fights and friendship! But in Yuri!!! on Ice there is more than that. In addition to having executed the friendship and rivalry drama much better than most, it was also able to incorporate romance in the story! Usually sports anime avoid that territory since the other elements take up too much of the story and since there are usually not enough female characters, but this didn't stop this anime from creating a romance between two guys (that is not a bromance and did not involve a love triangle, surprisingly). Overall, the story was a very refreshing take on a genre I personally thought was done to death long ago and I love it.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, this anime did a great job as well. Since figure skating is a single's sport, there was no need to create a lot of one dimensional characters just so there would be enough characters to form several teams. For that reason, careful attention was given to each character and all characters (both main and supporting characters) had depth to them. they all had different motivations, different personalities and not a single character was bland or boring. There were little to no tropes and it felt really nice to watch a sports anime with interesting unique characters (which became quite uncommon recently).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good, but people have been giving it more credit than is should have got. Yes, the designs were awesome, the character animation during the skating scenes was very good and the direction by Sayo Yamamoto was great. But the animation was also quite inconsistent at times, the characters didn't always fit the background of the scene (the 2D backgrounds looked too much like paintings sometimes, the CGI backgrounds were okay), and they reused a lot of the animations. Also, during the skating scenes (with few exceptions) each frames were given significantly less attention and a lot of the animations that did not involve skating weren't very impressive on their own. the animation was very good, but not outstanding like some people were led to believe.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack deserves a 10/10 for sheer diversity alone! The soundtrack has alot of high quality tracks in different genres ranging from classical to boogie to electronic and more. Some of the tracks are homages to famous pieces of music, like \"shall we skate\" (a musical theater inspired song) referencing \"shall we dance\" from the king and I (the skater's outfit even resembles that of the king) , or Allegro Appassinato in B minor being heavily inspired by Tchaikovsky's first piano concerto in B flat minor (3rd movement). I think the main reason the series was able to achieve this is because there were two composers working on the soundtrack, and they both did an amazing job. It's honestly the first time I considered to by a soundtrack for an anime once it comes out.\\n\r\nThe voice actors also did a pretty decent job portraying their characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the series isn't perfect. A lot of characters were pushed aside and were undeveloped and almost forgoten about, there are some problems in the animation and if you're not used to same sex relationships in anime, the interaction between Yuuri and Viktor would feel weird and just make you uncomfortable sometimes. But there's a second season coming (probably), so those things might still be fixed. It is one of the best sports anime I've had the pleasure of watching and I highly reccomend it!",

            "content": "\u201cYou have to do the opposite of what people expect. How else will you surprise them? That\u2019s my motto.\u201d  - Victor Nikiforov, Yuri on ICE!!!\r\nIf there is one thing this show did well, it was surprise me.  I came into this show expecting to see a cool sports anime about figure skating. I got so much more out of it than that. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThis story starts out simply: a Japanese figure skater, Yuri, screws up big time at the most important competition of his life.  He feels like a total loser. And cries in a bathroom stall. Which is something we\u2019ve alldone, just admit it.  He goes home, defeated, and wonders if he should retire from skating.\\n\r\nBut everything changes when his idol, the Russian skating genius/handsome bachelor shows announced in his family hot spring, and announces that he is going to take the season off just to coach Yuri. (He makes this shocking announcement butt-ass naked, by the way. Never change, anime.)\\n\r\nFrom there, the show progresses quickly.  Yuri trains and goes to competition. He slowly gains self- confidence. And the relationship between Yuri and Victor grows.\\n\\n\r\n**MINOR SPOILER***\\n\\n\r\nYep. They\u2019re gay.\\n\\n\r\nThis might come as a turn-off to you.  I didn\u2019t start this show to watch a gay relationship. But I wanted to see the skating, so I kept watching. And I ended up really liking their relationship, even more than I liked the skating. This show treats their romance like most other shows treat heterosexual romances: completely normally.  They don\u2019t make it into a big deal. Yuri and Victor aren\u2019t an obnoxious couple. Many tropes shown in other shounen-ai anime, like very explicit scenes and borderline abuse, are not present in Yuri on Ice. This show depicts the healthiest, most accurate depiction of a gay relationship I\u2019ve ever seen in anime.  And by the end, I was cheering their relationship on 1000%.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the show's conclusion was rushed, which was why I ended up rating Story an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the art is good. The characters are designed really well. My biggest issue with the art is that it is very inconsistent during the most important parts of the show: the skating competitions. One episode might show Yuri skating his short program with beautiful art. Another might show the same program with choppy, art that is clearly not as good. It didn\u2019t hinder the show as a whole, but it would have been nice to see some consistent high quality art.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are amazing.  This show relies heavily upon music, since the skaters compete with songs.  This is very well done. The lyrics are spot-on, and the music sounds great. I especially loved the music for Yuri\u2019s short program and his free skate. They sum up the feeling of the show very well, and I never once got tired of hearing them. Yes. I downloaded them.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYuri, the main character, is someone I could easily relate to. He has a clear goal, but he lacks self-confidence. When he failed, he felt like he let down everyone who supported him or cheered him on.  He\u2019s the best skater in Japan, and he still feels inadequate. Despite his low self-esteem, Yuri isn\u2019t whiny and annoying. He doesn\u2019t blame others for his problems, and he works hard to achieve his goal.  He isn\u2019t perfect. He\u2019s believable, and that what makes a show like this good. His relationship with Victor really changes him for the better, which is really great to see.\\n\\n\r\nYuri\u2019s rival, a younger Russian skater (who is coincidentally also named Yuri) is also a really interesting character. He\u2019s practically the opposite of Yuri: brimming with confidence, conceited, and rude. Despite having much less screen time, his character develops almost as much as the other Yuri, and the differences between these two characters make their individual traits shine.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters in this show are what make it so special. From the Canadian skater JJ, who is the most confident, (dare I say arrogant?) skater, who literally calls himself King JJ, to the adorable, hamster-loving Thai skater Pichit, who is a pure little cinnamon roll, this show makes its supporting cast shine.  There\u2019s a skater who can\u2019t get over his ex-girlfriend, a veteran skater who has competed alongside Victor for years, and a strong-and-silent type skater with a soft side. They aren\u2019t cardboard cutouts. These characters all have realistic ambitions and mannerisms, and that makes them really fun to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show absolutely exceeded my expectations. If, like Victor, this show\u2019s goal was to surprise the audience, then it absolutely succeeded.  \\n",

I wish that other people would look past the relationships, even though that's something that I absolutely love and think was well done without it being too in your face. The story is one that I think a lot of people can relate to, feeling like a failure and finding someone or something that pushes you to be your best. The art and the sound are incredibly captivating. The characters are relatable and rather down to earth for the world of ice skating and the stereotypes that are generally tied to theworld of competitive figure skating. This is definitely a show I would recommend to anyone who just wants to smile and feel good about the world. I'm not gonna lie, I was slightly offput when I first heard about it, but now it's in my top 5. Not to mention how amazing the opening and closing are. There isn't a day that I don't listen to the songs in this masterpiece. I'm anxiously waiting for a second season.",

The scenes were changing so fast, there weren't those nice anime silent moments anymore, and they started turning it into a yaoi rather than focusing on the sport itself, I wished they spent more time creating good animation when it came to skating,and also on the characters, even though I likeVictor. In the end I'll just say that this anime doesn't make me anticipate the end, it seems rather predictable, Yuri will win for sure, I just don't see the struggles really.",

            "content": "First off, I just wanna say I voted 10 to try and counter a little bit all of the negative puntuations this show is getting just because it has gay characters in it.\r\nThat said, I will be honest with this review: YOI is a good anime. It is nice, enjoyable and interesting.\r\nThe music was just great. I liked the OP more than the ED, but both were pretty good. And the music used during performances were just perfect for each one of them. However, though you could understand what they were trying to express with each one, I think they failed to make their individualfeelings reach out, and they relied on other characters explaining how the skaters felt. It is also possible that I wasn't concentrated enough to realize though.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters and the story, I liked them a lot. I like how they explained characters, their backgrounds and motivations, but I also think that maybe they overdid it. I can't bring myself to love a character I've just been presented to if I'm getting another character presented to me almost at the same time the first one comes out of scene, which is usually like three minutes later.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is still true that you see a bunch of them throughout the series and none of them feels like they shouldn't be there and all of them have a unique personality and (kinda) development. Also they're very well designed and non-exxagerated.\\n\r\nThe story is fun and lovable, and progresses just fine. It doesn't have much to it as it just shows Yuri as he gains selfconfidence while developing a friendship-then-love relationship with victor.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I'm speaking of the yaoi thing. It is just great that they decided to go fully into it instead of just queerbaiting. While sadly, there is never an actual \u00a1, explicit declaration of love, it is clear that they have a romantic relationship. It doesn't rely on harmful tropes, it doesn't use the toxic, dominant behaviours trope between yuri and victor to develop their relationship and it doesn't feel forced in any way. I'm just so happy I can get to see a gay couple portrayed without having to watch all of the \"no homo\"s that guionists and producers usually seem to need to include so that they make perfectly clear thay think it's disgusting to be gay/bi.\\n\r\nIt really is a breath of fresh air, and anyone with an interest in romantic comedies, sports animes or lgbt thematic should be able to enjoy it",

            "content": "This Anime actually started quite well. The first episode had everything: Great animations, sympathical characters as it seemed and a neat story of fun an feeling. Unfortunately, from the beginning to the end, the overall quality tends to drop dramatically. \r\nOf course you can't expect as much passion in every episode as in the first one, however, holding up an average of quality should have been possible. In the middle of the anime everything is thrown into disarry.\r\nThe quality of animation declines rapidly, characters often appear in a very reduced way, like chibi-style. This may supposed to be fun and it certainly is at somepoint, but this rather gave me the impression that the staff wanted to save work instead. Sadly this becomes clear during the ice-skating scenes, which often appeared stiff to me, though most of the effort should have been put into these animations since ice-skating is the main topic of this sports-anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlongside the animation, the story also suffers as time goes by due to vast amounts of new characters suddenly thrown into the anime. It is true that one tried to give those characters depth by using flashbacks to tell their backround storys, still I couldn't help feeling overwhelmed by the sheer amount of them and so unable to relate to their feelings. Several characters hardly have any screentime, though they seemed to be much more imprtant (like the best friend of the main character Yuri).\\n\r\nSo I wonder: Was it really that difficult to put less characters into the anime in order to give the remaining ones more space to evolve? I mean even one of the main characters desperately needed some more screentime.\\n\r\nNaturally, a sports anime that includes a competiton needs many characters, but then one shouldn't have squashed them into mere twelve episodes. In any case all these ice-skaters make you loose the guiding thread, through I'm not sure if there is one to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the animation and story quality slightly increases towards the end of the anime, but it doesn't reach the touchstone of episode one, which is to be expected anyway. The last episode seemed pretty rushed so the anime left no good impression on me in the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe main tropic of this show, ice-skating, is quite unusual for an sports-anime. In fact I don't even know whether this topic ever came up before. It certainly isn't surprising that someone like me, who has absolutely no idea what ice-skating is all about, fails to understand what those ice-skaters are doing except carrying out one pirouette after another. So I can't really say if the sport itself is well presented in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing of Yuri on ICE that striked positive to me was the music, which is outstanding in my opinion. Opening and ending songs are quite exceptional for an anime and also the piano piece during Yuri's ice-skating sessions is just beautiful, a true masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nIf the overall quality of the anime would have been at least about half the music quality, this could have been a great anime. But due to the vast amount of characters entering the scene in the middle of the show, the anime clearly vastes its potential.\\n\\n\r\n(note: I'm originally german, so bad grammar is to be expected^^)",

            "content": "I honestly do not understand why people enjoy this anime. \r\nAnime and manga are unique industries in the way that there is relatively very little resistance to representing homo-eroticism or LGBTQ+ relationships because it's been proven to be economically viable. If this is the case, I do not understand why Yuri!!! on Ice does so little in almost every aspect. \r\nThe characters in the anime have pseudo-personalities; each character fits into a market-tested archetype with very few unique qualities. The series does not meaningfully develop any of the character arcs beyond some characters getting a bit better at ice skating, and because of this, anyromantic or sexual tension between characters feels artificial. The conflicts are made to be weirdly trivial (or at least the stakes in them are not properly conveyed to the audience), meaning that there is very little emotional investment on the audiences' part. Because of this, the experience of watching Yuri!!! on Ice is similar to watching 12 episodes of filler. \\n\\n\r\nThe series also makes no effort into being visually appealing or interesting beyond designing generically attractive characters. Ice skating scenes are literally re-used almost every episode (something that astounded me considering the anime is about ice-skating), making it mind-numbingly boring to watch.\\n\\n\r\nYuri!!! on Ice seems to be shallow and shameless fanservice in its lowest form. It's upsetting because the anime could've done so much more to represent queer people and relationships given its freedom to do so.",

            "content": "This is my first review, so please bear with me. Also, warning for one or two mild spoilers.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe plot of Yuri!! on Ice is very straightforward and tells the story of Katsuki Yuri's attempt to win the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating. In that aspect, it is reminiscent of most sports-centered anime you see nowadays, and nothing stands out about it in particular. However, the show establishes early on that it is primarily character-driven: the focus is more on the development of Yuri as a character and his relationship with his skating coach Victor. People who prefer more plot-heavy shows probably won't enjoythis. I, however, didn't really mind; the show executed the plot well and didn't act like it was anything but a character-driven story. From what I have seen online, the figure skating in the show was portrayed accurately and the scores everyone received in competitions were more or less correct. (Except for Yurio's final score in the GPF free skate, which I heard somebody pulled out of their ass)\\n\\n\r\nBesides that, the pacing of the story was done well and each episode transitioned smoothly into the next. The revelation in episode 10 of one of the character's motivations at the beginning of the show was pulled off well and I thought it was nice in how unexpected it was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 7/10\\n\r\nI thought that the character designs in Yuri!! on Ice were unique and well done. The backgrounds were one of the highlights for me: they were all drawn beautifully, and the art team did a nice job on the Barcelona episode in particular, which looked exactly like Barcelona does in real life. Attention to detail is shown in little things like phone cases and t-shirt designs, another thing I quite enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nWhat brought the score down for me was the animation. Specifically, the skating scenes. While the animation isn't that bad overall, the choreography of the skating scenes was pretty iffy at times and felt sloppy, which detracted from my experience watching the skating sequences. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was probably one of the show's best qualities. Both the OP and ED were catchy and I took the time to actually listen to them while watching the show, something I rarely do. The pieces used for the skating scenes were, while not all memorable, enjoyable to listen to. I rate OSTs based on how much I listen to them after I've finished the show, and I do have a few songs from the OST saved on my Spotify.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters are kind of a mixed bag for me. What I liked:\\n\\n\r\n- Yuri's character is overall well-written. His lack of self-confidence and anxiety are portrayed accurately and it was enjoyable throughout the show to watch him grow and mature as he stepped out of his comfort zone.\\n\\n\r\n- The women in the show are represented as strong and independent without reducing them into stereotypes. It's too bad they didn't get more screentime, but from what was shown I don't have any qualms in that department.\\n\\n\r\n- The diversity. There's characters from all over the world in this show, something you don't see in every anime. It was nice seeing underrepresented countries like Kazakhstan and Thailand in the show, and every character had a backstory and unique motivations that gave them some depth.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like:\\n\\n\r\n- Victor's character was a little flat. His main purpose was to be the object of Yuri's admiration and appeal to the viewers with fanservice and the homoerotic tension between him and Yuri, and as a result his character undergoes no major changes over the course of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n- The relationship between Victor and Yuri. I first learned about YOI on Tumblr, where it was gaining a lot of traction for supposedly showing an openly gay relationship. I think that's great - people have been fighting for more representation of the LGBT+ community in popular media, and it looked like this show was going to be the show that would transcend the queerbaiting seen in earlier anime like Free! and actually go for it. Did it live up to expectation? Not... really. Despite showing a (censored) kiss scene in episode 7 and many other scenes that hinted at something between Yuri and Victor, their relationship is never clearly defined. If the show wasn't going to explicitly state that the two characters are in a relationship, it really shouldn't have hinted at it in the first place. This detracted from whatever point the show was trying to make.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI will be frank and say that despite its' numerous shortcomings I enjoyed the show while I watched it. Admittedly, some of it probably stems from the fact that I fit into the demographic the show was aimed towards. Overall, it's a light-hearted comedy that serves it's purpose. If nothing I stated above deters you, I would recommend this show as a fun way to pass the time.",

But I started after 4 episodes came out and I wish I had waited. For me, it's an anime you can watch over and over even though you know the ending. \r\nIt doesn't feel like a sports anime as I think its mainly about the relationships that develop between the characters,  mainly Yuri and Victor. Comparing them from the beginning of the show to the end, you can see how far they've come. \r\nThe art quality decreases through out the series andsome of the monologues feel a bit meaningless. I also was pretty disappointed in the last episode as I feel like it didn't really end properly (preparing for another season or not). No anime is perfect. \\n\\n\r\nI feel this comes close. \\n\\n\r\nWatching Yuri and Victor is truly heart warming and endearing, especially seeing Yuri over come his lack of self confidence. Where this show lacks in the decreased art quality and sometimes dry writing, it's made up by the perfect choice of music, well made opening/ending, beautiful choreography and heart wrenching relationship between 2 people.",

            "content": "Might as well get this project off with a popular one.\r\nIntial impression of the series:\r\nI got into this show while it was still airing and the hype was off the bleeding charts! I started watching and Gods help me, I fell hard and fast for this series and this dub. The animation was flowing and expressive, the music at times being either gorgeous or something I could really rock out to (looking at you Theme of King J.J.  Say what you want about J.J. but that song is the shit!) the characters were loveable, if a bit... well... they required an adjustment period. Butthat didn't detract from the show and, if anything, it encouraged a rewatch, especially with the bombshell that was episode 10. As a side note, one thing this series does beautifully (for the characters that get it at least) is character development. I don't want to give too much away as I think people should go into this with an open mind and without pre-existing judgement but, aside from one or two characters who don't get the screentime that would usually be devoted to them, everyone gets some kind of development.\\n\\n\r\nHighlight of the dub:\\n\r\nI found it nearly impossible to find a character in this that I thought was better than the others as I had heard so many of them before in other anime, Hetalia, Assassination Classroom, Ouran Highschool Host and Black Butler to name a few so I decided that I would just pick up my favourites instead of trying to crown the best actor.\\n\r\nStarting with Yuuri Katsuki, Josh Grelle just seems to become more adorable with every role he takes and I just know he's going to rot my teeth one of these days. He gets across both sides of Yuuri's personality, that being the timid side that struggles with anxiety but he never makes it sound grating and he inspires sympathy while, at the same time, he adopts Yuuri's more confident side while he's skating Eros and Yuri on Ice. I'm not a voice actor but I can tell you that keeping both in balance while still staying true to the character is hard.\\n\\n\r\nSecond is Jerry Jewell who voices Victor Nikiforov. I'll admit that I had a pre-existing bias towards his Russian accent thanks to his role as Russia in Hetalia. But in comparison, I feel like he had to perform a balancing act between Russia's adorable and sadistic sides and it always felt like it was working against him. Now he gets to be confident and in control of his performance and when he gets emotional, I just wanna start crying with him.\\n\\n\r\nYuri Plisetsky, voiced by Micah Solusod, is a tricky subject for me to really convey my thoughts. I had seen him as Asano in AssClass and he got on my nerves pretty quickly but when the writers finally gave him some character development, I think that Micah managed to bring his more relaxed, less hostile side into the spotlight which is something I can appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nThere are really too many characters, all with brilliant performances, for me to explain fully but I want to lastly touch on one role which would be \\n\r\nChristophe Giacommetti voiced by, The prince of all Saiyans himself, Chris Sabat. I'll admit that whenever I see Sabat's name attached to a project, I get excited because I know that his performance is going to be brilliant. But, no joke, when I was first introduced to him, I was so surprised, I fell out of bed! And I don't mean a simple 'fall straight to the floor' fall either, I mean a full ' leap out of bed, hit the wall and roll back over to the bed where I dropped my phone' fall. I was so shocked by the hyper-sexed performance that I recieved, including THAT LINE (we all know which I mean) that I couldn't stop laughing! Kudos to you Sabat for another fantastic performance.\\n\\n\r\nLow point of the dub:\\n\r\nThis was quite possibly the hardest choice that I had to make as, like I've been gushing this entire time, this dub doesn't really have a low point. I think that the closest that it even gets to a low point would be J.J. but even that's really something to be taken with a grain of salt as you have to measure how much of it is the voice actor's fault and how much of it is the scripts?\\n\\n\r\nI will admit that I have a bias towards dubs and I'm very easy to impress especially if the cast is full of V.As who I'm already experienced with and fond of. But even knowing all of that, I will never hesitate to emphasise the dub, even if its just so you can hear the accents of the various characters.",

            "content": "So,just my opinion but it's been quite a long time since I've been into an anime this much. Seriously. No one knows how badly I'd crave a new ep every week,how I thought about it 24/7 every day of the week. It has got me back to drawing and writing,and that's just what it did for me. It's inspirational. What a load of malarkey,is what you are thinking.\r\nTo the point:\r\n I have watched a number of sports anime but none of them really made me care enough to actually like the sport IRL. \r\nI can't say that I'd try figure skating IRL,but this anime didspark an interest in me. Likewise,I never really liked music either. But you know there was something about YoI that spoke to me. Everything was so well thought out\\n\\n\r\nThe characters I'd say are the strongest elements of the show. Sure , not everyone got as much screen time as Yuuri or Victor but we got enough to have an idea of who they were and what their goals were.\\n\r\n Yuuri is the most realistic portrayal of a person IRL in anime. He was someone I could relate to. \\n\r\n YoI has a funny way of making you love even characters you initially hated.\\n\\n\r\nYoI has incorporated a lot of modern themes to it. It made use of various social networking sites, it shows you how viral and \"scary\" the media can be and it touches upon the concept of a gay couple (though not explicity stated,it's pretty obvious) which is an issue even today. The YoI world however is one where homosexuality is a norm like heterosexuality. The romance between Yuuri and Victor isn't the only or main focus of the show,though it is admittedly the most intriguing and distracting. The themes the skaters skate to all reflect what they skate for. The soundtracks,I can't stop listening to them. When's the last time an anime had english songs which weren't ENGRISH  and actually made sense? And if you're a pet owner,the show has got something to tug on your heartstrings too.\\n\\n\r\nYoI is a sports anime that doesn't occur in a school or school level. It has an international cast and has a number of adult characters. \\n\\n\r\nWhat was quite amazing is how the competitions never felts like just an anime,it felt like I was watching an actual skating competition IRL.  I felt actual chills nd anxiety when watching the skaters perform because the music and the situation the characters were put in made me so. Everytime someone messed up I found myself reacting to it.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri's breakdowns and hardships are all heavily emphasized to make you want to root for him. You want him to succeed. The same is done for the rest of the cast. You wan't them all to win.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is also very well done. It will also have moments that will make to tear up if not weep.\\n\\n\r\nNow the animation may be a peeve to some. I didn't really mind as long as the story was comprehensible. I don't nitpick on art much so it didn't bother me much. Some people complained that e have to see the same routine over 4 times. There's a point to it. We see how much they've improved each time.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending did feel lackluster to me. Another episode may have done the trick but I guess it was decent enough after that final surprise scene at the end. Overall the anime was very enjoyable to me and I feel empty now that it's over. Hoping for a s2.\\n\\n",

            "content": "To be honest, I watched Yuri!!! on Ice simply because I was intrigued by my friends' fascination with it, and seeing the screencaps they post contain some nice BL. But honestly, I was a little reluctant to actually watch it when I saw that it was about figure skating. It's not that I don't like figure skating, it's just that it wasn't too interesting for me. But the BL factor was what pushed me to still try it.\r\nThe story was nice, as we follow Yuri's struggle in winning the Grand Prix gold medal. For a 12-episode anime, the pacing was pretty decent. As someone whoisn't familiar with figure skating, all the information was new to me. And I think this show is a nice way to familiarize oneself with it. Seeing Yuri struggle in this field made me appreciate figure skating more. In this light, the show was successful in conveying this.\\n\\n\r\nAs for character development, we were given some background stories of the characters enough to appreciate or understand them during the tournaments. However, in my opinion, the 12 episodes weren't enough to give them a solid form for the audience to actually appreciate or to get attached to them. The background stories were shallow, or lacking, for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and the art were nice. The animation during the tournaments was actually funny, especially when they show the audience because you could see that they use the same frames over and over. I understand why, but it's just funny to me.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the enjoyment, for the BL factor. All of the scenes were great!!!! The relationship between Yuri and Victor was surprisingly amazing, such that it wasn't forced, it wasn't awkward. It was... natural. My heart bursts of excitement whenever they interact. I could say that I enjoyed the whole anime primarily because of the two! Nonetheless, the story and other factors were at par so I could say that this anime is rad regardless of whether there was the BL factor or not.\\n\\n\r\nFor people who enjoy some provocative male to male interactions, you might wanna try this! Or if you like sports in general.\\n\\n\r\nI just hope that we see more into the characters in season 2!!!",

The artwork is beautiful, the characters are lovable and dynamic, the story draws you in and makes you want to know what happens next, the music is varied and perfectly placed, and above all else this is a fantastic love story.\r\nIf you are a BL fan or just a fan of visually appealing anime this is a must. But grab a box of tissues because you'll cry for sadness, joy and beauty. This is definitely one of the most beautiful BL stories I have ever seen. The character'slove for one another carries them through all the hardships of the championship and as their love grows they both grow as people, learn from one another and are better off for each other. Likewise the art in this series is so carefully constructed. The fact that the artists could actually make the skaters look elegant and fluid or powerful and strong and overall it just looks like real figure skating is so impressive. \\n\r\nEven if you aren't a fan of BoysLove watch this show for the beauty and the characters and who knows maybe you will become a fan. I normally give comparisons to other shows but this one is so spectacularly different I'm not sure what to compare it to and I think everyone should watch it.\\n\r\nEdit: i'm still obsessed with this weeks later and i can't get the intro song out of my head!",

            "content": "Yuri on Ice has taken the anime community by storm, and rightfully so. I remember hearing about this anime on tumblr and not really being all that interested at first, because sports anime just aren't my thing. But, seeing as how this anime had received an overwhelmingly positive response, I decided to give it a shot, and I definitely do not regret it. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe only reason I gave the story 9/10 is because, well, the story isn't finished, and there is much more to be seen in the season 2 that will hopefully be happening. But, I absolutely loved the story. Yuri on Iceis so much more than an anime about ice skaters. It's a story of love, hardship, failure, and so many more. This anime addresses so many real-life issues, and it makes the plot seem so realistic and relatable. \\n\\n\r\nThe story didn't move too fast or too slow, either. Granted, it was only 12 episodes so things did move a bit fast, but that's to be expected. \\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice reminded me personally as a bit of a coming of age story since it tackles so many different issues like gender, sexuality, love, mental disorders, etc. But it does it in such a way that it's tasteful and subtle and just enough for the viewer to be intrigued. \\n\\n\r\nBriefly I want to talk about the romance in this series, as it is a part of the story. It's not the main focus, but it's there. What I think is so amazing about Yuri on Ice is that it tells the romance between these two men, and it's not made into a big deal. Yuri on Ice exists in a non-discriminatory universe where love is love. Yuri's main theme is even \"love\", and while it's not just romantic love, it's every type of love, which also seems to be a theme of the series. An incredibly prominent theme in Yuri on Ice seems to be \"love wins\". \\n\\n\r\nLike I said, while the main focus isn't the romance, it's a part of the story and how it's told. The blossoming romance between Victor and Yuri tells a story of it's own while seemingly moving the main plot along as well, without it seeming like there's too much going on at once. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Yuri on Ice is absolutely incredible. The skating scenes are almost all animated beautifully. It has to be incredibly difficult to animate ice skating, as the characters have to move fluently in time with the music. But it is so well done. There were a few animation errors throughout the series, but overall, it was stunning. The backgrounds were beautiful and always seemed to set the mood, and the characters were all beautifully drawn and expressive. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the soundtrack for Yuri on Ice. It's arguably my favorite OST. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening for YOI, \"History Maker\" by Dean Fujioka, is incredible. It's so inspiring and catchy, I find myself singing it all the time. The english vocals are practically flawless and the song is easy to get stuck in your head. The visuals that accompany it, while seemingly simple, are simultaneously beautiful. \\n\\n\r\n\"On Love: Eros\" was also an incredible song. Extremely catchy and sexy in it's own way. You could definitely tell that it was a passionate and sexual song. \\n\\n\r\n\"On Love: Agape\" was more emotional and beautiful, but it was still a gorgeous song. \\n\\n\r\nI also adored the song for Yuri's free skate, titled \"Yuri on Ice\".  It's beautiful, and it seems to tell the story of Yuri Katsuki on its own.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't know how it's possible, but Yuri on Ice created some of the most well-developed characters in merely 12 episodes. And this is only season one. \\n\\n\r\nThe most noticeable development is obviously Yuri's. Yuri starts the series as a a bit of an unconventional protagonist. After losing the Grand Prix, he's kinda feeling down and is considering retirement. He's lost all confidence in himself, and from the first episode we can tell that Yuri is a very anxious and awkward person that hasn't really learned to put himself out there, both as a skater and as a person. \\n\\n\r\nThat's where Victor comes in. \\n\\n\r\nVictor, Yuri's idol and the best figure skater in the world, comes to coach him and later helps him become confident in himself. He helps Yuri realize his true potential in more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\nBut what I really enjoyed is that when Victor came, it wasn't as though Yuri's anxiety went away. It was still there and it even affected his performances. But Victor helped him cope. Victor was there for him so he could learn to cope with it, not so he could eliminate it. Yuri's fears didn't automatically go away, in fact, one could argue that they were worse since he felt as though he had to perform well  in order to make Victor look good. But Victor always somehow managed to help Yuri pull himself together. \\n\\n\r\nHow did he do that? By loving him, as Yuri reveals later on. Victor's love is what motivates him. \\n\\n\r\nIt's also the desire to one day skate on the same ice as Victor, and that presumably means as a serious competitor. In my personal opinion, a healthy rivalry would be good for their relationship, both their romantic one and their coach/student one. \\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice tells the story of how these two characters learn to support each other and help each other realize their dreams and emotions. Just as Victor helps Yuri realize his potential, Yuri helps Victor realize a lot about his own emotions and desires. \\n\\n\r\nYuri gave Victor a whole new reason to skate. He made Victor feel a whole bunch of new emotions, ones that he had never experienced before, and I believe that he wants to express them through his skating, which is why he (spoiler alert) announced his comeback. \\n\\n\r\nNow, as for the supporting characters, I loved that we were given their backstories in such a way that it didn't consume the entire series. We learned a lot about each of the characters in just 12 episodes. And we got to see their emotions and struggles as well, which I really liked. \\n\\n\r\nI especially enjoyed seeing Yurio's journey as a young skater competing against a bunch of adults. He's a brat, but he's sweet in his own way, and learns to befriend Yuri despite considering him a fierce rival. I also liked his relationship with Victor, and the fact that despite his age, Victor considers him as a rival for Yuri, and possibly later on as a rival for himself.\\n\\n\r\nI always found the whole \"two Yuris\" thing to be really interesting, to be honest. \\n\\n\r\nI adored characters like Phichit, Otabek, Mila, even Chris who made me uncomfortable more than once with his... erotic skating. They were all very flushed out despite being side characters and I hope to see more of them in season two. I also enjoyed seeing their impact on Yuri and his career. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGosh, I really didn't want to say 10/10 again, but I can't help it. Even when some of the skating scenes were (very rarely) boring me, I still couldn't wait for the next episode. I found myself becoming extremely passionate over this anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, episode seven, when \"you-know-what\" happened? Yeah, I screamed. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, there wasn't a single episode I was disappointed with. I loved every minute. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's rare for me to call an anime perfect, but Yuri on Ice is damn near perfect. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want an intense anime with a lot of passion, sports, emotions, romance, comedy, and even a hint of fan service, then Yuri on Ice is definitely your anime.\\n\\n\r\nPlease, please give it a chance if you have the time. I think I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite anime of all time.",

The story no good, not really worth a reawatch or any more thoughts beside the 20min watching the episode. The animation good at times (buy that i mean a total of 10min within all the episodes). I would have loved more episodic des like n\u00ba 10 where they visited Barcelona and gave some CHARACTER  DEVELOPMENT (short backstories sad or not does not equal character development, attachment or personality). Sorry but i would not aim to see a second season. From episode 4 onwards ( with the exception of ep 10)it was a forced journey to finish the anime. God I was relieved when it ended as i could FINALLY tick it off my list. One word to describe this anime. Sandpaper. As entertaining and painful as sandpaper...",

            "content": "My overall rating of YOI would probably be a 5.5. Don't get me wrong, this anime was quite enjoyable for me. I wouldn't go as far as to rave about it, but it was entertaining. The best way to sum it up for me would be to call it cute.\r\nStory\r\nI don't think the story was anything that blew me away, it started off okay. I was into it enough to finish the series. My only problem with it was I found myself questioning the importance of some elements and why certain things were developed and others were not. This is more so about characters, butI\"ll get into that more later.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI liked the art style, it was cute and colorful and very upbeat. Very good for a lighthearted and short anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound was all right, I couldn't get into the other skaters' music that much. I found the opening grew on me after a bit, and I liked Yuri's music he skated to in the beginning. Otherwise, it didn't really stand out to me as a soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters started off okay, and they were fun to watch. My biggest disclaimer about this show is don't go into it wanting amazing character development, you're not going to get it. I had to remind myself not to get tunnel vision when it comes to the characters, because it can be easy to be sucked into wanting to be frustrated by the same characters not changing much if at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI did enjoy this anime, I did look forward to the next episode of it. The show wasn't bad, I did enjoy it. YOI is a good lighthearted anime if you want something to watch and enjoy without too much seriousness. What conflicted with my enjoyment was my frustration at Victor and Yuri's relationship not really going anywhere. I didn't feel like Yuri changed much and I didn't see why they couldn't work it out, because the relationship dynamic would have worked out really well in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI liked YOI, I would totally recommend it if you're thinking of watching it. Just don't push anything you're really into right now to make room for it. I don't know if it's a show I would be able to binge watch in a day, it's a little too fluffy for that. I just couldn't get past the unsatisfying ending. I felt like it was too ambiguous and played too safe. I know that not everything is so black and white, but what frustrated me is that the dynamic between Yuri and Victor was, and it was so muddied by external factors that it became more complicated than it needed to be.",

This goes into what I love about the show it is not uncommon for people who share a passion and spend a lot of time together to fall in love. I enjoyed the characters, I love how realistic the skating world is in this universe, and I just enjoyed the show. I don't like when we apply the same harsh critiques to a show that's supposed to be fun and we act as if it's an animated animelike death note. I laughed at times, I was invested in Yuuris growth, and I wanted to see him succeed. The family and friends of the figure skaters are easily one of the best parts.. A lot of the skatersfamilies are actually alive in the show and family and friends are very supportive and very loving you don't get to see that in many enemy anime. Overall I enjoyed it.",

The narrative is fantastic, where every little scene - every second - has a greater significance to the plot. Nothing is wasted, there's no fluff, and every moment helps building what is a rich story with an abundance of fleshed out characters with natural and realistic character development.\r\nThe symbolism and meta narrative is plentiful and beautiful, and even the music is used to tell a story on its own, with cues and instruments used to represent events and characters that can even reveal bits of the story yet to come, ifyou pay enough attention.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story unfolds, you'll learn new things that will definitely change the way you view the past, and even the characters themselves completely. This is a shining example of an anime you're better off watching more than once, and every little thing you might have nitpicked at in the past will be explained. Every single little thing.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the fact that the writers clearly understood what we, the viewers and fans, would've wanted the most if we had the choice, and they brought it to life to our delight and awe. 'Groundbreaking' may be a strong word, but I would be lying if I said this show with its way of handling certain subjects, won't change the future of anime storytelling, if only by a small margin, and its fantastic success - even amongst professional real life figure skaters - proves as much.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a conventional sports anime by any stretch, but it still captures the spirit of what a sports anime fan enjoys, and the competitions will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. Yuri!!! on Ice just happens to have a hell of a lot more going for it, than sport alone.",

The music is outstanding, the song 'Yuri on Ice' is honestly one of the best piano compositions ive heard in a awhile, to the point where I am going to learn it on piano asap, even oif you dont watch the anime or like it I recommend listening to the song. Now I realize the theme is not one many people like, as most people dont give a shit about figure skating, but the explanations of the sport are in thefirst few episodes (given this makes them slower and more confusing). But the themes of striving towards a goal and competition are true in any sport, so it is not hard to look past it even if you dislike it. Now there are lots of Yoai like situations, and I get that this makes guys uncomfortable, but its not that bad guys just enjoy it, liking it doesnt make you gay haha. Really the music and the art had me hooked, and the story is compelling, though this seems like a series best saved for binge watching, so if you watch it set aside some time.",

Most sports anime I have tried watching, have put me to sleep. This is the first one ever that I am fully wide awake, invested in, and engaged in. I just finished watching episode 8 and found myself feeling as if I was part of the audience. Every time Yuri makes a jump, I can't help but tense for a second, hoping he will make it. That is just one thing I love aboutthis anime. I feel as if I am there. Now onto the sound. Fantastic! I love the music in this anime so much and cannot wait for the original soundtrack to come out and you can bet I will be getting it. I love the opening and ending theme songs. They get so stuck in my head. The sound is very appropriate for the show. Next, we have the art. This is anime is beautiful to look at. I love the character designs, the colors, the animation. It is one of the reasons I decided to watch this anime. As a person who is not a fan of sports anime, I did not watch this at first, but sure am glad I did. Now, for the story. It's a typical sports anime. One of the things I don't really like about sports anime is the lack of story. They often seem bland and oftentimes, they seem kind of pointless to me. I feel myself questioning what the story is about most of the time. This one is not much different. It is its weak point in my opinion. That being said, everything else is so good and enjoyable, that it outweighs that lack of deep story and character development that I often don't get with sports anime. It is not boring. It is so fun to watch and I look forward to new episodes every week. If you are like me and don't particularly care for sports anime, do not discount this one. Give it a chance. You won't be disappointed. I really hope they do a second season of this, however I would hate to see it's quality decline, due to popularity. I really hope this keeps up and highly recommend it. One thing is for sure: this anime is for everyone, whether you like sports anime or not.",

Cant say the same abt the ice skating scoring system, there are a little bit mistakes in scoring system but overall it still a good, realistic sport anime. Oh and it also do a good portrayal of mental health issue and how to deal withit. But if you're somehow a so called fujoshi who only fetishizes same sex relationship but think of it as a sin in real life, sorry bruh. This anime is not for your little rotten brain.

            "content": "**Spoiler free review**\r\nI have recently seen Yuri!! on Ice a second time and so I've decided to write a review on it. To begin, I'd like to say that watching this anime a second time a year later made me remember why it holds the #9 spot in my favorite standard anime series. Let's go into detail, shall we?\r\nStory: 9.5/10\r\nYuri!! on Ice was divided into two times, both being the first 4 episodes and the remaining 8. The first 4 episodes were a casual post-tournament recovery for Yuuri Katsuki as well as a surprising setup when we see Victor become his coach. The remaining 8episodes were straight to business. It offered intense figure skating with different cups and the Grand Prix Final, as well as the bond between Yuuri and Victor, which added to the intensity of the figure skating performances done by Yuuri, when I was at the edge of my chair every single time he made a jump to see whether he would land it or not, with the thought of how Victor would react in my head. The first part of the anime was a good setup, but the other 8 episodes were really what made it shine bright.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.5/10\\n\r\nFigure skating is something that would be pretty hard to animate, given the specificity of the jumps, spins and step sequences done in performances. Yuri!! on Ice did a great job animating it greatly. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe best aspect of Yuri!! on Ice goes to sound. The opening and ending were magnificent, and the various songs and tracks that were used in every performance were great, and some of those songs and tracks were a huge boost to the intensity of their respective programs, like Yuri on Ice done by Yuuri in his free program, and JJ's theme song in his short program. Those were my favorite. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nGreat, international cast coming from many countries around the world, which is pretty nice to see in anime. Nothing more to that, since the background and development for these characters were kept short. Yuri!! on Ice was all about the performances.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\r\nI loved it. I loved the originality of this anime, the diverse characters, the music used in the performances, the performances themselves, I loved everything about it. This anime makes me nostalgic from time to time, and after watching it for a second time, the nostalgia and hype for it came back and formed a bubble around me which will pop again in a day or two. However, the aspect of this anime that was the most intense for me was the bond and the development between Victor and Yuuri. I know a lot of people tend to think this anime is great for its Yaoi/Shounen ai, and that IS the demographic genre of this anime, but that's not what I tend to look at. What I see isn't two males who love each other. I see a coach and his student who need each other. Yuuri needs Victor so he can gain confidence, and Victor needs Yuuri to perform amazingly so that he can see his student get the gold medal. It's really a different type of romance from what I've seen, and it was a crucial addition to the anime as it added a lot of intensity to Yuuri's performances, since Victor's reactions and their bond depend on them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10\\n\r\nI've said pretty much all I had to say, and I would love to see a sequel someday.",

            "content": "I absolutely understand why the reviews for Yuri on Ice are so mixed. However, I find myself more than a little obsessed with it, and I think that for all its flaws it's still worth a watch. Well, 2 watches--but I'll explain below.\r\nAs so many other reviewers have mentioned, this show has layers upon layers. You can definitely watch it as a romcom, albeit one that is constrained by a culture that hasn't been overly LGBT friendly in the past. Without too much digging, Victor's over-the-top behavior can be explained by the genre. You can watch this as a high-tension sports drama, where neither viewersnor the athletes themselves are entirely sure how well their routines will go. Really it's a mix of both, with a lot of psychological drama thrown in.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the psychological aspects that had me coming back. YOI has one of the best, most accurate portrayals of anxiety and depression that I have seen in any show. Realizing how anxiety makes your brain lie to you is key to understanding this show. Yuri sees himself as a loser--and when we meet him, we agree. He just bombed a major competition, is overweight from stress eating, and has recently moved back into his childhood bedroom. But that doesn't square with what is actually happening. He's the top-ranked male figure skater in Japan, his hometown is crazy supportive of him, and one of the most talented and attractive leaders in his sport has chosen to give up everything to come work with him. Even the other skaters, his erstwhile rivals, are nice to him. Yuri's drive to win, and the crushing pressure he puts on himself to succeed, are what is skewing his perception, and he's a textbook example of an unreliable narrator. A bombshell reveal at the end of episode 10 adds even more depth to this, and I strongly suggest you rewatch the series at least once to take advantage of this knowledge. Many of the problems I had with the show went away afterwards. (Try to watch it from Victor's perspective, if you can. This isn't a goofball romcom, but rather a tightly structured comedy of errors. Things that I took at face-value became funny, and lines I'd found amusing were now hilarious.)\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I truly enjoyed YOI, it does suffer from several major flaws. The animation quality plummets in the later episodes--there's an entire Twitter account dedicated to awkward YOI screengrabs--and it's especially disappointing given how lovely the action sequences are in the first few episodes. New characters are thrown in all the time, ostensibly to illuminate some part of Yuri or Victor's psyche, and are discarded just as quickly. The pacing is extremely uneven, and I would have gladly given up watching other skaters' performances for more time spent on Yuri and Victor themselves. I also wish their romance had been more overt, but the creators mentioned that they faced censorship so I can't blame them too much.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this, I think the series is still worth watching (and re-watching!). I'm looking forward to the movie and, hopefully, a second season with a distant-enough deadline for the show to work out some of its kinks.",

            "content": "*English is not my first language! The review will be edited... eventually! May contain spoilers!*\r\nGay-bait.\r\nThat was literaly the first thing, that came up in my mind, when I read the premise of the show - gay-bait! Lots of skinny, girly-looking boys, pretty music and sexy accents... no wonder this still holds rating over eight!\r\nThat being said... I can't believe that I have to say this... I have absolutely nothing against gays! I'm one myself, goddamit!\r\nSo... did I hate Yuri on Ice? No. Did I liked it? No... but I didn't hate it either! It's just not... that good as Fandom makes it out to be,and let me tell you my version, why that is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (4)\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so... lets be honest here! How many of us did actually see this anime, because of its story?! Not me, that's for sure! If you'd tkae away the ever-so-obvious yaoi-aspect out of the story, what would be left besides that? Some generic underdog-story, about ice skating! And I use the word \"generic\", as a praise!\\n\\n\r\nThe boy sucks at what he does - he feels bad. He meets someone, willing to help him - he feels better. The mentor and the pupil fall in love... somehow - boy sucks... little bit less, and is now happy. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said... generic underdog-story, with a splash of romance here and there... because horny teens need their ships. \\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't anything new, nor does it bring anything new to the table - gay-relationships in sports isn't anything new! It's not deep, nor does it try to bring up something entirely unexpected, or challenging to the viewer - it's just nice little hurt/comfort- one-shot with ice skating attached to it, and that's pretty much about it. Yet, it's still not insulting to me, for it never ever claimed to tell anything \"bigger than life itself\", but for such a hype and praise that I've received from its fans, I really was expecting something more, than a half-covered boy/boy- kiss, tears in a toilet, and ever-so-vague engagement.\\n\\n\r\nPrehaps in season 2...\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (9)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is where this anime stands strong on its own! I love this! I really, really love this!\\n\\n\r\nThe colors are pretty much all the shades of blue, which correlates nicely with the whole theme of ice, and skating, giving it that somewhat magical/unreal, almost that dreamworld- like tone, that I just love to death. The lighting is pretty, and the character desings are... passable, atleast. The japanese guy is still your basic, generic japanese guy, and most of the guys look like pretty, skinny girls, but that's what expected, really - you can't ice skate, with 1000 stones of pure muscle! \\n\\n\r\nThe choreographics of the ice skating competitions are the absolute best parts of the entire show! Every single move is precise. Every single routine is detailed and spot on. Every jump the skaters make... every fall... every victory and every defeat... you just feel them all! The art captures perfectly every motion... every emotion and motive, that these skaters have, and their passion to shine above others. You just need to watch all those jumps, and you can literaly feel yourself jumping youself! You just need to see someone fall or tumble, and you feel for them! Skating, like every sport, is a cruel game, where only one can be the best one, and when these characters literaly put everything they got for their routines, you just live with them, in every moment and downfall. \\n\\n\r\nMy hat and gloves are off for you! Bravo, gentlemen! Bravo!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (8)\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds... what can I say. It's a show about ice skating, so of course, the music will also be beautiful. I'm sure I won't be the only one, who's totally hooked with the Agape and Eros - simply two atmost beautiful pieces of soundtrack-music, that I've heard in a long while!\\n\\n\r\nSince I saw this anime in english dub, I guess I should say something about the accents... but I don't. I'm from Finland - the only accents I even recognized, was the russian accents, and even those felt somewhat... forced! Intentionally, prehaps...? Can japanese voice-actors even do russian accents...?\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters... all the three of them?\\n\\n\r\nYuuri is a wuss. He's an uke. He learns to skate... like a girl? He cries a lot. He's often being mocked as a fatty, and considered almost to old to compete seriously... at the age of 25. What can I say about him?! His dull as a rock! Nothing in him interests me, except his Eros-routine, and he still acts like a fourteen-year-old girl, being all shy and nervous and innocent and all that tall crap! For f*ck sake, you're a man! Start for once acting like one!\\n\\n\r\nVictor is seme. He's russian. He's sexy... apparently also a nudist of some sort. As a skater, he's top in his profession, and thus every single girly-boys wet dream, on ice. He got nothing for me.\\n\\n\r\nYuri... is russian too. He skates. He... fuck him.\\n\\n\r\nYeah... characters are bland. Very bland. They're tasteless. They all skate. And two of them, have the same name - all for you, shippers and fanfiction-writers. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I usually say \"bland\", it usually means, that the characters have no personalities, nor motives or desires. In this case, however, the \"bland\" means... extremely generic. All the characters do have personalities... and very distinguished at that! They all want something, they're all very well motivated and they do all change throughout the story, but... they're nothing new to me. I've seen all these characters done billion times already... only, in this time, the main heroes are gay! It's and old model, with some new paint on it, which doesn't make it interesting! It's just... bland! Bait!\\n\\n\r\nIt's kinda like the same thing, that happened very often in movies in 90s' - if a character is gay/bi/whatever, the whole character is build around that fact. In here, all the characters are skaters, and two of them are closet gays - that's their personality! No, they're not similar to each other, and yes, they do have their own motives, quirks, habbits and such, but it's still so obvious, that they're ment to be skater-gays first, and everything else later on! \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, these characters are this weird, unsatisfying combination of frustation, blandness and harmless charm, that forms no real image in my head! They're nothing new, and still... I find nothing rage-worthy in them! They're just... baits! Gay-baits, and nothing more!\\n\\n\r\nBut, yes... keep in mind, that this was twelve-episode season 1, so... prehaps, next time, we get so see some actual characters, than some generic fanfiction-shells. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6)\\n\\n\r\nMan, this is hard...!\\n\\n\r\nDespite all my gripes with this show, I actually really liked it... occasionally. \\n\r\nI wasn't going in for it because of the story, nor the characters, but the ice skating, and I got what I wanted - nothing more, nothing less. Of course, I was left wanting for more, especially in terms of stroy and the characters, but that's what we have season 2 for, right? Right?!\\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice, is pretty much the definition of \"candy with no sugar\"- anime - it looks pretty, but tastes bad. It has a nice overlook to it, but little to no subtance, which will make you wonder, what's the even point to it! It's one of those shows, that will get overhyped by the Fandom, and thus, hated by those, who were expeting something a little bit more, than what it gave to us. Yes, it's still not done yet, but what is done by now, is not anything anything that special to beging with - deal with it!\\n\\n\r\nBut, if I have to bring up something that I truly liked to see, exept beautiful skating routines, was the - surprise! - the romance-angle, of the story! I really liked the Yuuri/Victor- relationship. It started out nicely, as a mentor/pupil- thing, turning into innocent romance... relatively fast, considering their opposite personalities. I really liked their little sidestory, and I really want to see them grow and develope even more... as a couple, and as individuals. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5)\\n\\n\r\nIn overall, Yuri on Ice was a big, big disappointment. Harmless and pretty-looking candy with no sugar, but still... a disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was bland, the characters were almost blander, and I really had to ride on that novelty-pony all the way to the Hellville, so that I could really enjoy the only things this show had to offer - music, art, and skating. This anime has nothing noteworthy, nor revolutionary, to grand it higher-than-good- rating, a and if it didn't have that one single half-assed gay-kiss thrown in the mix, even it's horny fans would see this season as a total turd!\\n\\n\r\nStill, I'm not going to hate. Yes, it was hyped excessively, and yes, maybe the Fandom will always see more in this, than anyone else on Earth will ever see, but... I can respect them for that. This may have been a dry plum for me, but atleast, some will find some juice left in it.",

            "content": "Initially I had no desire to watch Yuri on Ice because I'm not a fan of ice skating at all, I don't watch it and I don't do it. I've ice skated only one time in my life and it was a nightmare so, I already had an established mindset going into the show. The reason I decide to watch the show came down to an Instagram poll Yuri on ice vs Kuroko no Basket and `Yuri lost with 2 votes to 14. However I like an underdog so I decided to go with Yur and, I'm glad I did because it was a phenomenalshow.\\n\\n\r\nYuri on ice follows 23 year old  Yuuri Katsuki a figure skater from Japan after his crushing defeat at the Grand Prix Finale. he returns to his family home to assess his options for the future. After his loss he has gained a substantial amount of weight and, realizes that his opportunity in the skating world is gradually going away due to his age and, lack of confidence. Eventually he hits up a local rink and preforms a free skate program of his idol Victor Nikiforov which is recorded and put on the internet and, boom instant spotlight. The causes Victor to come from Russia to Japan to train Yuuri in order to win the Grand Prix.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Yuri on ice is the basic protagonist fails and picks himself back up with the help of a mentor and a rival in order to redeem himself and win. A basic story that has been done a hundred times in the past and, will be done a hundred times in the future. The execution of the story was great. Each episode had a flow to it and an easy to follow storyline with few subplots to make it more interesting without cluttering the entire show. I also commend the writers for achieving a perfect balance of comedy and drama as the blend well together and, don't feel out of place. the comedy in this show was absolutely phenomenal, I laughed so hard at some of the scenes from the show, the dramatic moments had brilliant build and I could imminently  feel what the characters were going through at that moment because of the way it was handled. I also liked the tournament aspects of the show, it had the feel of the ladder style tournament from mortal combat where our characters had to pass a certain stage to move on to the finale, which was beautifully done. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the ice skating scenes, the movements with the music was a magnificent thing to watch. also, I loved the visual storytelling that happened in the skating scene, it really helped boost the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first anime I have seen from MAPPA so I had no idea what to expect in terms of visuals. The visuals of the show were fantastic, there are various locations in the show such as Japan, Russia and China to name a few and each had a unique feel to it. The character design was passable, and as stated earlier the ice skating scenes were brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one of the strongest aspects of the show. the opening song History maker is a thing of beauty, hearing it no one can help but sing along to the song it is that good and I think it set the perfect tone for the show as in we were going to see something special as we went into each episode. However I wasn't a big fan of the animation style used in the opening, it just felt out of place. The ending is more instrumental and has more of a techno vibe but, I feel that it serves as a nice pellet cleanser due to it giving some breathing room after the show especially with the credits consisting of social media pictures.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the show were my favorite  part of the show. Starting off with our main character Yuri Katsuki, he reminded me of Shinichi Izumii from Parasyte, a vulnerable innocent soul who turns into a badass well as badass as an ice skater can be almost. He was a good main character because he was relatable, I Immediately felt a connection to him and watching his character develop and grow over the duration of the show was a beautiful thing. he was funny charming and Ice skated like a pro. I felt a connection to Your because I saw I bit of myself in him in that I also, lacked confidence and, messed up important situations in my life so watching him overcome that that beautiful. moving on to his coat Victor Nikiforov, he was probably the most entertaining character in the show meaning that he was probably the funniest. I always like it when a professional in a certain field steps dow to help the underdog. Victor was also a brilliant character as he was funny, charming and I thought he was a good coach. Now my favorite character in the show Yuri Plisetsky a 15 year old Russian skater who is what every fifteen year old wishes he was. The moment he was introduced I knew he would be my favorite in the show because he oozed charisma. he was funny, intense, relatable and, the best skater in the entire anime. He told a brilliant story when he was on the ice, it was like watching Shawn Michaels wrestle I was just drawn to him. Some of the side characters were pretty memorable such as Christophe Giacometti a Swiss skater who takes erotic to another level, J.J Laroy a Canadian skater who is full of himself but, had the skills to back it up, also he had a tramp stamp. Phichit Chulanont from Thailand was also pretty fun to watch. Otabek Altin who had an interning relationship with Yuri Plisetsky that I wish had more development. Three little girls that served as a form of comic relief, Italian siblings that took the term over protective to a new level, a skater who skated in makeup to sell his story and other skaters whose names I can't recall at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe only issue I have with the show is its pace. The tournaments usually lasted only one or two episodes. I wish that the ice skating scenes had more screen time. Also there are episodes where the skaters in the tournaments interact with each other outside the rink and, these were some of the highlights of the show but they were very few and, far between. This especially stands out at the end of episode ten where the skaters are having dinner together discussing the tournament and, rings and a drunken Yuuri. This was one of the best scenes in the entire anime and, nothing like it has been done agains I wish we had more of those scenes. To add on to that, some skaters barely get any development. Also Yuri Katsuki skates to the same two programs in all the tournaments. Furthermore we only saw the tournaments Yuri Katsuki was in which is a real bummer as I would have liked to see the other tournaments to make the show more dynamic. But, thats just nitpicking.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed Yuri on Ice, it had great characters, a relatable story, great comedy and, drama that complemented each other. The show made ice skating cool with I though was impossible. The show was fun to watch and, I'm hoping that it continues, hopefully a second season will come out someday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(May contain spoilers)\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Yuri!!! on ICE, even bought merchandise of it while I was still high on the initial hype for the series and for the representation of a gay couple, but then I sat down and calmly thought it over. Is it really that good? Well, let me tell you why it's overhyped.\r\nStory:\r\nI'm gonna be honest; when I first heard about this anime, what reeled me in wasn't the story. Top Russian ice skater helps his fanboy get back on his feet along with some rivals on the way. It sounded quite generic. When I actually watched the anime, I found myselfenjoying the story quite a bit. I like how it was executed; Victor wasn't arrogant, Yuuri didn't stay just a fanboy and actually developed nicely on his own accord and through his own hard work which, of course, Victor helped with. There were some points in the show that kept it interesting, such as the kiss, the almost-downfall of JJ, and the winner of the Grand Prix finals, and for that, I give the story a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAh, the art. It was both good and bad. Certain scenes were exquisitely drawn, like the many times there was a closeup of the characters' lips, glossy and soft, or their eyes, piercing. The design of the ice skating costumes was also very well done and stayed true to both the personality of the skaters and the theme they were skating to. However, the downfall of the animation were the skating scenes themselves. A lot of them were so poorly drawn that you could barely see the skater's expression and they looked truly low budget. Some might try to counter this argument by saying the animators drew over actual skating routines and put in a lot of effort into the animation, but, no matter how much effort you put in, it doesn't matter if the end result is bad, at least from a critic's point of view; a polished turd is still a turd. And I must add that, even in the most well drawn scenes of the anime, the animation was, at best, generic. If you want to know what extraordinary animation is, take a look at Kyoto Animation's works or Studio Madhouse's adaptations of One Punch Man or Mob Psycho 100. I'm afraid I cannot give the animation anything more than a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI have no complaints about the soundtrack, at all. In fact, it was quite nice. The music was well done for the skaters' performances, although I didn't really notice it in other, more everyday scenes. One piece that particularly stuck out to me, though, was Yuuri's main theme song. I quite liked it. However, I must say that the rest of the music wasn't anything especially amazing. It gets a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the downfall of this show. The main character, Katsuki Yuuri, is the only one I believed to be truly fleshed out in this show. He had a caring family, a role model, and still, he suffered from anxiety and was depressed for a while before he met Victor. He had wonderful character development, his confidence in himself and his skating growing, Yuuri learning to be himself in front of Victor and, of course, bolder. The others, though? Very two-dimensional. In fact, we practically know nothing about the deuteragonist's life before he flew himself over to Japan in order to train Yuuri. His family, hobbies, worries and motivations? They were never elaborated upon. The same goes for the majority of the other characters, whose lives outside of skating we only got minor glimpses of. I give the characters a 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDespite all of the flaws of this series (and there's quite a bit of them), I actually enjoyed it. The shortcomings weren't that noticeable until I actually sat down and replayed the anime in my mind. They didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the series that much. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOn the whole, this anime is worth a watch, especially if you're looking for a nice atmosphere and a feel-good series. Is it, in my opinion, mediocre? Yes. Did it deserve the two Crunchyroll awards it got for its animation and story? Absolutely not. But, if you have nothing better to do, watch it. It's not that bad of an anime and can be enjoyed quite a bit. My overall score for it is 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read my first ever review, it means a lot! I tried to be as objective as I could. Please rate it as helpful if it helps you in deciding how you judge this series, or if you agree with my statements, and please know that my opinions of this anime have absolutely nothing to do with whether the couple is gay or not (I've seen some people getting shit for criticizing the anime for its actual faults and not for actually being homophobic about it). Have a nice day! :)",

            "content": "Once YoI finally ended I screamed, like legit shrieks and screams, my voice cracked on that last episode. I wanna talk about why I love this anime and why it\u2019s been the highlight of this year, for me.\r\nOne of the most important ones is definitely the GAY. Not because of the fan service, or queerbaiting, or whatever other terms people like using to put down shows.\r\nThis is the first anime sports, serious sports mind you, that there\u2019s real gay in it, that is approached beautifully and so realistically. This is breaking norms, rules, and I love it.\r\nAnother thing is racial diversity! The cast has allkind of races and ethnicities, and they\u2019re not dumb stereotypes, in fact I\u2019ll get to that in a bit. Everyone is treated super cute, and with respect, while also being true to their roots, so it isn\u2019t racial diversity for \u201cshow\u201d like some haters like to spout off.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also super important: breaking gender stereotypes. We see boys using eyeliner, mascara, eyeshadow, lipstick, using cute pink cellphones, pink curtains and pajamas, and all kinds of cute, glittery thing that by all rights is not gendered, and I love seeing it being used for everyone!\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t forget that they also approached everyone\u2019s ages with an amazing respect, they didn\u2019t sexualize Yurio or Minami, or the other cuties, the ones that were sexual were the adults, and heck if I don\u2019t like that! Not saying teenagers can\u2019t be sexual or sexy, just that there tends to be too much focus on that, and here we see just cute kids, angry little kittens, coming into their own without the need for that. I just like it, okay?! /protects all the cuties\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the gay, this isn\u2019t just focused on gay, heck this is inclusive. There\u2019s heteros, bisexuals, homosexuals, and there\u2019s shout outs to the real ice skaters that broke norms, which is lovely!\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of shout outs, one of the things I love is that this show is so well researched, not just the costumes, but the shout outs, the routines, everything has been done right, and I love seeing the passion infused in this!\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is stellar, as are the characters, I really get the sense these are people with their own needs, dreams, goals and desires, and flaws, and they\u2019re all so compelling, I want a season for each character!!! \ud83d\ude2d\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is super great, from the OP, to the ED, to the songs picked for the routine. The art is gorgeous, have you seen those character designs and costumes?! Aaah! Plus the animation is tricking amazing!\\n\\n\r\nI want a Season 2 really badly and I hope it happens!\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t seen this, well I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re reading this sentence, but go watch it!",

            "content": "Yuri on Ice?  Ha! More like Yaoi on Ice, am I right?  It\u2019s not like that\u2019s been used before..\r\nThe Fall 2016 anime season had the best collection of anime in the entire year; Sound! Euphonium Season 2, March Comes in Like a Lion, Flip Flappers, Gi(a)rlish Number, etc.  However, one anime in particular was getting the most buzz, the most popular series airing at the time was the series I had very little expectations for.  Odd, considering the anime I went into with low expectations happened to be a serious contender for Anime of 2016 for me.  Yuri!!! On ICEis the anime series most people are probably going to remember from 2016.  It\u2019s even caught the attention of former figure skater Johnny Weir, so you know it\u2019s become quite a hit.  However, the question stands: Does it deserve the hype?  Today, I take a look at Yuri!!! on ICE, the 2016 anime born to make history.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nYuri on Ice's popularity is mostly due to its easily accessible and relatable story about a figure skater climbing up the ranks after hitting rock bottom and his interactions with other competitors and his coach.  The plot may seem like your typical underdog story, however Yuri on Ice takes it in a different direction.  Rather than focusing on getting better at figure skating, the anime focuses more on building Yuri\u2019s confidence.  The main conflict isn\u2019t that he can\u2019t skate, it\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t have the confidence to.  For a lot of people, the show may come off as nothing but a yaoi anime that has figure skating in it, and that\u2019s something that can either be liked or hated.  However, the show offers so much more than that. I thin that it ties in with the story quite well as their relationship has a strong contribution to Yuri's confidence and Viktors motivation for teaching him.  The story may seem simple, but it's the character's that make it so much more better, which we'll get into right now.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe character\u2019s are probably the strongest point in this anime.  Yuri is a good-natured guy that most of us can relate to, but what makes him such a great character is his determination and passion for ice skating.  Watching him mature into a confident, young skater with Victor's guidance is more than worth the price of admission.  Yuri on Ice has one of the best developed characters i've seen in a long time; Yuri himself is a great character with real emotions, real motivations, and his journey throughout the series is both satisfying and enjoyable to watch.  Yuri isn\u2019t the only standout, as Victor is the exact opposite of him, being much more lively and bubbly.  He\u2019s just a delight to watch, both on and off the ice, but still maintains his wisdom and sympathy for Yuri\u2019s inner struggle.  Whether you think the main duo\u2019s relationship is platonic or not, it\u2019s a genuine connection that immensely helps in their character development.  Yuri and Victor is one of the anime\u2019s strongest points, and the moments between them are such a joy to watch.  Yurio is your typical tsundere-ish rival, although he doesn\u2019t mature by the end unlike the rest of the cast.  The rest of the skaters are likable in their own right, although there are a few that you never hear from after their performances.  They\u2019re just there to fill in the gaps.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the story and characters work due to the incredible amount of heart at it\u2019s core.  You genuinely feel for these characters; their struggles, their downfalls, and their uprisings are what make the series so enjoyable to watch.  Of course, some characters get set aside, never to be seen again, but the characters that we DO see are great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't anything special, save for a few tracks: the OP, History Maker is one of the most upbeat and well-animated openings i\u2019ve seen.  The single track simply called Yuri on Ice encompasses the main character\u2019s story throughout the anime, telling a story within the song.  As I said, soundtrack is solid save for those two tracks; nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\r\nI have a love-hate relationship with the animation of this anime.  When off the ice, the animation is decent to look at; MAPPA, the studio behind such series as Terror in Resonance and Rage of Bahamut: Genesis did a decent job of things like character designs and backgrounds.  However, one of the strongest points of the anime is the skating sequences.  Man, they are a joy to watch.  Former Japanese figure skater Kenji Miyamoto handled the choreography, and the passion poured into the routines make them impossible to take your eyes off of.  Unfortunately, the art itself isn\u2019t consistent, as you\u2019ll mostly see shots of poorly animated skaters in the middle of performances.  In my opinion, that\u2019s a very small complaint that didn\u2019t take away from my enjoyment of the anime.  In short, the skating sequences are fantastic, and the animation itself is fine to look at most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nWednesdays aren\u2019t the same anymore without Yuri!!! On ICE.  Much like how Ping Pong: The Animation made me so invested in a sport that I had no interest in prior, YoI got me invested into figure skating; every performance, I smiled every time a skater would get a jump right, or if they nailed a step sequence.  The anime manages to be what it set out to be, and does it in flying colors. Even if all buildup isn't paid off, the series is still satisfying enough, and ends in a way where it\u2019s open for a second season. Hopefully we get to see a continuation of Yuri, Victor and everyone else\u2019s journey as they continue to make history.\\n\\n\r\nYuri!!! on ICE gets an A-",

            "content": "GENERAL AND STORY: Firstly, some things I really appreciate that the anime did and managed to pull it off well, which made me enjoy the anime even more.\r\n1. Now most of your average sports animes take place in high school and the story goes from 0-hero as the protagonist(s) is/are beginning to develop and practice their skills in that sport and slowly move on to local and/or state level championships related to that sport. HOWEVER, YOI completely takes this cliche plot-line and throws it away. We already know that Yuuri is a very accomplished and brilliant ice skate since he was good enough to enterthe Grand-Prix final in the first place. It's hero- (well not exactly 0) but it's about Yuuri's downfall as well as his COMEBACK into the world of ice skating. That's what makes it more unique and separates it from cliche sports anime tropes. \\n\\n\r\n2. (Many people know YOI for mainly this reason) but the HEALTHY, beautiful depiction of a LGBT (MLM) relationship. No queer-bating, no unnecessary drama between the two or sexualisation of their relationship. Yuri and Victor's relationship is portrayed as a beautiful bond between two men who are soulmates and nothing else. \\n\\n\r\n3. The plot-twists! Many people thought that this anime would end up being the cliche \"Victor is taking advantage of Yuuri to get fresh publicity etc\" HOWEVER, episode 10 reveals all and the plot twist is a sweet and funny one that you wouldn't expect. (Example of good writing)\\n\\n\r\nART: (SOLID 8) Beautifully choreographed skating sequences and generally smooth animation. HOWEVER, there are sometimes mild errors in the animation which is of course because of the budget limitations, otherwise generally visually pleasing animation with good choreography and beautiful scenery. Also, the skaters's competition outfits are diverse and beautifully made.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: (10) Firstly, the sound effect of the ice skates gliding through the ice is excellent and very realistic. The OP and ED are both fabulous. The best thing is the original music composed for each of the skaters's routines, beautiful and diverse range of music which told each of the skaters's different stories.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: (9) Diverse range of well-written characters who didn't simply succumb to stereotypes. Yuuri is an excellently written protagonist- all the hurdles and problems he faced with himself (self-doubt etc) are very real and not just bullshit problems you see certain protagonists face like \"O shit does {love interest} like me?? What am i gonna do???\" Also, the unreliable narrator trope is handled wonderfully, none of us saw that plot-twist coming did we? ;) \\n\r\nAlso, Victor is more than just the typical shallow, self-absorbed heartthrob you would think he is. He's a loving and supportive character who is super talented and pours his heart out into what he does.\\n\r\nFinally, we are introduced to many characters from different countries (some which we see only for a short 1 or 2 episodes) HOWEVER, none of them are boring two-dimensional characters, all of them have their own unique personality.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Most of the points for why I enjoyed this anime so much is already mentioned above, so all I'm going to say is that I really enjoyed watching Yuuri and Victor's journey to the next Grand-Prix final. It was a beautiful story which destroyed stereotypes, gave us a lovely MLM relationship, funny moments, interesting characters, beautiful music, superb ice-skating sequences and a story of learning to accept yourself no matter how bad you mess up.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ah. What can I say? You see that high rating right? This show very much is of that high quality. And all those soft romantic momentsthat people who are 16+ might probably enjoy this show more. But still you just have to watch the skating sequences!\\n\\n\r\nStory [10/10]: Solid story build up. And really one season is not enough to show a sports story. Very well choreographed skating sequences. Just watch them. You'll enjoy them.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation [10/10]: My god, Victor has such a seductive, slim and  a very well toned body!! I also liked the drawings in the opening song of the show. If you are a girl, you'll have a feast for your eyes watching Victor ;) Very nicely drawn and a nice flow of animation there. All characters and scenery are also well drawn and distinctive. All skating sequences have an excellent flow making it easy to see the choreography for the most part. Probably it was because I kept reading the subtitles too during these sequences, that's why I might have missed some things. And I must must mention all the sweet moments like Victor and Yuri hugging each other just before Yuri's performance or their tiny gestures here and there that were so so cute and full of love. Love watching such animation sequences and I really wish Japanese animators will do more of such in future shows as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8/10]: Opening and ending theme songs are very catchy. Yuri on Ice song of Yuri's free skate program is THE BEST!!! They could have done original instrumental songs for the other characters' skate programs too. I didn't enjoy the other songs as much so a slightly lower score for sound. Voice actors as always have done a fantabulous job and a thousand salutes to all for putting life and uniqueness into each and every character. Get the same feeling while hearing any anime show actually. These voice actors- just how can they sound so so accurate each and every time!!?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]: The most important part of making Yuri on Ice such a superb show. Each character has a unique personality. Yuri, Victor and Yuri Plisetsky's interactions with each other are really the backbone of this show. Victor has a very pleasant personality, Yuri is that typical awkward guy character who surprisingly does some bold things sometimes. Yuri Plisetsky is a typical arrogant teenager also having some soft spots beneath that attitude. Other than that I liked Mickey and Sala's character development too, though there's wasn't a very long appearance. The 3 skating otaku kids of Yuri's friend are quite funny. I'm glad that even though there are so many BL undertones in this show, the animators didn't go too much over board showing them. Else it would have spoiled the mood set in each episode by all the skating sequences.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]: I enjoyed this show to the max. Excellent skating sequences in each episode, very nice character development. And very very sweets moments in between. Highly highly recommended to watch!! :)",

That is until his fellow skater and hero since childhood, Victor Nikiforov, watches one of his performances and vows to coach him until he wins his first Grand Prix.\r\nStory (7)\r\nThe story of Yuri!!! On ICE is a simple one. As a rule, this tends not to bother me with sports anime, I simply enjoy watching characters give it their all to achieve a goal or to improve, all the while developing as characters. However, it was hard to maintain enjoyment levels watching the same performancesover and over again. As the show\u2019s animation and art was so attractive, I would have liked to have seen a wider variety of performances. Also, as Yuri K\u2019s development hinged on Victor\u2019s approval, it seemed hollow. I had other hang-ups about the relationship between these two characters, but I\u2019ll come on to that later. Nevertheless, I felt that the show successfully accomplished what it set out to be: a beautifully packaged sports anime with strong homoerotic undertones.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8)\\n\r\nI thought that the animation/art was stunning. Whilst other people appear to have problems with the animation, citing too few frames per second, I had no issues with it. Unless you\u2019re an animator or are looking for said problems, I expect that you, too, won\u2019t have any issues.\\n\\n\r\nMusic (8)\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed all of the music used as part of the show, including the background music, the OP/EDs, and the pieces used as part of the skaters\u2019 performances.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5)\\n\r\nThis show had a wide variety of characters, however, many of them settled comfortably into tropes and weren\u2019t developed much at all. Nevertheless, this is understandable given the number of characters and the show\u2019s length. What I struggled with more was the relationship between Victor and Yuri K. I don\u2019t have a problem with homosexual (or borderline homosexual) relationships, it\u2019s just that I often found myself questioning the sincerity of theirs. During episode one it was implied that Yuri had feelings for his childhood friend (a woman), Victor immediately came on to Yuri with the force (and subtlety) of a bulldozer, and the two characters seemed to spend very little screen time actually getting to know one another, so for me it seemed contrived simply to attract a certain kind of viewer. To summarise, the relationship between Victor and Yuri felt vacuous and hollow, which is problematic, given how much of the show\u2019s runtime was dedicated to it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment (7)\\n\r\nDespite the show\u2019s flaws, I would say that it was enjoyable overall. It was exactly what it set out to be and I can\u2019t fault it for that. I just wish that it could\u2019ve been a little more ambitious, maybe throwing in a wider variety of routines and further developing its characters and their relationships to each other.",

            "content": "TL;DR: I came to the series with its flaws and hype in mind and ended up loving it anyway. It's an amazing series. Go watch it. \r\nI tried very hard to view YOI as objectively as possible while watching. Throughout each episode, I kept in mind both the hype of the series as well as its complaints and flaws since I figured this would give me the best chance of viewing it with a fresh mind.\r\nAnd having said that, I absolutely LOVED YOI and every moment of it. Everything from the beauty and hardship of figure skating to the character development and sense of unity,YOI is honestly a treasure.  As an early 20s lesbian hoping to see more down-to-earth same-sex relationships in her share of anime, I loved the brazenness of a m/m relationship beneath a sports anime. Some people have complained that this is an arguably 'gay for sake' series but I've seen more than enough BL series and other eye-candy sports anime and I've never seen anything come close to what Yuri on Ice has put out. The controversial moment when Yuri and Victor exchange rings, for example, is downplayed of course but I was more interested in the reaction from their friends. The thought of them being married is met with unadulterated congratulations and there's no overwhelmingly stupid 'But! We're both men!!' overshadowing it, which seems to preside in most BL material. Instead it is viewed as merely another thing they can strive towards.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, I really, truly believe calling YOI 'queerbait' is kind of offensive and a disservice to the meaning behind the series as a whole. Throughout Yuri's performances we are constantly reminded of the different types of love whether it be platonic, sensual or otherwise and are shown how it can be integrated in the skaters' routines to deliver artistically beautiful performances. I mean I get it: certain scenes could be purely fanservice, but isn't this the case with most comedic romance series'? I'll fall over if I have to watch another dramatic f/m scene or see some 'hilariously' perverse misunderstanding involving boobs and hot tubs. YOI offers a fraction of this and actually puts out meaningful sequences and story alongside it instead. \\n\\n\r\nYOI isn't a masterpiece, but comes close to being so to me personally. The characters in all their diverse glory are exquisitely developed in such a way as to remind us of the people behind the performances and the pressure. Yuri(o!) for example (Yuri's rival), develops in the series to become more personable than arguably Yuri himself, showing his true intentions and will to further encourage others in order to better himself. Hell, even JJ won me over a little after I got over his annoying catchphrases. A prevalent theme in YOI is unity and sportsmanship: the skaters come together to cheer each other on and show their support when they make errors. It's a really heartwarming thing to see. \\n\\n\r\nAs a sidebar, a really cool thing about this anime I noticed was the integration of social media. It's done is such a subtle way it made the series pretty endearing and a lot more down-to-earth. The end Insta-credits are seriously cute. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I loved it. Sorry. \\n\r\nAnd no, I don't have Yuri on Ice as my ringtone.",

            "content": "If you're an anime fan as of the Fall 2016 season you've almost certainly heard of and probably watched Yuri on Ice. But if you haven't watched it yet, or you're new to anime, you may be wondering - can a show about gay ice skaters really be so good? Yes, it can. \r\nGoing into this I should say that I'm a young woman - the target demographic for this series. I know straight guys who do like YoI but the female demo is likely to get more out of it. \r\n-Story- \r\nThe story is pretty standard for a sports anime - though, unlike inother sports, the main character isn't part of a team. In terms of plot development there aren't any major surprises - the motivation to watch comes more from moment-to-moment character interactions and the ice skating sections. \\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nAs a character-driven story, where YoI really shines is with its' characters. The main 3 characters are the titular Japanese figure skater Yuri, world champion Viktor, and the young Russian Yuri (or Yurio), a rival to our protagonist. It sounds corny, but one of the most enjoyable aspects of YoI is seeing Yuri's character grow from where he is at the start of the series to where he is at the end. \\n\\n\r\nOfcourse the most famous aspect of YoI is the gay relationship between Yuri and Viktor. I'm not exactly qualified to consider this as a depiction of LGBT relationships in anime or fiction generally, but I genuinely think this is a well-written and likeable romance / love story, not just a gay one. The story in-universe doesn't even dwell on the the relationship being gay - noone in YoI ever questions that aspect. Later developments in their relationship in the second half of the series feel quite normal and believable, for me atleast, which is a sign of good writing. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yeah, as part of the target demographic I have to say the fanservice and the development of Y/V's relationship is really good (especially eps 7/10/end of ep12). I'm not usually the biggest fan of romance in fiction but this was different - I found myself really liking the two MCs and wanting them to get together.  There's some goofy homoerotic moments earlier on, but didn't feel that out of place with YoI being a lighthearted series. \\n\\n\r\nFor a 12 episode series YoI does a decent job with the supporting characters, especially the other skaters who make it to the grand prix. None of them have a great amount of depth, but some of them are memorable and you feel some sympathy when they lose. And then there's the Russian Yuri / Yurio - who I liked as a character, a good counterpart to the two MCs, though the story kinda struggles with giving him a role, before settling on him being the Japanese Yuri's main rival. \\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\\n\r\nThe animators did a very good job with what must have been a pretty limited budget. The quality of the animation does vary with the budget clearly being lavished on some scenes more than others - also, some of the skating animations are reused - but overall YoI is pleasing on the eye, especially in the skating sequences. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound- \\n\\n\r\nThe characters voice actors do well in giving the MCs and some of the other skaters a distinctive sound to them - especially Viktor's VA which has a kind of foreign sound to my ears, appropriate for a Russian character. The OP and ED songs are very catchy and memorable (the OP is accompanied with some beautiful animation). \\n\\n\r\nAs for the dub - Yuri sounds fine, but it has Russian accents on the Russian characters - which you may think makes sense, but half of the chars in the series are Russian so it gets pretty OTT. After a while though I found the Russian accents sort of endearing. I'd recommend watching it with subs the first time round, the dub's kinda amusing a 2nd time round. \\n\\n\r\n- Flaws- \\n\\n\r\nDespite my love for YoI, I definitely recognise it has a number of flaws.\\n\\n\r\n- The ending, while satisfactory, is a bit anticlimatic. There's going to be a Season 2 so it doesn't need to wrap everything up. However, when the script was written the creators probably thought it'd be only a 1-series story so the buildup of the story up to ep12 feels a little off. \\n\r\n- The attempts at drama fall flat on their face. The couple of dramatic moments where one of the two MCs threaten to split up aren't really believable as we know it'll be resolved by the end of the episode. Though the first of these instances in ep 7 does get an amazing payoff. \\n\r\n- as previously mentioned, there are occasional dips in animation quality. \\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first heard of YoI I wasn't expecting it to be anywhere near this good. On paper it shouldn't be that great, but Yuri on Ice in my view far exceeds its' elevator pitch. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a rare anime that is quite as enjoyable and fun, and obviously made with as much love for its' subject matter as this one is; an anime that drew back myself and countless other anime fans week after week to find out where the writers would take the characters next. While not all anime watchers will enjoy it as much as I and the rest of my demographic did, YoI is definitely an show all anime fans owe it to themselves to watch. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Yuri!!! on Ice,\r\nI've been looking forward to watching this for a while now, and maybe it's my expectations that gave me the ending opinions I have on this, or maybe it's just how good it is.\r\nI was impressed with this from the very beginning, the opening had me excited for what I was getting into. The song, the animation for it. \r\nThe characters were great as soon as I met them, there's been a lot of hype about this so it's surprising that they met the expectations that had been built up for me, yet without even knowing what I should be expecting? \r\nThe animationis gorgeous, as is the character design. The contrast between Yuuri, Yuri(o) and Victor is fantastic, they're individual from each other, yet you can still pick up their similarities. \\n\\n\r\nYuuri has his dreams of ice skating and they seemed to be slipping away from him, but he always held onto his inspiration whom was Victor. So he's incredibly surprised when Victor suddenly appears saying he wants to coach Yuuri. Watching the relationship between the two of them evolve is one of my favourite parts of this series, obviously one of the big deals about this is the possible yaoi undertones, which I fully support between the two of them. \\n\\n\r\nThis is possibly the very first sport anime I've watched, they're generally not something I enjoy, but I had a lot of fun watching this. It's not all sport, yes it's the main subject but there's enough substance in other things to draw you in. I think I'll actually make an effort to watch other sports anime now that I've watched this, it's shown me how interesting and engrossing they can be.\\n\\n\r\nYou really feel like you're going through the events with them, you tense up wondering whether the person is going to pull off their move or make a mistake, you anticipate what their scores will be and where they'll place in the rankings. It does an incredibly good job of sucking you into the world, and it's exactly where I wanted to be.\\n\\n\r\nI was actually sad it ended where it did, I wanted more. But there's such a thing of too much of a good thing and it's good it ended, though with the tease of the possibility of more which is exciting. I loved watching this, it charmed me and I can see why it's so popular. If you enjoy sports, or even if you don't, this is something that should go on your list of things to watch.. Sooner rather than later.",

            "content": "We live in an ever changing world. Things that were considered unacceptable even 10 years ago are becoming more and more commonplace. Covering these types of things can be tricky, but more and more people are stepping up to the plate in an attempt to make them more welcome and accessible. There are some people out there who will avoid this series and everything about it solely based on it's subject matter. This is a big mistake, because \"Yuri!!! on Ice\" is a series brimming with positivity, wit and charm that makes watching it worth your time. \r\nPlot:\r\n\t\"Yuri!!! on Ice\" has a very simplistic plot.Japanese figure skater Yuri Katsuki has been performing poorly at events, and as a result he contemplates retirement. Viktor Nikiforov, a Russian figure skater idolized by many, Yuri included, sees a video of Yuri privately performing his recent championship-winning routine. Viktor is moved by his rendition, and goes to Japan to find Yuri and become his coach in order to help him win the next Grand Prix Finals. The series follows this plot to the end, introducing new characters and building relationships along the way, which is where this series shines. There is a missed opportunity for a chance to teach the viewer some of the basics of figure skating, however. During routines there are announcers critiquing the performance, much as they would if you were to watch a real figure skating event. They say the types of spins the characters are about to do, such as \"Quadruple Toe Loop\" or \"Triple Salchow\", but they never explain the difference between the two so a viewer that doesn't know anything about figure skating, myself included, isn't going to understand why these moves are impressive. They do go to the effort of explaining that having a raised arm going into a jump gets them more difficulty points, so there was easily a chance for them to go into further detail about how competitive figure skating works.\\n\r\n\t\"Yuri!!! on Ice\" is not so much about the plot, but about the characters as they realize their passions for figure skating as well as their budding relationships with each other. There are a few moments that come off as kind of cringe worthy and I do think that near the end, the skating needed to be broken up a little more with some of the off ice scenes that focused on the characters. Overall, it is a strong plot driven by its enjoyable characters that push this series along. 8/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n\tThe series main focus is on Yuri, Viktor, and the fifteen year old Russian skater Yuri Plisetsky, also known as Yurio. They get the brunt of development, as their characters and relationships are fleshed out entirely from start to finish. \\n\r\n\tVitkor is a fun loving, energetic man who's passionate style is quite often on display. He has a very straightforward, \"tell it like it is\" demeanor thats disguised by a charming exuberance. His beaming personality lights up the screen whenever he is front and center, weather he is being playful and friendly , or stern and serious. His passion for figure skating is unwavering, but it's the intamate moments he has with both Yuri and Yurio that make his feelings for the sport oh so apparant. \\n\r\n\tOn the flip side, we have Yuri, who is a complete contrast to Viktor. At first, Yuri had a lack of self-esteem. He would often second guess himself, apologize for anything and everything he though he did wrong, never really being sure of himself. It's through his relationships with everyone he meets that he is able to overcome his self doubt and improve as a skater and person. It's easy for a character like this to become annoying quickly, buy luckily Yuri never really does. Yuri puts significant effort into improving himself as a skater and as a person, and because of that you want to see him succeed. You want to see all that hard work pay off. Alot of his shortcomings are played for comedy, which was an excellent decision, because it causes him to come off as likable rather than melodramatic.\\n\r\n\tYurio is brat and a loudmouth, but that doesn't mean he is a poor character. He skates because he wants to be the best, and has negative feelings towards those he sees as a threat to that goal. He is confident to say the least, but throughout you get glimpses of vulnerability that help humanize him. The personality he puts forth makes him seem cold and unfriendly, but despite that, he doesn't come off in a way that makes you dislike him. He comes off as another skater that has passion for the sport, and wants more than anything to hone his skills and become the best he can be. \\n\r\n\tThere are many supporting characters, all of which have their own motivations. There are characters like Phichit Chulanont, who's goal is to inspire his home country of Thailand to embrace figure skating, and Christophe Giacometti, who's inspiration comes from sharing a podium with Viktor, preferably with a gold medal around his neck. These characters do well in support, but this series is all about the main three. Even Yurio can take a backseat at times to Yuri and Viktor, but this is generally ok, as the relationship between these two is the shows driving force. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n\tThe art style of \"Yuri!!! on Ice\" is definitely one of its strongest qualities. Character designs are clean and nice to look at, as are the costumes that the skaters wear during their performances. The animation of the skating sequences is mostly good. There is a bit of CG that is noticeable, and sometimes the animation from one scene to another can look sort of choppy, but it isn't obvious enough to detract from the overall quality of the scenes. There is a suprising amount of detail during moments where characters are doing spins and step sequences. The art remains largely unchanged during moments off ice, save for the fact that they aren't spinning at high speeds. Colors are vibrant and clean, making this series an easy one to pick up based on animation style alone. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\n\tThe OST for \"Yuri!!! on Ice\" is a mixed bag for me. While I really enjoy the orchestral score, especially the track our title character free skates to, the tracks that play during most of the short program skates are boring, bordering on cheesy. They don't give me the sort of emotion that a track needs to make it memorable. The opening and ending theme do exactly that. The opening theme is a grand affair, littered with horns and a dubstep-esque feel that do what they set out to do. The ending theme is an upbeat song with a similar EDM style that makes keeps the hype going well after the episode has ended. The sound effects themselves are truly wonderful. The sound of skates meeting ice during the appropriate scenes are wonderfully accurate to how that type of thing would actually sound, helping add to the immersion. \\n\r\n\tThe voice acting in this series is superb. Jerry Jewel and Micah Solusod have had previous experience doing Russian accents, so choosing them as Viktor and Yurio respectively made perfect sense. Both take an episode or two to come into their own as the characters but they both do very good jobs with their roles. Josh Grelle was downright perfect as Yuri. Grelle's ability to reach both higher and lower registers really helps with a character that switches between the two fairly often. As a show with multiple nationalities on display, so to are those countries accents. Most are good, but one of them was quite distracting to me. 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n\t\"Yuri!!! on Ice\" has the potential to be a very important series down the road by handling its subject matter the way it does. Never in this series does this subject become a spectacle. Never does it become a distraction. Never does it become a problem. It is simply another part of what makes these characters so great and worth watching. \\n",

There are a shit ton of subplots through the other competitors, does anyone honestly care about these other people?

            "content": "So now that I've finally watched this really popular anime from two years ago, the only summary that comes to mind is: \"What did I expect?\"\r\nIf I said that I am a fan of sports-focused anime, I'd be lying. I am obssessed with beautiful art styles and outstanding animation though, so after having it recommended for way too long, I gave up and spent some time with Yuri!!! on Ice.\r\nAnd to be fair, I already knew what I'm gonna get out of it. Some incredibly drawn scenes, breathtaking choreographies, a lot of innuendos and most importantly - a romance between two main male characters. And,surprisingly, it did work in a way.\\n\r\nSince it's a series about ice skaters, everyone can justify a bit (or more) of feminine, tight suits wearing men. Everything here is shiny, pretty, mesmerizing, and attractive in a way.\\n\r\nYes, I gotta admit, something about all these dancing boys who blush at basically everything, something about how they interact with one another and, obviously, how they show themselves off on a rink is just hot and it may be hard to turn your sight away.\\n\r\nOf course, as I mentioned earlier, the main story is suplemented with a romance between main character, Yuri, and his coach, Victor. And it also works!\\n\r\nIn this world, where everyone expresses their gratitude by hugs, crying and tender gestures, it's only common sense for those two to start a romantic relationship. We can see it's development and I just can't help but say that it is... Cute. Very cute even.\\n\r\nBut it all just seems really pale when compared to the musical side of this show. \\n\r\nI mean, it makes sense that an anime focused on dancing has a great soundtrack, but here the creators went a bit further. Different songs used by different characters perfectly mirror their personalities and just sound amazing overall. I really listened to some of them after I finished the show and that is unusual for me!\\n\r\nSo even if the story is pretty basic and follows the usual themes of getting from rock bottom to the top of the world, everything surrounding the main plot is is so enjoyable, that you don't really mind some cliches. It's not a must-watch for everyone but it is a nice little show to watch on a cold, winter evening.",

            "content": "Yuri!!! on ICE is a sports anime that provides a glimpse into the world of competitive male figure skating. As someone that enjoys watching figure skating, this anime was something I naturally wanted to check out. \r\nStory: I liked that the story focused on pro athletes as opposed to amateur ones. It shows that even pros have their struggles and lessens the cliche of novice athletes who suddenly finds themselves to be masters at the sport. However, I wished that the story focused a bit more on the training portions of the athletes to better show their struggles and improvement. In this aspect the showdid more telling than showing. In addition, I found the premise of Victor acting as Yuri's coach was a bit unrealistic (despite the show later revealing the reason) and the ending felt more like it done by the creators just to spite fans and create the opportunity for a second season. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: In keeping with the nature of the show, the male characters in here are pretty boys. The costumes are pretty though it was a bit disappointing to see Yuri use Victor's costumes than have his own set. The initial animation was stunning and smooth but there was a noticeable drop in quality as the show continued. There were a lot of recycled animations both from a skating performance perspective and flashbacks. I would have enjoyed the show more if each of the skaters used a different set of movements for their short programs and free skate events at each cup and at the grand prix. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I was never a fan of the opening theme but I did enjoy some of the music used by the skaters during their performances, especially Eros. Other than that, the background music is nothing stellar to characterize memorable moments and the same songs are used in each performance. I watched a bit of the English dub as well. I've found that the dub tries to build in more accents while the Japanese voice actors are much more serious. While the accents are sometimes funny to hear, they make it much more difficult to comprehend what was said. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The show features a wide variety of characters from different countries. However, development was only really placed on a few of the main characters. It was interesting to see Yuri becoming more confident of his skating, Victor trying to be a better coach, and Yurio beginning to develop more friendships. The relationship between Victor and Yuri, while strongly suggested and cute at times, was sometimes a bit awkward. It felt more like the relationship occurred because the two are the main characters as opposed to there being a more natural chemistry. However, Victor's personality was also something that surprised me the most as he has both a serious side and an extremely silly one. The other characters only really got monologues during their skating routines to give some insights into their motives and backstories but you don't see them actually changing. The character development was also a little choppy and hurried which could have been due to the show only have 12 episodes. Perhaps if there had been 24 episodes the development would have been a bit smoother.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: Despite its flaws, I really enjoyed watching the skating performances of the show and would look forward to a second season.",

            "content": "I hate yaoi. \r\nYes, you read that right. I repeat. I hate yaoi. I hate anything that even has hints of yaoi. You may call me homophobic or close-minded but that's what I truly feel. And mind you, I don't hate the LGBTQ community nor do I have anything against those who are fans of yaoi. It's just not my cup of tea. \r\nSo, why the heck am I here writing a review on one of the most popular BL anime of all time? Believe me, up till now I can't believe I watched this. A lot of my friends kept on pestering me togive it a chance even though I countlessly told them I hate yaoi. So, for the sake of my peace of mind, I finally gave it a try. \\n\\n\r\nAnd surprisingly, I... didn't hate it. I actually like it. \\n\\n\r\nIt helped a lot that I'm a huge fan of shounen, drama, and sports genre. While watching this, I was constantly reminded of Welcome to the Ballroom (another great sports anime) and that's a good thing because I really love that. I was on my way on giving this a solid 10 but then... the ending happened. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I won't go too much into detail. All I can say is, it's so obvious the creators didn't expect that Yuri on Ice will get massively popular. It's like they're travelling on path A for a long time but then, when they're about to reach the end, suddenly turned to path B and go on a brand new adventure. If done right, it's fine. However, in this case, it backfired. \\n\\n\r\nIf by any chance someone who thought the ending was perfect/fine read this and disagrees with me, feel free to state your opinion. Just know that I won't reply nor even read it. \\n\\n\r\nSo since that happened, I settled for an 8. The critic writer in me just can't let it pass. \\n\\n\\n\r\n~[Story]~\\n\\n\r\nThe story's good. It's enticing and really draws you into their world. I never thought figure skating would be very interesting! However, it employs the usual formula often seen in sports anime. Nothing too original but it's still very entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n~[Art]~\\n\r\nThe art's nice. I love the diversity in this series by showing people from various nationalities with a distinct feature in each character. It was a really nice touch. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n~[Sound[~\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the two strengths of this anime. I love every soundtrack featured here. Especially the opening \"History Maker\". Before watching Yuri on Ice, I always thought its opening song is one of the best out there. And now that I've seen the anime, it added a lot of emotional depth to the song making me love it even more. \\n\\n\r\nBut even so, Shall We Skate is still my most favorite song. Theme of King JJ is second. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n~[Characters]~\\n\\n\r\nThis is the other strength of this anime and in my opinion, its best quality. The characters are just lovable. There was hardly any character that was set aside. Almost everyone had a role and the creators made sure each of them will have a screen time on the last episode which is something not every anime do. \\n\\n\r\nI'm very impressed that they were able to flesh out as many characters as possible in the span of 12 episodes. I found myself getting attached even to those who barely had any screen time. Each one of them creates an impact to the viewer to the point I don't root for the main protagonist that much. I still want him to win of course, but I just can't help but be swayed over by his rivals. \\n\\n\r\nThat just shows how magnificent the cast are. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development in almost every person that showed up in a show is hard to pull off. But they did. Very impressive. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n~[Conclusion]~\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Yuri on Ice is a great anime. I, now, completely understand why it gathered a huge following and why a lot of my friends kept on telling me to try it out. The story's good, the art's nice, the sound's awesome, and the characters are great. I'm glad I gave it a try. \\n\\n\r\nSo, did this help lessen my hatred over yaoi? Nope. I enjoyed this a lot but I'm still not a fan of BL. I won't suddenly jump ship just because of this anime. It's still not my cup of tea and I don't think it'll ever be BUT I'll watch season 2 in case they release one. \\n\\n\r\nAfter all, Yuri on Ice is the first and last BL anime I'll ever watch. \\n\\n\r\nP.S.: Phichit is #besthusbando.",

As such, it didn't really commit to either story, which left the anime in quite a mess.\r\nOf the three main characters, Yuri Plisetsky was the most interesting, as he was the character who had the most well fleshed out backstory, sadly he was also the character who had the lest screen time.  Victor wasn't really given any backstory, and by the time we got it, it was very little too late.  Victor could easily beseen as a walking plot device, there to motivate the flip flopping, and confusing narrative of the protagonist Yuri Katsuki.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing that can be said for the series was the opening musical sequence, quite a catchy tune.  And the hope that this series, as average as it is, because of it's commercial success (most especially amongst the young female demographic) lead other studios or writers to come up with a better type of story, with far more interesting characters and a far more committed and less ambiguous gay relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a bad story, but it's not what I'd consider that good, and it certainly doesn't live up the hype.

            "content": "In all honesty, Yuri!!! on Ice isn't as good as some may leave you to believe.\r\nHowever, that doesn't mean it was bad.\r\nMost of the comments I've seen about this series shows the extremes; you either liked it, or you hated it. \r\nAdmittedly, YoI is and will probably continue to be one of my favorite animes, but at a subjective stand point, there are flaws.\r\nArt: The art is a train wreck. I admit this. It's completely all over the place, and very inconsistent. The only reason I gave it a 5/10 is for the chibis, that surprisingly work very well with the tone of the moment,and the beginning episodes where the animation is still in it's prime stages. \\n\\n\r\nSound: If there was one thing this anime did absolutely perfectly, it was the music. History Makers, Eros, Agape, Stammi Vicino, You Only Live Once, Shall we Skate...these songs have been in my head ever since the first day I heard them. Half the songs I listen to nowadays is from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: And here is where the show makes, perhaps, it's biggest flaws (other than the art).\\n\\n\r\nYuuri K. is the average relatable, flawed character with a little flair that is his explicitly stated and explained anxiety. The show's depiction of this common mental disorder is very accurate in it's own right, but at some points it's just a plot point to add conflict into the story. \\n\\n\r\nViktor is the all-knowing mentor that is commonly found in self-growth stories, there to encourage and teach the main character. Admittedly, Viktor is my favorite character in YoI, which means I am slightly biased towards him. He does have his own minor flaws (his impulsiveness, forgetfulness, being painfully blunt, and how he seems incapable of handling Yuuri's anxiety at the Cup of China) but they don't flesh out his character enough to make him believable. \\n\\n\r\nYuri P./Yurio: Oh look, the typical angsty teen arrogant enough to believe he can take down the reigning 5-time-world-champion despite being half his age. Plot twist: he probably can. Don't get me wrong, I like Yurio, but his character is a typical rival-type against Yuuri. Don't believe me? Think about all the rivals Ash has had from Pokemon.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining cast, are, in reality, quite forgettable. Due to time constraints, their back stories are all rushed, and we never really get to fully connect with each of them. \\n\\n\r\nStory: I feel that, given more thought and time, the story line of YoI could have been a lot better. There are just too many timeskips. From the first episode to the last, we cover a full year in-series, but within the first episode we're already skipping through three months from the Sochi Grand Prix to the Fukuoka World Championships, and between the Cup of China and Rostellecom Cup is another month where we completely miss any relationship development between Viktor and Yuuri after the you-know-what. The anime is too split between focusing on the relationship versus the skating, and it shows. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Alright, despite all this, I enjoyed watching (and re-watching....and re-watching again...) YoI. I can't possibly explain why, given how much I was bashing on it's plot and characters above, but something about YoI just makes it enjoyable for me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: YoI is a wonderful but unrealistic show about the homosexual relationship of an idol and his biggest fan while they both focus on the sport that has consumed both of their lives, with a side order of mental illness and a ton of side characters that sometimes make sense and sometimes don't. \\n\\n\r\nIt's an anime, people, it was never going to be fully realistic in the first place.",

            "content": "I'm sure there's all sorts of reviews already, so I'm starting with the Overall first. With the entire 12 episodes, there was a bit of strong fanservice, or at least, strong bromance as I want to redefine. So to say, I believe the plot and the animation along with soundtracks balanced out that if you ask me, with the addition of the general humor. I'd definitely recommend this to males as well for those reasons despite the 'bromance' involved. And small reminder, it's not any lesbian theme if that's what you're expecting from because of the title, 'Yuri' on Ice, since Yuri is also anobvious name that people seem to neglect (lol).\\n\\n\r\nStory, being an original story and concept, without derailing at the get-go, it got my solid attention. Every episode managed to hook me, mainly the choreography for every dance per character. You'd think there's no reason for Victor to coach Yuri K. except that was also proven wrong. Now another point is, it's realistic, the jumps and the falls, they're real and not easily perfected which was represented in the anime itself. I totally loved that. \\n\\n\r\nArt, the animation was really smooth from the get-go (unless you're those random frame-to-frame type). Like I've briefly mentioned, the choreograph fitted very well with everything especially to the soundtracks which I was very amazed with. They weren't even going overboard with the skin's pigment at all either, it was done well with consideration. The artwork, wasn't anything too much of an impact for me except those strong \"bromance\" moment so to say, still not much of any big change at all so 8, it was in that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound, again and again, I can't stop going on with this but the choreographing was really good. Every new soundtrack for new characters, it always fits and matches pretty accurate. I don't think a lot of anime can ever pull that off. Each character also has their own theme so adding that factor...it was an eccentric moment. Although some soundtracks/skates weren't my favorite moment, it was nonetheless very fitting. I'd say...it covers a wide range of various types of soundtracks in a sense, including the OP/ED song. Scored my 9 for these reasons.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, Yuri's strong attachment towards Victor as his inspiration and idol, and as a friend, you can see how Yuri keeps changing and growing after being a loser previously. Victor didn't appear out of the blue, and they both were struggling in their own ways. Victor struggling as a first time coach while Yuri aiming to be the Gold medalist. Other characters that came along the way, they've had their own moments and developments, each having their own goal and motivation. We can definitely see how they overcome the challenge as well along with adjusting to the pressures. There's not much of characters to hate honestly so, I find all the other characters being very great, a 9.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, a definite solid 9 leaning towards a 10 too, I definitely enjoyed everything in a nutshell. The jokes along with the strong emphasize of 'Bromance' was amusing, the various comments along with my own expectations of the outcome, it was a pleasant time waiting for each episode every week. Fan-theories everywhere, innuendos, etc., even the other characters made me lost myself (like the Heartbreaker guy and JJ). Lastly, I was definitely curious about this series for my own guilty motivation but otherwise, it definitely went beyond my expectation in some ways.",

            "content": "As a figure skating fan, I was extremely excited for Yuri On Ice, and it went over the top when impressing me!\r\nStory: 9\r\nUnlike what seems to be most sports anime, Yuri On Ice displays the real struggles of athletes, as such it's very encouraging to see a non-high school related sports anime. The story follows a male in his early 20s known as Yuri Katsuki, a Japanese skater suffering multiple defeats and mistakes through out his career. As fate would have it, his long admired idol; Victor Nikforov, 5 time figure skating Grand Prix champion, has decided to take on the challenge of becoming Yuri'scoach, after a video of him online went viral of Yuri preforming one of Victor's most well known programs.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is very well done. Some of the programs however, I felt like they could've used better animation quality. Nonetheless, the artists for YOI did a fantastic job.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this is incredible! Such a wide arrange of music genres used, it's absolutely stunning. Let's not forget the wonderful opening of; History Maker that I on a daily basis, dab to and jam out to when no one is looking. As well the ending, oh sweet Jesus, I dance around to that shit, it is the good shit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nYuri on Ice is filled with a wide arrange of characters, as such they are so enjoyable and unique, I especially enjoy the concept of most of them being of different nationalities, though it is not new, it's really encouraging to see that.\\n\r\nAn example of this would be Phichit: it's not very common I see South-East Asian characters in anime, he's very admirable too and is ambitious to become Thailand's first ever Grand Prix winner, God I love me a character like that.\\n\r\nBut my personal favourite skater happens to be; Leo. It's all just because he reminds me of a personal favourite skater; Jason Brown.\\n\r\nAnd let's not forget ya boi Yuri Katsuki, my God he displays such good character development it's not even funny, he's a wonderfully written main protagonist. \\n\r\nAnd heavens, let's not forget such an amazing female cast; Minako is absolutely hilarious and relatable and Mila is such a bundle of joy, it's such a shame I would've loved to see her and Sala have a program of sorts. If we're being honest, Yuri On Ice seems to have the best female supporting cast of any sports anime I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs stated in the beginning of the review, I am a figure skating fan, and just knowing that a figure skating anime exist, it makes me so happy. Though I am more of a fan of the female programs, gotta love me some good 'ol fashion men programs too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nWhether you enjoy sports anime or not, Yuri On Ice is still a total must try. If you're honestly just watching it for the 'gay skaters' honey, you're in for just more than that.",

            "content": "Story: 6/10 \r\nYuri!!! On Ice caught my attention, because it was not set in a school. Seeing as most sports anime are set in schools with teenage characters, I found the idea of a cast with a wider range of ages interesting. Yuuri's development was fine and I liked how the production team used the 'unreliable narrator' and let some episodes be in a different character's point of view to flesh out another character. Good job in breaking the stereotypes! \r\nHowever, I found the plot development and dialogue rushed. Most of the story was 'word-for-word', the production team should've done the dialogue in a 'shownot tell' method which I think would have executed the story better. The comedy part is subjective but I found it funny. No offence, but the gay undertones in the show were cringey. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor a sports anime, the quality of the animation and art is substandard. Animation was rather inconsistent, for example, some skaters' performances are blurred compared to the major characters. The quality of animation dropped after the first few episodes. The design of the characters were good though. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic was well done, I liked the skaters' tracks, especially Yuuri's and JJ's, which were very memorable. The sound could have been improved, if they had added more fast-paced tracks to make the atmosphere more intense. For a competitive sports anime, the atmosphere is a little too laidback. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting section was excellent. All the voice actors are in character and their voices fitted their characters, especially Uchiyama Kouki (Yuri Plisetsky). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKatsuki Yuuri is the main protagonist of the show and he is the one undergoing development. His development was done nicely. \\n\\n\r\nVictor Nikiforov has a strong presence in the show and is a relateable character, in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nYuri Plisetsky is a unique character and unlike most younger characters in sports anime, he is more matured and very determined. This makes him stand out. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, the minor characters (especially those who did not end up in the Grand Prix Finals) were one-dimensional characters, who could have been further developed. The only exception to this is Georgi Popovich, who has a backstory behind his program. Maybe we'll be seeing that in the next season.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI had enjoyed the show  because of the humour, soundtrack and captivating characters.I'll be looking forward to a season 2, hopefully the later season would focus on the side characters, whom I think deserve more development. I found the show slightly disappointing as I did not find it as 'great' or 'amazing' as most people did. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI think that the show could have much more potential but sadly, most of it is wasted on the story. If you like shonen ai or yaoi, this show is for you.",

Most of it is amazing, but there are parts with cartoony looks that I don't like in anime.

            "content": "There is a word to describe this anime: poor.\r\nART : 6/10 - fair.\r\nThe art is rather good though. It has got its own style, between realism and cartoon, and it's pretty cool. Moreover, the quality of animation is sometimes outsanding. But, let's be honest: can you really use so many times the same animations in a 12-episode anime? I don't think so.\r\nSOUND : 8/10 - very good.\r\nYet, the sound is great. Some skating music themes are not excellent, the ending is awful, but the rest is really great. I found the soundtrack good, and it's rare enough to be stressed. The opening is one thebest I've ever heard. A pure masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER : 3/10 - poor.\\n\r\nHonestly, the main characters are boring. Yurio is okay. Yuri isn't really interesting. Victor isn't developed at all. Precisely, Yuri seems to have deep thoughts and a character development. The problem I'd like to raise is that it is never shown. So, we just see Yuki in different moods and we don't understand why he got so moody. So, it doesn't work. Victor, for his part... an empty character. You enjoy seeing him as a coach, but, otherwise, you haven't got anything to say about him - because the anime hasn't got anything to say about him!\\n\r\nThe minor characters are quite developed though. But it gets on your nerves. Shigatsu wa kimi no uso developed its minor character and it didn't bother because THE MAIN ONES WERE DEVELOPED. YURI !!! ON ICE's are not.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY : 3/10 - poor.\\n\r\nThe three first episodes were okay. They were not terrific, they were good enough. But they have a flaw that will be found several times in the anime: the scenaristic contrivances are obvious! The people who wrote this script were lazy. \"We need Yurio to find Victor? Let this random old man tell him with no reason!\"\\n\r\nBut what comes after the first competition between the two Yuris is horrifying. You just see people skate... sometimes the secondary characters have a little development. The relation between Yuri and Victor is just boring, and you don't understand why they like each other so much. You don't even understand if they're in love with each other or not. There. Is. No. Story. But. This. Skate. Competition. Some fanservice and skating don't make a story!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT : 5/10 - mediocre.\\n\r\nBut it's quite enjoyable though. The skating representations are pretty good and well animated, even though the CGI is sometimes laborious. And I guess the opening saves the day.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL : 3/10 - poor.\\n\r\nIt isn't totally awful. Sometimes, and I don't know why, it is pleasant. But this anime has got really dreadful flaws. The story is really boring... well, let's be honest: the story is absent! They didn't want to tell a story: they wanted to draw sexy guys skating and not daring to make out together (let alone the fact that they use a lot of the same images again and again and again...). It's not enough to make a good anime.\\n\r\nBut I didn't hate it. But the best word to decribe it is: \"Meh.\" The second best is \"poor.\"",

            "content": "Yuri on Ice is one of my Top 3 favorites and many may disagree but hey, there's a reason we all get to write a review and put our opinions on it.\r\n(Trying not to spoil)\r\nStory: 8\r\nMany people think Yuri on Ice only became famous since it features a Gay couple who is also the series' two main characters, however for me the story alone is amazing and would be successful even without it's main couple and it shouts out two major themes, Love and Determination.\r\nLove, in the series it discusses two types of Love which they explained to be Agape (Unconditional Love) and Eros (SexualLove), \"Eros is Fanservice?\" I hear you say? Well if you look into it more Eros could also be seen as Love for oneself while Agape could be Love for others around you.\\n\\n\r\nOur Two Yuris, Yuri katsuki and Yuri(o) Plisetsky already know the feeling of one of the other types of Love, in this case Yuri katsuki is being supported by thousands of Fans, his family and friends are all supporting him, However he has no confidence in himself (Agape, No Eros) And Yurio has plenty of confidence in himself but does not show love or support to pretty much anyone (Eros, No Agape)\\n\r\nWith our two Yuris, We learn what Love for others and love for oneself is like through Victor Nikiforov, someone who has already experienced both (Not explained how in the anime but will be in the upcoming movie 'Ice Adolescence').\\n\\n\r\nOur two Yuris experience or shows the audience an example of Determination as well. Yuri katsuki is determined to win gold and to make himself a better skater (Learning Eros) and Yuri Plisetsky has always been determined to earn for his family for they are not the wealthiest family, while also showing his support to people he meets (Learning Agape).\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nUnlike other animes that feature characters from different countries, YOI's artsyle makes it so you could easily see what race or what country they came from just by looking at them and honestly the details in each character is very accurate, Phichit for example who, at least the people I know in real life had thought he was Filipino despite him being Thai (Though that is understandable since it is said that Thai people and Filipinos look alike) And it's choices of colors throughout the series isn't Monochromatic, nor is it too colorful. The colors are just right.\\n\\n\r\nWhile many complain that the Opening is rather lazy, if you dig deeper to discover why that is is because YOI came from nowhere and the studio had a very limited amount of money to spend for this project. Another thing that is rather impressive is that the opening was only animated by one person and made within 2 weeks. Animation in general could be good and bad, really it's quite inconsistent. but for a project with VERY limited amounts of money? rather impressive.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the OP.\\n\r\nWhile it's nothing new for Anime to have a full english OP or at least a version of it, The opening is very catchy and wouldn't sound like something for an anime (From the many people I know, They told me it sounded more like something that would come from a disney movie or fairytale) And even though not relevant, it's quite easy to memorize (Well... I can't speak for those who can't speak English) And although not all, some anime's OP lyrics wouldn't be relevant AT ALL to the anime, But in 'History Maker' Each paragraph would represent each character or multiple characters (Mostly the chorus)\\n\\n\r\nThe ED including the one featured at Episode 10 is very catchy as well, very fitting for each of the endings as well. The Ending in general where it shows pictures of various characters through an app that is similar to instagram, the music has a happy tune, very upbeat too. For episode 10 (Spoilers, just read the next paragraph) It features our little Yuri, Drunk. The music fits PERFECTLY with very wacky singing.\\n\\n\r\nFor each skater's music in general\\n\r\nFor music such as \"King JJ' and \"Yuri on Ice\" which are two music that are supposed to represent the life/personality/feeling of two characters, JJ and Yuri. It represents them very well. With 'King JJ' it was able to do so with it's lyrics and tune while 'Yuri on Ice' doesn't have lyrics, just by listening to the music you could feel how Yuri does and how his adventure had been, riding this rollercoaster through music.\\n\\n\r\nMusic like Phichit's which for his free skate and short program are from a movie that was made in thailand, The music (to me) is very appropriate and accurate.\\n\\n\r\nOther random ones are very well made and written as well, may not be important as others but has a message through each one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nSo one of the biggest things about this Anime is the characters. it is something people often complain as well. YOI's characters are very likeable and relateable, even characters who were only properly seen in 1 or 2 episodes are liked/loved by the millions of fans. For example, Leo de Iglesia (tried calculating) had only properly appeared in the series for about less than 20 minutes all combined, and yet he is very relatable for those who find inspiration from music. Emil probably has only appeared for less than 10 minutes but is very well liked too. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems like because of the limited money this series had they threw in a bunch of characters even if it means you would know almost NOTHING about them, and yet they are so likeable, lovable and relatable that it only takes mere minutes for them to be onscreen.\\n\\n\r\n(A reason why many fans would like a season 2, there is still plenty to uncover about the story/stories of these characters)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nIt could get boring to watch the skating of characters that aren't even important at all to the story, even if that's so there is a moment/ scene in that episode that makes everything worth watching (somehow) and if you really want to be a super fan you could just sit back and relax instead of skipping to know more info about these characters (the useless but Interesting types) But in scenes of Yuri, Yurio and Victor? NEVER SKIP THOSE.\\n\\n\r\nBut in all seriousness when i came across this from the first episode I know I would enjoy this series a lot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nNow- Let me just clear something up. I absolutely am not a fan of this because of the ship, it is because of how the relationship grows. You think homophobes (Or if you are one yourself) would hate this? I have met plenty of people in real life and online who are absolutely against LGBT and yet Yuri on ice is what they say one of their favorite animes. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think this anime should only be praised for it's representation, but also for it's story because it's more than just something LGBT.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yuri on Ice: a spoiler free review\r\nWhen too much is not enough\r\n   Sometimes we go just a little too far. You tell the person you have a crush on you like them for the first time. You're nervously shaking from the adrenaline, you finally burst and tell them they are all you want, need and desire. They are being convinced. They see your side. They may like you too. But you keep going. You tell them how you couldn't bare to be without them for even a second longer. Your soap box turns into a soap factory. They start drawing back, eventually answeringin a \"I don't know...\"\\n\\n\r\n   It was a mixed bag I had for this show. At times I believed it actually cared for the characters, their feelings, motives and drives for change, but then it kept trying to sell me a product I already bought. There were moments in this show where I felt as vulnerable and worthless as Yuri was feeling and then there were moments where I thought about picking up the remote to fast forward.\\n\\n\r\n   It isn't against sports for a good sports drama can effectively use said sport to convey a certain drive. This show definitely did that. Those episodes were very well done. Highlights of the story. But where it failed was in its use of the sport. Or overuse. \\n\\n\r\n  It comes down to what we want out of a story. Do we want a story about ice skaters doing pretty things on ice or do we want a story about a coach and athlete finding a love and bond where no one thought possible. I personally like the second option I listed, and wished for more. It is a relationship worth developing instead of what this show seemed to have done which was explore it. \\n\\n\r\n   I want stories about people. People doing incredible things. And 70% of this show did that. It told the story of two very vulnerable people. A pro skater with the drive to show true talent, even if not from his own skates, and a young star who is trying to find their worth in the world. But more importantly, two people, finding something they both care about more than skating. Each other.",

            "content": "Yuri On Ice is an amazing series for anyone looking for good character development and characters to hold onto and love; It\u2019s a really heart-touching romance and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who believes in true love! The storyline is definitely memorable for anyone who puts a little thought into it, and I love how every small little thing is explained.\r\nThe music is outstanding, and I think that they did a great job; some of the music is coordinated with the story line, which I thought was really neat! I loved the different types of music the skaters skated to, and I stilllisten to them now! There\u2019s a variety, from rock, to piano, and I think it\u2019s nice!\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I didn\u2019t like about this anime is that... the animation; sometimes, it\u2019s absolutely amazing and vibrant, and sometimes, well, you\u2019re wondering what you\u2019re looking at. Not that that makes it bad! It makes for some pretty funny jokes!\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I didn\u2019t like was that... well... we don\u2019t really learn much about Victor in the anime, and episodes 11 and 12 leave you with this queasy feeling as to where their relationship will go; I don\u2019t like how their relationship hasn\u2019t even been confirmed as canon, and they don\u2019t actually confess their feelings towards one another.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development- I could spend all day writing this. The character development is amazing, as the characters learn and change every episode or so, their opinions varying and emotions set alight. It\u2019s really fun and entertaining to watch as they make those moments noticeable, and it makes for some hearts warming scenes!\\n\\n\r\nThe overall rating I\u2019ve given it is a 9, because it\u2019s absolutely beautiful! If you love true love and ice skating, Yuri on Ice is for you!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sports anime are cool. They're over the top, they're intense, they're silly and they're fun. I'm always up to throwing on Prince of Tennis and holding back a giggle at the absurdity.\r\nBut, uh, my guilty pleasure has always been romance, and to see a sports anime focus so heavily on romance is a breath of fresh air in a medium that's so crowded by imitation it drew me in and kept me watching! \r\n...for better or for worse.\r\nLet's start with the positive. Yuri on Ice does not hold your hand or over-explain anything. There are no hints about who King JJ is before he showsup and breaks up the monotony of repetitive ice skating scenes to make you believe that he deserves to win with an awe-inspiring performance that feels not just unique, but energized in a way no other ice-skating scene is. \\n\\n\r\n Nothing in the narrative hints that Yuri is going to subvert tropes and sound so calm and confident as he grows into his own and pulls from an inner strength we haven't seen from him, and there are plenty of understated, human moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance doesn't have any. It falters from overdone and sappy to weirdly restrained. There's no ambiguity with how much it focuses on the romance, but the writers just don't follow up to give the relationship any progression at all. You either get the pair of them acting like friends that are a bit too formal to be lovers, to lines like, \"Seduce me,\" out of nowhere! \\n\\n\r\nIt's all to do with the pacing. Most of Yuri on Ice is an endless series of figure skating routines accompanied by the personal stories of a number of side characters. Figure skating all looks the same and gets boring when it's all I'm looking at 99% of the time. They shove so much onto the screen that the story doesn't really progress, and the relationship doesn't get the room to be developed. There's little time for things to simmer and build, to ratchet up the tension--romantic or narrative.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this worth watching, then?  Characters. Even if the romance is botched, the way Viktor and Yuki interact is mesmerizing, and the stories of the side characters resonate in a way that shows real talent from the staff. The dialogue is especially noteworthy for sounding as human as the characters with few exceptions, and the subversion of the expectations brought on by events in the story is constant and quick. It's in moments like those, when it's moving fast and speaking volumes, when I see real potential for Yuri on Ice to rise above to join the ranks of the best of its contemporaries. But I can't.\\n\\n\r\nThe art switches from pretty good to pretty foul, and the overall story is just botched. There's only so much I can recommend a sports romance story that utterly fails in its handling of the sport, the romance, and the story. Characters and dialogue can only take you so far if the backbone of the show is broken. But it's enough to make me leave it with a positive impression. If it had cut out some of the extraneous figure skating scenes to try to add more weight to the competition and a bit more development to the romance, it could have been a powerhouse. But sometimes the line between mediocrity and greatness is razor thin, no matter how painful it may be to acknowledge.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou guys have a lot to prove in S2. Oh, and if I hear the song that Yuri skates to one more time that isn't the finale or something, I am going to lose my shit big time.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yuri on Ice is a good anime that will be fine for people who are not searching for some deep, psychological stuff, or mindfuck anime. It is not a dramatic shoujo, nor that kind of deep and depressing psychological anime, it is not philosophical, and it is not an action anime. \r\nIt is a fluffy anime, that will work well for those searching for humour and a light show to see. And even if it is not heavy, it doesn't mean it is superficial. Instead their characters have an humanity that is treated with lots of sensitiveness and reality.\r\nWhat is new about YOI? The animeis not simple fanservice even if it brings the relationship in same-sex couple. It's innovative in diverse aspects.\\n\r\nIt is one of the firsts 'shonen ai' who do not stereotype homo affection and fetichizes gay relationships in very poor manner. I really felt that I was FINALLY watching to a real gay relationship, not a fetichized and unrealistic one that we see in shonen ai and yaois, that have almost all of them the same story and clich\u00e9s.\\n\r\nSpecially I was admired that I was finally seeing a HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP in same sex couple in anime and maybe in media in general. Even with the age gap, it wasn't an excuse for domination and submissive dynamic. Instead, the older one stimulate the younger into his development and empowering, helping building his self-steem instead of the abusive dynamics that we see in shonen ai couples. Also,  that difficult to show a clearly visible couple with lots of sabottage to consumate any affective stuff in the show, we don't see in YOI. It's clear that it wasn't totally uncloseted their relatioship, they don't have very physical contact (but instead, we see lots of care, some affection touching, not sexual ones, we see a significant RELATIONSHIP in gestures that show lots of deepness between them both, without the need of compulsive explicit exposure it is showed in a more delicate way). Even though, inside the story and for anyone seeing it, yes, it was very clear that they were a couple, that they developed a relationship, that they loved each other, that they become more and more reciprocating theirs feelings, that they become engaged, that they were together and schocking people with that, that they didn't care to be visible to the entire world only with attitudes, not necessarily with words, and it was beautifull, inspiring. The attitude of Victor to respect the timing of his lover, the attitudes in this relationship, it was admirable, we need to much these referentials, these inspirations, we need so much to see beautifullness and to find interesting and sexy the respect, the consent, the igualitarian dynamic, the caring, the no-sexualitzation of the other, the multiple ways of loving someone beyond sex like being by its side, sharing your knowledge, accepting the other the way it is, trying to understand, to grow together. Victor had everything to exercize power, but he didn't choose it. He choosed to puts by the side of the other, to not occupy a place of prepotency. His position as an goldstar, a great athlete, his age and experience, his beauty, WAS NOT AN EXCUSE TO EXPLORE, to manipulate the other, to use. Instead he engage in a relationship to help the other to grow and discover himself as a potent person too. He waits Yuuri timing, he don't pressure, don't bully, don't invade, he don't RAPE, as we unfortunatelly see in a lot of yaois. He is never abusive! It's an incredible progress! Finally some representation of a healthy couple, healthy sexuality. Yuuri has his own time to enter this relationship and to reciprocate Victor feelings, Victor never pressure this, he respect the process of the other. That is what captivated me in this show, that's what made this show being a loved one for me. It shows good relationships, of friendship, he has ethnic diversity, it is not misoginist, it doesn't exclude women from an only-boy fujoshi fantasistic universe... He shows a good relationship between men, without abuses and game-playing, so the show helped toward non homophobic representation of gay desire and relationships. And it doesn't mean they are perfect as a couple, that they don't fail in this relationship... we see their conflicts. And we see they work it trought. It was what made this show so special for people among other things.\\n\r\nSome fujoshis may cry that there was not sex between them and other stuff to fetichize, but I find that this mantained the quality of the show, bringing attention to what really matter. I think that it is great anyway to show physical contact between same-sex couples, but I really think it was a strategy for not turning it empty in a sexual stimulation for some public. It makes you pay attention to the story, to the relationship.\\n\r\nAnd if you want to relax your mind, see this show. It doesn't have an amazing plot, but it can be very good in it simplicity.\\n",

            "content": "In my Opinion, Yuri on ice is a great anime because of the story. Since Yuri on ice is an original story anime without it being based on any manga or novel, it is a great anime in story. What I know is that usually original story anime doesn't turn out as good as it should be but Yuri on ice is different. The only other original story anime I know is Gundam. So I am impressed that Yuri on ice can capture people's hearts with its story alone. \r\nThe art of Yuri on ice is amazing, because I once watched a video which showshow an anime is made. Overall an anime is a like a group of moving pictures, so the crew have to draw each frame of the character moving. Because of this fact, I realize that making a skating anime will not be that easy. When Yuri on ice, the animation of the jumps and figure skating skills such as the spins and step sequence is just a masterpiece. Yuri on ice is truly an awesome anime to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Yuri on ice is not a disappointment. The soundtrack is beautiful and it can touch people's hearts. Most of all the soundtracks kind of shows the feelings of the skaters, like Yuri's free program soundtrack shows how his life flows, with ups and downs, and so its a beautiful soundtrack. The soundtrack of the other skaters are also beautiful. the soundtrack is just so heartwarming that it can be listened to anytime. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also a masterpiece. Kubo-sensei created characters that are all likable and sweet even though they are supporting characters. For example, maybe in some other anime, people will dislike the antagonist or the character that are competing with the main character, but that's not the case in Yuri on ice. Even though there are many competitors, but all of them could be a favourite character and so the favorite characters can be other characters not only the main trio. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Yuri on ice to me is an amazing anime that should be watched by everyone. That is because the development between characters could be cringe or gay at times but to me that's what makes this anime special. No once can tackle the idea of romance like Yuri on ice did. The heartwarming relationship between Yuuri and Viktor is just so cute that it can capture people's hearts no matter whether they are male or female. All in all, I really enjoyed this anime because of the development between characters and the animation of the characters, scenery and of course the figure skating.",

            "content": "This is the second sports anime I\u2019ve watched. The first was Free. I wanted to share my thoughts so this is my first review on this site.\r\nSpoilers. I suggest watching all 12 episodes before reading my review.\r\nPlot:\r\nIt\u2019s a Sports Anime/ Romantic Comedy about a young man named Yuri Katsuki.  He\u2019s a 23 year old professional figure skater who thinks he sucks (made it to the Grand Prix but whatever), and is therefore contemplating retiring. However, his idol Victor Nikiforov, a 27 year old enigmatic goofball and five time world champion, shows up out of nowhere and offers to coach him. This begins his secondchance battle for gold. However, he's up against anxiety, other well trained skaters, and Yuri (Yurio) Plisetsky, a 15 year old prodigy . You\u2019ve seen this story before,but as the saying goes it\u2019s not the destination but the journey. Also there's an adult cast and no high school setting?! What have I done to deserve this bounty?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nPros-\\n\\n\r\nYuri is our protagonist and main (unreliable) narrator. He\u2019s very relatable, likable, and adorably innocent. His anxiety was frustrating, but realistic. It didn\u2019t just suddenly disappear in eight months. His struggle with it was constant the entire show. The biggest enemy in the series is his low self-esteem, and his journey is to manage it so that the great skater within him can finally come out.\\n\\n\r\nCons-\\n\\n\r\nYuri is to codependent on Victor. It got to the point that I was asking does he even like skating for himself or does he only like it because Victor does? He\u2019s very obsessed with him. He was like this before Victor officially entered his life, and it just intensified from there. It also bothered me that his town, family, and friend\u2019s lifelong support was treated like chop liver. You were definitely all alone there Yuri. No support whatsoever until Victor fell from the heavens. \\n\\n\r\nPros-\\n\\n\r\nVictor is the deuteragonist,Yuri\u2019s coach,and love interest. He has a very charismatic and playful personality. He can be perceptive and serious, but his default is to be a child in a man\u2019s body. It\u2019s impossible to dislike him.  \\n\\n\r\nCons- \\n\\n\r\nAs far as overall depth goes there's only crumbs to be found with him.  I want more than the tiniest peek behind the curtain, and considering he's the second lead we should have gotten that. Victor's just not a fully realized character. His sole purpose is to seduce the pork cutlet bowl out of Yuri\u2019s pants. If other people didn\u2019t see and interact with him I would be convinced he was a figment of Yuri\u2019s imagination.\\n\\n\r\nPros-\\n\\n\r\nYurio rounds out the mains as the tritagonist.  He\u2019s the defacto next Victor of the skating world. I like watching him skate (agape mostly), and he can be funny. Yea, that\u2019s all I got.\\n\\n\r\nCons- \\n\\n\r\nHis personality can only be defined as a violent, angry asshole. He\u2019s a nasty piece of work. His disgusting behavior is either ignored or played for laughs. The one time a character genuinely called him to task the scene was over before it truly began. I was not happy.\\n\\n\r\nPros-\\n\\n\r\nIt was nice that the side characters each had their own distinct personalities. \\n\\n\r\nCons-\\n\\n\r\nThey took away too much screen time from Yuri and Victor.  The sides were likable in their own right, but I just didn\u2019t care about them. However, I had to put up with their presence for long, boring, and repetitive skating sequences. Honestly, if it wasn\u2019t the two Yuri\u2019s skating I pretty much zoned out.\\n\\n\r\nRomance:\\n\\n\r\nPros-\\n\\n\r\nShh, don\u2019t tell anyone but our main couple they\u2019re \u2026two guys. Let\u2019s be real this is the strongest reason this show was watched. They're both very likable, and have great chemistry. Their interactions were charming, tender, heartwarming, and funny.  I rooted for them to get a happy ending. Their story is a nice template for romantic arcs.\\n\\n\r\nCons-\\n\\n\r\nThe overall execution is timidly done. \\n\\n\r\nThe only kiss in the series is very quick and censored. An engagement is treated in an oddly humorous and escape clause like manner.They have a fifties sitcom sleeping situation. They're a couple right? Why are they sleeping in separate beds? Also for two people who are supposedly together there's curiously an awful lot of tease and switch scenes.\\n\\n\r\nBiggest skater on the planet engaged? Apparently the world's just not going to talk about that. Fianc\u00e9? What\u2019s that?  A side character gets to say girlfriend and fianc\u00e9. Another gets to visibly kiss his ex-girlfriend in photos and say that he loves her. What\u2019s different about their relationship and our main\u2019s?\\n\\n\r\nTheir moments are severely mired in skater rhetoric. There\u2019s no frank discussion about their feelings toward each other at all.Their coupledom exists in a strange bubble.There's no concrete acknowledgement of its existence.Not even from them.\\n\\n\r\nTheir romantic and professional relationship is treated like they\u2019re one and the same, and the writers seem afraid to detangle the two. They won't fully commit to this utopia. Simply put any occasion that could possibly cement their relationship is meshed into a coach/student excuse or goes to wonderland.\\n\\n\r\nThis peculiar coyness is allowed to permeate,but nudity, raunchiness,and people letting their bodily fluids lose on the ice is apparently a-okay. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore there are pacing/off screen issues that make their moments have a did I miss something air to them. \\n\\n\r\nA utopia doesn\u2019t mean push things under the rug. It's fine that the negatives don\u2019t exist in this world. However, why are the positives covered with skating excuses,and   thrown down the rabbit hole. Their romance is executed like an oddly vague fanfiction. The biggest outrage is it doesn\u2019t have to be. Despite thoughts to the contrary there's no network/media censorship for this show. The odd censoring is creator inflicted. Why?\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nPros- \\n\\n\r\nThe more adult looking art style worked well for the show. I also liked most of the character designs, and very much appreciated that everyone looked like a different person. Also when the show didn\u2019t look like it was a having a budget crisis it could be very pretty and smooth looking. Characters would look really well drawn, and the choreography for the skating wouldn\u2019t look like a bunch of choppy arms and legs flailing about like a deformed baby walrus.  Basically when the animation was nice the skating would actually look like a beautiful dance as it should. Also the opening has the three mains show off their skating. It was repetitive, but nice to see. I didn\u2019t particular care for the art style though.\\n\\n\r\nAlso from a personal standpoint I liked the contrast of Yuri\u2019s design.Eros Yuri and Regular Yuri are both him. He was nerdy looking but still attractive. The show didn\u2019t make this some mutually exclusive thing. \\n\\n\r\nCons- \\n\\n\r\nI sometimes asked myself where the budget was going. There were a good helping of off model shots for the characters and skating routines, frame rate issues, and general texture weirdness etc. Basically too much choppiness, stiffness, and general derp plagued this show. It didn\u2019t look like an abomination, and I wouldn\u2019t watch 12 episodes of a show that looked like it crawled out of the abyss, but the graphical abilities of the overall series were very inconsistent both on and off the ice. \\n\\n\r\nAlso red lines kept appearing on the characters noses. I noticed this on Victor and Yurio the most, and it was a distracting design choice. There were also sometimes black lines on the characters necks and foreheads. This was also an artistic choice that was not required.\\n\\n\r\nSkating Know How:\\n\\n\r\nThe show was not made for the layman. Basically unless you already have some skating knowledge get ready to be loss. If there\u2019s a difference between quads and quads or regular jumps and quads the show most certainly didn\u2019t care to share.The basics of the skating techniques weren't explained in any real depth in the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nDiversity:\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an international stage and yet everyone is white.  Yuri himself is the most Caucasian looking \u2018Japanese\u2019 man I've ever seen. His \u2018Japanese\u2019 family, friends, and peers all look very white as well.  Some people will try to do mental gymnastics,but every anime has this precise problem. There\u2019s a word for it, but I\u2019ll leave it to myself. \\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nSome of the the skaters had some admirable pieces, and the background music was nice to. The skating standouts would be Yuri on Ice and Agape. On Ice is basically Yuri\u2019s character in music form, and it\u2019s a very beautiful, regal piece. Agape is hauntingly pleasing. It\u2019s basically lyrical innocence. This piece is played while Yurio skates, and it almost makes you forget he\u2019s the biggest bastard on the show. Almost.\\n\\n\r\nHistory Maker is the opening, and it goes well with the theme of the show, but I personally didn\u2019t like it. \\n\\n\r\nYou Only Live Once is the ending music. It has a nice,catchy electronic beat to it that also fits the theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nComedy:\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very comedic in nature, and the jovial tone fit the overall narrative,but I do wish it was more serious than what was presented.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Work: \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a dub watcher and this was done by one of my favorite companies Funimation. They did some brilliant work here. Standouts of course are the three mains. I adored Yuri's voice. It was perfect for him. Yurio's was also well chosen, and it fit him to a tee. Lastly, Victor\u2019s voice is my personal favorite. Like yurio he has a russian accent, and it was this pleasing mixture of sensual and carefree. I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nEnding:\\n\\n\r\nIt was odd. There was a lot of deus ex machina, character regressions, pacing issues, and miscommunication melodrama etc. Basically the last two episodes (12 especially) felt like they were narratively disconnected from the episodes that came before it. Instead of making a strong series finale they decided to milkage bait a second season. \\n\\n\r\nIn Summary:\\n\\n\r\nThe show overall has some execution issues, but despite that I enjoyed the series. I\u2019m on my third and final rewatch after all. I\u2019ve also gotten two others to view YOI, and they loved it as well. Basically what the show does well it does very well, and the cons didn\u2019t take away from that. Therefore it ultimately gets an 8 from me.\\n\\n",

The animation was definitely inconsistent during its skating scenes, plus there were a couple issues with the story, but it never got in the way of my enjoyment for the show. My favorite part of the show was the characters, especially Yuuri. I found Yuuri to be a character who i could really relate to. His anxiety and self doubt really resonated me. His and Victors relationship was also a joy to watch. It really made mehappy to a same sex couple represented in a way like this in anime. Yeah its been done before, but not in a way. Im giving this show an overall 10 because its my definition of a perfect anime. Ive never been so moved by an anime before, which sounds cheesy, but its really interesting to see the impact this show has had on me and many other people",

            "content": "Hmm... I don't think I'm very qualified to write this cos I'm definitely not a Yuri fan. Still, decided to give this a go after the hype/ raving reviews from many fans. \r\nStory - 4 (Decent)\r\nThere really isn't much to this story as it focuses on the romance between Yuri Natsuki and Viktor Nikiforov. Viktor has always been Yuri's idol especially after he 'failed' at a major competition; then one day, he finds his most idolised Russian skater at his doorstep, demanding to be his coach (after Yuri uploaded a video of his skating/ imitation of Viktor's routine). There are other characters like Yuri Plisetskyand figure skaters from other countries, but they aren't very fleshed out/ given much screen time apart from 1-2 minutes of skating.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound - 6\\n\r\nAgain, not qualified to write this at all cos I'm not an Art/ Sound person. It's not bad, but I find the skating sequences aren't as breathtaking as a real-life performance (well that's to be expected) or as spectacular as many make it out to be. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\r\nNot much development of the characters beyond their skating; why did Viktor choose to train Yuri, what are their motivations, their backstories, etc? Some of them are explained, but barely - and most of the emphasis is placed on Yuri/ Viktor ROMANCE, rather than character development.\\n\r\nReading other reviews I also agree that it's a bit meh at times because there's never a proper \"Yuri\" moment - not that I'm a fan, it's just quite ??? because it doesn't deliver what it 'promises'.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\r\nHalfway through the series I got rather bored, to be honest. But I like to finish my series so I sped through the remaining. Probably won't watch again :(\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5 - Mediocre\\n\r\nIt's not terrible... i think. But highly unlikely something I'll turn to/ recommend others.",

After all that\u2019s the name of our protagonist Yuuri Katsuki, nationality Japanese, currently his only accomplishments thus far have been Junior World Champs Division, which he\u2019s only come dead last. Now that series has dialed down the publicity and the community is finally looking it at it from a broader perspective the reviews aren\u2019t as positive unlike once before. Why is that? Well let\u2019s a dive look and hope to find out why.\r\nStory: 8\r\nWorld Champion Victor Nikiforov has currently won his 4th World Champion in the Senior division, beating the best of best. Hisis nationality Russian and during latest run Yuuri has been placed 5th, meaning he\u2019s dead last in Junior Division. An up and coming rival Yuri Plisetsky, Russian as well, tells Yuuri to call it a career and quit due to his weight gain and the fact that Yuri dislikes/hates Yuuri. Anyhow Yuuri weight gain was due to the passing of his beloved pet dog. Meeting his icon/role model Victor at airport, Yuuri can\u2019t help but admire and be at a speechless knowing he\u2019s nowhere or close to his status. Even questioning if it\u2019s right for him to even continue to pursue his skating career. However, Victor spots Yuuri self-doubting himself, to snap Yuuri out Victor ask him if wants a take a photograph with him, only to have Yuuri not even respond but leave the scene.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri goes home, grieving while at the same time trying to figure out whenever he wants to continue ice-skating or pursue his career being that he\u2019s a college graduate. Continuing you gain weigh he finally decides to give it one more season. Known a childhood friend Yuuko Nishigori, she\u2019s well acquainted with the owner of skating stadium and they as well adore Yuuri. Eventually, Yuuri gives Yuuko a skating choreograph to get her opinion on his skills thus far. It\u2019s only be in shock that Yuuko insist that was exactly like Victor\u2019s choreograph. Unknowingly, Yuuri performance was video recorded and made its way online. During this time as well Victor has won his 5th \\n\\n\r\nWorld Champion, an achievement no one has accomplished.\\n\r\nAfter Victor sees Yuuri video on the internet, Victor decides to hang the laces and call it a quits. The world is in shock and his manager insist if this is case Victor won\u2019t be able to come back to the game in tip top form. Victor is in his prime but walks away to train the young man in the video Yuuri.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 7 | 8  \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is really off putting at times looking absolutely clunky, it makes wonder if it\u2019s to appear to make Yuuri more obese. At times during an ice skating performance it appears to skip frames. When it wants to the anime can look stunning as if you were watching Mamoru Hosada movie. The music OP & ED, weren\u2019t anything to glamorous or jaw dropping visually, but the music pleasantly fitting and it grows on you. I\u2019m very fond of the show animation for the pets as well. One main complaint is that animation can look really bad during the most important skating scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nYuuri Katsuki \u2013 There\u2019s no doubt that he has an eating problem, from the start of the show it portrayed from even his childhood that Yuuri was a bit on chubbier side. Yuuri takes a lot influence from Victor, to even adopt a dog. It\u2019s known that Yuuri wasn\u2019t much on the friend\u2019s side and that\u2019s he\u2019s a timid. Always unsure of his very own skills and doubting himself if skating is really for him.\\n\\n\r\nVictor Nikiforov \u2013 5th Time World Skating Champion, every outgoing and friendly from the get go. What drives him are not the accolade\u2019s but the audience \u201cOhh\u201d and \u201cAhh\u201d. He\u2019s always trying to do perform and act that\u2019s never been done, just trying to surprise and give the audience a revelation of his cinematography of skating, that\u2019s what drives him. That\u2019s what eats away at Victor, causing him to move away from the spotlight because he doesn\u2019t think believe he astonishes anyone.\\n\\n\r\nYuri Plisetsky \u2013 During his younger years, Yuri would do stunts in skating performance that weren\u2019t recommend due to his age and it could damage his body. Being in an instantly sensation he caught Victor attention, and Victor promised him to choreograph his skating performance for when he was ready to join the big leagues. Now he\u2019s in a rivalry the other Yuuri trying to get Victor to come to Russia and train only him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the chemistry between Victor and Yuuri it\u2019s what makes the show so wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts/Overall: 9\\n\\n\r\nAs to why I believe the community has begun to dislike it, is due to the fact that it's always best to into an anime with no expectations even if it\u2019s hyped to be a spectacular one. Otherwise you\u2019ll let down drastically and chewing it out at every corner. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, I believe the amount of screen time side characters wasn\u2019t even close to enough to show them off, rather than made them one dimensional and even forgettable after their time in spotlight was done even if it was a short time. I know the animation during the choreographed skating was clunky at times as well, and it felt like they were reusing some at the same scenes as well but that\u2019s perhaps because they do the same routine just different here and there.\\n\\n\r\nAnother complain is that I wish I given an explanation to the jumps/spins/cuts the skaters were performing it all looked the same to me. Last I believe this anime would have benefited greatly being longer because after the half way point it felt greatly rushed. Even with all it's flaws I can't help but tap my finger to as why I enjoyed so much.",

            "content": "I succumbed to the hype. The hype\u2026was absolutely worth it. This anime has a unique charm which just sucks you in and removes the inner skeptic in you that may have developed over the huge fanbase. It has a unique charm that is even hard to describe because of the many aspects of this anime that have been executed wonderfully. \r\nThis anime keeps you on the edge of your seat during moments, yet evokes the warm and fuzzies *cough* fangirl screaming *cough* moments, more frequently than you would think. The feel of some moments is super random and strange, yet\u2026so right. \r\nYuri Katsuki, a professionalice-skater bombs out badly in the Grand Prix skating event, leaving him unable to meet his famous Idol, Victor Nikiforov, after failing at the event. After returning home, a lucky twist of fate results in Yuri acquiring Victor as his couch. With the combined motivation of winning the gold medal at the next Grand Prix, the pair fight to make their dreams a reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe competitions are used as a base for the character development. Victor seeks to gain inspiration through the role of a coach, whilst Yuri yearns to find something worth skating for as a means of expression during his competitions. Their personalities are well suited as Yuri is ready to discover uncharted parts of his identity which Victor is thrilled to coax out of him. As Yuri has his own ability for self motivation and Victor does not have to do much rather than guide him, it really overrides what I had been expecting: Victor being an overbearing/cruel coach always having to convince Yuri of his worth. That is why their relationship is so adored by fans of this series - because Yuri and Victor meet each other half way.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first male same-sex romance anime and I was surprised by how convincing the relationship between Yuri and his coach Victor got to be. The combining of the ambition of both characters with their passion towards each other just worked out to be an amazing mix. Victor views Yuri as an individual with great undiscovered potential, so after watching a video of Yuri attempting Victor\u2019s ice-skating routine, he decides to become his coach. Just the very way in which this couple came together really solidifies their relationship. Though Victor has always been Yuri\u2019s idol, Victor also seems to recognise Yuri\u2019s appreciation  and possible connection with him through his rendition of his own dance. Together, they become a powerful duo, using the ice-skating rink to display the development of their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nReally though, even though the romance plays a substantial part of the side characters are really well crafted, such that you become invested in each of their stories and fates.\\n\\n\r\nWe have Yurio, Victor\u2019s prior trainee, who remains salty throughout the progression of the anime due to Victor ditching him (which did seem a bit harsh). He channels his rage into his ice-skating with his new couches and really becomes a character to be reckoned with in the competitions.\\n\\n\r\nOther notable characters include: JJ. who struggles with his seemingly impenetrable arrogance during his skating.\\n\\n\r\nI have to mention the overly-sexual character Chris. Watching his skating routines just made me feel so uncomfortable\u2026perhaps because of his creepy facial hair. Expect butt grabbing and unreasonably long crotch shots when you\u2019re watching this guy.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the killer soundtrack. The opening theme is so uplifting that i was wishing that it would play as my background music while I go about my life. It\u2019s a fusion of classical/techno music that just\u2026works. The ending theme is also super catchy and the cute Yuri-Victor scenes were so perfect that i became curious right at the very start of the anime about how their relationship would progress.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is stunning and I was awed by the fluidity of the movements of the skating routines each time. Yuri and Victor\u2019s alternate face styles were also adorable:\\n\\n\r\nFinal words: Go watch this now. It is unique, well crafted and the hype is real. Any negatives? Chris\u2019s uncomfortable scenes and IT WAS SIMPLY TOO SHORT. It has a indescribable loveable quality to it that will get you hooked and won\u2019t let go. Now have to find a way to curb my feelings of withdrawal after watching something so amazing.",

            "content": "Slight spoilers ahead.\r\nI have two main criticisms for this show.\r\nThe first criticism addresses a problem that the show somewhat successfully solves, though there remains room for improvement. The problem has to do with how to handle the repetitious showing of each skater's programs. The songs are the same, the performance is the same, the only main difference is whether the skater lands their jumps. The show's solution is largely to use this as an opportunity to show us the character's state of mind, not just as it pertains to how their performance is going, but how their performance relates to their larger concerns and anxietiesabout their career and life goals.\\n\\n\r\nThe show alternatively could have used new performances each time the skater appeared on the ice, though this probably would have required more effort on the animators' part, and might have been taken creative liberties with its depiction of professional figure skating. The idea here is that these new performances would be reflections of the character's state of mind at the time, possibly forgoing the need for an internal monologue.\\n\\n\r\nThe show in very few occasions utilizes this idea of reflecting a character's state of mind in their physical performance: Yuri in his first few short program performances opens up increasingly erotically, and Michele Crispino's (brother to Sala Crispino) second performance that we see is far more melancholic than his first one, reflecting his reaction to his sister's separation. These are good, but the only instances I recall.\\n\\n\r\nI would have liked to have seen this method pursued further, particularly since the internal monologues, while themselves effective (albeit somewhat a crude way of presenting the same information), end up falling short due to weaknesses in the show's narrative, which brings up my second and largest point.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's narrative is far too quick. The show sets up this arc for Yuri where he'll come to learn what love or eros is, which largely concludes halfway through, rendering his skating performances less interesting. Yuri(o), who was set up as Yuri's rival, receives far less attention than Yuri. There's some interesting potential with Yuri(o), but we're instead left with asides rather than developments: for instance, Yuri(o)'s concern that he'll soon physically mature in a way that will mean having to alter his skating style. Victor, despite receiving the second most amount of air time, receives possibly even less narrative attention than Yuri(o).\\n\\n\r\nAll the other skaters receive interesting attention, but again, it's done far too quickly without really establishing the characters, exploring them and their backgrounds, and then developing them, their issues and resolutions.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that had this show been twice as long, and properly attentive, this could have been an easy 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "Yuri On Ice!! is a collection of perfect things that all suffer from major flaws. These perfect things include (1) Beautiful Skating (2) Representation of a M/M queer relationship (3) Representation of the Anxiety/Insecurity that often comes with ambition. Without further ado, I'm going to go into these 3 things and why they're good andwhy they fell short of what a viewer might want.\r\n1) Skating Animation - At first, this is breathtaking. It's clearly one of the main draws of the show, and also the location where the majority of the animation budget went. The movements of the skaters are fluid, dynamic, and emotional. Thehuge flaw? Repetitiveness. We see the same skating routine over and over and fucking over, with very little change. After a while you notice that there isn't even much difference BETWEEN the skating routines of each skater. It's lovely, but it gets  boring to the point where I don't even want to see the skating anymore, just give me the scores.\\n\\n\r\n2) Relationship - Many people have been complaining about this, and the bottom line is that Yuuri and Victors relationship balances itself on eroticisation. This is the story of a young man coming to TERMS with his confidence, with his feelings of sexuality and interest, not the story of a gay couple falling in love. Some queer men I've talked to about it find it endearing. Others find it obnoxious. Its great to see some M/M sexual tension on screen, and to feel the insecurity of a young man face his feelings, and face the fact that he's competing with men who are way more sexually mature and confident than him. This is shown through the skating. The relationship remains ambiguous/undefined, but thats also because the characters focus is on their skating, and their interest in each other is expressed through skating, not through establishing an actual relationship. Its not out of line for each character, or for this genre of anime to keep this relationship weird and ambiguous. Whether it remains a major flaw , one that renders queer relationships petty, or whether it turns into a minor one depends largely on Season 2 and whether or not we get to see more of Victors real personality, not just this picture-perfect guy we've seen sofar.\\n\\n\r\n3) Anxiety - This is the shows most compelling strength, and the only thing it executes completely flawlessly. Yuuri's anxiety about being in a high pressure environment is real. It can be frustrating and melodramatic, but such is the nature of anxiety. People can have difficulty dealing with pressure, and constantly belittle themselves and blind themselves to how well they're actually doing. Sitting and crying about it isn't a one-time deal, instead its a constant struggle that many people deal with. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Yurri On Ice!! is a great show, with compelling characters, solid character development, and solid animation ( as long as there isn't a dog in the shot, jeesus that animal was lazy) . The side characters are also pretty well defined and designed, and the soundtrack is great, albeit cheesy and not particularly artsy. To be honest, for me, a cis-straight-woman, its biggest downside was how repetitive the skating sequences get, which is 80% of the show, lets be real. Whether or not you have an issue with the superficiality of the M/M relationship is up to taste, and hopefully it'll become more well defined in subsequent seasons. It also has great racial/gender representation, which is a good bonus.",

            "content": "Yuri!!! on Ice is all everyone's talking about right now, and I have heard all good things. Which is why I was surprised when I crawled my way onto MAL and found out that this popular sports anime is actually wildly controversial. Most everyone's opinions are either black or white, love it or hate it.\r\nStarting from the most interesting place, let's break down this show's story. It seems that general consensus has decided that this show has terrible pacing and is quite rushed, which I can't deny. So much happens in the span of an episode and it feels quite crammed. This is a showthat needed at least 22 episodes to be at its best. Despite the overwhelming ammount of things that happen in an episode, the episodes still seem to become rather boring, like they're taking too long to just end. I think this show is at its very best during the slice-of-lifey comedy scenes, which are packed with character development and bonding between the characters. From the fanbase's reactions, this seems to appeal most to everyone else, too. These are the moments when the show doesn't feel as rushed, and all the best aspects of this show can shine. In general, this show has a lot of wow factor and it manages to mesmerize you and steal your attention. To me, the best moment of the entire show will be the beautiful skating scene in the first episode, where Katsuki Yuuri is staking Viktor Nikiforov's program.\\n\\n\r\nNow here's the part where I piss off every straight boy on this entire site. This show is not queerbait. This show has a confirmed, canon gay couple that develops over the course of the series. Maybe it's just me, but getting engaged (this is confirmed to be an actual engagement. They aren't just bros who like putting rings on each other in churches) is probably a good sign that it isn't just \"bait\". I personally enjoyed the romance between the two characters and it was easily one of YOI's greatest aspects.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that is commonly criticized is the character development. This, I can get behind. The side characters are very poorly developed and it's hard to care about them at all. And I'm honestly trying. My favourite episode had to be episode 11, where a side character got a full character arc. This was beautifully handled and it emphasized the problems with this show's side character development. The most interesting characters were the main characters, Yuuri, Viktor, and Yurio. All of them are developed in a \"show don't tell\" fashion and make huge and important changes over the course of the show. The development of these characters is truely something to be appreciated. \\n\\n\r\nAnd honestly? This show got me emotional. I never cried, but my lil heartstrings were tugged at. It's very good at bringing out the feels, in a positive way. It may not be my favourite, but I care about this show very deeply. I also wanna touch on the themes expressed in this work. They resonate with me very deeply and in general, are themes that most people can appreciate. A very diverse cast, a canon gay couple, representation for mental illness (anxiety and depression), love, life, friendship, and self-empowerment. (Although the love/friendship theme is probably the least interesting of them).\\n\\n\r\nThe music is absolutely stunning. It is rather overused, and quite a few tracks aren't the type of thing I would listen to on my own time, but I cannot stress enough how beautiful it really is.  In general, sound isn't really used in very interesting ways, but it isn't used poorly by any means. As far as voice acting, the sub is phenomenal. The voice actors all fit their roles and all the characters sound good together. None of the voices are obnoxious. The dub is a VERY different matter. The dub is DREADFUL. It's quite entertaining and quotable though. \"You can do better than him, b*tch!\" is going to be stuck in my head until I die. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation and directing of this show is infamous for being bad, and I don't think I have to comment much on that. It really is terrible and one of YOI's worst aspects. But animation isn't all that goes into a show's visuals. Firstly, the background art is stunning and is based off of actual locations. The character designs are fairly generic, but the skating outfits are quite beautiful. Of all characters, Georgi easily has the most interesting character design and that needs more appreciation. YOI has beautiful flow and the shot composition looks nice and neat. This show doesn't have much in the way of a colour pallete, and sometimes the colours look downright ugly, but it is digitally processed pretty nicely. It is overall very inconsistent, and whilst some things about the visuals are great, some (such as the animation) completely flop.\\n\\n\r\nIt's all a matter of personal taste, really. I thought YOI was a great, but definitely flawed show.\\n\\n\r\n7/10.",

            "content": "Note: This review was written on my Review Book on Wattpad. If you are interested, don't be shy to check it out! (Link's in my bio)\r\nYuri on Ice is an anime of Fall 2016, that just ended on December 22, 2016. The series revolves around 23 year old Yuri Katsuki, who had just recently returned from his 5 year trip from high school, and his miserable crash from his Ice Skating career. Now that the previous season was over for him, Yuri went back home to Hasetsu, Japan, to see his family and friends back home. Fortunately, Yuri's love for Ice Skating never died, andas soon as he came home from the failing season, he showed Yuuko, his friend who works at the ice rink, just exactly what he has been working on: An exact copy of Russian Iceskating legend, Victor Nikiforov's latest Free Skate Program of the season: Stay Close to Me (and one of my favorite routines lol). Unfortunately, Yuuko's daughters, Axel, Loop and Lutz, secretly recorded Yuri's imitation, and posted it on social media, making him go viral. At this point, everyone in the world had seen his skate, that including the one and only Victor. Drawn by the way he moved to the music, Victor decided to not compete in the next season's competition, and headed to Hatsetsu to train Yuri as his coach.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so if you don't know already, I AM YOI TRASH. Like, whenever a new episode came out, i couldnt stop screaming. No wonder my feelings have vanished overnight, they were given to the finale of Yuri on Ice. Also, don't be mislead by the title. I am 110% sure that this is not a Yuri anime. Definitely not. Like i scream at this series lots of times, and a girl x girl ship happening is definitely not it. If you were looking for a Fall 2016 Yuri anime, Id suggest checking out Izetta: The Last Witch. I havent watched it myself yet, but from the gifs ive seen on tumblr, it looks really good. But anyways, if i to explain YoI in three words, theyd probably be something around:\\n\\n\r\nInternational Gay Iceskaters.\\n\\n\r\nYeah.\\n\\n\r\nBut for a person who hasnt really been much on Yaoi series or Sports animes in general, I really loved Yuri On Ice, and it easily became my favorite Fall 2016 anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWARNING! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk, like I said before, I never really was much for Sport animes, Yuri On Ice being the second one I watched, and Ao No Kanata No Rhythm Four being the first(or 50%, the parody of Free if that counts), the genre goes by a  certain story to it; The main Protagnist dwells intrest in a sport, become very determined to win competiton, gets support from another protagnist, they bond a relationship throughout the series, they enter the competition, and \"you either get booed or win a medal.\" (Quote from Haru from 50% off. ) This type of story can either really draw a person in, or draw them away even more. I'm going to be honest with you, I never really enjoyed watching sports, real life ones, or animated. I don't know, but I never really saw them as exciting. However, when I started watching Yuri On Ice however, the story wasn't the first thing that caught my attention. And to be honest it usually it never is for me, rather its the characters that catch me before-hand (though this wasn't the case for YoI either.) Even so, I rated the story of the series an 8 because by episode 5 or 6, like the point where Yuri was in the China Cup, I started really getting pumped for the next epsiode. To be honest the tension they added in the series of making the podium, or a succesful posistion or not. By the end, I screamed The story really got to me around the midpoint of the series, and it was around the thrid, maybe fourth reason why I continued watching it in the first place. But anyways, yeah, for not being a sports person, the story was really good, and I definetely give an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art style, as well as the animation to the show was the first thing that caught my eye in Yuri on Ice. I've loved ice skating for a few years now, but I figured there was probably no way I could learn, since there aren't that many ice rinks around where  i live at. But, when I watched the first episode of Yuri On Ice, the animation was amazing, and I really have taken a liking to it still. My first impression on the series was the animation and art style, and to be honest, thats what made me continue to watch the series. To be honest, I wasn't going to continue watching Yuri On Ice after episode 1, but I thought about how much I enjoyed the animation and art style of the series, and i decided to continue with episode 2, and i became attached by 3. So, you can thank the animation fir hooking me into the series, otherwise i was just going to drop it at episode 1 and nit come back to it for months for another shot. And thats why Yuri on Ice's animation and art style gets a 10/10 from me. Plus, its really pretty and I just love it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOk, so if you have 99% of the YoI soundtrack on your iPod that you listen to daily, everywhere you go, I think you got the right to give the Sound to this series a 10/10. Seriously. I listen to this on the bus on the way to highschool everyday, and occasionally i have the nerve to play it out loud and annoy all of the little 7th graders in the back of the bus with it. But yeah, definitely love the YoI soundtrack. My favorites would definitely include \"Stay Close to Me,\" \"Serenade for Two,\" \"In Regards to Love: Agape,\" and \"Shall We Skate.\" The soundtrack also helps devolp the characters, as if emotional scenes weren't enough. Also, I think their skate music makes you like some of the characters more. For example, my first impressions on JJ weren't that hot, like I thought he was a loud and egotistic character that I felt was going to be really annoying. But, a few nights after episode 9 or 10 aired, I went ahead and binge-listened to the Yuri On Ice Soundtrack while working on a project for science, and I had ran across the theme of King JJ. But instead of me skipping it, I kinda just left it there and kept working on my project. I don't know why, but when the new episode aired, I didn't hate on JJ anymore, in fact I liked him. And I'm guessing it was thanks to the themes too. Sometimes, I sit in the car and have my parents get upset at me because I'm going deaf with \"Duetto\" blasting in my ears, and they could hear it from their side of the car. If that doesn't owe a 10/10, I don't know what will. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIs this really any shocking? If you've read any other of my reviews, the characters are the main component of why I continue watching an anime. Like, if I don't have at least one character in a series to keep me sane, I probably won't continue to watch it. Sometimes, there were shows that I didn't care much for, but I continued watching it for that ONE character i liked. However, in Yuri!!! On Ice's case, I watched it because i love ALL of the characters. Like, even the ones you'd hate in real life for being over dramtic or a giant perv, you love in this show because of that. Chris is a perfect example. When i saw Chris for the first time, debuted in 5 (i think? Yeah pretty sure it was 5), and they showed the audience his routine, I was laughing, saying \"Haha hes a pervert. I love it,\" while screaming at the same time: \"Chris NO Please dont do anything on the ice.\" And even though he was the one I personally really screamed at minority character wise, I still loved him for his quirks, and I miss the Switz. And like I had mentioned before with JJ, i even turned out liking him by episode 11 or something around there. Its like, you love the characters even if somethings wrong with them. Like they have flaws, yes, but that doesnt give you any reason to hate any of them. And I dunno if I already said this, but I have never fell in love with a cast of characters that quickly. Like, usually, there's at least one character I don't like, or at least don't care for, but Yuri on Ice didn't seem to be the case. If an anime can make me love the ENTIRE cast of characters in just one season of 12 episodes, than the Characters definitely gets a 10/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/General: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, for my first impressions, the first couple of episodes that aired, I gave the series an 8/10, because I thought it was really good, and even though Im not much on Sport or Yaoi series, it seemed like it was a really good series with lots of potential. However, by episode 6 or 7, I changed my rank to a 10, because I had just fallen in love with it. I got really excited for the series, for all of its componets, not just its Characters or OST. Though I have never really dwelled in Sports anime in general, I really enjoyed Yuri On Ice, and its made me want to ice skate even more from 3 or 4 years ago. I really enjoy how it just hooks you in, even if you never watched a sports game in your entire life (Seriously, whenever someone asks me what team I like, and I say no, they become really shocked). Yuri on Ice is a really good series in my opinion, and I reccomend it if you're okay with Yaoi ships. If you really don't like guy relationships, then don't watch, because there's a LOT of shipping there, just for the fan service. But, if you're okay with it, then go ahead, I enjoyed it myself. Anyways, as for Enjoyment and general grading, I definitley give Yuri On Ice a 10/10, and it has definetley has become a favorite of mine. \\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, that's all for now! Hope you all enjoyed, and hope to see you next time!",

            "content": "I've been looking forward to this anime ever since it was announced and it did not disappoint. As it says in its PV, Yuri!!! on Ice is an original anime about figure skating and I would recommend it to fans of figure skating or people looking for something new and fun to watch. \r\nThe staff really put the time and effort to capture the feeling of the figure skating world and I would like to thank Kenji Miyamoto for his contribution. He really worked his butt off on those routines.\r\nAs for its characters, it's the story of a top-notch skater that struggles with performing underpressure and his figure skating idol turned inexperienced coach. I appreciate how Yuuri Katsuki is not a rookie. I'm always thankful for anime that have adults as their protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nYuri!!! on Ice focuses on a protagonist who already reached his goal, the Grand Prix Finale, but failed miserably. Despite his nerdy appearance, Yuuri is an athlete that hates to lose and tends to be hard on himself despite already having gained fans and achievements. On the other hand, Victor Nikiforov has already reached the top, but has lost his inspiration and love for figure skating which he finds again through Yuuri's skating. Together, the two of them work together to win the Grand Prix Finale.\\n\\n\r\nIt was interesting to have a story focused on the athlete/coach relationship instead of a rivarly. On the other hand, I think Yuuri's rivalry with Yuri Plisetsky could have been fleshed out more.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are likable and easily stand out from each other. I liked hearing their thoughts during their routines instead of commentary about their skating. The costume designs for each character were also fantastic. Thank you Chacott's Yuiko Sagiri for your contribution! \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to animate sports with lots of movement like figure skating, but the staff managed to pull it off albeit not perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nThe music for the routines was a pleasure to listen to and there are quite a number of memorable pieces. The BGM was also nice.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, the sexiness wasn't over the top like in Yamamoto's other work, The Woman Called Fujiko Mine. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the downs, it really could have done well with an extra episode between 4 and 5 to introduce the other skaters and expand upon Yuuri and Victor's relationship. The pace felt too fast in some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a fun show that was crafted with lots of love for the figure skating world.\\n",

It is only 12 episodes long, and normally I'm not influenced to watch such a short anime in the amount of time I did this, one day, but I couldn't stop with just a few. I also normally skip the opening and ending songs after a few episodes because I had heard them only half an hour ago, but I find myself listening to the music even now as I write this review. I have seen a few reviews on here that had people dislikingit, but that is probably because they weren't trying to connect to it. Yuri Katsuki is a truly inspiring character and the author of the show isn't afraid in not just depicting his relationship with Victor, but also the faults behind his actions. As someone who personally suffers from a lot of anxiety and lack of confidence, I can't help but see myself in Yuri. Also those who did not like the art, the art doesn't have to be perfect to tell the story and its frankly a little refreshing because I've seen faulty art in other anime as well that are much longer and more boring than this. I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who has an open mind and heart. Can't wait for the second season because I'm sure there will be one with the positive reviews I've seen.",

            "content": "It was good. Just good. I was disappointing when I was told that there was a canon gay relationship just to find that it's ambiguous as all hell and doesn't feel like a romantic relationship at all. The story was okay, not super interesting, but it followed the plot of a sports anime almost verbatim, nothing new, but still not a terrible plot to watch. The character designs were easy on the eyes, however the animation was choppy in some areas probably due to budgetary limitations. Some of the movement on the rink wasawkward with the back ground. Acceptable, still. I liked the soundtrack overall. Some pieces were more memorable than others however. The characters were boring if I'm honest. They fit overused archetypes and hardly appear to have any depth. The only character I felt that did was Yurio, but he hardly got any screen time anyways. Yuri has a pretty \"nothing\" personality which makes it hard to comment on. Victor was okay, he has a passion for ice skating, but there's not much else to him. Despite all this I rather enjoyed the series. It was nice to look at and captured the excitement of watching actual ice skating. If that's a sport you enjoy watching, I'd recommend it since nothing else has much going for it. Overall, I give it a 7/10. It was alright, if you're into that kind of thing.",

            "content": "This anime is not a perfect 10. This anime is, however, a masterpiece---flaws and all. Yuri!!! On Ice may not be the best of this year or this season, but there is a reason why it has earned its place in many hearts. Objectively, this anime is a 8.5/10; but it is difficult to be completely objective when something gifts you with so much unbridled joy and shares with you as much pure-hearted love as it can provide. Hear me out.\r\nOVERALL - 10\r\nIt's the first Wednesday after Yuri!!! On Ice ended. While there is the usual emptiness that comes with a great show ending, YOIleft me feeling in a way that an anime hasn't caused in a long time: content and in love. It is not every season, it is not even every year that you come across an anime that gives you a happiness that lingers. Anime can make you feel all sorts of emotions and I'm not saying YOI is the first to make people happy. For me, personally, it's been so long since an anime gave me emotions that lasted actual HOURS after watching an episode (since the airing of FMA:B, specifically). How could I not give a 10 to the anime that kept me almost irrationally happy during what was actually a really bad day? How could I not give a 10 to the anime that is actually completely awe-inspiring?\\n\r\nYOI is not the first to do any of the revolutionary things it's praised for. It's not the first to respectfully show a homosexual relationship. It's not the first to animate ice skating. It's not the first to have a multiracial cast. It's not the first to dare break the molds of its genre. (Don't get me started on why YOI shouldn't have a yaoi/shounen ai tag, I will gather the might of our international fandom and fight you.) However it is, as of now in 2016, the best accumulation of all of these things into one beautiful show about love: who you love and what you love and how you love. To say it simply, Yuri!!! On Ice is an ice skating anime---a sports anime---with one of the most realistic and mature romances I have ever seen. It treats its showcased sport and its themes and its undertones with the sincerity and respect that they deserve. It's a dark horse anime that rapidly locked its place amongst the personal favourites of the season/year for many.\\n\\n\r\n[The blinder you go into watching this anime, the better. Although a little torturous, the weeks between episodes where the fandom waited in a collectively held gasp were part of what made this anime so unique. Watching anime was suddenly not something you did by yourself and commented about for a bit after the newest episode; something about this anime compelled its viewers to actively seek out other viewers and to rewatch together. There's a reason why the fandom is so dang loud (and full of memes, ahem) and that is because we love this anime so much that we have to share it. We want to share this show's love, its staff's love, and our own. If nothing else, please respect that ;A;]\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 8\\n\r\nIt's a sports anime. Don't expect anything deep or philosophical or something that'll make you question your moral values (although it may make you question other things, haha)---jump in with your heart open to another underdog story. I say \"another,\" but a great underdog story as well-written as Katsuki Yuuri's is as inspiring and powerful as any other. The pacing of this show is skillful. I daresay nearly flawless, emphasis on nearly. Each episode is meaningful; every line endearing (some more cringe-worthy? than others); for 24 minutes, you are gently swept away into a world very much like our own. But there's a catch: Kubo-sensei (creator) & Sayo-san (director) removed discrimination and hatred. The conscious nods to the role of social media, to figures in ice skating, and to real locations reflect upon the idea that YOI's universe isn't just \"an idealised version\" of ours, but a visualisation of what we can make the world into.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION - 8\\n\r\nNo one honestly admits the flaws of YOI's animation and art like its own fans do. I love this anime with all my soul and I will point out every frame-skip, every awkwardly drawn face, every slip in perspective, every colouring mistake this anime has. The fandom makes memes out of YOI's derps and fails! Even with all of its mistakes, none of them can truly detract from how mesmerising every performance is. As Yuuri refines his performances, so does the animation refine. Every scene off the ice is just as wonderful to watch. YOI's art/animation is not perfect. It definitely isn't perfect. But it's BEAUTIFUL. I find myself trying to take in every detail, trying to follow every movement. Even if you don't ever watch this anime, appreciate the fact that Studio MAPPA animated the whole human body as it dances across ice. (Also MAPPA is top-notch at close-up facial expressions. Just, just putting it out there.)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND/MUSIC - 9\\n\r\nAn average soundtrack doesn't bring tears to your eyes before it's even attached to a scene. An average soundtrack doesn't make you cry because of its attachment to a scene AND because of its sheer beauty. An average soundtrack doesn't evoke images of its scene in your mind like fond memories. Yuri!!! On Ice doesn't have an average soundtrack or even a great soundtrack. It has an astounding soundtrack. And the anime's opening and ending songs are super catchy so there's that! (It's also very pleasant to listen to the sound of the skates as they cut through the ice. Aw yis, sound design.)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 10\\n\r\nThe level of character endearment achieved within 12 episodes is unreal. Yuuri, admittedly plain and normal, is one of the most relatable and most inspiring MCs I've encountered. I love him irrationally and want the best for him because he reflects the honest anxieties of trying to become someone worthy of one's passions. Victor, who seems godly in every way, isn't boring and posh perfection. He is completely and loveably human, even though he has some harsh moments where he really slips up. Some of the other ice skaters show up for 1-2 episodes and that's it. Even if you don't care for them or lowkey (maybe highkey) hope they mess up, side characters aren't forgettable. Each one you can freely like or dislike, but their talents and passion for their sport is apparent and their individuality is distinct enough that you actually remember all their names! In one of her interviews, Kubo-sensei stated that they wanted every skater to become the MC when they performed. And they succeeded amazingly. The anime's other characters are just as much a crucial part of YOI as Yuuri and Victor are.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10 is too low a rating\\n\r\nNow this is why a 8.5/10 show gets a 10/10. I picked up this show as a joke. Many of the fandom did. We expected 6/10 work, expected Free! but the water's frozen. We made jokes about it constantly (still do). We expected a badly developed plot, the usual personalities with no depth---essentially we expected crap that we'd throw into our Dropped lists without a second thought... Or at least something we could watch to make fun of for the season. One of the strongest charms of YOI is the pleasant surprise that was the first episode... Then the second, then the third, then the fifth, then the seventh and the ninth and the tenth and the twelfth! The fandom jokes about the YOI writers being unpredictable and yells about always being SHOOK!!! because this anime is beyond anything we expected. No one knew what was really going to happen next because no one really expected anything in the first place! The show itself is a marvel---not the first of its kind, no---and its community is full of love (although some of us we can admit need to calm down a bit, o dear). Going into each episode, wondering about what YOI had in store, and being surprised so joyously that we were compelled to share in our happiness: that was one of the best things about this experience. And the fandom is not willing to die just yet ;)\\n\\n\r\nCINEMATOGRAPHY - 9 ; SEIYUU - 10 (come on, it's hard to go wrong with such an all-star cast) ; PACING - 9 ; LIKELIHOOD TO BUY DVD/BLURAY - 10 ; LIKELIHOOD TO BUY MERCH - 10 ; LIKELIHOOD TO MAKE FANART - 8 (I'm resisting really hard) ; REWATCH VALUE - 10 ; QUALITY OF MEMES - 9\\n\\n\r\nIN REGARDS TO \"QUEERBAITING\" & \"FANSERVICE\"\\n\r\nYOI gives its fans what they never expected to ever receive. Week after week this anime surprised its fandom over and over; this anime surpassed the fans' expectations with leap after momentous leap. Now, these events may be referred to as \"queerbaiting\" or \"female fanservice.\" Let me present this to you: if an anime were to show loving moments between a couple, would this be labelled as \"fanservice\" or \"romance\"? This isn't to say that YOI has no fanservice at all! However, fanservice is not what the show is about. The ship that the fandom yells about isn't at the heart of YOI at all (although it's at the heart of the fandom). At the heart is a message about what it takes to do what you love. A message to not be ashamed of who you are, because you have someone to support you even if it doesn't feel like it. (Especially to the LBGT+ community, the YOI fandom will always support you all <3)",

I just wanted to see another good sports anime after finishing the third season of Haikyuu and then I kinda slipped into ..... I dunno some Shota boys action? The fandom is really strong with this, I know, but I was never that kind of yaoi fan. \r\nSo I watched one episode after another, always in fear of my heart skiping a beat because those romance parts are so intense! Well you don\u00b4t keep watching Yuri on Ice because of them skating. After reading a lot of comments I\u00b4m prettysure that nobody watched it because of the sports part. But they are skating for sure, they have those competitions (like every sports anime), they have a past, they get through hard times, they win or they lose. They laugh and cry and improve their skills.\\n\r\nBut Yuri on Ice sticks out because of the characters and their relationships. I was immediately bound to this anime without even knowing why, but gosh how funny can an anime be without prepetuating a sterotype! \\n\\n\r\nI really laughed a lot and kinda inhaled all episodes. Well done, can\u00b4t wait for season 2!",

HOWEVER,while they each have their quirks they aren't nearly as fleshed out as they could be and while a good majority of the side characters are fun and entertaining, there are a few that could be thrown out without any consequences. \r\nthe animationthroughout is impressive with the skating performances for the most part look great. the animation does dip in quality for SOME performances. characters will look off model, and limbs will be distorted. luckily for me, it wasn't a real big deal especially when you think how beautiful it will look in the blu rays. \\n\\n\r\nanother thing that I see constantly are complaints that YOI doesn't have a real relationship, that its just teasing or baiting. you have to understand Yuri On Ice barely passed the network censors as it was. they physically could not show our male leads kissing or anything without it being stopped by the network (though in the blu ray the \"kiss\" will be uncensored/uncovered) \\n\\n\r\nYOI isn't a 10/10 show that some people say it is, it has its flaws. BUT there is a charm and a passion to this show that I don't see nearly enough in anime and I have to give this show props. it was a very entertaining run and I will definitely be buying the blu ray when it releases in America.",

            "content": "Intro:\r\nYuri!!! On Ice is a shounen-ai and sports anime about figure skating. It sounds really different from your typical popular anime, but it isn't bad or mediocre at all. It's received a lot of positivity and negativity, so I presume that in the end this show caters to specific individuals. No, it is not yaoi fangirls. It's the people who are passionate about something. People who've lost their passion. People looking for motivation and/or inspiration. The hopeless romantics that can see love everywhere. The show is imbued with emotional plot points that unless you at least vaguely relate to them, you're not going to fullyexperience Yuri!!! On Ice in what it really is. A story about a young man named Yuuri Katsuki who lost his confidence and wants to build it up and save his career. In the end, it isn't a sports anime, shounen-ai, or even slice of life (because slice of life has no plot, usually). Instead, it mirrors life itself, and maybe that's why a lot of people don't enjoy it; it also doesn't fit into one genre. \\n\\n\r\nPlot:7\\n\r\nIn technicality the plot is above average. If you look at it subjectively it is above average at best. It is, to put it simply, Yuuri Katsuki's journey to the Grand Prix Final. You follow him through the events leading up to it, he meets characters, makes friends, learns from them, and spends time with them. Very simple but enjoyable. However, with emotion imbued, it becomes a spectrum of complexity. A great portrayal of life. The story of someone's life. You can tell the key events by the emotions portrayed by the characters and even more by the emotional connection that inevitably occurs if you are one of the people mentioned above. Some key events are (SPOILERS AHEAD YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED) Yuuri performing Viktor's routine, the Hasetsu showdown, the China Cup, the Rostelom Cup(ESPECIALLY this one), The events feel repetitive if you don't enjoy the sport, but each figure skating event is a KEY EVENT in the story, so the events are VERY important. If you can emotionally connect with the characters, you'll feel the intensity of each episode and plot point and will be able to truly see it's clever moments. The important thing here is connecting to the characters!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is very good, but it is an 8 because of some minor flaws. The characterization of Yuuri is iffy at times, especially when skating due to the animation difficulty, but it is mostly consistent. The figure skating scenes are glorious! The animation focuses on portraying the way each individual skates, and making sure it is unique from the rest. The animation is usually very smooth, but choppy at times. There are also some coloring issues , but none of the issues distract from the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack here is amazing. All the melodies suit the skaters and are complex. Very top quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty fleshed out and have a lot depth so it is GOOD, but not outstanding like many fans of the show hype it up to be, however it does not distract from the show. The main flaw is that most of the characters do not have bad qualities which makes them more realistic. The bad qualities that are present are very subtle and I do like details such as these to be subtle, however I know this is not the standard for many. In terms of character development, the show was actually quite good at it with select main characters. Viktor didn't get much development, it is present though, but I expect we'll see more of that in season 2. Yuuri and Yuri got the most character development and it was clearly present if you could emote with the characters. A really good thing about this show is that even the side characters got really good characterization that made you care for them and make the event more entertaining. The relationships were pretty fleshed out. The romance between Yuuri and Viktor developed naturally and was handled quite well, though it did have a few mishaps of actual non-realistic yaoi fanservice, but they can be forgiven because these \"mishaps\" are actually explained by episode 10; it was just Viktor being Viktor so no harm done. Overall, very good characters, character relationships, and development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime thoroughly. I really connected with the characters and the episodes were so fun and tense at times. The moving romance between Yuuri and Viktor really added to the themes and enjoyment of the show. I cried a lot on the last episode and I really loved the show. Probably one of my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?: YES, but only if you don't mind lots of figure skating routines, and don't mind guys loving each other. If you really emote with the characters by episode 1, you're going to love it. And even if you don't relate with the characters, you still will probably enjoy it. \u263b",

            "content": "Yuri on ice is a very lovable and funny anime, yet it has its dramatic moments.\r\nBtw it's not qualified as a shounen ai/yaoi anime, but this would definitely be one of the major themes in this anime, as most if not all couples are gay couples (nothing wrong with that i 100% love it - just a warning)\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nIt's very unique, it is a sports anime about Figure skating where the main character Yuri Katsuki, gets the best figure skater in the world Victor Nikiforov as his coach. It's funny, lighthearted, but yet serious, however can be a little repetitive. Yuri's aim is to wingold at the Grand Prix Finale where he miserably lost last year.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\n10/10 for the art itself, 5/10 for the animation. There are many points where the animation is very bad, but closeup of all characters, along with character designs are beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are marvelous, as well both Jap dub and Eng dub are great. I really like the Eng dub as they have used accents, making it seem more realistic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nAll the characters are lovable, and you will soon enough have fallen in love with all of them. Yuri Katsuki, is very kind yet he is also very anxious, and his anxiety is portrayed very realistically throughout the series. Victor, is such a great and supportive guy. You get to meet most of the other skaters and know them personally, most of them even get character development (which is something this series has done exceptionally well)/\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis series is just something you will grow to love. All characters are perfect, the romance, comedy and even the drama. When they are skating your heart is gonna beat faster because you want to know the results.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIt is definitely worth a watch. The romance is handled better than even some romance anime, and the competitiveness of sport is also handled very well. It is very comical and will make you lol multiple times an episode. But the best thing is the realism, especially in regards to relationships between LGBT, anxiety, depression etc it is all very realistic and is something which could very well happen irl.",

            "content": "Yuri on Ice captivated hearts of its fans across the globe. Colourful characters, beautiful music and interesting premise kept people entertained throughout its run. There are however problems which stopped it from grasping its potential and becoming truly amazing. \r\nAs I said the characters, music and premise are the strongest points of this anime. Let\u2019s begin with the premise. There aren\u2019t many sports anime which have balls to start with an adult protagonist, let alone an experienced one. Our main character Yuri is 22 years old at the beginning of the series and he\u2019s already skating at the grand prix final. He\u2019s already reached theendgame. But he fails. He panics and in combination of stress and lack of confidence he bombs his skating program resulting in him finishing at the last place. The underdog stories are always present in sports series. But not many of them like this. Our protagonist is already amongst the elite. He\u2019s already reached level which not many were able to reach. Yuri himself as a character is not original, but has tangible mature quality to him. He sacrificed potential childhood love to be able to skate at this level. Yuri in the first 4 episodes is pretty fantastic character who has arc of self-discovery and self-appreciation. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are all gimmicky and fun. Victor is cool and extremely charismatic. He acts as support for Yuri and also pushes Yuri with his actions when it\u2019s necessary. His relationship with Yuri is maybe little over the top (kissing skates was never so gay) but it feels like genuine relationship of appreciation. Yuri finds support and driving force in Victor while Victor finds passion, energy, strength and reason to continue work on ice skating. The rest of the characters are all different and have their own gimmicks instead of being just another rival. Yurio is Yuri with confidence, raised as future champion, expected to achieve greatness, but he\u2019s still trying to appeal to Victor. He\u2019s trying to receive his approval. Yurio\u2019s relationship with Yuri is maybe little too dramatic but it\u2019s easily excusable because of circumstances. Yurio is teenager whose biggest icon randomly decided to leave him and train this Japanese guy who failed miserably. This leaves Yurio in state of confusion and hatred for both Yuri and Victor. As the series progresses, via his own strength Yurio reaches emancipation from Victor and Yuri. He\u2019s his own man. He skates not to receive approval but to win and prove he\u2019s the best. That\u2019s great development for a character that\u2019s not the main focus of the series (especially in 12 episode anime). Every other character is notable in some way and some even receive development. \\n\\n\r\nLastly I have to mention music because it\u2019s truly something you don\u2019t see every day. Every skater has two different themes they skate to and both of them are fit to each skater\u2019s personality. And the songs aren\u2019t just instrumental but have actual singing in them. This must\u2019ve taken a lot of time and effort and should be applauded by pretty much everybody. \\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s address the shortcomings of it. First of all the production apparently had issues. The animation is highly inconsistent. From the amazing skating performance of JJ in episode 8 to horribly looking Phichit\u2019s performance in episode 6. It probably took A LOT of time to choreograph all of these skating programs so I understand that animating all of them is not easy at all. Hopefully this will be fixed in Blu-rays. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now for the final and biggest problem I had with this series. It\u2019s structure. There is not much breathing room after episode 4. Characters are kind of forced to develop as they skate or shortly before they skate which removes realism and progression. This series should\u2019ve had at least 24 episodes. I understand that selling this idea of male ice skating with experienced people as main characters was not easy by any means (even if it was created by Sayo Yamamoto one of the more famous and acclaimed female anime directors). However this just leaves me to wonder how amazing a 24 episode Yuri on Ice could\u2019ve been. For example look at Ping Pong. There are only 2 major events in Ping Pong with its 11 episodes. This gives lots of time for characters to flesh out and set themselves for development even if they receive it as they play their matches. In Yuri on Ice, after the initial 4 episodes which serve as development and establishment of Yuri\u2019s and Victors characters there are 4 competitions. There is only 1 episode that works as breathing room and its episode 10. Outside of that it\u2019s all skating. With more episodes the development and progression could\u2019ve been smoother and cleaner. And that\u2019s my biggest problem with this series. Well made, better paced 24 episodes would reach potential height of 9 or even higher. As the series stands like this, its highly enjoyable ride which never lets you go but it tries to force a bigger storyline than it can cleanly process thus leaving you in a state of slight satiation. \\n",

            "content": "So this is popular. I didn't love it.\r\nYou'll notice some people bitch about the animation, and others praise it. That's because the animation is inconsistent and I would expect the skating scenes to always look great, but a lot of it is recycled and bad.\r\nI hated the main character Yuri. I don't think I liked Yurio (thank god they gave him a nicname) till episode 12. I loved everyone else.\r\nI thought the music was nice, but...each skater skates to only 2 songs and episode 11 was great because i'd never have to listen to eros ever again. This also makes it really terrible to watch.You might get some feels like \"oh god is he going to make his jump!\" but it get's old really fast.\\n\\n\r\nThis is kinda spoiler part but, we don't get a strong solidification of Yuri's and Victor's relationship. I was hoping for something stronger in the finale.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this follows few archetypes of sports anime. It's more about figuring out your place and 1 couple. I felt the anime had poor execution and could have been better.\\n",
