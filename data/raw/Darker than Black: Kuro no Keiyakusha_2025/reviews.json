            "content": "Darker than Black, what an adventure it has been. Darker than Black takes place in a near future world where two gates appeared, Heaven's Gate and Hell's Gate. The mysterious appearance of these gates brought with them the Contractors. Contractors are people who have entered into a contract with an unknown force and gained a unique power in return. The nature of the contract however requires them to give back each time they use their power. Payment is anything from smoking a cigarette to writing a poem. The main story is told through an omnipotent point of view with the \"camera man\" being at thescene and generally following a certain group of characters, but can focus on other characters as the protagonists for an entire arc. It is a very unique telling of the story and hard to put into words, but that isn't a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art style of Darker than Black are superb. Each character is completely unique and unlike some other shows with several similar looking characters, Darker than Black does an excellent job of giving each character an unique style and a winning personality. The fights of Darker than Black are done very well and are very fluid. Although short at times, it is after all not a shounen series, they are excellent none the less. Some fights are extended and are a real treat for the eyes. Bones, the producers, did an excellent job with the series and I am looking forward to seeing more of their work.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Darker than Black is up there with my favourites of all time. An excellent mix of various genres of music. At one point it will be a jazz track, then later it will be an orchestra piece or a rock track. Overall the music is really well done and accurately depicts the scene. At some points I found myself with the hair on the back of my neck standing up as the music heated up in preparation of a coming battle. The voice acting is top notch. Hei has two distinct voices: one serious and the other calm or even clumsy sounding. The other main characters: Kirihara, Yin, Huang, and Mao also have top notch performances. Overall the casting and voice acting are very well done.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has their own special traits and have very well written dialogue. Although it is for the most part an Action/Drama type of series, there are often Comedic undertones to help break up the suspense. When Hei is not masquerading as BK201, his codename, he is a very funny and sarcastic individual. Most every character has moments that make you want to laugh, especially Gai, the off the wall private eye, and his partner, the pink haired money hungry Kiko. All in all the characters have a very nice chemistry and it is interesting to see Hei's interactions with the people who are pursuing him. The only thing that is holding back the characters is, with the exception of Hei and Yin, there is very little back story provided for many of the main characters. This is hard to do of course though with an episodic type series.\\n\\n\r\nThe series seems episodic as the story is generally told in two episode mini-arcs, with the final arc being three episodes, it never really feels very episodic. Especially toward the end where the main plot runs into each new arc. Although there is a sense of conclusion after each arc, it never really feels like it is of an episodic nature (if that makes any sense at all). I immensely enjoyed Darker than Black and it had a very satisfying conclusion.",

            "content": "Ah, the age old question; what to do when certain people suddenly begin manifesting mysterious superpowers. Darker than BLACK responds with a classic solution found in series ranging from Witch Hunter Robin to X-Men: Form secret organizations to monitor and control these people. However, despite the similar theme, this show is anything but derivative.\r\nIn the beginning of the series, the premise of the show is somewhat vague as little is known about where the powers of the contractors come from, or how they are related to the gates. As the series progresses more information is inevitably revealed, creating good plot exposition and allowing the storyto move at a decent pace and keep each episode interesting. Where this series really shines however, is the characters.\\n\\n\r\nHei is portrayed brilliantly, having a rather comicbook superhero-like persona but adding a unique spin to it. His motives are not initially apparent, nor is his true relationship with the syndicate to which he belongs. Also, while contractors are known to be emotionless and purely rational, Hei somehow manages to retain his humanity, an anomaly which many of his acquaintances and opponents comment on. The true reason for this, as well as the origin of his powers remains hidden until the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe other members of Hei's organization are similarly well portrayed, each being represented uniquely and interestingly. Huang, Yin, and Mao each have a well written back-story that is both engaging and important to the overall plot. The other characters in the story are outstanding as well, especially the antagonists. Despite the fact that the contractors are supposed to be unemotional, each character still manages to have a unique personality which often even enhanced by this fact.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one weakness in this series, it is the ending, which is unfortunately rather inconclusive. I'm kind of hoping for a sequel, but this may be difficult for reasons that would be hard to disclose without revealing spoilers. The ending also has a &quot;suddenly everything got weird&quot; part to it that seems common in final episodes of supernatural anime, but at least it makes a lot more sense than many I've seen. If you like shows about people with supernatural powers, I think you should definitely watch this series.",

            "content": "\u2022Cool ass Chinese Batman protagonist in a Gotham-esque neo-noir setting?\r\nCheck\u2714\r\n\u2022A city overrun with nifty characters that have x-men like powers?\r\nCheck\u2714\r\n\u2022Nice mysterious lore with strange in-world concepts?\r\nCheck\u2714\r\n\u2022A clear-cut answer to ANY of these \"mysterious\" concepts and a sense of finality to our protagonist's existence?\r\nDon't hold your breath. \r\nDarker and Black felt like a show that was onto something worthwhile but ultimately never got around to proving it. The ingredients to make something great was clearly there but by the end, all we got was a show with ambitious ideas that did nothing but let it dwindle away into nothingness. Does that mean it isn't worth theinvestment? Well, yes and no. If all you wanted was a cool ass electric Batman beating the mercy of God into x-men characters, then DTB certainly delivers. However, if you wanted more than the beat-em-up action happening on the surface and actually cared about the complete package hinted at in the background, then you'll walk away empty-handed. \\n\\n\r\nLong story short, Darker and Black had the goods, just not the means necessary to deliver them.\\n\\n\r\n**THIS REVIEW WAS BROUGHT TO YOU BY PIZZA HUT**\\n\\n\r\nInstead of reciting the synopsis, I'll get straight to what the meat of the show consists of.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a series of mini-arcs with each addressing a new conflict. In each of these conflicts, the main group that contains our characters are assigned a task to fulfill by a crime syndicate, with our protagonist, Hei, being the foot soldier to carry out the missions. The syndicate, for a majority of the show, remained a faceless organization, and in the confines of the kind of show being presented, that isn't really a bad thing. They were omnipresent and ominous, guiding their pawns across the chess board, with Hei simply being another piece in the game. This syndicate was in constant conflict with other underground organizations, which lead both sides to dispatch \"contractors\" (superhumans) to do their bidding.\\n\\n\r\nThese clashes play out like a feud war being carried out in secrecy, due to the governing bodies of the city covering up the existence of \"contractors\" and \"dolls\" in fear of civil unrest. Since law enforcing authorities from the CIA to the local police are constantly trying to apprehend, gather, and suppress information about these occurrences, every episode hits you with a blitz of energy and nonstop action. That, of course, results in a narrative that's constantly on the move, which is a good thing for action junkies and those seeking out easy-to-consume entertainment. Also, while all of this is going on, we are also given clues as to how the world operates in regards to the contractors, dolls, and a phenomenon that's simply dubbed \"Hells Gate.\" While it's a gradual occurrence, after some time, these mini-arcs eventually converge to create an overarching one. Its story structure is similar to that of other shows like Ghost in the Shell: SAC and Psycho-Pass.\\n\\n\r\nSeems pretty straightforward right, so where do the problems start?\\n\\n\r\nWell, despite the consistent pace, since everything is told in a semi-episodic mini-arc format, there isn't really any true progression to talk about. Sure, we get to see the backstories of our main characters unfold and find out more about the show's lore, but as far as a sense of direction, DTB was scatterbrained. It aimlessly meandered about with no sense of purpose or clear destination, even after one seemed to present itself in the last handful of episodes. It ended up escalating the conflict instead of addressing it. Which brings us to the biggest issue plaguing the show: its inability to provide answers. \\n\\n\r\nDTB has a bad habit of telling us everything BUT what's actually important. It will go out of its way to deliver unnecessary expository dialogue to things we clearly see happening, while simultaneously using ambiguity as a crutch to avoid explaining the concepts it depends so heavily on. This, of course, results in a lot of moments where individuals would start acting out of character just so they can directly inform the audience of situations or explain how certain things work (like a contractor's given ability for example). I'm not saying a brief explanation isn't warranted but after something is established like the payment concept contractors have to make for using their powers, we don't need to get that information regurgitated every single time it happens \u2014 and trust me, it happens a lot. It feels as if the writers viewership as being too dimwitted to figure it out for themselves. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the information that they don't give us, a definitive answer to any of the anomalies that occurred in the story remained one of them. The show kept on insinuating that there're answers to come, by dropping little nuggets of information throughout the narrative but that simply never exfoliated into anything in the end. It felt like they completely abandoned the idea of trying to explain the reason for any of the \"mystery\" concepts, only to opt out by following a hollow aspect of the overall setting established in the beginning. None of the supernatural elements are ever justified or explained despite the fact \"mystery\" part of its genre:\\n\r\nWhy did the Hell's Gate appear? What purpose does it serve? How does it correlate with humans evolving into contractors? Why do the stars correlate with contractors lives? What is the end goal of the syndicate's operation? Are the contractors and dolls suppose to parallel the man vs man parable? Why is anything not making any proper sense outside of superficial techno-babble? \\n\\n\r\nFor a show that tried so much to build a mystery, it sure failed on upholding its end of the bargain. \\n\\n\r\nAnd how do you end a show that didn't bother to provide answers to anything? Well apparently, you simply reveal a poorly planned plot twist that turns the final episode into an existential fever dream that hasn't been seen since the likes of Evangelion. And since no one has the balls to say it, I will. For a show to chalk up all its supernatural elements to nothing more than made up allegorical fluff, while throwing in an improper Eva-esque conclusion, when up to that point, it was a simple rule-of-cool beat-em-up; why that's just borderline pretentious. And yes, I know, many of you are probably rolling your eyes in disgust by the mere mention of that \"p\" word, but really, in this situation, there's no other word to properly describe just how over-bloated the show got towards its climax. \\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with creators trying to be overly-ambitious but when the foundation is built on poorly realized concepts and unexplained in-world mechanics, the end result will inevitably suffer as a result. A perfectly serviceable action-romp was thrown away for the sake of ambiguity and pseudo-concepts. And if you're expecting the 2nd season to fill in the gaps, all you'll get there is a super loli, a raging alcoholic and talking squirrel, so don't hold your breath. \\n\\n\r\n**You know what goes well with this review? A nice hot box of PIZZA HUT!**\\n\\n\r\nThe stylistic direction of DTB was very western influenced. I wasn't kidding when I made the Gotham/x-men hybrid comparison. From the murky hues to character designs akin to that of DC Comics' cartoon installments, DTB's universe could easily crossover with a Justice League spin-off with very little problem. Like many other animated works, during the show's downtime, there wasn't much to credit the show for presentation-wise, but when the action sequences happen, it truly becomes blood pumping roller-coaster ride. And when placed side by side with other shows made in the same year, it truly was a cut above the rest. The only major hindrance that reared its ugly head was the occasional usage of CGI... also Pizza Hut ads, lots, and lots of Pizza Hut ads. I've counted no less than 17 ads while viewing the show (Code Geass has nothing on this). So take that for what you will.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was a mixture of new-school jazz, funk, and blues, along the lines of other western influenced anime such as Baccano! and Cowboy Bebop. This nice blend help contributed to the show's overall atmosphere, giving it character. Of course, it has its somber tracks as well but the ones that stood out were the aforementioned. The songs never outplay the corresponding scenes on screen but work in unison with them. There's a chemistry there that couples the visuals with the audio wonderfully. All the voice actors performed their roles with no noticeable hiccups, with this being one of the premier examples of an English dubbed cast trumping its Japanese counterpart. It's not going to be the \"best dub ever\" but it certainly gets the job done. \\n\\n\r\nNow, what barely got the job done, however, was the characters themselves. \\n\\n\r\nYou know you have a problem when the show's cat has more of a personality than the people in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast was crippled by the show's premise. Since contractors and dolls alike are devoid of irrational feelings and have no moral compass outside of calculated thought, it doesn't leave room for any kind of development or growth (or personality, for that matter). The most DTB can do was to flesh them out with a backstory but other than that, they remained one-note from beginning to end. Despite this flaw, one redeeming quality was that most of the adult characters were handled with some semblance of maturity. Of course, that doesn't negate the lack of characterization but it certainly helps to make them feel more grounded.. well... for the most part anyway, as they do occasionally toss in a bit of misplaced comedic moments in a similar fashion to how shows like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood attempted something similar. \\n\\n\r\nTo add more life to these emotionally stilted characters, the show resorted to victimizing them, with either the inclusion of a sad backstory or having them be discriminated against because of their abnormal abilities (similar to the way x-men approached the subject matter). It's passable drama but only to a certain extent and can be seen as forceful by seasoned viewers.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the semi-episodic structure, there's a lot of characters introduced. I'll only go over the three main ones we follow. \\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist is a man of little words and little personality as well, given his position as a \"contractor.\" in the show's canon. When remnants of his past and personal life are conjured up by others, it quickly becomes apparent that there's more to him beyond his stoic demeanor. But despite that, these brief glimpses of humanity in him are still lacking, thanks in no small part to the short emotional leash the anime forces him to wear. When in public, he masquerades as a bashful mild-mannered person, playing off the \"nice guy\" gimmick similar to other characters like Himura from Rurouni Kenshin and Vash from Trigun. It's only when he's tasked with a mission that his electric Batman persona reveals itself. His sole purpose is to be that of the iconic badass that kicks ass and takes names. And with little else expected from him, it's always fun to see him do just that. But of course, like the plot that went from a simple action-romp to a contrived metaphysical mess, the show's ending brought with it an unneeded plot twist that negated all the fun that Hei brought to the table. \\n\r\nOn a side-note, it seems like lacking emotion leaves more room for an appetite since Hei can guzzle down a crap ton of food with as much proficiency as a battle shounen protagonist. But enough about Hei, time to discuss my personal favorite from the bunch, Huang.\\n\\n\r\nHuang, to put it simply, is your hard-ass. The kind of guy you'll come across with the gravely voice and no bullshit attitude that borders on pigheadedness. He doesn't take shit from anyone. It's made quite clear that he's discriminatory towards Contractors and Dolls. This, of course, was later explained with his stand-alone backstory. Although he's simply a human and not tied to the \"no irrational emotion\" crutch of the show's premise, he too lacks any further growth. He's your archetypal mobster type and given his disdain for Contractors, you often see him butting heads with Hei. Despite that, he's the most maturely handled character in the group and perhaps the only one with actual characterization. He's the closest thing to a character with actual depth in the show; a man hardened by his line of work and unfortunate past. This was shown through his business decorum, as he approaches every situation with a veteran-like decorum. And as he stood, Huang was the backbone of this anime's success. Constantly working in the background to get shit done. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now that we've covered the show's cool mobster, time to talk about the Great Value knock-off brand of Rei Ayanami, Yin. \\n\\n\r\nYin was essentially the bootleg version of the \"Rei Ayanami\" archetype and with that said, there isn't much of a personality to speak of. She was appropriately classified as a doll (as she has the personality of one) and the only information needed to be known about her is that she's the eyes and ears of Hei, as her power allows her to see anywhere around the city where a pool of water is collected. Of course, she was eventually given a proper backstory episode dedicated towards her later on, but even that didn't do much to flesh her out as an individual and eventually became null and void after her moment in the limelight was over. But since this series is known for saying \"fuck a plot,\" even her involvement became more convoluted in later installments. But until you venture that far in, just enjoy her for her simplicity. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few other recurring characters in the show, like a private detective named Gai Kurasawa, a man who shares a striking resemblance, job, and characteristic to Kuruma Jo, from 1975's Hurricane Polymar. But seeing that no one even knows of that anime's existence, I digress.\\n\r\nAnother recurring side character worth addressing includes Misaki, who was your level-headed detective, and unlike most of the other side characters, she actually received a few episodes dedicated to fleshing her out. Not anything too compelling but enough to properly define her. She plays a bigger role by being a proxy for the viewers to see both sides of the growing conflict in the show. For all intents and purposes, she's basically a fleshed out plot-device. \\n\\n\r\nDespite a lack of any true development or proper characterization, as a collective, the cast was a lot of fun to watch. A case where the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. Just don't expect anything profound out of them. And in a way, that's the best way to describe this show, in a nutshell: fun but nothing beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black is like a smorgasbord, you simply pick whatever suits your fancy and discard anything that doesn't. As for me, I took away the cool ass fights and audiovisual treats. Your appetite as a viewer may allow for more, so depending on your taste and tolerance for certain things, this might be a buffet that you find yourself fully indulging in.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite my issues with the plot and contrive narrative threads brought up later on, I can't deny how much I enjoyed watching electric Batman kick the crap out of baddies in the dark alleyways of the city. Call it mindless violence if you will, but it was done with so much style and ease that I found myself taking in every moment of it. DTB was a bitter pill to swallow at times but when it came to the action, it delivered on a silver platter.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the years, DTB has garnered a sizable fan-base, staying relevant in many anime-centric discussion circles and to a certain extent, I can understand why. As far as rule-of-cool shows goes, DTB excels, but due to the issues I discussed, I can only recommend it to those who simply want a nice action flick. With that said, the lower you set your expectations, the greater your enjoyment of this title would be. It's not a show I'll ever advocate for but at the same time, I'll still give it the greenlight for others curious enough to want to check it out. \\n\\n\r\n**BTW you're probably tired from all that reading.. you should treat yourself to Pizza Hut......PIZZZA HUTTTT!!!**",

            "content": "==STORY==\r\nThe story is very good in my opinion, it contains many details about the history, abilities and life of the characters. It gets more and more complicated through the show. The story tells about a world, very similar to ours that had gone through a massive change. one day the starts started raining from the skies and together with them appeared a gate, Hells Gate. Some people were given special powers but not for free and they didn't really choose them. They were simply given special powers. They are called Contractors. A contractor has a special ability, as an example I can rain fire fromthe sky however it will cost me something. Each contractor has a different &quot;payment&quot; method. Some have to drink alcohol after each time they use their powers, some have to drink blood. The contractors are lacking emotions (as far as I've noticed) but aren't emotionless. Together with them appeared 2 more life forms, Dolls and Oracles. The dolls lack ANY emotions or free will, they act according to what they are told to do. They can do anything a normal human can. The oracles can... obviously predict the future. Since the &quot;Hell's Gate&quot; appeared many weird phenomenons started to appear near it. The city (Tokyo) was closed within walls and new skies appeared. \\n\\n\r\n=ART==\\n\r\nThe art is awesome, there's always a feeling of mystery and an enemy might hide anywhere. You can never tell what's going on and it doesn't randomly switch the scenes. The show is smooth and is pretty much perfect.\\n\\n\r\n==CHARACTER==\\n\r\nThe characters start with a small amount of info about them such as name and that's it. The info will grow through the story and new parts of them will reveal. The characters evolve and change quite a lot through the whole story. Some develop new sides which have never been seen even if they shouldn't.\\n\\n\r\n=ENJOYMENT==\\n\r\nI enjoy this show very much, to be honest with you I can't stop watching it. Almost watched the raws! The story isn't messed up, the art is great and you just can't stop watching. This show will leave you with a taste of more at the end of each and every episode.\\n\\n\r\n==OVERALL==\\n\r\nI enjoy this show so much and that's the main reason I'm making this review. Since some of you are probably confused I am more than glad to write this review down for you. I really hope you'll enjoy this show as much as I do.\\n\\n\r\n~regards -&gt; Tsunami! &lt;-",

They appeared the same time Hell\u2019s Gate did; a mysterious forcethat covers Tokyo\u2019s sky. Their powers come at a price and the wage is different for every Contractor. Rival organizations kill, back-stab, infiltrate, investigate and work together to uncover the mysteries of Hell Gate.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is Hei, one of these Contractors working as an assassin/investigator for one these organizations. Together with Yin, an emotionless doll; Mao the talking black cat and Huang, a normal middle aged guy; Hei tries to investigate the mystery that is Hell\u2019s Gate and locate his younger sister Pai whilst carrying out the orders/missions from the Syndicate. \\n\\n\r\nOh, don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get any more answers or plot revelation when watching the show. By the end of the series we\u2019re left with the SAME standstill story and the SAME questions as the beginning: What exactly is Hell\u2019s Gate? How did it get there? Why did it make people with supernatural abilities emerge? How did it alter the sky? Why doesn\u2019t Hei have a payment for his power? How did he come to work for the Syndicate? Sadly, the endless line of questions we have from episode one is left unanswered. \\n\\n\r\nWhen entering Darker than Black it can either be a hit or miss \u2013 people will either say \u201cOh, I\u2019ve seen it before\u201d and dismiss it, others will be taken in by the dark American superhero story atmosphere presented in the first two episodes. For the rest of the series it is pretty much a rinse and repeat session with the two episode mini arcs. This is what DtB does well, actually. By creating these mini arcs it doesn\u2019t danger itself into needlessly dragging the same story out and with this manages to cover quite a lot of characters as each mini arc is dedicated to one character revealing their past etc. \\n\\n\r\nBut the characters themselves were quite unremarkable. Sure, a masked contractor; a blind emotionless girl and talking cat along with other Contractors; British MI6 agents and police agents sounds interesting enough - but it really isn\u2019t. The characters do develop \u2013 as aforementioned there are mini arcs to show this, but they all lack something: REAL CHARACTER. Of course it is not a slice of life, therefore it can ignore the finer details but as they were TRYING to give the characters substance with the mini arcs it just made them fail even worse on giving an individual any spruce: they are all so dreadfully BORING. I ended up not caring about any single one of them. \\n\\n\r\nHei, on the other hand, was the exception. Forget all the other characters; this is the one who takes the entire spotlight. Probably the most entertaining one of them all \u2013 and why not!  Playing the normal innocent student by day and an apathetic assassinator by night, Hei is the master of in-character acting. What\u2019s more, with his split personality, insane skills and a mask that screams \u2018badass\u2019  he takes control of the entire show, I only wished we got to see more of that side of him.  He brought a reminiscent feeling of the character L from Death Note, notably for his crouched stance when taking on the role of the clueless student. \\n\\n\r\nHis English voice actor captured the split personality nature of Hei; from the innocent naivety to the cold-hearted killer. It really stood out from the other voice actors, who were \u2013 at best \u2013 average. However, one of the pros of watching the dub is hearing the British accents by many of the characters. Although it is overdone, at least there is that international appeal in it that the Japanese version will not have. But if you\u2019re not too keen on dubs in the first place then just opt to complete subs. You\u2019ll be missing out on the accents but one of the character\u2019s voice acting was so bad it lowered the overall quality of the sound. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of sound, one of the saving graces of the show was indefinitely the music. Though the music is most likely forgettable as there was no set soundtrack or theme songs that would be played in every episode, each unique theme that would range from jazz to classical to rock always manages to stir up excitement that would fit in perfect sync with the choreograph or scene.  Like Hollywood movies there is a varied track list, so it never becomes repetitive. The OP and ED on the other hand did not live up to the excellent sound during the show \u2013 it was good but with the other music they had already set themselves a high bar so that had left their OP/ED to become rather disappointing. One point that comes to mind about the opening sequences is the jogging camera movement in the animation. I thought this was an excellent way to portray the hectic and fragmented nature of the show, and made the OPs a joy to watch. Animation is flawless, as expected of BONES (those awesome guys who brought us Ouran, Fullmetal Alchemist and Cowboy Bebop).  \\n\\n\r\nFans of NGE, rejoice. Well fans of a \u2018certain scene\u2019 in NGE rejoice. For the show carries some resemblance to that famous mindfuck anime \u2013 with riddled monologues and the infamous \u201cCongratulations\u201d scene almost being replicated in the last episodes (yes, the show does not give us a complete ending). So, if you\u2019re not a fan of the NGE ending, then DtB probably won\u2019t be your cup of tea in terms of ending.  \\n\\n\r\nDarker than BLACK is heavily flawed. I felt like they were trying to hard; sometimes it had bad comedy and often enough it had too many loose ends. The story lacks development and the characters do not stand out. However, the series still manages to hook the audience with its dark atmosphere, the menacing Hei and the well orchestrated action scenes (my only qualm about said scenes were that there were too few and too short). The first few episodes are the critical point for the viewer \u2013 either a hit or a miss for them, some would deem it as \u201cseen it before\u201d, and others will be drawn into its alluring nature.  Also, regarding the second season of the show: that too does not even answer the questions formed for season one, so if you\u2019re okay for vague roundabout answers, dull characters (excluding Hei, naturally) and well choreographed action then DtB is the show for you.",

            "content": "What format is best for telling a story of an anime series; a narrative format that\u2019s episodic or a format that has a continuing story from beginning to end? It honestly depends on who or what story is trying to be told if any at all. While episodic is easier to get into since the format can be better use for just entertainment. Thus you can eliminate the need of continuity, making it favorable for anyone to just jump into the series at any point. An overarching story on the other hand can build up to a greater or more disappointing outcome depending on theexecution since it requires commitment. \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d combines both formats in its narrative will which lead to commitment issues. Thanks to it's careful execution in combining both types of story formats you have a first half that does a great job of world building and a second half that has an overarching story that remains engrossing to the end. \\n\\n\r\nGood: Strong Writing\\n\\n\r\nDarker Than Black uses a two episode format to tell its stories. Allowing side characters to receive enough development to them feel like characters part of a bigger story instead of coming across as unimportant one shot characters. Thanks to this format it offers a host of well thought out characters and storylines on a variety of themes. Each contributing to either fleshing the setting or further developing a recurring character. No matter the screen time of certain side characters, their contribution feels like they added a piece of lore to the series. The atmosphere excels due to its extensive world building in the first half. Not only does the world fill unique, but by the end of the series it\u2019ll feel like a real place even if it belongs in the realm of fiction.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that is mostly serious it knows when to have fun. The few comedic episodes in the anime don\u2019t affect the overall plot, but are nice a diversion to lighten the mood. These episodes inclusions make the series a bit enjoyable preventing from being a downer all the time. Generally though it has the well written dialogue to keep it afloat all throughout and engaging conversation among the characters as well. \\n\\n\r\nA downside to the two episode format is it will take half way before the main cast gets developed. In turn, this makes sticking with the anime a risk versus reward deal. Making it more dangerous is the fact that it doesn\u2019t have an overarching story until it reaches the second half either. So the first half focuses on Hei taking on jobs for a shady organization called \u201cThe Syndicate\u201d. Being more in line of an episodic anime generally not connecting story arcs. This will make it difficult to want to commit to the anime since the main cast is the only guaranteed returning characters while every supporting character is not guaranteed to return. The main cast will remain underdeveloped before reaching the halfway mark. There\u2019s no way around this issue other than having complete faith in the anime. If you\u2019re unable to attach yourself to anything in the anime before the main cast are developed in the second half, then staying committed to the series is a task on itself. \\n\\n\r\nOnce it starts developing an overarching story in the second half everything falls further into place. The stakes become bigger, the main cast get developed, and answers on some of the series biggest dangling questions get answered. For example, \u201cThe Syndicate\u201d motives and goal are revealed in the second half after being mentioned heavily in the first half. There\u2019s also the start of an overarching story that instead of creating more action goes for giving Hei a greater mental obstacle to overcome. Building it up nicely before reaching the finale and feeling the weight Hei has to shoulder. \\n\\n\r\nThe reaction towards the finale of \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d will draw mix reaction. It doesn\u2019t end with a bang making it fit more with the rest of the series. However, not everything will be answered. It\u2019s appropriate for some questions to remain unanswered since the characters themselves don\u2019t know all of them either. It\u2019s more in line of capturing a noir mystery so some dangling questions will be forgivable. One thing is certain about the finale is it does close the story up and ties up all loose ends. Completely understanding everything after it ends that\u2019s a whole other matter. \\n\\n\r\nGood: A Cool Cast \\n\\n\r\nHei is the protagonist of the series and for more than half of the anime his past is kept secretive. Unfortunately revealing anything about him should be a consider a spoiler. Learning about Hei and seeing his backstory developed is a major part of the story. His personality can throw viewers off since the series does take its time giving background towards contractor and explain why they are emotionless. Hei is written in such a way that part of his character is difficult to read because of it. He fills the quota to be an emotionless contractor, but shows emotion in everyday life with sarcastic remarks when he interacts with other in the cast. He\u2019s an intriguing mystery within the story and as a character becomes fully realize.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main from talking cat Mao who gathers information, to the unable to get drunk when drinking handler Huang, and emotionless medium doll Yin are handled in the same way in their characterization. Like Hei, these main characters don\u2019t get developed until later on in the series. When they are develop the two episode format allows room for in depth characterization. Setting up the character conflict in that episode and then following up by revealing bits of their themselves once the main cast reach closer towards a solution. Seeing them interact with one another never goes smoothly. Since they have varied personalities the chemistry between the characters can be both hilarious and captivating at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nHalf of the supporting cast tend to be done with after a single story arc. Once the story or job is finished that supporting characters will likely not be seen again. One of the few recurring supporting character is private eye detective Gai Kurusawa and his young manga obsessed assistant Kiko Kayanuma. The majority of the comedy revolve around these two characters. Gai Kurusawa is the closest the anime has to an exaggerated character. Reacting to his situation in over the top ways for a comedic effect. His interaction with Kiko usually revolve being desperate to accept any job for cash to arguing about the methods in getting cases solved. Episodes revolving around Gai Kurusawa and Kiko Kayanuma are easily entertaining with humor that hit due to their personalities and chemistry.\\n\\n\r\nThough the setting of the story is in Japan the cast is composed of characters from other parts of the world. It\u2019s not racial diversity just for the sake of it, but rather more of story tool to get across how big of a crisis it could escalate too. The CIA are involved, MI6 Agents are involved, underground organization \u201cThe Syndicate\u201d, and the organization Evening Primrose that attempt to obtain peaceful coexistence between contractors and humans are involved. That\u2019s quite the batch of organizations to keep track off and the same applies to the characters that work in them. Fortunately each organization is given a different objective for their goals and how they operate varied from one another. What this does is create different viewpoints within the setting on how the matter of contractors should be resolved. Giving several viewpoints on the matter as it grows into a bigger issue for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nGood: Capturing the Intended Mood Perfectly\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is handled by studio Bones. While not impressive in the least on the visual side or in movement the style is a good fit for the anime. Character designs don\u2019t have any exaggerated features and the environments are kept down to Earth as much as possible. Backgrounds are detailed with careful lighting that helps create the noir feel the series goes for. Everything is portrayed with some level of realism, including the contractors powers. Whenever a contractor uses their power the animation withholds from creating an excessive visual effect. Action scenes don\u2019t feature any flashy particle effect that draws attention to a contractor power. So everything meshes together for a unify look even when the more exaggerated element of the story are on screen. \\n\\n\r\nThis also holds true for the action scenes which aren\u2019t a drawing factor for the anime. Usually the action scenes are slow with the already mentioned restrained on flashy effects when a power is in used. In general, most of the action scenes have simple choreography that gets interrupted by conversations or is just slow in execution. Not counting the second opening. There are a few action scenes that combines contractors full abilities with the restraint display of powers, but unless Hei opponent Wei the action is underwhelming. CGI is used rarely, but questionable since it\u2019s primarily used on cars which aren\u2019t used for any elaborate scene. Cars simply go from one point to the next. Thankfully it does not stick out enough to become an issue since it\u2019s only use from far shots. If anything can get annoying is seeing product placement for Pizza Hut in the background.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting from both the Japanese and English dub cast are terrific. In both versions the low key and restrained performances give off that noir feel the anime goes for. Unfortunately in both versions, some cast members aren\u2019t allowed much ranged because part of the cast play the emotionless contractors. However, they are not stiff performances. The voice actors walk a thin line of coming across sounding wooden that they never cross. Most notably the most balance and perfected portrayal fall under Hidenobu Kiuchi in Japanese and Jason Liebrecht for the English dub both of whom voice Hei. Regardless what language you hear Hei speak both voice actor performances are tailored for this character. Neither are a dead giveaway in their delivery always surrounding Hei in this mysterious aura. His character is very difficult read, thanks to the voice talent, even delivery their jokes in a careful manner. Both actors are able to be funny while staying in character despite how little emotion they display in general.\\n\\n\r\nIkuya Sawaki in the Japanese cast and Kent William in the English both voice Mao. These two actors' voices give off vastly different vibes in their portrayal of Mao. Sawaki sounds more natural like a friendly person with many connections, while William deeper sounding voice makes him sound wiser. William older sounding voice shines when he delivers sarcastic remarks. In the English dubbed Kent William is an easy standout and my favorite actor in this season. \\n\\n\r\nOne area where the English dub surpasses the Japanese cast are the accents for foreign characters. The Japanese cast in general don\u2019t even come close in copying accents for foreign characters. In the English dub Troy Baker voices November 11, a clearly British character terrifically. Adding to an already accurate portrayal he fits the sophisticated character just fine. \\n\\n\r\nThe only major differences between both version is the comedy. Depending on what version you see the humor will be written for that specific culture in mind. Aside from that the English script remains as faithful as possible. While there\u2019s the obvious dialogue changes there are episodes where the story changes are less subtle. There\u2019s some episodes where certain plot points are beaten over the head. It\u2019s not damaging to the point that it\u2019s a complete turn off as it, though the material won\u2019t always match the quality of the original in the English script.\\n\\n\r\nIf you had to choose how to see the anime I would say watch the series subbed since the Japanese cast is consistent throughout the whole series. While the English dub in season one is the clear victor due to the voice actors more accurate portrayal of foreign characters. However, in season two some casting choices end up backfiring as the script changes are notably different making some of the English voice cast come across as annoying. The English dubbed has a better cast for the first season, but the Japanese cast is consistently good all the way. If it\u2019s short term English dub, but in the long run go with the English subbed.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is filled with good music. It\u2019s diverse in genre from rock ballads, to cool jazz, and to slower more calming sounding tracks. The two opening tracks can come across as misleading when representing the mood and pace of the series. \u201cHowling\u201d by Abingdon Boys School for the first 14 episodes and \u201cKakusei Heroism\u201d by An Cafe is used in episode 15 and onwards (minus episode 24) for the remainder of the series. Both opening theme makes \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d come across as a quick pace action series. While not accurate in presenting the series the two opening songs are fine for the anime. \u201cTsukiakari\u201d by Rie Fu is a slow and melancholic track. It\u2019s the ending theme for the first 14 episodes with a more emotional feel to it unlike the opening themes. Rie Fu soothing vocals are in harmony with the soft piano ballad. The second ending theme is \"Dreams\" by the band High And Mighty Color. \u201cDreams\u201d is more upbeat than the first ending theme in it\u2019s serenity. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: More than thrilled I stuck with it\\n\\n\r\nIt took me fourteen episodes before I was actually able to enjoy watching Darker Than Black. Everything is kept deliberately secretive so I found it difficult to care about my main cast in the first half of the series when they weren\u2019t developed. Eventually in the second half I started to care about them on episode 13 & 14 both of which focused on Yin. It was with these two episodes that my skepticism were gone since it made me feel that much closer to the main cast. I was convinced with these two episodes that this anime has something else to keep me coming back beside the first closing theme \u201cTsuki Akari\u201d by Rie Fu. Thank goodness too for those two episodes because episode 15 the ending theme changed. Episode 15 and onward the whole development of the main cast made the strong writing that much better in subsequent episodes. It just took a while to get into it. \\n\\n\r\nCalculating Points:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/3\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/3\\n\\n\r\nTechnical (Animation, Soundtrack, Voice acting, etc.): 2/3\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 1/1\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nDarker Than Black is not a series that will immediately hook you from the get go. The pacing is slow with it two episode structure taking half-way before developing a main story, but over time the strong writing, and great characters become far more memorable for it. Thanks to it two episode format for storytelling even side characters get fleshed out. Creating a fully realize world with diverse and complicated characters. It\u2019s a difficult anime to fully get into, but the payoff it worth it if you trust it and stick with it through the end.\\n",

            "content": "I decided to check out this anime based solely on Yoko Kanno's involvement.  From the first five minutes, the Matrix vibe was so heavy I thought Trinity was going to show up any minute.  After the opening 'homage', the Matrixy stuff is toned down and reduced to the landscape.  It's a green-hued city populated by people with powers...\r\nThere's also A LOT of annoying Pizza Hut product placements in nearly every episode.  This anime also has one of the most annoying anime character types in the medium: I'm talking about the character in law enforcement that is just useless and who's onlypurpose is to provide us with exposition.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is interesting though, random mysterious 'gates' appearing in South America and Japan, the stars being replaced by fake ones, contractors enacting weird rituals every time they kill.  Some story arcs are better than others, it's a mixed bag.  It's episodic, but tries to provide some plot development in each episode.  There's a cool British character named after my birthday: November 11.\\n\\n\r\nKanno's music is good as usual, she's sublime, but I was slightly disappointed to hear her strings aping Don Davis's Matrix style.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character of Hei was pretty interesting, not least for the fact that he's a Chinese main protagonist in a Japanese anime, but he looks cool in that mask too, and we watch him deceive people a lot, which is always fun.\\n\\n\r\nDarker Than Black is let down by the writing.  You know its at fault when you realise after 25 episodes they couldnt explain the main mystery of the tale; the reason why the world is the way it is; why the characters are the way they are; why we bothered to watch the anime in the first place.  There's a difference between smart ambiguity and stretching an interesting premise so thin you cant even wrap it up at the end.",

            "content": "Darker than BLACK is an exciting, heavily arc driven Sci-fi, Supernatural, Action anime; following the stories of various human beings, with various special powers, known as Contractors. ^_^\r\nThe plot of Darker than BLACK is somewhat confusing as you start but after a while you&rsquo;ll become accustomed to the intriguing plot, though it does take most of the show to fully understand. For the most part of the story it is arranged into 2 episode length adventures/arcs, giving it and episodic feel. Unlike other episodic adventure anime series (Cowboy Bebop), that extra episode allows the characters to be developed far better. This helps give this animeand edge because a lot of the characters are portrayed in such a way that you can&rsquo;t help but feel something towards them. Even though each arc has the same sort of structure as a 4-panel manga (Intro =&gt; Development =&gt; Turning point =&gt; Conclusion) yet each one feels unique in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the episodic characters that I discussed early, there are quite a few recurring main characters in the series that have fairly complex and intriguing personalities. Hei (BK201) being the character that the story revolved around was the most interesting one of them all, because he was so difficult to comprehend. The only real negative is the annoying detective character that appears, every now and then, for comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation can be compared with that of the more popular series, Death Note; with its superb visuals and the seamless blending of hand drawn and CG. Nonetheless there is just a little less detail, put into it, due to action but this helps create incredibly fluid animation. The music is basically a mix of Jazz, Rock, J pop and other melodies that will go well most of the different situations and moods of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Darker than BLACK fulfilled its purpose of becoming, an incredibly, exciting anime that could compete, with the likes of Claymore, when it first aired. Even with the plot and premise being confusing in the beginning, it all ended up being easy to understand as the show went on however there were still some issues left unexplained, in the end. Even with some elements of its storyline, having already been done before, there was still enough original content to make up for it. Well I recommend this anime to anyone who feels like watching a good action anime, with some sci-fi and supernatural elements.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "For a show with so much promise, Darker than Black is remarkably unremarkable, with a production as insipid as it is polished, and plot that tries so hard to be original that it ends up being turgid. I know there are hordes of fans of the show who will no doubt line up to disagree with me but, if the show had lived up to the expectations the names &ldquo;Studio BONES&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yoko Kanno&rdquo; conjure, I wouldn&rsquo;t be here expressing my disappointment. But irrespective of expectations and potential, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of the show as dressed-up mediocrity, with only an added dash ofheart to save it from being entirely unmemorable. The show&rsquo;s strengths lie in its characterisation and dramatic themes, which ultimately manage to shine through the absurd pseudo-sci-fi banter and general silliness. Its weaknesses are pronounced in the overarching story itself, and the way its progression is paced over the course of the show, but are also reflected in some surprisingly unimpressive production choices.\\n\\n\r\nBy no means is this a cheap anime, and on numerous occasions the visuals prove this with displays of technical excellence. However, I was rather dissatisfied with the show&rsquo;s production due to its poor and uninspired use of aesthetics to create a sense of style or to build an atmosphere. I think the show could have been enhanced greatly with greater attention being payed not simply to the detail and framerate of the animation, but also to its overall look. The background artwork, excluding a few scenes inside the gate, is bland and disengaging, with basic design and criminally unsubtle colouring. Compare the striking, and varied cityscapes of Gits:SAC to the featureless squares that DTB passes for buildings. Walls are lazily depicted in gradients of grey or brown that seem at odds with the lighting of the scenes. Rather than bringing the settings to life, they actually detract from them. Perhaps I&rsquo;m spoilt by IG&rsquo;s background work, but for a series of such supposed calibre I found it to be very poor indeed. The cel animation is crisp and detailed, and holds up well in the action scenes (as expected from the professionalism of BONES). Unfortunately, the character designs it has to work with are fairly average, with a few exceptions (Misaki, Yin).\\n\\n\r\nThe music is by Yoko Kanno, which says a lot for itself, although not as much as I&rsquo;d like in this case. The quality of the music itself is inarguably high - not Kanno&rsquo;s greatest work by any stretch, but nor her worst. Her jazz pieces lack the sophistication or personality of her work on Bebop and I can&rsquo;t help but feel that Mai Yamane&rsquo;s vocal contributions are wasted in her songs - but this still really good music. Unfortunately, it is often misused in the series - a common occurrence in anime. The problem with anime composition in the style of Kanno is that they&rsquo;re more pieces of music in their own right than they are score music. So, at times, the choice of music for a scene is jarring and some tracks are too oft repeated. I have no real qualms with the music, I was merely expecting a little more; if I hadn&rsquo;t known Kanno was behind it I would have been far less sceptical.\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black presents the kind of story that only anime would have the audacity to envision. The strangeness of the story almost leads me to suggest that it exemplifies the desperation of anime writers - where originality can only be found in the most farfetched and bizarre. So, rather than revolving around a core sci-fi concept or idea, the story is merely a construct of frivolous machinations that have no thematic connection to the real world whatsoever, and which are left mostly unexplained. I find it hard to justify my reservations toward the premise of the series, but it probably amounts to the fact that it is completely ridiculous AND it takes itself seriously. Such a wedding of the ridiculous and the serious should only be undertaken at the hands of those with extreme stylistic prowess like Shinichiro&rsquo;s Samurai Champloo or Cowboy Bebop - it really didn&rsquo;t work out in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n As part of the modern tradition of sci-fi anime, Darker then Black has hit up the viewer with a whole arsenal of strange vocabulary to learn, like &ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s Gate, Contractor, BK201&rdquo;, in what appears to be an attempt to alienate the audience while giving the impression everything makes sense if you&rsquo;ve done your homework. The anime industry seems to have come to the irreverent conclusion that the more convoluted and inaccessible a storyline is, the deeper and more worthwhile it is. I&rsquo;m not sure whether to blame Hideaki Anno for this, but Darker than Black is a certainly a culprit, leaving unanswered questions and logic gaps in its determination to condense a plot worthy (or not) of a fantasy epic into its 25 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nMuch of my frustration stems from the fact that the core backbone of the plot isn&rsquo;t divulged until far too late in the show, so that, for the majority of the series, you have an idea of what&rsquo;s going on but almost no idea WHY, or why it should matter in terms of the overall plot. I&rsquo;ve seen this in numerous anime before and I don&rsquo;t like it. It comes off as being little more than a gimmick to impress the viewer towards the end of the series by suddenly whipping out the answers to its seemingly incomprehensible premise. I prefer a traditional, linear approach to storytelling, as knowing the context of the story always adds gravity and import to the character&rsquo;s decisions and motives.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation is, nonetheless, a strength of the show, a strength that is not flaunted nearly enough. In this arc-based show, it is important that a sense of affinity or empathy with a character is swiftly established, and DTB achieves this nicely. Many of its earlier episodes are saved from their redundancy by the profoundness of the minor character&rsquo; plights. Hei, the protagonist, is certainly quite lacking; he spends so much time being mysterious that it&rsquo;s very hard to really care about him until the quick burst of character development he receives towards the end of the show. Luckily, the cast is rather large, and there are plenty of characters to become attached to. I grew particularly fond of Huang&rsquo;s anti-social rhetoric, and Mao&rsquo;s sceptical imparts. Together with Hei and the detached Yin their portrayal as a defunct family, who ultimately came through for each other, warmed my heart.\\n\\n\r\nIn a fleeting grab for redemption, the series manages to pull out a surprisingly gripping and sincere finale, which very nicely brings together the many emotional themes and dramatic overtones that have been brewing. The result is a climax that will tug at the heart of cry-baby and cynic alike with a powerfully bittersweet wrap-up, even if it won&rsquo;t divulge answers to some of the series&rsquo; greater mysteries. In fact, it was probably the most satisfying conclusion I&rsquo;ve seen all year. But a delectable aftertaste cannot wholly excuse the lack of direction of the bulk of its earlier episodes - which almost seemed like padding before this final arc. This could almost have been a 6-part OVA series. When all&rsquo;s said and done, the show was enjoyable enough through its entire run for me to recommend, but one should be prepared to be frequently underwhelmed and almost always unapprised. \\n",

            "content": "\u2018\u2019Darker Than Black\u2019\u2019 immerses the viewer in a fascinating world rife with cool superpowers, intrigue and mystery carried by beautiful animation and an evoking soundtrack by none other than Yoko Kanno. \r\nWell, that was the idea\u2026\u2026\r\nThe actual series definitely boasts impressive animation and cool superpowers, but that which the series tries to pass of as a story full of intriguing mysteries is nothing more than a total mess full of inconsistencies and plot contrivances. Worse yet, it wants to be seen as a dark and serious story but nevertheless shoehorns in some anime-trappings to try and hook a bigger audience. \r\nSaid story goes as follows:10 years ago a mysterious gate (creatively titled \u2018\u2019Hell\u2019s Gate\u2019\u2019) appeared in the middle of Tokyo which caused the stars to disappear and prompted changes in some people. People affected could be split up into 2 types: first there\u2019s  Contractors, who get a badass power (e.g. gravity-manipulation or teleportation) at the cost of an arbitrary payment (e.g. eating eggs or kissing someone) and then there\u2019s Dolls, (seemingly) emotionless people who can track people through an arbitrary medium, like water or mirrors. Knowledge of these things is kept under wraps by a secret international body called \u2018The Syndicate\u2019. They hunt down Contractors and offer them an ultimatum: submit or be killed. Normal people who come in contact with Contractors have their memories erased.\\n\\n\r\nIt is in this backdrop that we follow a team of Syndicate agents consisting of a bland Batman-knockoff, a Rei Ayanami-clone, a grumpy old fat guy and Salem from \u2018Sabrina The Teenage Witch\u2019. A large part of the series consists of 2-episode story arcs detailing a random mission carried out by said team. Well that\u2019s actually a bit misleading since it\u2019s Batman who ends up doing all the work while Rei (being a Doll) occasionally does some surveillance. Fatso and Salem are mostly there to be grumpy and snarky, respectively.\\n\\n\r\nOf course a team of secret agents needs to have a couple of real ones hunting them down for some tension. Problem is that the police officers in this series are idiots who couldn\u2019t catch a cold if they ran outside naked while it was snowing, so that\u2019s it for tension. Their only purpose in the narrative is that one of them often ends up listening to infodumps courtesy of that episode\u2019s exposition vessel. \\n\\n\r\nThe story-arcs all end up having a pretty similar pattern. Syndicate team tackles a case related to either a Contractor or a Doll,the police officers have a storyline that ties into the secret mission, Syndicate team gets to pull of secret agent stuff that often involves fighting dudes while the officers get to listen to exposition and remain ignorant of all the mysterious things that keep happening around them. Batman meets X-files, basically. The series makes an attempt to shake things up towards the end by introducing an overarching storyline, but it\u2019s so convoluted and filled with retcons and Deus Ex Machina that it ends up causing more damage than it fixes. \\n\\n\r\nAll of this is made worse by a number of plot elements and trappings that are inconsistent either within the show\u2019s universe or in a narrative sense. Some examples:\\n\r\n-\tA big deal is made about how a Contractor has a power that has to be paid for by doing something. 1 power, 1 payment. Except that there\u2019s Contractors whose powers can change in arbitrary ways, and there\u2019s Contractors who don\u2019t have to perform a payment. Worse yet, some payments aren\u2019t really payments at all. There\u2019s one Contractor whose payment is basically something that comes naturally with using his ability, and some payments are actually rather beneficial. \\n\r\n-\tA big deal is made about how Dolls have no emotions. Except that they do, they just appear emotionless. Why? It\u2019s never explored, in spite of the fact that it\u2019s a crucial part of one character\u2019s personality seeing as she\u2019s a doll. Guess they were fine with having a Rei Ayanami clone to attract otaku.\\n\r\n-\tThe series wants to be viewed as a gritty and serious \u2018noir\u2019 type story only to introduce a pair of supporting characters who outright parody these concepts. This creates a jarring tonal dissonance. Playing a genre straight can work. Parodying a genre can also work. Not both. The introduction of a blatant comic relief character in a serious story basically destroys the tone the makers were trying to establish. It\u2019s akin to putting Frank Drebin smack-dab in the middle of The Wire. \\n\\n\r\nI could talk about how some characters act completely out-of-character just so they can get killed or how a certain character\u2019s power goes from a basic elemental attack to being able manipulate reality but I\u2019ll stop here for brevity\u2019s sake.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty clear at this point that the makers didn\u2019t think this series\u2019 narrative and concepts through. The whole series is deliberately ambiguous in regards to its overall plot and universe which isn\u2019t a bad thing in and of itself. The problem is that the narrative is a mess. One could say that it doesn't matter seeing as the story is character-driven (ie. he J.J. Abrams Defense) but that's a rather weak defense as far as I'm concerned. Even a basic plot has to be somewhat coherent.\\n\\n\r\nDarker Than Black could\u2019ve been great. It had an intriguing setting, stellar animation, great sound direction (the actual soundtrack is forgettable despite being from Yoko Kano) and a few cool action scenes involving rather creative use of superpowers. But the storytelling is deplorable, the characters fail to be interesting or even entertaining and for every decent fight there\u2019s 2 fights that are essentially 3-second massacres that are there to impress you with the main character\u2019s \u2018\u2019awesomeness\u2019\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nJust goes to show: you can have all the best ingredients but you still need to have some cooking skills to make them into a tasty dish.\\n",

            "content": "\"Now I've lost it; I know I can kill. The truth is just beyond the gate...!!\"\r\nSTORY - For a series that essentially never explains anything, I'm actually extremely surprised I ended up liking it as much as I do. I'm not a fan of overt exposition, but I'm not a fan of dancing around all the obvious questions either, and Darker than BLACK does almost exclusively the latter. The majority of the series is episodic and comprised of two-episode mini-arcs; these episodes serve to explore the world and the characters, but any insight gained is limited and generally lead to more questions than answers. Andyet, the world presented is a very intriguing and unique; the concept of a select few with special abilities is everywhere, sure, but I'm totally in love with the idea of having to consistently pay a price for it. The series starts off a little slow, but none of the episodes are outright boring, and it's fun cataloging all of the data you receive and formulating various hypotheses about what had happened and why things are they way they are. It's the mystery that keeps you going.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it's immensely frustrating trying to understand anything sometimes, including the overarching plot and the motivation of any of the characters, which are, you know, kind of important, but even though I say that nothing's ever explained, there's definitely enough there for you to work off of. The episode-to-episode story is easy enough to get at a basic level, and as more and more elements present and repeat themselves, it becomes more and more interesting. It's open-ended in many ways, and there's plenty of room for interpretation. For that reason, it probably isn't for everyone; if you're looking for concrete answers and explanations, you'll almost certainly be disappointed. Most characters in the series don't even know what's going on, so there isn't anyone to spell it out for you.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - It really doesn't seem like it at first, but Hei is quite the fascinating character. It never seems quite clear whether Li is the disguise and Hei is the real personality or if it's the other way around. Both seem so sincere in their actions and words. The duality of his character seems contradictory because he comes off like he should be very straightforward, especially considering that &quot;contractors are logical creatures.&quot; The details of his past remain hazy and vague for a majority of the series, though it becomes obvious rather quickly what he still feels towards whatever had transpired. That in itself isn't all that interesting or original, but it's a good starting point for all the contradictions and a huge catalyst for the grand plot. I wouldn't say that Hei actually changes much throughout the course of the series, which is usually what I measure the merit of characters by, but he does learn a lot about himself, and those revelations seem to work just as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters aren't nearly as interesting, but together, they make a great supporting cast. Mao and Huang are both fun in their own way, though I do wish they had explored the former's past more. Too much about Yin was left unexplained for me to really take to her, but it didn't bug me all that much either. The detective and his assistant were pretty standard comic relief, but standard doesn't mean bad. Kirihara was also a pretty generic cop-type character, but she worked her role very well and her interaction with Li made for an interesting angle. (Or maybe I'm just a sucker for the secret identity drama thing.) The vast bureaucracy that stood over the plot was confusing to keep up with at times, but after a while, I found that it didn't really matter what the details were -- it's just bureaucracy. And it works out all right. \\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - Most of the things that BONES animates tend to impress me, and Darker than BLACK is no exception. Everything is smooth, beautiful, and entertaining to watch; the action scenes were fluid and well done, and most of the character designs were slick and distinctive. It's worth noting also that one of the sponsors was obviously a car company (I don't know which though because I don't know anything about cars) -- all of the vehicles in the series are explicitly detailed, with many utilizing 3d animation. There's also a pretty epic driving scene in the second opening's animation sequence. For the most part, this works out well, but there's that occasional 3d car that looks a bit out of place. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the sponsors is also the notorious Pizza Hut! In contrast to Code Geass's overt product placement though, DtB is much more subtle in its ways. The logo will appear on a few buildings and storefronts, but as much as Hei does gorge himself every other episode or so, he never actually goes out for pizza. I think this fact helps keep the overall mood of the series relatively serious; there are humorous bits, certainly, but it doesn't come off as nearly as crack-filled as the aforementioned. (I guess that's the difference between BONES and Sunrise.)\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - My little blurb at the beginning of this review is from the first opening theme. Once again, I really appreciate songs that relate directly to the series and contain lyrics specifically referencing it; I've always respected Takanori Nishikawa for this. Unfortunately, I find that his music under abingdon boys school is sub par compared to his music under T.M. Revolution. &quot;Howling&quot; has an interesting beginning, but the rhythm and melody feel jumbled up until the end/chorus. Being a Rie fu fan, I'd heard &quot;Tsuki Akari&quot; long before seeing the series, but while it's a pretty song, I didn't really feel as if it fit. It was almost jarring to hear it after every episode. The second opening, &quot;Kakusei Heroism ~The Hero Without A Name~&quot; by An Cafe is better in that it's more energetic and not as forced feeling; the second ending, &quot;Dreams&quot; by HIGH and MIGHTY COLOR is similar to the first in tone and mood, but something about it fits better -- I think it was just that Rie's voice itself didn't seem to fit the series, rather than anything about the music.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself mostly average, though there are a number of standout tracks -- particularly the intense tracks for high-action scenes and the horror/suspense movie-like tracks for the creepy and contemplative scenes. Still, I was surprised to find that Yoko Kanno was the composer because I don't feel as if Darker than BLACK's soundtrack is of the same caliber as the stuff Kanno is generally known for. It's not terrible by any means, but it certainly feels more subdued.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - Most of the cast is pretty average -- they're effective in their portrayals, but not particularly amazing. I did like Hidenobu Kiuchi as Hei a lot though; the differences between Hei and Li were really well done and it was great at highlighting the conflicts within his personality. I was also fond of Kirihara's voice, though it was pretty much the typecast for a strong-willed and morally infallible woman. The first two episodes are available dubbed and streaming from FUNimation's video site. Those two episodes didn't really leave that much of an impression on me, but I didn't think it was too bad?\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - To be honest, the first five episodes didn't do much for me. At six, it started to get more interesting because that was when Hei's past first started affect his present, and that was when the gate started to play a bigger role. After six, I never had a problem staying engaged, and the two-episode mini-arcs really helped keep my thoughts organized. As the overarching plot comes to reveal itself and the series climaxes near the end, you kind of forget that the episodes were ever structured that way because everything comes together so neatly. It's very smooth storytelling. And I liked the ending a lot too; it doesn't really explain much, and I'm still not completely sure what happened, but I like what I could understand and interpret. The concepts were good. It leaves me with a lot of questions, and I'd really like a sequel, but it's not the end of the world if there never is one. Few series can pull off that kind of open-endedness, but Darker than BLACK does.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Title: Darker than BLACK\r\nManga, Anime: Darker than BLACKdoes have an manga adaptation (who the author/artist is, I don't know, cause the information just isn't there).  It began running in Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Asuka magazine, and is currently up to four volumes.  It has yet to be licensed Stateside.\r\nDarker than BLACK is a twenty-five episode series done by Studio Bones (famous for their work on Fullmetal Alchemist and Ouran High School Host Club), and directed by Tensai Okamura (famous for his work on Wolf's Rain).  It ran from April 5th to September 28th, 2007 on Japanese TV, and has been licensed Stateside byFunimation and is due to be released at some point this year.\\n\\n\r\nStory: About ten years ago, this random thing called Hell's Gate appeared in the middle of Tokyo, and basically caused the normal destruction of the city and the disappearance of the night sky.  At the same time, people called Contractors started getting paranormal powers (think like the mutants from X-Men), and in exchange favor rationality over a human conscience.  The Contractors are kept a secret from the general populace and are used by the government and private groups as spies, assassins, etc.  The focus is on Hei, one of the most powerful Contractors, his blind Doll Yin, their handler Huang, and Mao, their wireless information Contractor talking cat.\\n\\n\r\nI admit, the premise drew me in; it sounds like X-Men, but with people actually trying to use them to their own advantage instead of annhiliate them (well, I take that back; you'll see what I mean later on in the series).  But there's a whole boatload of problems with this series.\\n\\n\r\nYou might be wondering, What exactly IS Hell's Gate?  What are Dolls?  How does a person become a Contractor?  How can a Contractor be a wireless information talking cat?\\n\\n\r\nExcept for that last question, don't expect any answers.  Darker than Black throws a whole shitload of information at you in the first few episodes, and then continues that pattern, but pulls a Rozen Maiden and really doesn't bother to explain exactly what the hell's going on, or anything that could actually help you make sense of what's going on here.  It's confusing and irritating; there was so much they could've gone into that would've made things clearer and would've helped the series a LOT.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters to keep track of.  This wouldn't be such a bad thing, except for that the character development comes a bit too late in the story for most core characters.  In fact, aside from the core characters I mentioned above and a passing interest in the Contractors and government agents involved in the cases, you don't really give a damn about who most of the two-episode arcs center around, which really doesn't help the series.  There were only two full arcs that I actually liked, along with the second half of two other arcs, and two of the three individual episodes at the end.  So, that's a total of... eight out of twenty five episodes that I actually liked.  That's a pretty shitty percentage.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big problem with the series is the placement of the two-episode arcs.  But more on that in Length.  \\n\\n\r\nYou're going to notice a lot of product placements, only because it's done in a clumsy and annoying way,  which is utterly unamusing.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, towards the end, Hei is revealed to have a power that, in its use and origin, is utterly Gary-Stu-ish and lacks a lot of coherent explanation, simply to try and bring an end to the story, which just pisses me off even more. \\n\\n\r\nThere is going to be an OVA due to be released later this year.  However, it's one episode, and based on who it centers around, it's not going to add shit to or conclude the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences were nice, yes.  And I liked the core characters.  However, the fact that nothing was really explained, the fact that most of the two-episode arcs' central characters weren't that likeable, and that character development comes at the wrong point (more on this under episode placement in Length) overwhelmed all the former.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: There's a lot of blood, and a bit of nudity at some points (anything that you'd really WANT to see is creatively censored).\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art is pretty well-done, here.  The character designs and backgrounds are well-done and gorgeous.  The cityscape is absolutely beautiful, especially at night.  The CG stands out a bit, but it isn't used enough that it gets on your nerves.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Yoko Kanno did the music for this series.  It's got a jazz bent to it, like what we heard in Cowboy Bebop, with a few sentimental pianos and string numbers thrown in.  It's good stuff, but it's not quite as good as some of her other stuff that I've heard.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two OPs and EDs, one for each half of the series.  The OPs are all harder rock numbers, though I like the first one slightly better than the second one, and the first ED is the typical J-Pop female ballad, which wasn't half bad, and the second ED is a power ballad, which I didn't like all that much.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few insert songs thrown in, and they aren't half bad.  Can't remember them enough to tell you how well they fit, though.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: No talent that I recognize from other shows, but everyone did a pretty good job.\\n\\n\r\nLength: There are some problems here, mainly with arc placement.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the arcs that contain character development are tossed in towards the end, which is a bit too late for it to come in, and most of the pointless shit is tossed in at the beginning.  For the most part, the arcs are standalones, which means that they could be easily be rearranged to make the series a bit more interesting. They SHOULD have done this, as it might have made the whole thing a bit more bearable.  Plus, certain plot elements are picked up in one arc, dropped for a few arcs, and then come up again towards the end, which just makes things even more irritating; it would have worked far better if the arcs with those elements were placed closer together.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, twenty-five episodes is just right.  Any more, and I probably would've dropped it, any shorter, and it would be even more incomprehensible and shitty than it already is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A series with pretty good animation and music, and an interesting premise and characters that utterly fails to explain ANYTHING, arcs that center around characters you don't give a shit about, has shitty episode placement, and, on top of it all, gives the otherwise likable main character a Gary-Stu power towards the end.  Trainwreck, please.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 8/10\\n\r\nLength: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 38/50; 76% (C)",

            "content": "What do you get when you combine X-men and Cowboy Bebop? This.\r\nDarker Than Black tackles the manifestation of paranormal abilities to humans and while it is not masterfully presented, I have learn to enjoy it.\r\nTen years passed after the incident that gave birth to Contractors, people who manifested paranormal abilities. Nowadays agency's hires Contractors for their own use, seldom even use them as they see fit; giving in to darker emotions and abusing that power. But in exchange from gaining this ability, they must always fulfill their renumeration. Hei is a powerful contractor hiding under the alias of Lee, masquerading as a Chinese transfer studentwhen not undercover, who has the ability to generate electricity and for some reason he doesnt have a renumeration. Under an unknown government, Hei along with Yin, a spirit medium who is incapable of emotions otherwise known as Dolls, and Mao a contractor whose body is stuck on a cat, together they form a team working assassination and the likes.\\n\\n\r\nThe show seems to be fairly deliberately paced, without being too frantic.\\n\r\nEach arc consists of two episodes. And each one introduces a new well written story, which sometimes can be frustrating since it was better off being a long arc rather being episodic.Dont worry, the characters are likable, in fact I very much like every character. Problem is, they're lifespan. Knowing that its only episodic, you can expect that they'll kick the bucket before you get to know them. But at least the arc does just gradually advances the story a little and it is impressive how they were able to compressed such immersing stories in only two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not an action-oriented anime. It focuses more on the struggle of each Contractor goes through. Sure it has some decent action every now and then but most of them ends with disappointment. Hei's power is nothing more than a taser, which makes it hard to believe that he is actually one of the most powerful Contractor. Even so, the story makes up for it, well more often than not.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters acting are distinctive and good enough all around. We all know how interesting people with psychedelic powers clashing can be. But Hei, in particular wasnt the highlight of the show. Yeah, he does have an interesting past, that generally forms half of the premise of this show. But clearly he is your average wanna-be angst badass protagonist, even though he does prove to be a promising character. Furthermore, there were two other unlikable characters, the detective and his otaku sidekick. They were the comic relief of the show, and quite frankly I felit it was unnecessary. Their arc was pointless and dull. Every second of their screen time, is a second wasted. They were better off giving as a better background of any of Hei's team.\\n\\n\r\nDTB is designed in such a way that the anime appears dynamic. It has detailed visuals and the animation is extremely fluid. The designs of each characters are not elaborate enough to be different but it does have its own physique.  The sound was fairly average and OST was nothing special to be notable. \\n\\n\r\nThis easily couldve been the anime version of the critically acclaimed american tv hit series, Heroes. But its deficiency of substance, plot advancement and in depth characters had it put down.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Hei does with his power and the impact he'll have on others is the raison d'etre of the show; the moody noir tone and offbeat writing are the reasons to tune in.",

            "content": "--- Warning: Contains spoilers ---\r\nStories of people with superhuman abilities have been around practically since the dawn of time. Ever since DBZ set the bar for \u201cpower levels\u201d consisting of blowing up planets however, more and more modern series have teetered on the edge of colossal scales at some point or another. Then you have Darker than Black, which can stand out among a handful of those with more reasonable (or rather comprehensible) scales in the post DBZ era. \r\nDarker than Black starts out by introducing these things known as contractors, people with special abilities like many series out there, who must pay a \u201cprice\u201dfor using their power ranging from things like writing poetry to breaking a few fingers. Aside from contractors we have dolls, which are basically emotionless mediums with no real personality, who send out things known as \u201cobserver spirits\u201d that work like mobile security cameras.\\n\\n\r\nWe quickly meet our main character Hei, a contractor with electric abilities who seemingly has no price unlike the other contractors out there. Working with a doll named Yin, a talking cat named Mao, and a man named Huang who seems like your typical 1930s mafia average joe, the group takes on missions from an organization simply referred to as \u201cThe Syndicate\u201d. This organization is apparently vast in scope, as it easily networks Hei into a variety of odd jobs necessary to gather intelligence and work his missions, even in the midst of organizations with top notch security. \\n\\n\r\nFor the first half of the series, we actually don\u2019t learn much about this group, but rather we uncover a variety of characters, their motives, and their back stories as Hei goes on various missions. Although these are well done and quite gruesome visually at times, none of these really seem to be tied together or have importance beyond just another day at the office, making the series fairly episodic in the beginning for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nThe arcs in Darker than Black generally tend to consist of two parts, mostly pertaining to \u201cHell\u2019s Gate\u201d, a wall around a supernatural zone that appeared some ten years ago in Tokyo as the stars in the night sky were replaced with those representing the lives of contractors. Unless you like unstable realities that laugh in the face of physics and induce mass hysteria, this probably isn\u2019t the type of area you would like to stroll through on a Sunday afternoon. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to see from the beginning, that there is a feeling akin to that of a mafia series. Everything from the way Huang obtains information to Hei\u2019s execution of missions to the way the group explains their relationship with each other fits the bill for a futuristic mafia. As such, they keep their profile as low as they can manage while avoiding failures that may make them live out their usefulness to The Syndicate. Of course, this means you will also get your fair share of enjoyable action as the group carries out The Syndicate\u2019s dirty work. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one of Darker than Black\u2019s most refreshing attributes though is the protagonist Hei. While not particularly rare, Hei is strong but not overpowered. Many modern series have protagonists that are simply too strong in comparison to the antagonists, leaving for boring lackluster fights as they easily beat their opponent. Hei is realistic on the other hand, and many times throughout the series the help of an ally saves him instead of his own strength. For those of you who prefer the ridiculously strong heroes, you might see this as a weakness on his part, but I quite enjoyed giving importance to what has become the oft forgotten role of \u201cright hand man\u201d in today\u2019s lineup of do it yourself heroes.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most protagonists though, Hei is rather silent. When he talks, it\u2019s usually only a brief response to another character consisting of maybe a few lines. Compared to other protagonists out there that are always shooting their mouths off and the like, it\u2019s nice to see one speak more through actions than words for once. Sometimes though, this does leave Hei taking a backseat for supporting characters as they become the central focus. In hindsight this is primarily seen in the beginning arcs, but this may end up making it difficult for some people to form a strong enough attachment to the series to see it out to the end when there is more focus and clarity on our main character. \\n\\n\r\nDespite his rather limited dialogue, Hei still clearly develops as a character. Initially seeming nothing more than the stoic murderer contractors are pegged for completed by his feared moniker \u201cThe Black Reaper\u201d, we see that this is only to maintain appearances for his job. It\u2019s not really until the second half of the series that we get to see this other side of Hei, notably when Yin becomes a target for their enemies. When The Syndicate deems Yin possibly harmful to their interests, they order Hei\u2019s group to kill her, to which he defies the order and saves her instead. More difficult orders come down from above as time goes on, and Hei becomes increasingly defiant as he comes to his own realizations of the path he wants to pursue. \\n\\n\r\nThis arc also introduces the growing relationship between Hei and Yin, and despite that both are about as conversational as a rock, they do gradually grow fonder of each over time in their limited communications. Their relationship reminded me much of Roger and Dorothy from Big O, though definitely more realistic considering Yin is actually human unlike Dorothy. It is important to note they don\u2019t always clearly communicate through language, as Yin simply sending out an observer spirit into the gate to check on Hei during one arc clearly meant a lot to him, and it is later noted that this is actually quite painful for a doll to do. Even by the end however, this relationship is still really only a stern fondness. Some audiences may be left unsatisfied that more development wasn\u2019t given here while others may feel that there wasn\u2019t enough directness in their relationship to make for a convincing enough development.\\n\\n\r\nAround the same time as Yin\u2019s arc, the main and only real plot of Darker than Black begins to emerge with the appearance of a character named Amber. Amber is a contractor codenamed \u201cFebruary\u201d, who apparently betrayed Hei as a member of his group, which also happened to include his sister Pai, in a South American War over a similar zone to Hell\u2019s Gate named \u201cHeaven\u2019s Gate\u201d. Spearheading a group of contractors by the name of Evening Primrose, Amber begins bombing the town and making a nightmare of Hei\u2019s life like a bad ex-girlfriend when she also kidnaps Yin. Don\u2019t forget she leaves behind the courtesy \u201cFU\u201d letter written in that girly handwriting complete with the little hearts and all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story here actually bridges a lot of elements from the beginning arcs together, in a way that makes you realize that while it had the kick back feeling of an episodic series initially, they were conveniently busy weaving the main plot underneath many of these stories unbeknownst to the audience. The realization at the end in how these stories connect to one another is quite a nice touch, but not to the level of being spectacular at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end, Amber eventually exposes the truth of the Syndicate and the nature of contractors to Hei, and it is then we really see him as the ideal hero.  Hei struggles with the hard moral choices and his limitations as an individual that are in ways reminiscent of heroes like Batman. His final decision on how to resolve the ending conflict speaks strongly towards justice, as he makes the world his enemy to do what he feels is right despite concerns from Amber. \\n\\n\r\nAbandoning everything he had previously known except Yin, Hei moves forward with his choice to try and get humans and contractors to coexist. Previously having been kicked from the Syndicate, the ending is left rather open with the implication he will begin a whole new life as the Syndicate hunts him down to no end. In many senses, Hei\u2019s journey is only beginning and this series is a prequel to setting that event in motion. While many people prefer their definitive endings, I felt it was rather fitting for the series to leave the ending open instead of attempting an abrupt halt to the nice developments the series brought forth just to manage a definitive end.\\n\\n\r\nTop the series off with a fitting OST and fluid combat scenes, and Darker than Black becomes a very enjoyable action series definitely worth the watch. The characters were all explained nicely by the end with their developments, even a majority of the supporting cast. Overall this series is best summed up as a \u201cChinese Electric Batman\u201d, which as it sounds, is just plain awesome. \\n",

            "content": "======\r\nShadows on a Black Road\r\n======\r\nAt the horizon of a bleak world stands an ominous wall, \u2018Hell\u2019s Gate\u2019, it\u2019s steel and cement arms spreading across the Tokyo skyline. The city itself is filled with curious characters borne with the Gate, Contractors and Dolls. Contractors are those that have gained supernatural abilities for a price, a penance they must pay for using their skills. Some have to overturn the shoes of their victims, smoke cigarettes or even drink the blood of young children. Dolls on the other hand are soulless mediums, who use various surfaces to track the ongoing of the city. Presented is a dark worldpainted in shadows and ambiguity, a backdrop against which Darker than Black[DtB] succeeds, a few shades short of greatness. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is vague: ten years ago, Hell\u2019s Gate emerged along with Contractors and Dolls, humans granted paranormal abilities. The smoke doesn\u2019t really clear up much as series progresses, failing to provide answers to how or why the Gate was created in the first place. Instead, Darker than Black drags you through a tale rife with political head butting and philosophical dilemmas while attempting to pluck a few heartstrings along the way.  Sometimes it feels the plot is trying to do too much, pushing character development while layering bureaucratic maneuverings atop of a monologue about the nature of the human soul. The tale is ambitious, but some of these elements just fall short. There\u2019s also the little issue of leaps of faith across little plot holes. You won\u2019t enjoy Darker Than Black very much if you don\u2019t buy into the logic. Some shows abuse this, such as Code Geass R2, but DtB never exploits its own narrative to that extent.\\n\\n\r\nThe climax serves as a stage focusing on the main character\u2019s personal journey instead of the large conflict that had nurtured in the final few installments. The effect was underwhelming, both could have been featured and the latter did not have to be shoved to the final few minutes to be resolved. The ending didn\u2019t tie together all the loose ends but I expect the sequel to fulfill the unrequited promises of the first. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were exceptional in Darker than Black. Hei, a polarized hero, wears an icy mask on his missions, while off duty he\u2019s reserved, clumsy and for a lack of a better word, \u2018cute\u2019. He\u2019s supported by the silent and morose Yin, and the level-headed Huang. The cast is given some vibrancy by Mao, the cautious if somewhat paranoid talking cat. The leads are likable but their development is allocated to specific arcs, their growth stunted outside these small windows. Hei can be seen as an exception, his past penciled in throughout. From a beer chugging secret agent, a cop with a stoic sense of justice to a sock-sniffing sociopath, the supporting cast is spectacular, filled with interesting figures. Kurosawa Gai brings relief to the tense, often brooding, atmosphere, with his perky pink-haired partner Kiko. Close to the middle of the series we see an erosion of Hei\u2019s stony visage, seeing it completely shatter in the last few moments. The revelations make Hei endearing but somewhat forgettable. We\u2019ve seen this type of hero, a cut and paste history pulled from many popular stories. \\n\\n\r\n======\\n\r\nProduction \\n\r\n======\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Darker than Black is exceptional, the Bones name branded onto every frame. A dark palette is favored to fill in the vacant allies, while vibrancy bubbles in Shinjuku\u2019s flashing lights. The style is outlined in dark strokes, as the action unfolds before your eyes. The scuffles between the Contractors highlight the fluidity of the animation, powers vibrating with force, sizzling with electricity or rippling with strength. Hei invokes the spirit of Spider-man as he zips around and about buildings with his grappling hooks for an impressive effect. A slight amount of CGI is used to animate cars, Bones opting for a more cell-shaded look to let them drive about seamlessly in the world.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs work well, each unique enough to give a distinct personality. Hei\u2019s pupils are not drawn in, creating an eerie effect, making him seem almost soulless. Facial animations are spot on, most impressively seen in Yin, her eyes betraying small fragments of feeling that she had supposedly forgotten. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is decent, not up to par of the visuals. The supporting cast surprisingly delivers excellent performances, their short roles reprised excellently. It\u2019s the main cast I felt was a bit weaker, feeling a bit forced. Huang is best when asked to treat his comrades like shit, his compassion coming off as fake. The soundtrack is varied; composed of more traditional tracks featuring bellowing pianos and whining violins, to more electro-pop influenced tracks like the opening. They interweaved the two styles well enough, rendering a pleasant soundscape fitting of Tokyo\u2019s dreary future. \\n\\n\r\n======\\n\r\nWatchability and Enjoyment\\n\r\n======\\n\\n\r\nAt moments I had \u2018WTF\u2019 feelings shock my system. I didn\u2019t know exactly what was going on why certain plot points were unfolding the way they were. The story led me one way, then the plot would stretch itself thin to move in another direction. It\u2019s a bit disorienting, but the complex forces at work in the show eventually boil down to a simple \u2018us versus them\u2019 scenario with Hei at the center of it all. The intricacy might be a turn off to some viewers, but I appreciated that the show saw the viewer as an intellect and did not spoon-feed the entire story to me. \\n\\n\r\n======\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts\\n\r\n======\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black is a welcome in a sea of mediocrity. It attempts to touch the horizon, to realize its own epic ambitions. There are a lot of loose strings, holes in the story that have to be reconciled in the second season for this program to reach hallowed annals of Anime prominence. The twenty-five installments created are excellent, the potential is there, but Darker than Black is an incomplete work. \\n",

            "content": "Darker than Black is a very enjoyable show for most people.  The storyline is extremely unique, with characters that show a level of depth not often seen.  I never found myself looking at the artwork and wondering what the animators were thinking.  Each of the characters has an appearance that looks realistic, but also unique.  Everything looks extremely high-quality to me;  Especially if you look at a dvd or .mkv version of the episodes, the level the artists drew on is very high.\r\nThe music was at times a bit hokey, but it grows on you surprisingly fast.  The creatorschose to go with a more jazz-themed soundtrack for a lot of the generic scenes, which I personally didn't enjoy.  But, the battle music is some of the best that I've heard.  DtB also features some of the most heartbreaking and beautiful songs for character themes or special moments that I've ever heard in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'm particularly impressed with the choice of Seiyuus that the producers chose.  I only recognized one actor as a 'veteran', later finding another favorite that changed her voice so completely I couldn't recognize it.  Despite this, I enjoyed the voices in the anime probably the most out of any subbed show.  Everything was matched so perfectly, I don't think they'll be able to come close with an english dub.  \\n\\n\r\nThat said, it is not for everyone.  Darker than Black is, well, dark.  If you've ever watched Death Note or a similar show, expect the same aura of gloom to hang over the episodes.  It also features some rather disturbing or violent moments, with a good deal of blood or gore.  If this makes you uncomfortable, perhaps another show would be better.  It's nothing compared to shows like Elfen Lied or Hellsing, but it's definitely there.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is one of the most well-written I've ever seen.  It starts you off knowing nothing at all, then ramps you up at a ferocious rate.  As I once commented to a friend, some shows like Naruto that are aimed at a younger crowd mention important concepts specifically, in detail, and quite often with pictures to go along with the explanation.  In DtB, you're lucky if a character mentions it in passing.  More often you're expected to pick up on things simply from how people act or talk of something.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to not discussing concepts clearly, Darker than Black often changes its mind on the rules of its own universe.  All too often it will lay down a rule, only to provide an exception to that very rule the same episode.  Because of this, the plotline feels very open and free to interpretation, even through the final moments of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of this said, I still personally count Darker than Black as my second favorite anime out of dozens that I've watched.  It provides a suspenseful, well-produced, mature alternative for those anime fans who want a little more out of their episodes.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF SEASON 1 ONLY**\r\nDarker than Black is a very cool, very unique show that is a great watch if you are looking for a nice change-of-pace anime. Darker than Black does not follow the traditional model of story-telling at all; in fact, it seems to create it's own rules. Rarely do you run into an anime that can balance its serious and depressing moments with light-hearted comedy so effectively all while being topped off with an intriguing plot, much like Fullmetal Alchemist. While it certainly has flaws (We'll get to those) and the FMA comparison is a bit generous, Darker than Blackis undoubtedly a fantastic anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nTen Years ago, an impenetrable field known as \"Hell's Gate\" appeared and psychics who wield paranormal powers at the cost of their conscience also emerged, becoming known as \"contractors\". Hei, the protagonist, is among the most powerful of these contractors, and along with his blind associate, Yin, he works for one of the many rival agencies vying to unlock the mysteries of Hell's Gate. \\n\r\nConsidering the involvement of the CIA, MI6, and other top secret agencies, Darker than Black's storyline gives off the an inevitable \"secret agent\" vibe that is pretty rarely portrayed in anime, at least not effectively. \\n\r\nThe most notable aspect about the show's plot, however, isn't the story itself, but it is the way the story is told. Rather then a continuous storyline, Darker than Black is told in a series of 2 episode long arcs that vary greatly in time, setting, and characters involved. The only real constant between these arcs is the protagonist Hei, but more on him later. This method of story telling was destined to be either hit or miss, and it was definitely a hit. It leaves the viewer intrigued as bits of information are revealed little by little in each arc until you finally have every piece to the puzzle and you can gaze upon the beautiful mosaic that has been assembled at last. The plot is really what gives the anime it's unique flair and that is the reason the show is so popular.\\n\r\nThat being said, there a few things that really irked me about the plot. For one, it didn't go in-depth enough about most of it's main plot elements. For example, what exactly is \"Hell's Gate\", specifically? How and why did it appear? Where did contractors come from? How exactly do you become a contractor? What exactly is a doll? How do you become a doll? etc. There are simply too many unanswered questions about the very foundation of the plot for this show to receive a 9 or 10 out of 10 in this category.\\n\r\nAdditionally, the ending was a bit underwhelming. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. It didn't have the level of satisfaction that I was hoping for, but some people liked it. I'm well aware of the second season, but, well... I'll write a review on that season later.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nIncredibly fluent and crisp animation. It really stands out for it's attention to detail and for how visually appealing it is. Truly beautiful artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nA pretty cool sound track with great openings, endings, and in-show tracks. The voice acting is also above average, but the sound effects were a bit weaker then I was hoping for, but after watching Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom, all gun sound effects sound bad to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters of Darker than Black, in my opinion, are what tie the entire show together. \\n\r\nHei, the protagonist, is one of the most intriguing characters in anime history. He is cool, mysterious, and his motivations aren't entirely clear until you get further into the show. The idea of a contractor who retains his emotions and has actual pure intentions grows on you as the anime goes on and Hei's sheer complexity and backstory are just the icing on the cake. Everyone who has seen this show loves Hei.\\n\r\nThere are many, many noteworthy side characters, including Yin, the chief of police, Huang, and Mau. All of these characters have arcs dedicated to them and all of them have intriguing backstories, especially Yin. As previously mentioned, the plot may be the reason the show is so popular, but I think the characters are the true driving force of Darker than Black.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThere really isn't another show out there that can be accurately compared to Darker than Black, and that is the reason that I highly recommend giving it a watch. The intricacy of the characters and story-telling technique is almost hypnotic and it makes for a very addicting experience. Check it out if you get the chance (Season 2 is very different from season 1, however, I'll write a review on that one soon).",

            "content": "What is truly Darker than Black?\r\nEnter 10 years after the \"incident\" and the emergence of \"Contractors\" and spirit mediums known as \"Dolls\". Darker than Black takes you into the mystery that is Hell's Gate. From the production studio Bones, the studio of such anime as Fullmetal Alchemist, Soul Eater, Eureka Seven, and Noragami comes one of 2007 best Anime. Darker than Black's anime adaption is one of original origin as the story line does not directly relate to the Manga. A risky move that is payed off with exceptional results as this was one fantastic series.\r\nDarker than Black focuses around Contractors, one in particular (BK201as known as The Black Reaper) and the humans who control them using their powers to gain utter dominance over one another. Humans also use spirit mediums known as \"Dolls\". Contractors are humans who gained supernatural abilities after the appearance of Heaven's Gate in South America and Hell's Gate in Japan, while Dolls are are emotionless mediums often used for their observation spirits. Contractors are referred to as Contractors as the pay a price each time they use their powers. Their \"payment\" can be just smoking a cigarette or growing years older. Dolls are know as Dolls as their emotionless nature leaves them with a doll like appearance.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the sudden disappearance of Heavens Gate 4 years ago the fear and mystery of Contractors grew and they became ever expendable to humans. Contractors and Dolls became tools for organizations all over the world such as the CIA, MI6, and the ever mysterious Syndicate to which the protagonist Hei (BK201), Yin (Spirit Medium), Mao (Contractor), and Huang (Human) belonged. Contractors existence is kept a secret from everyday citizens. Their lives show only the purpose of carrying out the dirty work of humans and doing whatever to survive. They are thought to be emotionless, tactless beings unable to think for themselves and are looked down upon by the humans they serve. Contractors and Dolls slowly evolved throughout the series becoming more independent and capable of self thought. With the emergence of Evening Primrose contractors now had a choice, fight against the Syndicate for the survival and acceptance of Contractors or remain a thoughtless tool sure to die by the hands of the ones they serve.\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black features in my opinion everything you could want in an anime. The animation stands on a level one would not expect to see in 2007. There is good character development among the main cast. The fight scenes are amazing (no matter how brief), and the soundtrack is awesome. Whether it is and OP, ED, or insert song it all fits the setting and story line. Lets not forget the top notch voice acting. True delivery of emotions and feelings or in Yin's case a lack there of was great. The episodes were shown in an episodic nature which didn't take away from or break the original plot. Not one episode could be called filler as each one progressed the original plot or the character it portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up Darker than Black was a unique, one of a kind anime and it was pleasurable to watch. It contains its fair share of comedic moments, loaded with action, highly entertaining, and leaves the viewer wanting more. Plus how could anyone forget that it gave the world Yin. I believe that Darker than Black is a must watch for anyone. It won't leave you disappointed. Over 140,000 people agree.",

            "content": "Darker Than BLACK is an anime that I had no knowledge of whatsoever before watching it. I decided to start it because the plot sounded interesting, and I am so glad I did. Most of it consists of 2 episode arcs up until the last several episodes, and they all help the plot along while also dealing with character development and sometimes a little comic relief.\r\nArt: The art in DTB is perfect for the atmosphere the story and characters are meant to be in. It gives off a neo-noir feel that also has variety within it. Character designs are varied depending on gender and age,and they are all very realistic while maintaining fantasy-like charming qualities. The settings in DTB are realistic as well, as it is supposed to take place in a modern Tokyo. You will not see an abundance of bright colors or too many dark ones, but it tends to lean a little darker. The battle scenes are done well, being intense yet not so intense that you can't tell what is going on. Much of the story is based upon the sky and stars itself, so those will come into play when regarding the art. The way shooting stars are presented whenever a Contractor is killed is done beautifully, even if it is just a shooting star. The art in DTB isn't something you would compare to other animes, simply because it just suits this anime's feeling so perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sounds and music used in DTB also fits the anime, ranging from a heartwarming song to a chase scene's music. The genre of music used on DTB fits the neo-noir aspect, as it sounds jazzy like it's supposed to. The same composer also did Cowboy Bebop's music score. The sound effects dealing with the splatting of blood to rainfall are done just as well as one would expect, so no complaints or super praising here. I must say that listening to DTB's background music outside of the anime has turned out well, and the songs are just too good not to listen to on repeat for a long while.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: All of the characters in DTB had good development and progress in my opinion, with some having their own arcs. Now you might be thinking &quot;ugh, character development arcs&quot; however they are done in such a way that they do not divert from the main plotline. It is also done in such a way that you want to know more about these characters and their past, just so you can get a better feeling of attachments towards them. Hei, the main character's intentions are never really clear until the conclusion of the series, yet you still feel like you're able to figure out what it is he is truly seeking. To be able to relate to Hei even though you're not completely sure of his true intentions shows how good of a character he is, although even after the end of the series he still might seem a little shrouded in mystery to you as it might feel a bit inconclusive.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Much of DTB deals with several parties of people having some development dealing with their past and other characters they must interact with. During these arcs, Contractors are always present. While also learning more about certain characters, you will still be learning about Contractors and the groups trying to find out more about Hell's Gate. The story in DTB might start out slow or might seem like it isn't  progressing, but if you pay attention to what is happening in the world around the characters and the characters themselves, it shouldn't be hard to see what is going on. What you'll be seeing here is conflicts between the government, Contractors, and the Syndicate that Hei and his team work for. They battle for peace, equality, and to find out each others intentions. Their biggest goal, however, is to find out the truth behind Hell's Gate and the other mysteries surrounding it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I took my time with DTB and only watched 2-3 episodes a day, to help make it last longer. Being able to see the progress of Hei's and others' goals was very enjoyable, and sometimes a relief. Finding out more about the mysteries and the true intentions and goals of certain characters gave a big sense of accomplishment. So, although the ending might seem a little off, I still felt a sense of completion and that I could see where things in the future of this world might lead to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: DTB was one of the most enjoyable animes I've had the pleasure of experiencing, and I'm glad it lasted a while. I'm not going to say it is the best ever, but for right now it is one of my favorites. The story, atmosphere, and plot development pace might not be suited for everyone or even a vast majority of people. However, if you can appreciate and understand it, you will be able to find an anime that has good characters and a story that isn't terribly full of depth but has enough for you to be able to get hooked. I can say for sure that I'll have fun rewatching this many times.",

            "content": "Darker than Black, what an adventure it has been. Darker than Black takes place in a near future world where two gates appeared, Heaven's Gate and Hell's Gate. The mysterious appearance of these gates brought with them the Contractors. Contractors are people who have entered into a contract with an unknown force and gained a unique power in return. The nature of the contract however requires them to give back each time they use their power. Payment is anything from smoking a cigarette to writing a poem. The main story is told through an omnipotent point of view with the \"camera man\" being at thescene and generally following a certain group of characters, but can focus on other characters as the protagonists for an entire arc. It is a very unique telling of the story and hard to put into words, but that isn't a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art style of Darker than Black are superb. Each character is completely unique and unlike some other shows with several similar looking characters, Darker than Black does an excellent job of giving each character an unique style and a winning personality. The fights of Darker than Black are done very well and are very fluid. Although short at times, it is after all not a shounen series, they are excellent none the less. Some fights are extended and are a real treat for the eyes. Bones, the producers, did an excellent job with the series and I am looking forward to seeing more of their work.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Darker than Black is up there with my favourites of all time. An excellent mix of various genres of music. At one point it will be a jazz track, then later it will be an orchestra piece or a rock track. Overall the music is really well done and accurately depicts the scene. At some points I found myself with the hair on the back of my neck standing up as the music heated up in preparation of a coming battle. The voice acting is top notch. Hei has two distinct voices: one serious and the other calm or even clumsy sounding. The other main characters: Kirihara, Yin, Huang, and Mao also have top notch performances. Overall the casting and voice acting are very well done.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has their own special traits and have very well written dialogue. Although it is for the most part an Action/Drama type of series, there are often Comedic undertones to help break up the suspense. When Hei is not masquerading as BK201, his codename, he is a very funny and sarcastic individual. Most every character has moments that make you want to laugh, especially Gai, the off the wall private eye, and his partner, the pink haired money hungry Kiko. All in all the characters have a very nice chemistry and it is interesting to see Hei's interactions with the people who are pursuing him. The only thing that is holding back the characters is, with the exception of Hei and Yin, there is very little back story provided for many of the main characters. This is hard to do of course though with an episodic type series.\\n\\n\r\nThe series seems episodic as the story is generally told in two episode mini-arcs, with the final arc being three episodes, it never really feels very episodic. Especially toward the end where the main plot runs into each new arc. Although there is a sense of conclusion after each arc, it never really feels like it is of an episodic nature (if that makes any sense at all). I immensely enjoyed Darker than Black and it had a very satisfying conclusion.",

            "content": "Ah, the age old question; what to do when certain people suddenly begin manifesting mysterious superpowers. Darker than BLACK responds with a classic solution found in series ranging from Witch Hunter Robin to X-Men: Form secret organizations to monitor and control these people. However, despite the similar theme, this show is anything but derivative.\r\nIn the beginning of the series, the premise of the show is somewhat vague as little is known about where the powers of the contractors come from, or how they are related to the gates. As the series progresses more information is inevitably revealed, creating good plot exposition and allowing the storyto move at a decent pace and keep each episode interesting. Where this series really shines however, is the characters.\\n\\n\r\nHei is portrayed brilliantly, having a rather comicbook superhero-like persona but adding a unique spin to it. His motives are not initially apparent, nor is his true relationship with the syndicate to which he belongs. Also, while contractors are known to be emotionless and purely rational, Hei somehow manages to retain his humanity, an anomaly which many of his acquaintances and opponents comment on. The true reason for this, as well as the origin of his powers remains hidden until the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe other members of Hei's organization are similarly well portrayed, each being represented uniquely and interestingly. Huang, Yin, and Mao each have a well written back-story that is both engaging and important to the overall plot. The other characters in the story are outstanding as well, especially the antagonists. Despite the fact that the contractors are supposed to be unemotional, each character still manages to have a unique personality which often even enhanced by this fact.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one weakness in this series, it is the ending, which is unfortunately rather inconclusive. I'm kind of hoping for a sequel, but this may be difficult for reasons that would be hard to disclose without revealing spoilers. The ending also has a &quot;suddenly everything got weird&quot; part to it that seems common in final episodes of supernatural anime, but at least it makes a lot more sense than many I've seen. If you like shows about people with supernatural powers, I think you should definitely watch this series.",

            "content": "\u2022Cool ass Chinese Batman protagonist in a Gotham-esque neo-noir setting?\r\nCheck\u2714\r\n\u2022A city overrun with nifty characters that have x-men like powers?\r\nCheck\u2714\r\n\u2022Nice mysterious lore with strange in-world concepts?\r\nCheck\u2714\r\n\u2022A clear-cut answer to ANY of these \"mysterious\" concepts and a sense of finality to our protagonist's existence?\r\nDon't hold your breath. \r\nDarker and Black felt like a show that was onto something worthwhile but ultimately never got around to proving it. The ingredients to make something great was clearly there but by the end, all we got was a show with ambitious ideas that did nothing but let it dwindle away into nothingness. Does that mean it isn't worth theinvestment? Well, yes and no. If all you wanted was a cool ass electric Batman beating the mercy of God into x-men characters, then DTB certainly delivers. However, if you wanted more than the beat-em-up action happening on the surface and actually cared about the complete package hinted at in the background, then you'll walk away empty-handed. \\n\\n\r\nLong story short, Darker and Black had the goods, just not the means necessary to deliver them.\\n\\n\r\n**THIS REVIEW WAS BROUGHT TO YOU BY PIZZA HUT**\\n\\n\r\nInstead of reciting the synopsis, I'll get straight to what the meat of the show consists of.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a series of mini-arcs with each addressing a new conflict. In each of these conflicts, the main group that contains our characters are assigned a task to fulfill by a crime syndicate, with our protagonist, Hei, being the foot soldier to carry out the missions. The syndicate, for a majority of the show, remained a faceless organization, and in the confines of the kind of show being presented, that isn't really a bad thing. They were omnipresent and ominous, guiding their pawns across the chess board, with Hei simply being another piece in the game. This syndicate was in constant conflict with other underground organizations, which lead both sides to dispatch \"contractors\" (superhumans) to do their bidding.\\n\\n\r\nThese clashes play out like a feud war being carried out in secrecy, due to the governing bodies of the city covering up the existence of \"contractors\" and \"dolls\" in fear of civil unrest. Since law enforcing authorities from the CIA to the local police are constantly trying to apprehend, gather, and suppress information about these occurrences, every episode hits you with a blitz of energy and nonstop action. That, of course, results in a narrative that's constantly on the move, which is a good thing for action junkies and those seeking out easy-to-consume entertainment. Also, while all of this is going on, we are also given clues as to how the world operates in regards to the contractors, dolls, and a phenomenon that's simply dubbed \"Hells Gate.\" While it's a gradual occurrence, after some time, these mini-arcs eventually converge to create an overarching one. Its story structure is similar to that of other shows like Ghost in the Shell: SAC and Psycho-Pass.\\n\\n\r\nSeems pretty straightforward right, so where do the problems start?\\n\\n\r\nWell, despite the consistent pace, since everything is told in a semi-episodic mini-arc format, there isn't really any true progression to talk about. Sure, we get to see the backstories of our main characters unfold and find out more about the show's lore, but as far as a sense of direction, DTB was scatterbrained. It aimlessly meandered about with no sense of purpose or clear destination, even after one seemed to present itself in the last handful of episodes. It ended up escalating the conflict instead of addressing it. Which brings us to the biggest issue plaguing the show: its inability to provide answers. \\n\\n\r\nDTB has a bad habit of telling us everything BUT what's actually important. It will go out of its way to deliver unnecessary expository dialogue to things we clearly see happening, while simultaneously using ambiguity as a crutch to avoid explaining the concepts it depends so heavily on. This, of course, results in a lot of moments where individuals would start acting out of character just so they can directly inform the audience of situations or explain how certain things work (like a contractor's given ability for example). I'm not saying a brief explanation isn't warranted but after something is established like the payment concept contractors have to make for using their powers, we don't need to get that information regurgitated every single time it happens \u2014 and trust me, it happens a lot. It feels as if the writers viewership as being too dimwitted to figure it out for themselves. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the information that they don't give us, a definitive answer to any of the anomalies that occurred in the story remained one of them. The show kept on insinuating that there're answers to come, by dropping little nuggets of information throughout the narrative but that simply never exfoliated into anything in the end. It felt like they completely abandoned the idea of trying to explain the reason for any of the \"mystery\" concepts, only to opt out by following a hollow aspect of the overall setting established in the beginning. None of the supernatural elements are ever justified or explained despite the fact \"mystery\" part of its genre:\\n\r\nWhy did the Hell's Gate appear? What purpose does it serve? How does it correlate with humans evolving into contractors? Why do the stars correlate with contractors lives? What is the end goal of the syndicate's operation? Are the contractors and dolls suppose to parallel the man vs man parable? Why is anything not making any proper sense outside of superficial techno-babble? \\n\\n\r\nFor a show that tried so much to build a mystery, it sure failed on upholding its end of the bargain. \\n\\n\r\nAnd how do you end a show that didn't bother to provide answers to anything? Well apparently, you simply reveal a poorly planned plot twist that turns the final episode into an existential fever dream that hasn't been seen since the likes of Evangelion. And since no one has the balls to say it, I will. For a show to chalk up all its supernatural elements to nothing more than made up allegorical fluff, while throwing in an improper Eva-esque conclusion, when up to that point, it was a simple rule-of-cool beat-em-up; why that's just borderline pretentious. And yes, I know, many of you are probably rolling your eyes in disgust by the mere mention of that \"p\" word, but really, in this situation, there's no other word to properly describe just how over-bloated the show got towards its climax. \\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with creators trying to be overly-ambitious but when the foundation is built on poorly realized concepts and unexplained in-world mechanics, the end result will inevitably suffer as a result. A perfectly serviceable action-romp was thrown away for the sake of ambiguity and pseudo-concepts. And if you're expecting the 2nd season to fill in the gaps, all you'll get there is a super loli, a raging alcoholic and talking squirrel, so don't hold your breath. \\n\\n\r\n**You know what goes well with this review? A nice hot box of PIZZA HUT!**\\n\\n\r\nThe stylistic direction of DTB was very western influenced. I wasn't kidding when I made the Gotham/x-men hybrid comparison. From the murky hues to character designs akin to that of DC Comics' cartoon installments, DTB's universe could easily crossover with a Justice League spin-off with very little problem. Like many other animated works, during the show's downtime, there wasn't much to credit the show for presentation-wise, but when the action sequences happen, it truly becomes blood pumping roller-coaster ride. And when placed side by side with other shows made in the same year, it truly was a cut above the rest. The only major hindrance that reared its ugly head was the occasional usage of CGI... also Pizza Hut ads, lots, and lots of Pizza Hut ads. I've counted no less than 17 ads while viewing the show (Code Geass has nothing on this). So take that for what you will.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was a mixture of new-school jazz, funk, and blues, along the lines of other western influenced anime such as Baccano! and Cowboy Bebop. This nice blend help contributed to the show's overall atmosphere, giving it character. Of course, it has its somber tracks as well but the ones that stood out were the aforementioned. The songs never outplay the corresponding scenes on screen but work in unison with them. There's a chemistry there that couples the visuals with the audio wonderfully. All the voice actors performed their roles with no noticeable hiccups, with this being one of the premier examples of an English dubbed cast trumping its Japanese counterpart. It's not going to be the \"best dub ever\" but it certainly gets the job done. \\n\\n\r\nNow, what barely got the job done, however, was the characters themselves. \\n\\n\r\nYou know you have a problem when the show's cat has more of a personality than the people in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast was crippled by the show's premise. Since contractors and dolls alike are devoid of irrational feelings and have no moral compass outside of calculated thought, it doesn't leave room for any kind of development or growth (or personality, for that matter). The most DTB can do was to flesh them out with a backstory but other than that, they remained one-note from beginning to end. Despite this flaw, one redeeming quality was that most of the adult characters were handled with some semblance of maturity. Of course, that doesn't negate the lack of characterization but it certainly helps to make them feel more grounded.. well... for the most part anyway, as they do occasionally toss in a bit of misplaced comedic moments in a similar fashion to how shows like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood attempted something similar. \\n\\n\r\nTo add more life to these emotionally stilted characters, the show resorted to victimizing them, with either the inclusion of a sad backstory or having them be discriminated against because of their abnormal abilities (similar to the way x-men approached the subject matter). It's passable drama but only to a certain extent and can be seen as forceful by seasoned viewers.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the semi-episodic structure, there's a lot of characters introduced. I'll only go over the three main ones we follow. \\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist is a man of little words and little personality as well, given his position as a \"contractor.\" in the show's canon. When remnants of his past and personal life are conjured up by others, it quickly becomes apparent that there's more to him beyond his stoic demeanor. But despite that, these brief glimpses of humanity in him are still lacking, thanks in no small part to the short emotional leash the anime forces him to wear. When in public, he masquerades as a bashful mild-mannered person, playing off the \"nice guy\" gimmick similar to other characters like Himura from Rurouni Kenshin and Vash from Trigun. It's only when he's tasked with a mission that his electric Batman persona reveals itself. His sole purpose is to be that of the iconic badass that kicks ass and takes names. And with little else expected from him, it's always fun to see him do just that. But of course, like the plot that went from a simple action-romp to a contrived metaphysical mess, the show's ending brought with it an unneeded plot twist that negated all the fun that Hei brought to the table. \\n\r\nOn a side-note, it seems like lacking emotion leaves more room for an appetite since Hei can guzzle down a crap ton of food with as much proficiency as a battle shounen protagonist. But enough about Hei, time to discuss my personal favorite from the bunch, Huang.\\n\\n\r\nHuang, to put it simply, is your hard-ass. The kind of guy you'll come across with the gravely voice and no bullshit attitude that borders on pigheadedness. He doesn't take shit from anyone. It's made quite clear that he's discriminatory towards Contractors and Dolls. This, of course, was later explained with his stand-alone backstory. Although he's simply a human and not tied to the \"no irrational emotion\" crutch of the show's premise, he too lacks any further growth. He's your archetypal mobster type and given his disdain for Contractors, you often see him butting heads with Hei. Despite that, he's the most maturely handled character in the group and perhaps the only one with actual characterization. He's the closest thing to a character with actual depth in the show; a man hardened by his line of work and unfortunate past. This was shown through his business decorum, as he approaches every situation with a veteran-like decorum. And as he stood, Huang was the backbone of this anime's success. Constantly working in the background to get shit done. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now that we've covered the show's cool mobster, time to talk about the Great Value knock-off brand of Rei Ayanami, Yin. \\n\\n\r\nYin was essentially the bootleg version of the \"Rei Ayanami\" archetype and with that said, there isn't much of a personality to speak of. She was appropriately classified as a doll (as she has the personality of one) and the only information needed to be known about her is that she's the eyes and ears of Hei, as her power allows her to see anywhere around the city where a pool of water is collected. Of course, she was eventually given a proper backstory episode dedicated towards her later on, but even that didn't do much to flesh her out as an individual and eventually became null and void after her moment in the limelight was over. But since this series is known for saying \"fuck a plot,\" even her involvement became more convoluted in later installments. But until you venture that far in, just enjoy her for her simplicity. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few other recurring characters in the show, like a private detective named Gai Kurasawa, a man who shares a striking resemblance, job, and characteristic to Kuruma Jo, from 1975's Hurricane Polymar. But seeing that no one even knows of that anime's existence, I digress.\\n\r\nAnother recurring side character worth addressing includes Misaki, who was your level-headed detective, and unlike most of the other side characters, she actually received a few episodes dedicated to fleshing her out. Not anything too compelling but enough to properly define her. She plays a bigger role by being a proxy for the viewers to see both sides of the growing conflict in the show. For all intents and purposes, she's basically a fleshed out plot-device. \\n\\n\r\nDespite a lack of any true development or proper characterization, as a collective, the cast was a lot of fun to watch. A case where the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. Just don't expect anything profound out of them. And in a way, that's the best way to describe this show, in a nutshell: fun but nothing beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black is like a smorgasbord, you simply pick whatever suits your fancy and discard anything that doesn't. As for me, I took away the cool ass fights and audiovisual treats. Your appetite as a viewer may allow for more, so depending on your taste and tolerance for certain things, this might be a buffet that you find yourself fully indulging in.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite my issues with the plot and contrive narrative threads brought up later on, I can't deny how much I enjoyed watching electric Batman kick the crap out of baddies in the dark alleyways of the city. Call it mindless violence if you will, but it was done with so much style and ease that I found myself taking in every moment of it. DTB was a bitter pill to swallow at times but when it came to the action, it delivered on a silver platter.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the years, DTB has garnered a sizable fan-base, staying relevant in many anime-centric discussion circles and to a certain extent, I can understand why. As far as rule-of-cool shows goes, DTB excels, but due to the issues I discussed, I can only recommend it to those who simply want a nice action flick. With that said, the lower you set your expectations, the greater your enjoyment of this title would be. It's not a show I'll ever advocate for but at the same time, I'll still give it the greenlight for others curious enough to want to check it out. \\n\\n\r\n**BTW you're probably tired from all that reading.. you should treat yourself to Pizza Hut......PIZZZA HUTTTT!!!**",

            "content": "==STORY==\r\nThe story is very good in my opinion, it contains many details about the history, abilities and life of the characters. It gets more and more complicated through the show. The story tells about a world, very similar to ours that had gone through a massive change. one day the starts started raining from the skies and together with them appeared a gate, Hells Gate. Some people were given special powers but not for free and they didn't really choose them. They were simply given special powers. They are called Contractors. A contractor has a special ability, as an example I can rain fire fromthe sky however it will cost me something. Each contractor has a different &quot;payment&quot; method. Some have to drink alcohol after each time they use their powers, some have to drink blood. The contractors are lacking emotions (as far as I've noticed) but aren't emotionless. Together with them appeared 2 more life forms, Dolls and Oracles. The dolls lack ANY emotions or free will, they act according to what they are told to do. They can do anything a normal human can. The oracles can... obviously predict the future. Since the &quot;Hell's Gate&quot; appeared many weird phenomenons started to appear near it. The city (Tokyo) was closed within walls and new skies appeared. \\n\\n\r\n=ART==\\n\r\nThe art is awesome, there's always a feeling of mystery and an enemy might hide anywhere. You can never tell what's going on and it doesn't randomly switch the scenes. The show is smooth and is pretty much perfect.\\n\\n\r\n==CHARACTER==\\n\r\nThe characters start with a small amount of info about them such as name and that's it. The info will grow through the story and new parts of them will reveal. The characters evolve and change quite a lot through the whole story. Some develop new sides which have never been seen even if they shouldn't.\\n\\n\r\n=ENJOYMENT==\\n\r\nI enjoy this show very much, to be honest with you I can't stop watching it. Almost watched the raws! The story isn't messed up, the art is great and you just can't stop watching. This show will leave you with a taste of more at the end of each and every episode.\\n\\n\r\n==OVERALL==\\n\r\nI enjoy this show so much and that's the main reason I'm making this review. Since some of you are probably confused I am more than glad to write this review down for you. I really hope you'll enjoy this show as much as I do.\\n\\n\r\n~regards -&gt; Tsunami! &lt;-",

            "content": "Darker than BLACK has grown rather popular on the net, gaining rave reviews, popularity by word of mouth and leaving trails across the forums and the net in general. With a show with such high acclaims it is only natural to expect a truly remarkable show. Funnily enough, it turned out to be one of the most unremarkable shows I have ever seen. \r\nSet in our time but in an alternate world where global warming isn\u2019t the planets biggest threat but supernatural beings with unique powers are \u2013 these beings dubbed the name \u201cContractors\u201d. They appeared the same time Hell\u2019s Gate did; a mysterious forcethat covers Tokyo\u2019s sky. Their powers come at a price and the wage is different for every Contractor. Rival organizations kill, back-stab, infiltrate, investigate and work together to uncover the mysteries of Hell Gate.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is Hei, one of these Contractors working as an assassin/investigator for one these organizations. Together with Yin, an emotionless doll; Mao the talking black cat and Huang, a normal middle aged guy; Hei tries to investigate the mystery that is Hell\u2019s Gate and locate his younger sister Pai whilst carrying out the orders/missions from the Syndicate. \\n\\n\r\nOh, don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get any more answers or plot revelation when watching the show. By the end of the series we\u2019re left with the SAME standstill story and the SAME questions as the beginning: What exactly is Hell\u2019s Gate? How did it get there? Why did it make people with supernatural abilities emerge? How did it alter the sky? Why doesn\u2019t Hei have a payment for his power? How did he come to work for the Syndicate? Sadly, the endless line of questions we have from episode one is left unanswered. \\n\\n\r\nWhen entering Darker than Black it can either be a hit or miss \u2013 people will either say \u201cOh, I\u2019ve seen it before\u201d and dismiss it, others will be taken in by the dark American superhero story atmosphere presented in the first two episodes. For the rest of the series it is pretty much a rinse and repeat session with the two episode mini arcs. This is what DtB does well, actually. By creating these mini arcs it doesn\u2019t danger itself into needlessly dragging the same story out and with this manages to cover quite a lot of characters as each mini arc is dedicated to one character revealing their past etc. \\n\\n\r\nBut the characters themselves were quite unremarkable. Sure, a masked contractor; a blind emotionless girl and talking cat along with other Contractors; British MI6 agents and police agents sounds interesting enough - but it really isn\u2019t. The characters do develop \u2013 as aforementioned there are mini arcs to show this, but they all lack something: REAL CHARACTER. Of course it is not a slice of life, therefore it can ignore the finer details but as they were TRYING to give the characters substance with the mini arcs it just made them fail even worse on giving an individual any spruce: they are all so dreadfully BORING. I ended up not caring about any single one of them. \\n\\n\r\nHei, on the other hand, was the exception. Forget all the other characters; this is the one who takes the entire spotlight. Probably the most entertaining one of them all \u2013 and why not!  Playing the normal innocent student by day and an apathetic assassinator by night, Hei is the master of in-character acting. What\u2019s more, with his split personality, insane skills and a mask that screams \u2018badass\u2019  he takes control of the entire show, I only wished we got to see more of that side of him.  He brought a reminiscent feeling of the character L from Death Note, notably for his crouched stance when taking on the role of the clueless student. \\n\\n\r\nHis English voice actor captured the split personality nature of Hei; from the innocent naivety to the cold-hearted killer. It really stood out from the other voice actors, who were \u2013 at best \u2013 average. However, one of the pros of watching the dub is hearing the British accents by many of the characters. Although it is overdone, at least there is that international appeal in it that the Japanese version will not have. But if you\u2019re not too keen on dubs in the first place then just opt to complete subs. You\u2019ll be missing out on the accents but one of the character\u2019s voice acting was so bad it lowered the overall quality of the sound. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of sound, one of the saving graces of the show was indefinitely the music. Though the music is most likely forgettable as there was no set soundtrack or theme songs that would be played in every episode, each unique theme that would range from jazz to classical to rock always manages to stir up excitement that would fit in perfect sync with the choreograph or scene.  Like Hollywood movies there is a varied track list, so it never becomes repetitive. The OP and ED on the other hand did not live up to the excellent sound during the show \u2013 it was good but with the other music they had already set themselves a high bar so that had left their OP/ED to become rather disappointing. One point that comes to mind about the opening sequences is the jogging camera movement in the animation. I thought this was an excellent way to portray the hectic and fragmented nature of the show, and made the OPs a joy to watch. Animation is flawless, as expected of BONES (those awesome guys who brought us Ouran, Fullmetal Alchemist and Cowboy Bebop).  \\n\\n\r\nFans of NGE, rejoice. Well fans of a \u2018certain scene\u2019 in NGE rejoice. For the show carries some resemblance to that famous mindfuck anime \u2013 with riddled monologues and the infamous \u201cCongratulations\u201d scene almost being replicated in the last episodes (yes, the show does not give us a complete ending). So, if you\u2019re not a fan of the NGE ending, then DtB probably won\u2019t be your cup of tea in terms of ending.  \\n\\n\r\nDarker than BLACK is heavily flawed. I felt like they were trying to hard; sometimes it had bad comedy and often enough it had too many loose ends. The story lacks development and the characters do not stand out. However, the series still manages to hook the audience with its dark atmosphere, the menacing Hei and the well orchestrated action scenes (my only qualm about said scenes were that there were too few and too short). The first few episodes are the critical point for the viewer \u2013 either a hit or a miss for them, some would deem it as \u201cseen it before\u201d, and others will be drawn into its alluring nature.  Also, regarding the second season of the show: that too does not even answer the questions formed for season one, so if you\u2019re okay for vague roundabout answers, dull characters (excluding Hei, naturally) and well choreographed action then DtB is the show for you.",

            "content": "What format is best for telling a story of an anime series; a narrative format that\u2019s episodic or a format that has a continuing story from beginning to end? It honestly depends on who or what story is trying to be told if any at all. While episodic is easier to get into since the format can be better use for just entertainment. Thus you can eliminate the need of continuity, making it favorable for anyone to just jump into the series at any point. An overarching story on the other hand can build up to a greater or more disappointing outcome depending on theexecution since it requires commitment. \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d combines both formats in its narrative will which lead to commitment issues. Thanks to it's careful execution in combining both types of story formats you have a first half that does a great job of world building and a second half that has an overarching story that remains engrossing to the end. \\n\\n\r\nGood: Strong Writing\\n\\n\r\nDarker Than Black uses a two episode format to tell its stories. Allowing side characters to receive enough development to them feel like characters part of a bigger story instead of coming across as unimportant one shot characters. Thanks to this format it offers a host of well thought out characters and storylines on a variety of themes. Each contributing to either fleshing the setting or further developing a recurring character. No matter the screen time of certain side characters, their contribution feels like they added a piece of lore to the series. The atmosphere excels due to its extensive world building in the first half. Not only does the world fill unique, but by the end of the series it\u2019ll feel like a real place even if it belongs in the realm of fiction.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that is mostly serious it knows when to have fun. The few comedic episodes in the anime don\u2019t affect the overall plot, but are nice a diversion to lighten the mood. These episodes inclusions make the series a bit enjoyable preventing from being a downer all the time. Generally though it has the well written dialogue to keep it afloat all throughout and engaging conversation among the characters as well. \\n\\n\r\nA downside to the two episode format is it will take half way before the main cast gets developed. In turn, this makes sticking with the anime a risk versus reward deal. Making it more dangerous is the fact that it doesn\u2019t have an overarching story until it reaches the second half either. So the first half focuses on Hei taking on jobs for a shady organization called \u201cThe Syndicate\u201d. Being more in line of an episodic anime generally not connecting story arcs. This will make it difficult to want to commit to the anime since the main cast is the only guaranteed returning characters while every supporting character is not guaranteed to return. The main cast will remain underdeveloped before reaching the halfway mark. There\u2019s no way around this issue other than having complete faith in the anime. If you\u2019re unable to attach yourself to anything in the anime before the main cast are developed in the second half, then staying committed to the series is a task on itself. \\n\\n\r\nOnce it starts developing an overarching story in the second half everything falls further into place. The stakes become bigger, the main cast get developed, and answers on some of the series biggest dangling questions get answered. For example, \u201cThe Syndicate\u201d motives and goal are revealed in the second half after being mentioned heavily in the first half. There\u2019s also the start of an overarching story that instead of creating more action goes for giving Hei a greater mental obstacle to overcome. Building it up nicely before reaching the finale and feeling the weight Hei has to shoulder. \\n\\n\r\nThe reaction towards the finale of \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d will draw mix reaction. It doesn\u2019t end with a bang making it fit more with the rest of the series. However, not everything will be answered. It\u2019s appropriate for some questions to remain unanswered since the characters themselves don\u2019t know all of them either. It\u2019s more in line of capturing a noir mystery so some dangling questions will be forgivable. One thing is certain about the finale is it does close the story up and ties up all loose ends. Completely understanding everything after it ends that\u2019s a whole other matter. \\n\\n\r\nGood: A Cool Cast \\n\\n\r\nHei is the protagonist of the series and for more than half of the anime his past is kept secretive. Unfortunately revealing anything about him should be a consider a spoiler. Learning about Hei and seeing his backstory developed is a major part of the story. His personality can throw viewers off since the series does take its time giving background towards contractor and explain why they are emotionless. Hei is written in such a way that part of his character is difficult to read because of it. He fills the quota to be an emotionless contractor, but shows emotion in everyday life with sarcastic remarks when he interacts with other in the cast. He\u2019s an intriguing mystery within the story and as a character becomes fully realize.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main from talking cat Mao who gathers information, to the unable to get drunk when drinking handler Huang, and emotionless medium doll Yin are handled in the same way in their characterization. Like Hei, these main characters don\u2019t get developed until later on in the series. When they are develop the two episode format allows room for in depth characterization. Setting up the character conflict in that episode and then following up by revealing bits of their themselves once the main cast reach closer towards a solution. Seeing them interact with one another never goes smoothly. Since they have varied personalities the chemistry between the characters can be both hilarious and captivating at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nHalf of the supporting cast tend to be done with after a single story arc. Once the story or job is finished that supporting characters will likely not be seen again. One of the few recurring supporting character is private eye detective Gai Kurusawa and his young manga obsessed assistant Kiko Kayanuma. The majority of the comedy revolve around these two characters. Gai Kurusawa is the closest the anime has to an exaggerated character. Reacting to his situation in over the top ways for a comedic effect. His interaction with Kiko usually revolve being desperate to accept any job for cash to arguing about the methods in getting cases solved. Episodes revolving around Gai Kurusawa and Kiko Kayanuma are easily entertaining with humor that hit due to their personalities and chemistry.\\n\\n\r\nThough the setting of the story is in Japan the cast is composed of characters from other parts of the world. It\u2019s not racial diversity just for the sake of it, but rather more of story tool to get across how big of a crisis it could escalate too. The CIA are involved, MI6 Agents are involved, underground organization \u201cThe Syndicate\u201d, and the organization Evening Primrose that attempt to obtain peaceful coexistence between contractors and humans are involved. That\u2019s quite the batch of organizations to keep track off and the same applies to the characters that work in them. Fortunately each organization is given a different objective for their goals and how they operate varied from one another. What this does is create different viewpoints within the setting on how the matter of contractors should be resolved. Giving several viewpoints on the matter as it grows into a bigger issue for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nGood: Capturing the Intended Mood Perfectly\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is handled by studio Bones. While not impressive in the least on the visual side or in movement the style is a good fit for the anime. Character designs don\u2019t have any exaggerated features and the environments are kept down to Earth as much as possible. Backgrounds are detailed with careful lighting that helps create the noir feel the series goes for. Everything is portrayed with some level of realism, including the contractors powers. Whenever a contractor uses their power the animation withholds from creating an excessive visual effect. Action scenes don\u2019t feature any flashy particle effect that draws attention to a contractor power. So everything meshes together for a unify look even when the more exaggerated element of the story are on screen. \\n\\n\r\nThis also holds true for the action scenes which aren\u2019t a drawing factor for the anime. Usually the action scenes are slow with the already mentioned restrained on flashy effects when a power is in used. In general, most of the action scenes have simple choreography that gets interrupted by conversations or is just slow in execution. Not counting the second opening. There are a few action scenes that combines contractors full abilities with the restraint display of powers, but unless Hei opponent Wei the action is underwhelming. CGI is used rarely, but questionable since it\u2019s primarily used on cars which aren\u2019t used for any elaborate scene. Cars simply go from one point to the next. Thankfully it does not stick out enough to become an issue since it\u2019s only use from far shots. If anything can get annoying is seeing product placement for Pizza Hut in the background.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting from both the Japanese and English dub cast are terrific. In both versions the low key and restrained performances give off that noir feel the anime goes for. Unfortunately in both versions, some cast members aren\u2019t allowed much ranged because part of the cast play the emotionless contractors. However, they are not stiff performances. The voice actors walk a thin line of coming across sounding wooden that they never cross. Most notably the most balance and perfected portrayal fall under Hidenobu Kiuchi in Japanese and Jason Liebrecht for the English dub both of whom voice Hei. Regardless what language you hear Hei speak both voice actor performances are tailored for this character. Neither are a dead giveaway in their delivery always surrounding Hei in this mysterious aura. His character is very difficult read, thanks to the voice talent, even delivery their jokes in a careful manner. Both actors are able to be funny while staying in character despite how little emotion they display in general.\\n\\n\r\nIkuya Sawaki in the Japanese cast and Kent William in the English both voice Mao. These two actors' voices give off vastly different vibes in their portrayal of Mao. Sawaki sounds more natural like a friendly person with many connections, while William deeper sounding voice makes him sound wiser. William older sounding voice shines when he delivers sarcastic remarks. In the English dubbed Kent William is an easy standout and my favorite actor in this season. \\n\\n\r\nOne area where the English dub surpasses the Japanese cast are the accents for foreign characters. The Japanese cast in general don\u2019t even come close in copying accents for foreign characters. In the English dub Troy Baker voices November 11, a clearly British character terrifically. Adding to an already accurate portrayal he fits the sophisticated character just fine. \\n\\n\r\nThe only major differences between both version is the comedy. Depending on what version you see the humor will be written for that specific culture in mind. Aside from that the English script remains as faithful as possible. While there\u2019s the obvious dialogue changes there are episodes where the story changes are less subtle. There\u2019s some episodes where certain plot points are beaten over the head. It\u2019s not damaging to the point that it\u2019s a complete turn off as it, though the material won\u2019t always match the quality of the original in the English script.\\n\\n\r\nIf you had to choose how to see the anime I would say watch the series subbed since the Japanese cast is consistent throughout the whole series. While the English dub in season one is the clear victor due to the voice actors more accurate portrayal of foreign characters. However, in season two some casting choices end up backfiring as the script changes are notably different making some of the English voice cast come across as annoying. The English dubbed has a better cast for the first season, but the Japanese cast is consistently good all the way. If it\u2019s short term English dub, but in the long run go with the English subbed.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is filled with good music. It\u2019s diverse in genre from rock ballads, to cool jazz, and to slower more calming sounding tracks. The two opening tracks can come across as misleading when representing the mood and pace of the series. \u201cHowling\u201d by Abingdon Boys School for the first 14 episodes and \u201cKakusei Heroism\u201d by An Cafe is used in episode 15 and onwards (minus episode 24) for the remainder of the series. Both opening theme makes \u201cDarker Than Black\u201d come across as a quick pace action series. While not accurate in presenting the series the two opening songs are fine for the anime. \u201cTsukiakari\u201d by Rie Fu is a slow and melancholic track. It\u2019s the ending theme for the first 14 episodes with a more emotional feel to it unlike the opening themes. Rie Fu soothing vocals are in harmony with the soft piano ballad. The second ending theme is \"Dreams\" by the band High And Mighty Color. \u201cDreams\u201d is more upbeat than the first ending theme in it\u2019s serenity. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: More than thrilled I stuck with it\\n\\n\r\nIt took me fourteen episodes before I was actually able to enjoy watching Darker Than Black. Everything is kept deliberately secretive so I found it difficult to care about my main cast in the first half of the series when they weren\u2019t developed. Eventually in the second half I started to care about them on episode 13 & 14 both of which focused on Yin. It was with these two episodes that my skepticism were gone since it made me feel that much closer to the main cast. I was convinced with these two episodes that this anime has something else to keep me coming back beside the first closing theme \u201cTsuki Akari\u201d by Rie Fu. Thank goodness too for those two episodes because episode 15 the ending theme changed. Episode 15 and onward the whole development of the main cast made the strong writing that much better in subsequent episodes. It just took a while to get into it. \\n\\n\r\nCalculating Points:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/3\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/3\\n\\n\r\nTechnical (Animation, Soundtrack, Voice acting, etc.): 2/3\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 1/1\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nDarker Than Black is not a series that will immediately hook you from the get go. The pacing is slow with it two episode structure taking half-way before developing a main story, but over time the strong writing, and great characters become far more memorable for it. Thanks to it two episode format for storytelling even side characters get fleshed out. Creating a fully realize world with diverse and complicated characters. It\u2019s a difficult anime to fully get into, but the payoff it worth it if you trust it and stick with it through the end.\\n",

            "content": "I decided to check out this anime based solely on Yoko Kanno's involvement.  From the first five minutes, the Matrix vibe was so heavy I thought Trinity was going to show up any minute.  After the opening 'homage', the Matrixy stuff is toned down and reduced to the landscape.  It's a green-hued city populated by people with powers...\r\nThere's also A LOT of annoying Pizza Hut product placements in nearly every episode.  This anime also has one of the most annoying anime character types in the medium: I'm talking about the character in law enforcement that is just useless and who's onlypurpose is to provide us with exposition.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is interesting though, random mysterious 'gates' appearing in South America and Japan, the stars being replaced by fake ones, contractors enacting weird rituals every time they kill.  Some story arcs are better than others, it's a mixed bag.  It's episodic, but tries to provide some plot development in each episode.  There's a cool British character named after my birthday: November 11.\\n\\n\r\nKanno's music is good as usual, she's sublime, but I was slightly disappointed to hear her strings aping Don Davis's Matrix style.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character of Hei was pretty interesting, not least for the fact that he's a Chinese main protagonist in a Japanese anime, but he looks cool in that mask too, and we watch him deceive people a lot, which is always fun.\\n\\n\r\nDarker Than Black is let down by the writing.  You know its at fault when you realise after 25 episodes they couldnt explain the main mystery of the tale; the reason why the world is the way it is; why the characters are the way they are; why we bothered to watch the anime in the first place.  There's a difference between smart ambiguity and stretching an interesting premise so thin you cant even wrap it up at the end.",

            "content": "Darker than BLACK is an exciting, heavily arc driven Sci-fi, Supernatural, Action anime; following the stories of various human beings, with various special powers, known as Contractors. ^_^\r\nThe plot of Darker than BLACK is somewhat confusing as you start but after a while you&rsquo;ll become accustomed to the intriguing plot, though it does take most of the show to fully understand. For the most part of the story it is arranged into 2 episode length adventures/arcs, giving it and episodic feel. Unlike other episodic adventure anime series (Cowboy Bebop), that extra episode allows the characters to be developed far better. This helps give this animeand edge because a lot of the characters are portrayed in such a way that you can&rsquo;t help but feel something towards them. Even though each arc has the same sort of structure as a 4-panel manga (Intro =&gt; Development =&gt; Turning point =&gt; Conclusion) yet each one feels unique in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the episodic characters that I discussed early, there are quite a few recurring main characters in the series that have fairly complex and intriguing personalities. Hei (BK201) being the character that the story revolved around was the most interesting one of them all, because he was so difficult to comprehend. The only real negative is the annoying detective character that appears, every now and then, for comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation can be compared with that of the more popular series, Death Note; with its superb visuals and the seamless blending of hand drawn and CG. Nonetheless there is just a little less detail, put into it, due to action but this helps create incredibly fluid animation. The music is basically a mix of Jazz, Rock, J pop and other melodies that will go well most of the different situations and moods of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Darker than BLACK fulfilled its purpose of becoming, an incredibly, exciting anime that could compete, with the likes of Claymore, when it first aired. Even with the plot and premise being confusing in the beginning, it all ended up being easy to understand as the show went on however there were still some issues left unexplained, in the end. Even with some elements of its storyline, having already been done before, there was still enough original content to make up for it. Well I recommend this anime to anyone who feels like watching a good action anime, with some sci-fi and supernatural elements.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "For a show with so much promise, Darker than Black is remarkably unremarkable, with a production as insipid as it is polished, and plot that tries so hard to be original that it ends up being turgid. I know there are hordes of fans of the show who will no doubt line up to disagree with me but, if the show had lived up to the expectations the names &ldquo;Studio BONES&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yoko Kanno&rdquo; conjure, I wouldn&rsquo;t be here expressing my disappointment. But irrespective of expectations and potential, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of the show as dressed-up mediocrity, with only an added dash ofheart to save it from being entirely unmemorable. The show&rsquo;s strengths lie in its characterisation and dramatic themes, which ultimately manage to shine through the absurd pseudo-sci-fi banter and general silliness. Its weaknesses are pronounced in the overarching story itself, and the way its progression is paced over the course of the show, but are also reflected in some surprisingly unimpressive production choices.\\n\\n\r\nBy no means is this a cheap anime, and on numerous occasions the visuals prove this with displays of technical excellence. However, I was rather dissatisfied with the show&rsquo;s production due to its poor and uninspired use of aesthetics to create a sense of style or to build an atmosphere. I think the show could have been enhanced greatly with greater attention being payed not simply to the detail and framerate of the animation, but also to its overall look. The background artwork, excluding a few scenes inside the gate, is bland and disengaging, with basic design and criminally unsubtle colouring. Compare the striking, and varied cityscapes of Gits:SAC to the featureless squares that DTB passes for buildings. Walls are lazily depicted in gradients of grey or brown that seem at odds with the lighting of the scenes. Rather than bringing the settings to life, they actually detract from them. Perhaps I&rsquo;m spoilt by IG&rsquo;s background work, but for a series of such supposed calibre I found it to be very poor indeed. The cel animation is crisp and detailed, and holds up well in the action scenes (as expected from the professionalism of BONES). Unfortunately, the character designs it has to work with are fairly average, with a few exceptions (Misaki, Yin).\\n\\n\r\nThe music is by Yoko Kanno, which says a lot for itself, although not as much as I&rsquo;d like in this case. The quality of the music itself is inarguably high - not Kanno&rsquo;s greatest work by any stretch, but nor her worst. Her jazz pieces lack the sophistication or personality of her work on Bebop and I can&rsquo;t help but feel that Mai Yamane&rsquo;s vocal contributions are wasted in her songs - but this still really good music. Unfortunately, it is often misused in the series - a common occurrence in anime. The problem with anime composition in the style of Kanno is that they&rsquo;re more pieces of music in their own right than they are score music. So, at times, the choice of music for a scene is jarring and some tracks are too oft repeated. I have no real qualms with the music, I was merely expecting a little more; if I hadn&rsquo;t known Kanno was behind it I would have been far less sceptical.\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black presents the kind of story that only anime would have the audacity to envision. The strangeness of the story almost leads me to suggest that it exemplifies the desperation of anime writers - where originality can only be found in the most farfetched and bizarre. So, rather than revolving around a core sci-fi concept or idea, the story is merely a construct of frivolous machinations that have no thematic connection to the real world whatsoever, and which are left mostly unexplained. I find it hard to justify my reservations toward the premise of the series, but it probably amounts to the fact that it is completely ridiculous AND it takes itself seriously. Such a wedding of the ridiculous and the serious should only be undertaken at the hands of those with extreme stylistic prowess like Shinichiro&rsquo;s Samurai Champloo or Cowboy Bebop - it really didn&rsquo;t work out in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n As part of the modern tradition of sci-fi anime, Darker then Black has hit up the viewer with a whole arsenal of strange vocabulary to learn, like &ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s Gate, Contractor, BK201&rdquo;, in what appears to be an attempt to alienate the audience while giving the impression everything makes sense if you&rsquo;ve done your homework. The anime industry seems to have come to the irreverent conclusion that the more convoluted and inaccessible a storyline is, the deeper and more worthwhile it is. I&rsquo;m not sure whether to blame Hideaki Anno for this, but Darker than Black is a certainly a culprit, leaving unanswered questions and logic gaps in its determination to condense a plot worthy (or not) of a fantasy epic into its 25 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nMuch of my frustration stems from the fact that the core backbone of the plot isn&rsquo;t divulged until far too late in the show, so that, for the majority of the series, you have an idea of what&rsquo;s going on but almost no idea WHY, or why it should matter in terms of the overall plot. I&rsquo;ve seen this in numerous anime before and I don&rsquo;t like it. It comes off as being little more than a gimmick to impress the viewer towards the end of the series by suddenly whipping out the answers to its seemingly incomprehensible premise. I prefer a traditional, linear approach to storytelling, as knowing the context of the story always adds gravity and import to the character&rsquo;s decisions and motives.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation is, nonetheless, a strength of the show, a strength that is not flaunted nearly enough. In this arc-based show, it is important that a sense of affinity or empathy with a character is swiftly established, and DTB achieves this nicely. Many of its earlier episodes are saved from their redundancy by the profoundness of the minor character&rsquo; plights. Hei, the protagonist, is certainly quite lacking; he spends so much time being mysterious that it&rsquo;s very hard to really care about him until the quick burst of character development he receives towards the end of the show. Luckily, the cast is rather large, and there are plenty of characters to become attached to. I grew particularly fond of Huang&rsquo;s anti-social rhetoric, and Mao&rsquo;s sceptical imparts. Together with Hei and the detached Yin their portrayal as a defunct family, who ultimately came through for each other, warmed my heart.\\n\\n\r\nIn a fleeting grab for redemption, the series manages to pull out a surprisingly gripping and sincere finale, which very nicely brings together the many emotional themes and dramatic overtones that have been brewing. The result is a climax that will tug at the heart of cry-baby and cynic alike with a powerfully bittersweet wrap-up, even if it won&rsquo;t divulge answers to some of the series&rsquo; greater mysteries. In fact, it was probably the most satisfying conclusion I&rsquo;ve seen all year. But a delectable aftertaste cannot wholly excuse the lack of direction of the bulk of its earlier episodes - which almost seemed like padding before this final arc. This could almost have been a 6-part OVA series. When all&rsquo;s said and done, the show was enjoyable enough through its entire run for me to recommend, but one should be prepared to be frequently underwhelmed and almost always unapprised. \\n",

            "content": "\u2018\u2019Darker Than Black\u2019\u2019 immerses the viewer in a fascinating world rife with cool superpowers, intrigue and mystery carried by beautiful animation and an evoking soundtrack by none other than Yoko Kanno. \r\nWell, that was the idea\u2026\u2026\r\nThe actual series definitely boasts impressive animation and cool superpowers, but that which the series tries to pass of as a story full of intriguing mysteries is nothing more than a total mess full of inconsistencies and plot contrivances. Worse yet, it wants to be seen as a dark and serious story but nevertheless shoehorns in some anime-trappings to try and hook a bigger audience. \r\nSaid story goes as follows:10 years ago a mysterious gate (creatively titled \u2018\u2019Hell\u2019s Gate\u2019\u2019) appeared in the middle of Tokyo which caused the stars to disappear and prompted changes in some people. People affected could be split up into 2 types: first there\u2019s  Contractors, who get a badass power (e.g. gravity-manipulation or teleportation) at the cost of an arbitrary payment (e.g. eating eggs or kissing someone) and then there\u2019s Dolls, (seemingly) emotionless people who can track people through an arbitrary medium, like water or mirrors. Knowledge of these things is kept under wraps by a secret international body called \u2018The Syndicate\u2019. They hunt down Contractors and offer them an ultimatum: submit or be killed. Normal people who come in contact with Contractors have their memories erased.\\n\\n\r\nIt is in this backdrop that we follow a team of Syndicate agents consisting of a bland Batman-knockoff, a Rei Ayanami-clone, a grumpy old fat guy and Salem from \u2018Sabrina The Teenage Witch\u2019. A large part of the series consists of 2-episode story arcs detailing a random mission carried out by said team. Well that\u2019s actually a bit misleading since it\u2019s Batman who ends up doing all the work while Rei (being a Doll) occasionally does some surveillance. Fatso and Salem are mostly there to be grumpy and snarky, respectively.\\n\\n\r\nOf course a team of secret agents needs to have a couple of real ones hunting them down for some tension. Problem is that the police officers in this series are idiots who couldn\u2019t catch a cold if they ran outside naked while it was snowing, so that\u2019s it for tension. Their only purpose in the narrative is that one of them often ends up listening to infodumps courtesy of that episode\u2019s exposition vessel. \\n\\n\r\nThe story-arcs all end up having a pretty similar pattern. Syndicate team tackles a case related to either a Contractor or a Doll,the police officers have a storyline that ties into the secret mission, Syndicate team gets to pull of secret agent stuff that often involves fighting dudes while the officers get to listen to exposition and remain ignorant of all the mysterious things that keep happening around them. Batman meets X-files, basically. The series makes an attempt to shake things up towards the end by introducing an overarching storyline, but it\u2019s so convoluted and filled with retcons and Deus Ex Machina that it ends up causing more damage than it fixes. \\n\\n\r\nAll of this is made worse by a number of plot elements and trappings that are inconsistent either within the show\u2019s universe or in a narrative sense. Some examples:\\n\r\n-\tA big deal is made about how a Contractor has a power that has to be paid for by doing something. 1 power, 1 payment. Except that there\u2019s Contractors whose powers can change in arbitrary ways, and there\u2019s Contractors who don\u2019t have to perform a payment. Worse yet, some payments aren\u2019t really payments at all. There\u2019s one Contractor whose payment is basically something that comes naturally with using his ability, and some payments are actually rather beneficial. \\n\r\n-\tA big deal is made about how Dolls have no emotions. Except that they do, they just appear emotionless. Why? It\u2019s never explored, in spite of the fact that it\u2019s a crucial part of one character\u2019s personality seeing as she\u2019s a doll. Guess they were fine with having a Rei Ayanami clone to attract otaku.\\n\r\n-\tThe series wants to be viewed as a gritty and serious \u2018noir\u2019 type story only to introduce a pair of supporting characters who outright parody these concepts. This creates a jarring tonal dissonance. Playing a genre straight can work. Parodying a genre can also work. Not both. The introduction of a blatant comic relief character in a serious story basically destroys the tone the makers were trying to establish. It\u2019s akin to putting Frank Drebin smack-dab in the middle of The Wire. \\n\\n\r\nI could talk about how some characters act completely out-of-character just so they can get killed or how a certain character\u2019s power goes from a basic elemental attack to being able manipulate reality but I\u2019ll stop here for brevity\u2019s sake.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty clear at this point that the makers didn\u2019t think this series\u2019 narrative and concepts through. The whole series is deliberately ambiguous in regards to its overall plot and universe which isn\u2019t a bad thing in and of itself. The problem is that the narrative is a mess. One could say that it doesn't matter seeing as the story is character-driven (ie. he J.J. Abrams Defense) but that's a rather weak defense as far as I'm concerned. Even a basic plot has to be somewhat coherent.\\n\\n\r\nDarker Than Black could\u2019ve been great. It had an intriguing setting, stellar animation, great sound direction (the actual soundtrack is forgettable despite being from Yoko Kano) and a few cool action scenes involving rather creative use of superpowers. But the storytelling is deplorable, the characters fail to be interesting or even entertaining and for every decent fight there\u2019s 2 fights that are essentially 3-second massacres that are there to impress you with the main character\u2019s \u2018\u2019awesomeness\u2019\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nJust goes to show: you can have all the best ingredients but you still need to have some cooking skills to make them into a tasty dish.\\n",

            "content": "\"Now I've lost it; I know I can kill. The truth is just beyond the gate...!!\"\r\nSTORY - For a series that essentially never explains anything, I'm actually extremely surprised I ended up liking it as much as I do. I'm not a fan of overt exposition, but I'm not a fan of dancing around all the obvious questions either, and Darker than BLACK does almost exclusively the latter. The majority of the series is episodic and comprised of two-episode mini-arcs; these episodes serve to explore the world and the characters, but any insight gained is limited and generally lead to more questions than answers. Andyet, the world presented is a very intriguing and unique; the concept of a select few with special abilities is everywhere, sure, but I'm totally in love with the idea of having to consistently pay a price for it. The series starts off a little slow, but none of the episodes are outright boring, and it's fun cataloging all of the data you receive and formulating various hypotheses about what had happened and why things are they way they are. It's the mystery that keeps you going.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it's immensely frustrating trying to understand anything sometimes, including the overarching plot and the motivation of any of the characters, which are, you know, kind of important, but even though I say that nothing's ever explained, there's definitely enough there for you to work off of. The episode-to-episode story is easy enough to get at a basic level, and as more and more elements present and repeat themselves, it becomes more and more interesting. It's open-ended in many ways, and there's plenty of room for interpretation. For that reason, it probably isn't for everyone; if you're looking for concrete answers and explanations, you'll almost certainly be disappointed. Most characters in the series don't even know what's going on, so there isn't anyone to spell it out for you.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - It really doesn't seem like it at first, but Hei is quite the fascinating character. It never seems quite clear whether Li is the disguise and Hei is the real personality or if it's the other way around. Both seem so sincere in their actions and words. The duality of his character seems contradictory because he comes off like he should be very straightforward, especially considering that &quot;contractors are logical creatures.&quot; The details of his past remain hazy and vague for a majority of the series, though it becomes obvious rather quickly what he still feels towards whatever had transpired. That in itself isn't all that interesting or original, but it's a good starting point for all the contradictions and a huge catalyst for the grand plot. I wouldn't say that Hei actually changes much throughout the course of the series, which is usually what I measure the merit of characters by, but he does learn a lot about himself, and those revelations seem to work just as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters aren't nearly as interesting, but together, they make a great supporting cast. Mao and Huang are both fun in their own way, though I do wish they had explored the former's past more. Too much about Yin was left unexplained for me to really take to her, but it didn't bug me all that much either. The detective and his assistant were pretty standard comic relief, but standard doesn't mean bad. Kirihara was also a pretty generic cop-type character, but she worked her role very well and her interaction with Li made for an interesting angle. (Or maybe I'm just a sucker for the secret identity drama thing.) The vast bureaucracy that stood over the plot was confusing to keep up with at times, but after a while, I found that it didn't really matter what the details were -- it's just bureaucracy. And it works out all right. \\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - Most of the things that BONES animates tend to impress me, and Darker than BLACK is no exception. Everything is smooth, beautiful, and entertaining to watch; the action scenes were fluid and well done, and most of the character designs were slick and distinctive. It's worth noting also that one of the sponsors was obviously a car company (I don't know which though because I don't know anything about cars) -- all of the vehicles in the series are explicitly detailed, with many utilizing 3d animation. There's also a pretty epic driving scene in the second opening's animation sequence. For the most part, this works out well, but there's that occasional 3d car that looks a bit out of place. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the sponsors is also the notorious Pizza Hut! In contrast to Code Geass's overt product placement though, DtB is much more subtle in its ways. The logo will appear on a few buildings and storefronts, but as much as Hei does gorge himself every other episode or so, he never actually goes out for pizza. I think this fact helps keep the overall mood of the series relatively serious; there are humorous bits, certainly, but it doesn't come off as nearly as crack-filled as the aforementioned. (I guess that's the difference between BONES and Sunrise.)\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - My little blurb at the beginning of this review is from the first opening theme. Once again, I really appreciate songs that relate directly to the series and contain lyrics specifically referencing it; I've always respected Takanori Nishikawa for this. Unfortunately, I find that his music under abingdon boys school is sub par compared to his music under T.M. Revolution. &quot;Howling&quot; has an interesting beginning, but the rhythm and melody feel jumbled up until the end/chorus. Being a Rie fu fan, I'd heard &quot;Tsuki Akari&quot; long before seeing the series, but while it's a pretty song, I didn't really feel as if it fit. It was almost jarring to hear it after every episode. The second opening, &quot;Kakusei Heroism ~The Hero Without A Name~&quot; by An Cafe is better in that it's more energetic and not as forced feeling; the second ending, &quot;Dreams&quot; by HIGH and MIGHTY COLOR is similar to the first in tone and mood, but something about it fits better -- I think it was just that Rie's voice itself didn't seem to fit the series, rather than anything about the music.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself mostly average, though there are a number of standout tracks -- particularly the intense tracks for high-action scenes and the horror/suspense movie-like tracks for the creepy and contemplative scenes. Still, I was surprised to find that Yoko Kanno was the composer because I don't feel as if Darker than BLACK's soundtrack is of the same caliber as the stuff Kanno is generally known for. It's not terrible by any means, but it certainly feels more subdued.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - Most of the cast is pretty average -- they're effective in their portrayals, but not particularly amazing. I did like Hidenobu Kiuchi as Hei a lot though; the differences between Hei and Li were really well done and it was great at highlighting the conflicts within his personality. I was also fond of Kirihara's voice, though it was pretty much the typecast for a strong-willed and morally infallible woman. The first two episodes are available dubbed and streaming from FUNimation's video site. Those two episodes didn't really leave that much of an impression on me, but I didn't think it was too bad?\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - To be honest, the first five episodes didn't do much for me. At six, it started to get more interesting because that was when Hei's past first started affect his present, and that was when the gate started to play a bigger role. After six, I never had a problem staying engaged, and the two-episode mini-arcs really helped keep my thoughts organized. As the overarching plot comes to reveal itself and the series climaxes near the end, you kind of forget that the episodes were ever structured that way because everything comes together so neatly. It's very smooth storytelling. And I liked the ending a lot too; it doesn't really explain much, and I'm still not completely sure what happened, but I like what I could understand and interpret. The concepts were good. It leaves me with a lot of questions, and I'd really like a sequel, but it's not the end of the world if there never is one. Few series can pull off that kind of open-endedness, but Darker than BLACK does.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Title: Darker than BLACK\r\nManga, Anime: Darker than BLACKdoes have an manga adaptation (who the author/artist is, I don't know, cause the information just isn't there).  It began running in Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Asuka magazine, and is currently up to four volumes.  It has yet to be licensed Stateside.\r\nDarker than BLACK is a twenty-five episode series done by Studio Bones (famous for their work on Fullmetal Alchemist and Ouran High School Host Club), and directed by Tensai Okamura (famous for his work on Wolf's Rain).  It ran from April 5th to September 28th, 2007 on Japanese TV, and has been licensed Stateside byFunimation and is due to be released at some point this year.\\n\\n\r\nStory: About ten years ago, this random thing called Hell's Gate appeared in the middle of Tokyo, and basically caused the normal destruction of the city and the disappearance of the night sky.  At the same time, people called Contractors started getting paranormal powers (think like the mutants from X-Men), and in exchange favor rationality over a human conscience.  The Contractors are kept a secret from the general populace and are used by the government and private groups as spies, assassins, etc.  The focus is on Hei, one of the most powerful Contractors, his blind Doll Yin, their handler Huang, and Mao, their wireless information Contractor talking cat.\\n\\n\r\nI admit, the premise drew me in; it sounds like X-Men, but with people actually trying to use them to their own advantage instead of annhiliate them (well, I take that back; you'll see what I mean later on in the series).  But there's a whole boatload of problems with this series.\\n\\n\r\nYou might be wondering, What exactly IS Hell's Gate?  What are Dolls?  How does a person become a Contractor?  How can a Contractor be a wireless information talking cat?\\n\\n\r\nExcept for that last question, don't expect any answers.  Darker than Black throws a whole shitload of information at you in the first few episodes, and then continues that pattern, but pulls a Rozen Maiden and really doesn't bother to explain exactly what the hell's going on, or anything that could actually help you make sense of what's going on here.  It's confusing and irritating; there was so much they could've gone into that would've made things clearer and would've helped the series a LOT.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters to keep track of.  This wouldn't be such a bad thing, except for that the character development comes a bit too late in the story for most core characters.  In fact, aside from the core characters I mentioned above and a passing interest in the Contractors and government agents involved in the cases, you don't really give a damn about who most of the two-episode arcs center around, which really doesn't help the series.  There were only two full arcs that I actually liked, along with the second half of two other arcs, and two of the three individual episodes at the end.  So, that's a total of... eight out of twenty five episodes that I actually liked.  That's a pretty shitty percentage.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big problem with the series is the placement of the two-episode arcs.  But more on that in Length.  \\n\\n\r\nYou're going to notice a lot of product placements, only because it's done in a clumsy and annoying way,  which is utterly unamusing.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, towards the end, Hei is revealed to have a power that, in its use and origin, is utterly Gary-Stu-ish and lacks a lot of coherent explanation, simply to try and bring an end to the story, which just pisses me off even more. \\n\\n\r\nThere is going to be an OVA due to be released later this year.  However, it's one episode, and based on who it centers around, it's not going to add shit to or conclude the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences were nice, yes.  And I liked the core characters.  However, the fact that nothing was really explained, the fact that most of the two-episode arcs' central characters weren't that likeable, and that character development comes at the wrong point (more on this under episode placement in Length) overwhelmed all the former.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: There's a lot of blood, and a bit of nudity at some points (anything that you'd really WANT to see is creatively censored).\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art is pretty well-done, here.  The character designs and backgrounds are well-done and gorgeous.  The cityscape is absolutely beautiful, especially at night.  The CG stands out a bit, but it isn't used enough that it gets on your nerves.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Yoko Kanno did the music for this series.  It's got a jazz bent to it, like what we heard in Cowboy Bebop, with a few sentimental pianos and string numbers thrown in.  It's good stuff, but it's not quite as good as some of her other stuff that I've heard.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two OPs and EDs, one for each half of the series.  The OPs are all harder rock numbers, though I like the first one slightly better than the second one, and the first ED is the typical J-Pop female ballad, which wasn't half bad, and the second ED is a power ballad, which I didn't like all that much.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few insert songs thrown in, and they aren't half bad.  Can't remember them enough to tell you how well they fit, though.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: No talent that I recognize from other shows, but everyone did a pretty good job.\\n\\n\r\nLength: There are some problems here, mainly with arc placement.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the arcs that contain character development are tossed in towards the end, which is a bit too late for it to come in, and most of the pointless shit is tossed in at the beginning.  For the most part, the arcs are standalones, which means that they could be easily be rearranged to make the series a bit more interesting. They SHOULD have done this, as it might have made the whole thing a bit more bearable.  Plus, certain plot elements are picked up in one arc, dropped for a few arcs, and then come up again towards the end, which just makes things even more irritating; it would have worked far better if the arcs with those elements were placed closer together.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, twenty-five episodes is just right.  Any more, and I probably would've dropped it, any shorter, and it would be even more incomprehensible and shitty than it already is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A series with pretty good animation and music, and an interesting premise and characters that utterly fails to explain ANYTHING, arcs that center around characters you don't give a shit about, has shitty episode placement, and, on top of it all, gives the otherwise likable main character a Gary-Stu power towards the end.  Trainwreck, please.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 8/10\\n\r\nLength: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 38/50; 76% (C)",

            "content": "What do you get when you combine X-men and Cowboy Bebop? This.\r\nDarker Than Black tackles the manifestation of paranormal abilities to humans and while it is not masterfully presented, I have learn to enjoy it.\r\nTen years passed after the incident that gave birth to Contractors, people who manifested paranormal abilities. Nowadays agency's hires Contractors for their own use, seldom even use them as they see fit; giving in to darker emotions and abusing that power. But in exchange from gaining this ability, they must always fulfill their renumeration. Hei is a powerful contractor hiding under the alias of Lee, masquerading as a Chinese transfer studentwhen not undercover, who has the ability to generate electricity and for some reason he doesnt have a renumeration. Under an unknown government, Hei along with Yin, a spirit medium who is incapable of emotions otherwise known as Dolls, and Mao a contractor whose body is stuck on a cat, together they form a team working assassination and the likes.\\n\\n\r\nThe show seems to be fairly deliberately paced, without being too frantic.\\n\r\nEach arc consists of two episodes. And each one introduces a new well written story, which sometimes can be frustrating since it was better off being a long arc rather being episodic.Dont worry, the characters are likable, in fact I very much like every character. Problem is, they're lifespan. Knowing that its only episodic, you can expect that they'll kick the bucket before you get to know them. But at least the arc does just gradually advances the story a little and it is impressive how they were able to compressed such immersing stories in only two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not an action-oriented anime. It focuses more on the struggle of each Contractor goes through. Sure it has some decent action every now and then but most of them ends with disappointment. Hei's power is nothing more than a taser, which makes it hard to believe that he is actually one of the most powerful Contractor. Even so, the story makes up for it, well more often than not.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters acting are distinctive and good enough all around. We all know how interesting people with psychedelic powers clashing can be. But Hei, in particular wasnt the highlight of the show. Yeah, he does have an interesting past, that generally forms half of the premise of this show. But clearly he is your average wanna-be angst badass protagonist, even though he does prove to be a promising character. Furthermore, there were two other unlikable characters, the detective and his otaku sidekick. They were the comic relief of the show, and quite frankly I felit it was unnecessary. Their arc was pointless and dull. Every second of their screen time, is a second wasted. They were better off giving as a better background of any of Hei's team.\\n\\n\r\nDTB is designed in such a way that the anime appears dynamic. It has detailed visuals and the animation is extremely fluid. The designs of each characters are not elaborate enough to be different but it does have its own physique.  The sound was fairly average and OST was nothing special to be notable. \\n\\n\r\nThis easily couldve been the anime version of the critically acclaimed american tv hit series, Heroes. But its deficiency of substance, plot advancement and in depth characters had it put down.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Hei does with his power and the impact he'll have on others is the raison d'etre of the show; the moody noir tone and offbeat writing are the reasons to tune in.",

            "content": "--- Warning: Contains spoilers ---\r\nStories of people with superhuman abilities have been around practically since the dawn of time. Ever since DBZ set the bar for \u201cpower levels\u201d consisting of blowing up planets however, more and more modern series have teetered on the edge of colossal scales at some point or another. Then you have Darker than Black, which can stand out among a handful of those with more reasonable (or rather comprehensible) scales in the post DBZ era. \r\nDarker than Black starts out by introducing these things known as contractors, people with special abilities like many series out there, who must pay a \u201cprice\u201dfor using their power ranging from things like writing poetry to breaking a few fingers. Aside from contractors we have dolls, which are basically emotionless mediums with no real personality, who send out things known as \u201cobserver spirits\u201d that work like mobile security cameras.\\n\\n\r\nWe quickly meet our main character Hei, a contractor with electric abilities who seemingly has no price unlike the other contractors out there. Working with a doll named Yin, a talking cat named Mao, and a man named Huang who seems like your typical 1930s mafia average joe, the group takes on missions from an organization simply referred to as \u201cThe Syndicate\u201d. This organization is apparently vast in scope, as it easily networks Hei into a variety of odd jobs necessary to gather intelligence and work his missions, even in the midst of organizations with top notch security. \\n\\n\r\nFor the first half of the series, we actually don\u2019t learn much about this group, but rather we uncover a variety of characters, their motives, and their back stories as Hei goes on various missions. Although these are well done and quite gruesome visually at times, none of these really seem to be tied together or have importance beyond just another day at the office, making the series fairly episodic in the beginning for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nThe arcs in Darker than Black generally tend to consist of two parts, mostly pertaining to \u201cHell\u2019s Gate\u201d, a wall around a supernatural zone that appeared some ten years ago in Tokyo as the stars in the night sky were replaced with those representing the lives of contractors. Unless you like unstable realities that laugh in the face of physics and induce mass hysteria, this probably isn\u2019t the type of area you would like to stroll through on a Sunday afternoon. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to see from the beginning, that there is a feeling akin to that of a mafia series. Everything from the way Huang obtains information to Hei\u2019s execution of missions to the way the group explains their relationship with each other fits the bill for a futuristic mafia. As such, they keep their profile as low as they can manage while avoiding failures that may make them live out their usefulness to The Syndicate. Of course, this means you will also get your fair share of enjoyable action as the group carries out The Syndicate\u2019s dirty work. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one of Darker than Black\u2019s most refreshing attributes though is the protagonist Hei. While not particularly rare, Hei is strong but not overpowered. Many modern series have protagonists that are simply too strong in comparison to the antagonists, leaving for boring lackluster fights as they easily beat their opponent. Hei is realistic on the other hand, and many times throughout the series the help of an ally saves him instead of his own strength. For those of you who prefer the ridiculously strong heroes, you might see this as a weakness on his part, but I quite enjoyed giving importance to what has become the oft forgotten role of \u201cright hand man\u201d in today\u2019s lineup of do it yourself heroes.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most protagonists though, Hei is rather silent. When he talks, it\u2019s usually only a brief response to another character consisting of maybe a few lines. Compared to other protagonists out there that are always shooting their mouths off and the like, it\u2019s nice to see one speak more through actions than words for once. Sometimes though, this does leave Hei taking a backseat for supporting characters as they become the central focus. In hindsight this is primarily seen in the beginning arcs, but this may end up making it difficult for some people to form a strong enough attachment to the series to see it out to the end when there is more focus and clarity on our main character. \\n\\n\r\nDespite his rather limited dialogue, Hei still clearly develops as a character. Initially seeming nothing more than the stoic murderer contractors are pegged for completed by his feared moniker \u201cThe Black Reaper\u201d, we see that this is only to maintain appearances for his job. It\u2019s not really until the second half of the series that we get to see this other side of Hei, notably when Yin becomes a target for their enemies. When The Syndicate deems Yin possibly harmful to their interests, they order Hei\u2019s group to kill her, to which he defies the order and saves her instead. More difficult orders come down from above as time goes on, and Hei becomes increasingly defiant as he comes to his own realizations of the path he wants to pursue. \\n\\n\r\nThis arc also introduces the growing relationship between Hei and Yin, and despite that both are about as conversational as a rock, they do gradually grow fonder of each over time in their limited communications. Their relationship reminded me much of Roger and Dorothy from Big O, though definitely more realistic considering Yin is actually human unlike Dorothy. It is important to note they don\u2019t always clearly communicate through language, as Yin simply sending out an observer spirit into the gate to check on Hei during one arc clearly meant a lot to him, and it is later noted that this is actually quite painful for a doll to do. Even by the end however, this relationship is still really only a stern fondness. Some audiences may be left unsatisfied that more development wasn\u2019t given here while others may feel that there wasn\u2019t enough directness in their relationship to make for a convincing enough development.\\n\\n\r\nAround the same time as Yin\u2019s arc, the main and only real plot of Darker than Black begins to emerge with the appearance of a character named Amber. Amber is a contractor codenamed \u201cFebruary\u201d, who apparently betrayed Hei as a member of his group, which also happened to include his sister Pai, in a South American War over a similar zone to Hell\u2019s Gate named \u201cHeaven\u2019s Gate\u201d. Spearheading a group of contractors by the name of Evening Primrose, Amber begins bombing the town and making a nightmare of Hei\u2019s life like a bad ex-girlfriend when she also kidnaps Yin. Don\u2019t forget she leaves behind the courtesy \u201cFU\u201d letter written in that girly handwriting complete with the little hearts and all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story here actually bridges a lot of elements from the beginning arcs together, in a way that makes you realize that while it had the kick back feeling of an episodic series initially, they were conveniently busy weaving the main plot underneath many of these stories unbeknownst to the audience. The realization at the end in how these stories connect to one another is quite a nice touch, but not to the level of being spectacular at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end, Amber eventually exposes the truth of the Syndicate and the nature of contractors to Hei, and it is then we really see him as the ideal hero.  Hei struggles with the hard moral choices and his limitations as an individual that are in ways reminiscent of heroes like Batman. His final decision on how to resolve the ending conflict speaks strongly towards justice, as he makes the world his enemy to do what he feels is right despite concerns from Amber. \\n\\n\r\nAbandoning everything he had previously known except Yin, Hei moves forward with his choice to try and get humans and contractors to coexist. Previously having been kicked from the Syndicate, the ending is left rather open with the implication he will begin a whole new life as the Syndicate hunts him down to no end. In many senses, Hei\u2019s journey is only beginning and this series is a prequel to setting that event in motion. While many people prefer their definitive endings, I felt it was rather fitting for the series to leave the ending open instead of attempting an abrupt halt to the nice developments the series brought forth just to manage a definitive end.\\n\\n\r\nTop the series off with a fitting OST and fluid combat scenes, and Darker than Black becomes a very enjoyable action series definitely worth the watch. The characters were all explained nicely by the end with their developments, even a majority of the supporting cast. Overall this series is best summed up as a \u201cChinese Electric Batman\u201d, which as it sounds, is just plain awesome. \\n",

            "content": "======\r\nShadows on a Black Road\r\n======\r\nAt the horizon of a bleak world stands an ominous wall, \u2018Hell\u2019s Gate\u2019, it\u2019s steel and cement arms spreading across the Tokyo skyline. The city itself is filled with curious characters borne with the Gate, Contractors and Dolls. Contractors are those that have gained supernatural abilities for a price, a penance they must pay for using their skills. Some have to overturn the shoes of their victims, smoke cigarettes or even drink the blood of young children. Dolls on the other hand are soulless mediums, who use various surfaces to track the ongoing of the city. Presented is a dark worldpainted in shadows and ambiguity, a backdrop against which Darker than Black[DtB] succeeds, a few shades short of greatness. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is vague: ten years ago, Hell\u2019s Gate emerged along with Contractors and Dolls, humans granted paranormal abilities. The smoke doesn\u2019t really clear up much as series progresses, failing to provide answers to how or why the Gate was created in the first place. Instead, Darker than Black drags you through a tale rife with political head butting and philosophical dilemmas while attempting to pluck a few heartstrings along the way.  Sometimes it feels the plot is trying to do too much, pushing character development while layering bureaucratic maneuverings atop of a monologue about the nature of the human soul. The tale is ambitious, but some of these elements just fall short. There\u2019s also the little issue of leaps of faith across little plot holes. You won\u2019t enjoy Darker Than Black very much if you don\u2019t buy into the logic. Some shows abuse this, such as Code Geass R2, but DtB never exploits its own narrative to that extent.\\n\\n\r\nThe climax serves as a stage focusing on the main character\u2019s personal journey instead of the large conflict that had nurtured in the final few installments. The effect was underwhelming, both could have been featured and the latter did not have to be shoved to the final few minutes to be resolved. The ending didn\u2019t tie together all the loose ends but I expect the sequel to fulfill the unrequited promises of the first. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were exceptional in Darker than Black. Hei, a polarized hero, wears an icy mask on his missions, while off duty he\u2019s reserved, clumsy and for a lack of a better word, \u2018cute\u2019. He\u2019s supported by the silent and morose Yin, and the level-headed Huang. The cast is given some vibrancy by Mao, the cautious if somewhat paranoid talking cat. The leads are likable but their development is allocated to specific arcs, their growth stunted outside these small windows. Hei can be seen as an exception, his past penciled in throughout. From a beer chugging secret agent, a cop with a stoic sense of justice to a sock-sniffing sociopath, the supporting cast is spectacular, filled with interesting figures. Kurosawa Gai brings relief to the tense, often brooding, atmosphere, with his perky pink-haired partner Kiko. Close to the middle of the series we see an erosion of Hei\u2019s stony visage, seeing it completely shatter in the last few moments. The revelations make Hei endearing but somewhat forgettable. We\u2019ve seen this type of hero, a cut and paste history pulled from many popular stories. \\n\\n\r\n======\\n\r\nProduction \\n\r\n======\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Darker than Black is exceptional, the Bones name branded onto every frame. A dark palette is favored to fill in the vacant allies, while vibrancy bubbles in Shinjuku\u2019s flashing lights. The style is outlined in dark strokes, as the action unfolds before your eyes. The scuffles between the Contractors highlight the fluidity of the animation, powers vibrating with force, sizzling with electricity or rippling with strength. Hei invokes the spirit of Spider-man as he zips around and about buildings with his grappling hooks for an impressive effect. A slight amount of CGI is used to animate cars, Bones opting for a more cell-shaded look to let them drive about seamlessly in the world.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs work well, each unique enough to give a distinct personality. Hei\u2019s pupils are not drawn in, creating an eerie effect, making him seem almost soulless. Facial animations are spot on, most impressively seen in Yin, her eyes betraying small fragments of feeling that she had supposedly forgotten. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is decent, not up to par of the visuals. The supporting cast surprisingly delivers excellent performances, their short roles reprised excellently. It\u2019s the main cast I felt was a bit weaker, feeling a bit forced. Huang is best when asked to treat his comrades like shit, his compassion coming off as fake. The soundtrack is varied; composed of more traditional tracks featuring bellowing pianos and whining violins, to more electro-pop influenced tracks like the opening. They interweaved the two styles well enough, rendering a pleasant soundscape fitting of Tokyo\u2019s dreary future. \\n\\n\r\n======\\n\r\nWatchability and Enjoyment\\n\r\n======\\n\\n\r\nAt moments I had \u2018WTF\u2019 feelings shock my system. I didn\u2019t know exactly what was going on why certain plot points were unfolding the way they were. The story led me one way, then the plot would stretch itself thin to move in another direction. It\u2019s a bit disorienting, but the complex forces at work in the show eventually boil down to a simple \u2018us versus them\u2019 scenario with Hei at the center of it all. The intricacy might be a turn off to some viewers, but I appreciated that the show saw the viewer as an intellect and did not spoon-feed the entire story to me. \\n\\n\r\n======\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts\\n\r\n======\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black is a welcome in a sea of mediocrity. It attempts to touch the horizon, to realize its own epic ambitions. There are a lot of loose strings, holes in the story that have to be reconciled in the second season for this program to reach hallowed annals of Anime prominence. The twenty-five installments created are excellent, the potential is there, but Darker than Black is an incomplete work. \\n",

            "content": "Darker than Black is a very enjoyable show for most people.  The storyline is extremely unique, with characters that show a level of depth not often seen.  I never found myself looking at the artwork and wondering what the animators were thinking.  Each of the characters has an appearance that looks realistic, but also unique.  Everything looks extremely high-quality to me;  Especially if you look at a dvd or .mkv version of the episodes, the level the artists drew on is very high.\r\nThe music was at times a bit hokey, but it grows on you surprisingly fast.  The creatorschose to go with a more jazz-themed soundtrack for a lot of the generic scenes, which I personally didn't enjoy.  But, the battle music is some of the best that I've heard.  DtB also features some of the most heartbreaking and beautiful songs for character themes or special moments that I've ever heard in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'm particularly impressed with the choice of Seiyuus that the producers chose.  I only recognized one actor as a 'veteran', later finding another favorite that changed her voice so completely I couldn't recognize it.  Despite this, I enjoyed the voices in the anime probably the most out of any subbed show.  Everything was matched so perfectly, I don't think they'll be able to come close with an english dub.  \\n\\n\r\nThat said, it is not for everyone.  Darker than Black is, well, dark.  If you've ever watched Death Note or a similar show, expect the same aura of gloom to hang over the episodes.  It also features some rather disturbing or violent moments, with a good deal of blood or gore.  If this makes you uncomfortable, perhaps another show would be better.  It's nothing compared to shows like Elfen Lied or Hellsing, but it's definitely there.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is one of the most well-written I've ever seen.  It starts you off knowing nothing at all, then ramps you up at a ferocious rate.  As I once commented to a friend, some shows like Naruto that are aimed at a younger crowd mention important concepts specifically, in detail, and quite often with pictures to go along with the explanation.  In DtB, you're lucky if a character mentions it in passing.  More often you're expected to pick up on things simply from how people act or talk of something.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to not discussing concepts clearly, Darker than Black often changes its mind on the rules of its own universe.  All too often it will lay down a rule, only to provide an exception to that very rule the same episode.  Because of this, the plotline feels very open and free to interpretation, even through the final moments of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of this said, I still personally count Darker than Black as my second favorite anime out of dozens that I've watched.  It provides a suspenseful, well-produced, mature alternative for those anime fans who want a little more out of their episodes.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF SEASON 1 ONLY**\r\nDarker than Black is a very cool, very unique show that is a great watch if you are looking for a nice change-of-pace anime. Darker than Black does not follow the traditional model of story-telling at all; in fact, it seems to create it's own rules. Rarely do you run into an anime that can balance its serious and depressing moments with light-hearted comedy so effectively all while being topped off with an intriguing plot, much like Fullmetal Alchemist. While it certainly has flaws (We'll get to those) and the FMA comparison is a bit generous, Darker than Blackis undoubtedly a fantastic anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nTen Years ago, an impenetrable field known as \"Hell's Gate\" appeared and psychics who wield paranormal powers at the cost of their conscience also emerged, becoming known as \"contractors\". Hei, the protagonist, is among the most powerful of these contractors, and along with his blind associate, Yin, he works for one of the many rival agencies vying to unlock the mysteries of Hell's Gate. \\n\r\nConsidering the involvement of the CIA, MI6, and other top secret agencies, Darker than Black's storyline gives off the an inevitable \"secret agent\" vibe that is pretty rarely portrayed in anime, at least not effectively. \\n\r\nThe most notable aspect about the show's plot, however, isn't the story itself, but it is the way the story is told. Rather then a continuous storyline, Darker than Black is told in a series of 2 episode long arcs that vary greatly in time, setting, and characters involved. The only real constant between these arcs is the protagonist Hei, but more on him later. This method of story telling was destined to be either hit or miss, and it was definitely a hit. It leaves the viewer intrigued as bits of information are revealed little by little in each arc until you finally have every piece to the puzzle and you can gaze upon the beautiful mosaic that has been assembled at last. The plot is really what gives the anime it's unique flair and that is the reason the show is so popular.\\n\r\nThat being said, there a few things that really irked me about the plot. For one, it didn't go in-depth enough about most of it's main plot elements. For example, what exactly is \"Hell's Gate\", specifically? How and why did it appear? Where did contractors come from? How exactly do you become a contractor? What exactly is a doll? How do you become a doll? etc. There are simply too many unanswered questions about the very foundation of the plot for this show to receive a 9 or 10 out of 10 in this category.\\n\r\nAdditionally, the ending was a bit underwhelming. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. It didn't have the level of satisfaction that I was hoping for, but some people liked it. I'm well aware of the second season, but, well... I'll write a review on that season later.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nIncredibly fluent and crisp animation. It really stands out for it's attention to detail and for how visually appealing it is. Truly beautiful artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nA pretty cool sound track with great openings, endings, and in-show tracks. The voice acting is also above average, but the sound effects were a bit weaker then I was hoping for, but after watching Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom, all gun sound effects sound bad to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters of Darker than Black, in my opinion, are what tie the entire show together. \\n\r\nHei, the protagonist, is one of the most intriguing characters in anime history. He is cool, mysterious, and his motivations aren't entirely clear until you get further into the show. The idea of a contractor who retains his emotions and has actual pure intentions grows on you as the anime goes on and Hei's sheer complexity and backstory are just the icing on the cake. Everyone who has seen this show loves Hei.\\n\r\nThere are many, many noteworthy side characters, including Yin, the chief of police, Huang, and Mau. All of these characters have arcs dedicated to them and all of them have intriguing backstories, especially Yin. As previously mentioned, the plot may be the reason the show is so popular, but I think the characters are the true driving force of Darker than Black.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThere really isn't another show out there that can be accurately compared to Darker than Black, and that is the reason that I highly recommend giving it a watch. The intricacy of the characters and story-telling technique is almost hypnotic and it makes for a very addicting experience. Check it out if you get the chance (Season 2 is very different from season 1, however, I'll write a review on that one soon).",

            "content": "What is truly Darker than Black?\r\nEnter 10 years after the \"incident\" and the emergence of \"Contractors\" and spirit mediums known as \"Dolls\". Darker than Black takes you into the mystery that is Hell's Gate. From the production studio Bones, the studio of such anime as Fullmetal Alchemist, Soul Eater, Eureka Seven, and Noragami comes one of 2007 best Anime. Darker than Black's anime adaption is one of original origin as the story line does not directly relate to the Manga. A risky move that is payed off with exceptional results as this was one fantastic series.\r\nDarker than Black focuses around Contractors, one in particular (BK201as known as The Black Reaper) and the humans who control them using their powers to gain utter dominance over one another. Humans also use spirit mediums known as \"Dolls\". Contractors are humans who gained supernatural abilities after the appearance of Heaven's Gate in South America and Hell's Gate in Japan, while Dolls are are emotionless mediums often used for their observation spirits. Contractors are referred to as Contractors as the pay a price each time they use their powers. Their \"payment\" can be just smoking a cigarette or growing years older. Dolls are know as Dolls as their emotionless nature leaves them with a doll like appearance.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the sudden disappearance of Heavens Gate 4 years ago the fear and mystery of Contractors grew and they became ever expendable to humans. Contractors and Dolls became tools for organizations all over the world such as the CIA, MI6, and the ever mysterious Syndicate to which the protagonist Hei (BK201), Yin (Spirit Medium), Mao (Contractor), and Huang (Human) belonged. Contractors existence is kept a secret from everyday citizens. Their lives show only the purpose of carrying out the dirty work of humans and doing whatever to survive. They are thought to be emotionless, tactless beings unable to think for themselves and are looked down upon by the humans they serve. Contractors and Dolls slowly evolved throughout the series becoming more independent and capable of self thought. With the emergence of Evening Primrose contractors now had a choice, fight against the Syndicate for the survival and acceptance of Contractors or remain a thoughtless tool sure to die by the hands of the ones they serve.\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black features in my opinion everything you could want in an anime. The animation stands on a level one would not expect to see in 2007. There is good character development among the main cast. The fight scenes are amazing (no matter how brief), and the soundtrack is awesome. Whether it is and OP, ED, or insert song it all fits the setting and story line. Lets not forget the top notch voice acting. True delivery of emotions and feelings or in Yin's case a lack there of was great. The episodes were shown in an episodic nature which didn't take away from or break the original plot. Not one episode could be called filler as each one progressed the original plot or the character it portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up Darker than Black was a unique, one of a kind anime and it was pleasurable to watch. It contains its fair share of comedic moments, loaded with action, highly entertaining, and leaves the viewer wanting more. Plus how could anyone forget that it gave the world Yin. I believe that Darker than Black is a must watch for anyone. It won't leave you disappointed. Over 140,000 people agree.",

            "content": "Darker Than BLACK is an anime that I had no knowledge of whatsoever before watching it. I decided to start it because the plot sounded interesting, and I am so glad I did. Most of it consists of 2 episode arcs up until the last several episodes, and they all help the plot along while also dealing with character development and sometimes a little comic relief.\r\nArt: The art in DTB is perfect for the atmosphere the story and characters are meant to be in. It gives off a neo-noir feel that also has variety within it. Character designs are varied depending on gender and age,and they are all very realistic while maintaining fantasy-like charming qualities. The settings in DTB are realistic as well, as it is supposed to take place in a modern Tokyo. You will not see an abundance of bright colors or too many dark ones, but it tends to lean a little darker. The battle scenes are done well, being intense yet not so intense that you can't tell what is going on. Much of the story is based upon the sky and stars itself, so those will come into play when regarding the art. The way shooting stars are presented whenever a Contractor is killed is done beautifully, even if it is just a shooting star. The art in DTB isn't something you would compare to other animes, simply because it just suits this anime's feeling so perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sounds and music used in DTB also fits the anime, ranging from a heartwarming song to a chase scene's music. The genre of music used on DTB fits the neo-noir aspect, as it sounds jazzy like it's supposed to. The same composer also did Cowboy Bebop's music score. The sound effects dealing with the splatting of blood to rainfall are done just as well as one would expect, so no complaints or super praising here. I must say that listening to DTB's background music outside of the anime has turned out well, and the songs are just too good not to listen to on repeat for a long while.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: All of the characters in DTB had good development and progress in my opinion, with some having their own arcs. Now you might be thinking &quot;ugh, character development arcs&quot; however they are done in such a way that they do not divert from the main plotline. It is also done in such a way that you want to know more about these characters and their past, just so you can get a better feeling of attachments towards them. Hei, the main character's intentions are never really clear until the conclusion of the series, yet you still feel like you're able to figure out what it is he is truly seeking. To be able to relate to Hei even though you're not completely sure of his true intentions shows how good of a character he is, although even after the end of the series he still might seem a little shrouded in mystery to you as it might feel a bit inconclusive.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Much of DTB deals with several parties of people having some development dealing with their past and other characters they must interact with. During these arcs, Contractors are always present. While also learning more about certain characters, you will still be learning about Contractors and the groups trying to find out more about Hell's Gate. The story in DTB might start out slow or might seem like it isn't  progressing, but if you pay attention to what is happening in the world around the characters and the characters themselves, it shouldn't be hard to see what is going on. What you'll be seeing here is conflicts between the government, Contractors, and the Syndicate that Hei and his team work for. They battle for peace, equality, and to find out each others intentions. Their biggest goal, however, is to find out the truth behind Hell's Gate and the other mysteries surrounding it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I took my time with DTB and only watched 2-3 episodes a day, to help make it last longer. Being able to see the progress of Hei's and others' goals was very enjoyable, and sometimes a relief. Finding out more about the mysteries and the true intentions and goals of certain characters gave a big sense of accomplishment. So, although the ending might seem a little off, I still felt a sense of completion and that I could see where things in the future of this world might lead to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: DTB was one of the most enjoyable animes I've had the pleasure of experiencing, and I'm glad it lasted a while. I'm not going to say it is the best ever, but for right now it is one of my favorites. The story, atmosphere, and plot development pace might not be suited for everyone or even a vast majority of people. However, if you can appreciate and understand it, you will be able to find an anime that has good characters and a story that isn't terribly full of depth but has enough for you to be able to get hooked. I can say for sure that I'll have fun rewatching this many times.",

            "content": "Darker Than Black is one pretty good ranked anime, the name is cool, the short videos are OK so I expected a good, thrilling SCI-FI dark action anime.\r\nWell, the anime is all that, but in a very poor and mild way. \r\nThe first few episodes of the anime are good and they can hook you to want more, but when you find yourself wanting more, this anime simply doesn't give you that. The plot is decent, but eventhought this anime has 25 episodes, it feels like it has a looot filer episodes and characters. The story is going good, but the anime gets you thefeeling like only a couple of minutes per episode (and even that's a lot here) are story related and that something really happens only in the last few episodes. This anime can easly be watched with only half of brain since you won't miss much and you don't have to concentrate. To explain, you don't have to concentrate on the story, but the average viewer would want to concentrate to find some anwsers which the anime doesn't provide that very good. Conclusion from that - feel free to do your dishes and watch this anime. It won't emerge you into the story and the setting, it won't get you rooting for some character and only a few last episodes will compel you to watch more (so you can finaly SEE something of this anime). \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty one dimensional, their past has been explained but really poorly, the animation is tolerable, sound is nothing special and the overall experiance was pretty poor.",

            "content": "Dark than Black was one of the worst I have seen.  The entire show seems to have a created by committee feel to it.  Several half decent ideas about characters, story, and development get jumbled together into a incoherent mess.\r\nThe story is confusing due to lack of decent explanation for pass events which seem to have a lot to do with the current events.  While at first this seemed to be trivial in the first few episode, all of the supporting characters keep bring up the pass like a weapon.  Every time you think you have time to enjoy the hearand now someone, who will not survive the episode, is all, \"Hei, remember back when you had feelings and wasn't such a tool?\"  Ok Darker than Black, I get it the incident with Heaven's Gate is undisclosed South America is important.  Due tell...........oh ok, no one knows WTF happened.  Stop bring up stuff you are not going to explain and has no real barring on the events at hand.\\n\\n\r\nThey did get around to explain this incident later in the show, but it wasn't that big of a reveal and changed nothing about what was going on now.  While it did present Hei with a bit of a moral/social dilemma, he seemed like he had already made his choice on the matter some time before the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo what does the story give you.  Hei is an assassin with super powers....that he never really uses and works for an \"mysterious organization\" with no real name.  He is contracted to kill fellow contractors (ha ha, I see what you did there) for no good reason and he is totally cool with that.  He is in fact using them as a resource to pay his bills so he can secretly look for his sister....a hobby he barely makes time for.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also Huang, his handler who is just around to tell Hei what he is thinking about doing is stupid, then run and hide.  He does help with information gathering, but honestly he is just a plot device to explain away how you contact an organization with no name, location, etc.\\n\\n\r\nYin is the stereotypical mute and cute girl.  She can see anyone near water if that water is connected to the water she is usually standing in, washing her hands with, etc.  I was waiting for her to be something more than a long range tracking device, but it was not to be.  The 1 shot episode about her was also very pointless.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a talking cat for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nI would now take the time to rip into the villains, but I just stopped caring at some point.  They were all the same \"bad guy\".  Contractor, ex-military from the Heaven's Gate incident, knows nothing important, kills for no reason, dies at the hands of Hei.  Repeat with new character design and new social quirk.\\n\\n\r\nNothing in Dark than Fail had any substance and never went anywhere of interest.  You know what was cool about this anime, the music.  The opening got me to get the Abingdon Boys School self titled album which was great.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the first episode was great; but then it failed to measure up to its own standards for 25 more episodes.  There are real McDonald's signs everywhere (I bet you can't guess who paid for production costs), but I actual think that was kinda cool/funny.  Hei, Yin, and Huang all are uninteresting and seem to be incapable of developing as people.  No matter what happens in the story, being betrayed, killing people for no reason other than someone said to, murder your own kind, find out your sister is a bitch, nothing seems to phase them.  No social growth, no change in character, nothing.\\n\\n\r\nJust get the Abingdon Boys School album and forget you ever heard of this failure.  Maybe get a wallpaper or two of Hei in that wicked mask, but that is the limit.",

            "content": "DtB: Kuro no Keiyakusha\r\nWhile watching DtB i was feeling that for some reason it was similar to something i saw but better and that something was Phantom:PFTR, even tho DtB came first as an anime the source material for Phantom existed way before and an OVA anime serie was released in 2004 which i didn't watch but the mask theme was there.\r\nStory\r\nThroughout the first fourteen eps. the formula that the anime followed was bi-episodic which i only like if they're really good, with DtB i can point out it was good, it didn't disappointed me but i would rather have episodes explaining a lot ofthing like what was the causing of the fake sky and the dual gates that appeared all of a sudden or why the contractors have to work for humans? do they die if not? because the, ''they're reasoning beings'' is not an answer and how people becomes Contractors and Dolls? and how is it that Lee/Hei got his powers from that other character? questions raised and no one to answer but despite all the questions unanswered the story was good and so were the bi-episodic ones with very good action.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe art style was good sometimes the drawing was out of quality but the animation on everything was very good so was the animation on the action scenes, always on point, so yeah it was very good, the mask design was like the ones from the anime Phantom:PFTR and the design for some characters were similar to a lot of characters from Phantom and Baccano! anyways the art was very good in general.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music is very good but sometimes i felt there was a song that didn't match with the situation, more than one song but i got used to it and there's a lot of songs that were great with the situations; The VA was great but Pai's voice was not believable she was like 10 and then a teen but she always had a 4 years old kid voice but she didn't appear much so it didn't ruined the anime;The first OP song was great, the 2nd one was good and the ED songs ok. Overall the Sound was very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are very good, the development for the important characters is noticeable from not liking Huang to like him after watching his background story and why he has that little hate for contractors and why he's bitter, the little background that Hei has but the development he has in every episode is good, Yin's back story was good the only one that has little to none is Mao only the why for being a cat also Kirihara Misaki has a little back story too.\\n\r\n-Lee/Hei is a contractor with emotions and no retribution (later explained why but inside that explanation is something unexplained) he eats a lot and people may think that's his retribution but he eats even when he doesn't use his powers, he meets a lot of girls that falls for him without Him wanting to. \\n\r\n-Yin is a doll capable to feel emotions because of Hei and because she appears little there's no much to write about her just that she has a back story.\\n\r\n-Huang may look like a douche but he will show his humanity and that he's not a bad person and will become a little likeable.\\n\r\n-Mao is a contractor, actually a cat that will bring comedy to the situations and sometimes save the situations.\\n\r\n-Kirihara Misaki is a detective that works to chase contractors that are a treat to the world and also is working on finding out the identity of The Syndicate and the contractors that works for them being those Huang's team.\\n\r\n-November Eleven is one of the characters that looks like from other animes, when i first saw him i thought i was seeing Ladd Russo from Baccano! is 100% identical even half of his personality is like his.\\n\r\n-Gai Kurasawa is a private detective who serves as a comedy relief and is acompanied by a pink haired girl Kiko; He's another character that is similar to another character from Baccano! the charismatic Isaac Dian, he has half Dian's personality is like watching him in the same goofy role but as a detective and not that charismatic, it was hard not to think of Isaac at that moment.\\n\r\n-Amber is another one that in the past looks similar to Drei from Phantom:RFTP but only in the flashbacks.\\n\r\nA lot more characters interesting and good characters like April, Wei Zhijun, Havoc /Carmine was interesting because who she was and little was known about her and what kind of powers she had and a lot of characters that were ok.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nVery good enjoyment considering this is a bi-episodic anime and the action scenes were enjoyable just as the music and the characters, it's a shame that there's a lot of unexplained things but what was there wasn't bad.",

            "content": "DTB reminds me a lot of Witch Hunter Robin. Both series feature people with supernatural abilities except in DTB they are called Contractors, and both are boring. The premise is boring enough. How many times do we have to see people with superpowers? But the biggest problem lies in the writing by trying to do too many things. A good writer hits two birds with one stone, a bad writer wants to hit ten birds with one stone and misses all of them. The series tries to show the lives of different contractors and how their Contracts affect them, at the same time it alsowants to blend in some government conspiracy. Hei's background and storyline (if he actually has any) also attempts to reflect a serious theme, that is don't hesitate in what you believe in. \\n\\n\r\nThe result? The series turns into a mess and fails to deliver any of them. A lot of times it even gives me this feeling that DTB is more about style than substance. I wasn't able to feel anything for most of the contractors. In the end my only conclusion about their lives is that contractors have feelings and that's it. The government conspiracy isn't very believable either. Hei's serious theme is just jokes because the only times I got to know his character are episode 1 when he said &quot;I hate Contractors&quot; and the final relevation in the last episode when I finally understood why he hates contractors.\\n\\n\r\nDTB has other issues too. It features these two detectives that serve no purposes to the story and are very very annoying. The music is at most decent and the two OPs are just average, although I do like ED2 by High and Mighty. The animation is good but nothing outstanding. I would only recommend DTB for its atmosphere if you are majoring in animation.\\n\\n\r\nPS Almost forgot. It also has some big plotholes like how did the contractors got their contracts and wth is the Hell's gate etc.",

            "content": "Darker Than BLACK is an anime which came to my attention as I was scouring through the works of the Studio Bones. Since I liked stuff from Bones I decided to give it a whirl and here I am. Let's Begin.\r\nStory \u2013 7.3\r\nThe story of DTB centres on the actions of Hei, our \u201cprotagonist\u201d and I use the word centres very loosely. This is because of the story telling narrative that DTB employs, as each arc is told from the perspective of usually someone other than our MC. Furthermore each arc is told over the course of 2 episodes rather than one, which allows forfar more character development and depth of storytelling within each arc. This is a unique feature and it works very effectively as it draws your further into this mysterious world. \\n\\n\r\nBut therein lies the problem; Most of it remains a mystery. Hardly anything is actually explained within the course of the anime which leaves the viewer without a sense of closure, which for an anime such as this one, is key. This feeling of dissociation can reduce the immersion and therefore reduce the enjoyment one can get from this anime. However these negatives are outweighed by the interesting premise and the unique execution of story-telling narrative of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 9.2\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for DTB was done by Studio Bones and like most of their mid-2000s stuff is of a high quality. The movement is fluid, the character designs are detailed and I can\u2019t seem to remember any point where there was a drop in animation quality. The background too is very interesting as it uses a colour pallet which creates both an aura of darkness but, more importantly, it alludes to the idea that there is a great deal that we don\u2019t know about this universe and all that it entails. However the quality of the action sequences would\u2019ve sold the whole anime to me without anything else. Each one is brilliantly executed with such style that I found it hard not to just sit back and admire it. Also the character designs were all very interesting as they reflected the type of character that each person was. Overall the animation is brilliant with the quintessential style that Bones can bring to the table.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 8.65 (OST \u2013 9.2 and VA \u2013 8.1)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for this anime is absolutely brilliant. It is both able to capture the mood of the scene when necessary but also be able to reduce the dark nature of some scenes too and show it in a new light. The perfect examples are some of the chase scenes where zany music is played and, contrary to initial thought, it works to a tee as it makes the chase feel more exciting. On the whole it is an excellent soundtrack with memorable pieces dotted about here and there. Also a special mention to the first opening, TM Revolution I love your voice.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very good throughout the anime and the voice actors deliver lines brilliantly at times. However the problem that arises with this dub is the script itself and even with the actors\u2019 best efforts it still shows some weaknesses here and there. Overall it\u2019s a very good dub which is very occasionally let down by some flaws in the script.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 8.0\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in DTB are a key reason for why the deep, dark nature of the anime never became overwhelming.  There was a massive pallet of Characters within this show and allow for the different personalities to shine in their own given moments. This could vary from down to Earth and very human to superbly eccentric and out there. This variety allowed for the anime to never become stale. I also really enjoyed the fact that there was never a main antagonist of sorts, which allowed for clashes of ideals to occur rather than a fight between good and evil. This factor also added to the dark nature of the anime as our \u201cprotagonists\u201d were never pure at nature and did delve into some morally questionable activities.\\n\\n\r\nHowever I did feel there were certain things that could have been executed better. For example most of the character development was left until the latter stages of the anime to occur. This did cause me to become a little disinterested with the characters and their actions. Furthermore some of the characters did feel as if they were surplus to necessity. On the whole it was good cast of characters portrayed in interesting ways and moral dilemmas which develop the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 8.2\\n\\n\r\nI really did enjoy watching this series and it had a brilliant blend of action and exposition. Though the lack of explanation of some finer details and the delay character development did irk me a bit it never detracted massively from the action and the unique story-telling narrative. Overall it was highly enjoyable series to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 8.27\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole this was a very good anime to watch. It excelled in the OST and Art departments being highly stylish in both whilst creating a good plot, albeit a little thin at times, and solid cast of varied and vibrant characters. I would recommend this anime to anyone who is a fan of Studio Bones and/or a fan of action.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that you found the review helpful and any feedback would be greatly appreciated =D\\n",

            "content": "This series may not be appropriate for everyone. It doesn&rsquo;t contain the most gore, nor the most violence in a story, nor the most amount of dialogue. However, the convolution and supernatural aspects of this series are bound to confuse some people, but if you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;ll find it enjoyable.\r\nStory (or otherwise the convoluted background you need to understand)\r\nTen years ago, an inscrutable and abnormal territory known as Hell&rsquo;s Gate appeared in Tokyo and altered the sky and decimated the landscape. The heavenly bodies disappeared, replaced by false stars. During this time, people who possess various special abilities emerged. Kept secret from the knowledgeof the masses, these individuals, known as Contractors, are able to murder in cold blood. Various nations around the world use Contractors as spies and agents, often resulting in violent battles for information. Each fake star has a corresponding contractor, and they vibrate when their contractor&rsquo;s power is being used. As such, contractors are usually identified by their star&rsquo;s Messier catalogue number. However, their abilities are gained at the edge of their humanity. They lack human emotions, especially aversion to killing. Contractors usually work for one of various rival Syndicates as spies and assassins, although the ultimate purpose of the Syndicates is initially unknown. (wikipedia) This is basically the background you need to start out with to understand the premise of Darker than BLACK. The series opens with the protagonist, Hei an elite contractor with the Messier code BK-201 and the plot begins to unravel the mysteries surrounding the abnormalities of Hei and his search for his sister Pai, that then pulls in the past that seems to be horrifying and bleak.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nGreat animation is what I&rsquo;ll say for this series. It&rsquo;s good for the series, perhaps not the best, but still really entertaining. I&rsquo;ll say its very good for its genre and you&rsquo;ll find it satisfying to watch. The action scenes are fluidly animated and overall animation is not bad at all. The setting painted by the colors are right for the mood, dark at times, contrasting with the aptly placed humor at others. You wont find a problem with this series in terms of art, though I have to say some scenes maybe one or two seemed like it was cheaply done&hellip;.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nAlright, we&rsquo;re down to the most redeeming aspect of this series. *Takes a deep breath*. For a sci-fi series that I&rsquo;ve seen, this has some of the best character development you&rsquo;ll ever see; each character really except for some has an incredibly detailed and intriguing back story that doesn&rsquo;t detract at all from the overall enjoyment of the main plot. Taking into consideration the mood of the series, the backstories of often grim, realistic, and oftentimes tragic. I&rsquo;ll say this; lots of people die. The protagonist, Hei, or his alter persona (the alias he uses when not on missions) Li Shengshun is a fascinating case of character study. Very little is revealed about him in the beginning and you begin to wonder if he&rsquo;s just another one of those silent dominating protagonists. Then very soon, you&rsquo;re brought into his alias, the gentle, clumsy Chinese transfer student Li Shengshun who has an enormous appetite yet is still thin. Character interaction for the most part aren&rsquo;t as illuminating or enjoyable as series like Spice and Wolf, where the essence of it is the dialogue, but what makes Darker than BLACK an unique series is each character&rsquo;s backstory. From Hei&rsquo;s troubled past and the mysteries surrounding his sister and his lover in the South American disaster, to Yin&rsquo;s equally bleak past, to Huang&rsquo;s unbelievably bitter past history; each backstory has relevance to the main plot and provides considerable food for thought on their actions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nHow do I put this. At first I put this on hold due to the beginning not quite drawing me in. However after a while I returned, and quickly became fascinated by its intriguing storyline. Darker than BLACk is a plot driven series, so much, that I didn&rsquo;t really care about anything else when I watched it. So will you, when you see it, of the betrayal, irony, friendship, love, and political machinations. Such is the value of Darker than BLACK.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 9/10.",

            "content": "SPOILER-FREE\u2122\r\nPreface: I became extremely inebriated the night I decided to write my review of the Darker than Black franchise. While I admit this isn't my best writing ever (actually it's some of my worst), Darker than Black was one of the worse anime I've seen so it seems fitting. Yes it's going to be one of those reviews.  This is intended to cover the entire franchise, meaning this review applies to every anime with \"Darker than Black\" in the title.\r\nSo let me tell you a story about the other day. Actually it was longer than that ago I think, whatever it\u2019s a story. SoI\u2019m hanging out with this girl, just me and her. It wasn't a date or anything, our relationship was completely platonic at the time. Nowadays I would describe our relationship more as \u201cnonexistent\u201d than \u201cplatonic\u201d but that\u2019s an unrelated point, probably.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways she\u2019s an artist or some shit, in the art club at college at least, one of those go-getter types good at everything you know? She gets to talking about some art exhibition that just opened that she wants to go to, maybe she should go with a friend or something (nudge nudge wink wink). Just like I always do, I fumbled that shit like Eustace, that fat kid from your gym class in school, fumbled the football thrown at his nuts by Cliff, the 7th grader who\u2019s identical to Tim Tebow in every way except his religious fervor is more likely directed toward the King of the Bottomless Pit than Jeebus. You probably laughed your ass you little shit, you\u2019re going to hell, where Cliff will be a ruler and violate your every orifice with a spiked dildo (no homo man, no homo).\\n\\n\r\nWhere was I? Oh yeah, I hardly could have handled the situation worse, it was one of those situations where I might as well have been juggling gas jugs and torches but couldn't think of anything but that itch on my ass. I basically acted exactly like the densest harem protagonist imaginable with a lot less charisma and a lot more anxiety issues. My verbatim response is kept in one of those memory centers that the booze hits first but suffice to say: it was something along the lines of:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cy-y-you too *mumble*\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis highlights a dire point in my personal life in that I can\u2019t handle women for shit. I mean damn, I\u2019m more than halfway through college and I just got over panic attacks when I form words directed in an angle more acute than 70\u00b0 from a vagina, or was it obtuse? I\u2019m a goddamn business student I can\u2019t do math. Or girls come to think of it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does all this have to do with Darker than Black, an anime made by the great (snicker) studio Bones in the Year of our Bush 0006? Well just thinking about this story makes me embarrassed, angry and depressed, exactly the same emotions I have when I recall watching Darker than Black.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 2/10\\n\\n\r\nDid you know that in some parts of South America it\u2019s totally normal for men to have sex with donkeys? I\u2019m not making this up, there's a documentary on YouTube.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d love to draw an analogy between these people and fans of this show, but no matter how I wrack my brain I simply can\u2019t come up with any relation between being a zoophile and being a liar. The reason I say fans of DtB (Darker than Black) are liars is not because of the erroneous statement that this anime is the greatest thing since Death Note, although that argument could be made. The far more erroneous statement they will make is that the first and second seasons of BtDF (Black to the Darker Future) are COMPLETELY different and although the first season was AWESOME you can\u2019t POSSIBLY rate the second season the same. Well I\u2019m here to tell you they\u2019re definitely shoving it in a mule\u2019s pu-I mean they\u2019re wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway here\u2019s the plot in a nutshell: There\u2019s this guy named Pedro and he has sex with a donkey. I mean a mysterious event happens on earth where two \u201cgates\u201d (which are never properly explained or shown on screen, like a lot of this anime\u2019s lore but ONE OF THEM WAS IN SOUTH AMERICA) open and lots of people lose their emotions, gain superpowers and their progress can be tracked by fake stars which have replaced the real night sky. You would think that NASA and such would notice if giant balls of plasma were switched with holes poked in a giant black tarp but then again you miss a lot of stuff when you\u2019re having sex with a donkey.\\n\\n\r\nScratch that. I\u2019m not about to totally begrudge a series with some inconsistent backstory, what really matters is the characters, plot, donkey loving, etc. The \u201cdonkey loving\u201d was just a metaphor by the way. Both seasons are the same: largely unrelated \u201caction\u201d and \u201cdrama\u201d lead up to an incomprehensible ending. I don\u2019t know what the author was going for: Evangelion-esque, a post-modern approach to consistency or maybe just screwing a donkey. By which I mean I feel like it was just supposed to leave a lot to the imagination.\\n\\n\r\nThe goal here is to create a thriller balanced between the necessarily-authoritarian state and rebels just trying to find a place in this world. More often though it just winds up being one of Hei\u2019s knives trying to find a place in the chest of one of many of a cast of almost interesting side characters.\\n\\n\r\nA lot is presented in the story, but very little is solved. The plot of this anime was tangled, barely linear, and left a lot of loose ends. Lots of sub-plots are raised, and then dropped, none of the lore is explored to any comprehensible depth, and in the end very little if anything is resolved. For example: what exactly caused this situation? How did this world change the way it did? What made the characters the emotionless blobs they are, other than a plot device? More specifically I think Hei\u2019s powers relate to his time in South America. Maybe if you have sex with a donkey you could shoot lightning out your fingers, try it.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION 4/10\\n\\n\r\nDesperation can drive a man to great lengths, I should know. But never mind that, religion can drive a man to lengths reasonable men could only dream of. I\u2019m not trying to be a militant atheist or anything, far be it from me to criticize all religion. But anime reviews are meant to inform, so I feel I should make you a little smarter. I\u2019m sure you already know about Mormons and Scientologists so I\u2019m going to focus on Orthodox Jews, bear with me I\u2019m going somewhere with this.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway ultra-Orthodox Jews do some crazy stuff: like the hats and the meat and not pressing buttons on Saturday. But did you know that some will wear plastic bags on airplanes?\\n\\n\r\nApparently the rationale is that they can\u2019t pass over a graveyard so the plastic bag is to keep them pure just in case. I wonder what the altitude limit on that is, the era of space travel is going to be hilarious if religion survives that long. What\u2019s more, some sects will practice circumcision in a prehistoric way. They will cut off the foreskin without anesthesia and then (supposedly to prevent infection) suck, and not even I\u2019m creative enough to make this up, ON THE BABY\u2019S PENIS, THERE ARE OLD MEN OUT THERE GIVING HUMMERS TO 7-DAY-OLDS. That is absolutely disgusting, just like the animation of Darker than my Soul, I mean Darker than Black.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is (now) 7 years old so I don\u2019t mean to criticize by the same standards that I might apply today, but seriously it would be sub-par even 7 years before that. The production values of this show are low, to say the least. It is seriously unimpressive and to be honest I think even the poorest studios should at least include a few moments where they try to impress us. But hashed CG, still frames and lazy design are just the tip of the iceberg of an anime more than 40 episodes with not even one decent scene. Even in action, where most studios dump their money, there was really nothing to see here. Bones may not be on the same level as a Shaft or Gainax but they must have really hit a tough patch in 2007 and 2009 respectively.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMaybe my problem is that I\u2019m a weeaboo. I mean I\u2019m drinking sake in Japan, writing an anime review. Maybe if I gave up my childish habits I could get a girlfriend, and get in shape, and make lots of money, and get back on topic.\\n\\n\r\nI have to offer Browner than-nah that\u2019s an old joke I\u2019ll spare you.\\n\\n\r\nI have to offer Darker than Black something that may seem like praise but I\u2019m afraid is actually a criticism: the sound is the best part. The sound track wasn\u2019t anything special but it earns a passing grade, as do the OPs, EDs and Voice Actors.\\n\\n\r\nWhat pushes the sound over the edge to \u201cgood\u201d is the voices, more specifically Yin\u2019s, more specifically when she says \u201cHei.\u201d She\u2019s got a throaty rasp that makes me gajizzle in my pazzizles every time.\\n\\n\r\nDamn you\u2019re lucky that this review is more important to me than fapping right now.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 3/10\\n\\n\r\nHei\u2019s role in Darker than Black and my role in this review have one striking similarity: about 2/3 the way through we both started drinking directly from the bottle.\\n\\n\r\nHei is your typical character that the author clearly wrote himself into.  Not that I\u2019m denying fantasies, myself having never aged past 6, sometimes I let my imagination run wild and become a superhero or a spy in my mind, god I\u2019m such a loser. Anyways this can be fun but if you write fiction it makes for a weak character. Hei is an empty suit in truest sense of the term, well more of an empty scientifically-impossible-bulletproof-yet-flexible-trenchcoat. I\u2019d like to call him a Mary Sue, but he\u2019s such a non-existent personality that I can\u2019t even bestow that dubious title. There is a plot device to weakly explain away other character\u2019s lack of emotion, but Hei just has nothing. Word of the day is: vacuous, vac\u00b7u\u00b7ous (Adj) def: Hei.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first season, our primary secondary (ha) character is Yin, who is a \u201cdoll.\u201d In the Darker than Black universe a \u201cdoll\u201d is\u2026actually never fully explained but it means people treat her like a porcupine made of polonium. The other aspect of being a doll is having \u201cno emotion.\u201d Now there is some attempt to write in \u201cemotion\u201d into Yin\u2019s character by having her fall for Hei and having a disjointed personality. But considering this is reflected in Hei\u2019s own lack of depth it really goes nowhere other than somewhere nonsensical, I think. She\u2019s a Rei clone, and a pretty lousy one at that, just like I\u2019m a pretty lousy clone of a version of myself who\u2019s a lot cooler and better than me. I hope this paragraph makes sense to someone other than drunk me.\\n\\n\r\nYin is boring with no meaningful characterization.\\n\\n\r\nShion replaces Yin. Shion starts with an incredibly erratic personality, but after an episode or two a plot device steals her interesting points and molds her into another Rei clone; this time with a Barrett coming out from between her prepubescent breasts, for fan-service for people like you, you sick fuck.\\n\\n\r\nNow there are plenty of other characters from Mao to Amber to Kiko. They mainly serve to provide \u201ccomic relief\u201d or to confuse the plot even further. A few of them get decent characterization but don\u2019t worry it will all be unraveled by the bizarreness of the endings.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and say you probably play video games. Who am I kidding, if you watch any anime you almost certainly play video games (and if you\u2019re considering this crappy shit you definitely do). Think back to a below average game. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve played many bad games, some too bad to keep you for long. But there has probably been one that really wasn\u2019t good at all. When you look back you can\u2019t but acknowledge it was not really to your taste at all, an addictive flash game or an MMORPG for example (any MMORPG, they\u2019re all the same). You can\u2019t say you really enjoyed it but when you look back at the play time it\u2019s like 300 hours or something.\\n\\n\r\nYou know the feeling, you never had much fun, but you just kept going in an odd form of absorption in the game. That\u2019s what happened to me with Give Her the D(tB). If I was being completely objective I would have dropped it fast and never come back. But somehow I just kept watching the next episode. I wasn\u2019t interested in the story or the characters or anything, I just kept going. I don\u2019t really know why, I just kept going.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nThey say that if you shoot for the moon at least if you miss you\u2019ll land among the stars. Darker than Black shot for the moon, but landed in a hedge. That\u2019s what happens with them fake stars you know.\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black reminds me of a Republican candidate. It is confused, contradictory and has a poor grasp on science. And it isn\u2019t nearly as intelligent as it thinks it is. There are a lot of fans, but you really aren\u2019t sure who they are. These fans say the message got diluted over time but it\u2019s hard to see how it\u2019s different at all.\\n\\n\r\nI was let down seriously by this anime. Usually when an anime is super popular it\u2019s awful, and some of the not popular ones run the gamut. In between we have the territory of Durarara, Death Note, Code Geass, Darker than Black and their ilk. I\u2019ve gotten used to such anime usually being bad but also usually having something going for them. DtB; however, was a thorough displeasure, no matter what its fans say.\\n\\n\r\nFuck you, Fuck me, Fuck this anime, Fuck everything.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nDarker Than Black, despite the hilariously emo sounding title, is a series that came to me highly recommended. Like the title suggests, it tells a story with a very dark tone, brooding characters, and is not exactly a jovial \"slice of life\" series. Does being so dark make it actually good? I will try to explain\r\nPlot: 5/10\r\nSpoilers!!!\r\nThe plot is that 2 inter-dimensional gates have appeared on Earth for reasons that are never explained and all of the stars in the sky have disappeared and have been replaced with fake stars. The reason for this is also never explained, but each fake star represents a powerfulmagic user that can perform amazing feats, but must \"pay a price\" every time they use their powers. This price is performing a certain deed that could be anything from hopping 3 times on one foot to breaking a bone, to eating a certain food. There is no rhyme or reason to each user's contract. Magic users are also all sociopathic for reasons that are never explained and only act in rational self interest. Basically the world is now filled with wizard Ayn Rand's suffering from extreme OCD. A war was apparently fought over one of these dimentional gates, but the details are never given as to how the war started, why it was fought, or how it ended the status of the US as a world power despite the war taking place in Brazil. What we do know is that the US is now run by the Chinese Triad gang...for reasons that are never explained. Are you seeing a pattern here? Darker than Black has cool ideas, but never actually fleshes them out and virtually EVERYTHING goes completely unexplained. You just have to accept really ridiculous shit and move on. This wasn't intended to be a highbrow art film, yet fucking Eraserhead explains more about the plot and background than Darker Than Black. There is a way to let the audience fill in details and correctly do what Darker than Black tried to do. The videogame Dark Souls explains very little in terms of plot, but has an extensive lore that allows players to slowly piece together the details and make theories. The writer of Dark Souls said he was inspired by reading Western Fantasy books during his early youth when he couldn't really read English and could only grasp a fragment of the plot. With only a partial understanding of what was going on, he had to fill in the rest with his imagination. The difference between Dark Souls and Darker Than Black is that Dark Souls at least gives clues in the form of extensive lore. In Darker Than Black, the writing is so lazy that even the dedicated fan wikias don't have fan theories as to how the fuck most events happened or what the fuck is going on. Perhaps Darker Than Black referred not to the series tone, but to the clarity of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black is largely episodic, so characters are introduced and abandoned every couple episodes. The only character that really gets development is Hei, who is basically Chinese Batman. Hei is a cool character, but not a great enough character to carry the entire show. He isn't really that unique, amazingly badass, or THAT interesting at a character psychology level. Like most other aspects of this show, the characters are fine, but not great.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are both pretty good in this series. This is a modern production with a big budget, so you would expect them to execute well in this area. I was not disappointed. Although I am glad the writer/director of the series wasn't in charge of art. Otherwise half the screen would be covered with a black bar and we the audience would have to guess what is going on in the left half of the screen during every episode without any answers ever being given or even hinted at. What is going on over there? Who the fuck knows? I don't need to explain shit!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever wondered what it would be like if David Lynch directed HBO's series Heroes? That is pretty much EXACTLY what this is. A version of Heroes that rapes your mind and nothing is ever fucking explained...EVER.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nObscurity in art can be valuable. When the author holds the hand of the audience and explains every last detail, it eliminates healthy, intellectual discussion and interpretation. We wouldn't still be debating TS Elliot's 4 Quartets if Elliot left behind a Cliff Notes that explains everything he meant. On the other hand, just leaving out details and not explaining anything in your plot doesn't automatically make your work good. In fact, without leaving any clues that even give hints as to the explanations of key plot points, it could be viewed as lazy and utterly pretentious writing. However, I will point out that Darker Than Black does do a few things well. It is a technically well made series with a decent main character, cool atmosphere, and some unique ideas. It had the daring to try something different, even if it could have been executed far better. It isn't a great series, but it certainly isn't a bad one.",

You have no clue what Hell's gate is, or where it came from. You have no clue who that old lady is doing the taboo reading with the stars, they dont explain who she is, or what she is talking about.\r\nYou have no clue who or what the\"syndicate is\".\\n\\n\r\nI dont think I could reveal the plot if i tried because I dont know what is going on.\\n\r\nPretty much \"contractors\" are people that look, talk, act, heck even used to be humans that have some form of a power and someone wants to kill them all off, because they are killers? Even though they only kill for the most part unless instructed by some higher up suits to do dirty work?\\n\\n\r\nTrust me, if that doesn't make sense, it is because it isn't supposed to. The crazy thing is the end goal is erase all contractors, you often find contractors fighting each other, not really quite sure what they are fighting for other than to fight or because they were told to.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is awful, and season 2 was somehow worse despite knowing at LEAST something that is going on. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights were extremely lousy, usually ending in 40-50 seconds or less. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend it to a friend.",

            "content": "\"If you pretend to feel a certain way, the feeling can become genuine all by accident.\"\r\n-Hei \r\nDarker than Black is an action-packed anime featuring quite a few unique and aspiring concepts.  Some are done well, while others fall short of expectations or are entirely unexplained.  Sometimes in animes you have to accept the unexplainable, but when it such an important part of the plot, it can leave a bad taste in your mouth\u2026 or make you feel unfulfilled.  There are numerous highly positive reviews of Darker than Black, and while the show is not bad, some of its weaknesses need to beaddressed.  Try to keep an open mind as you read my review.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show has many positives, so I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m ripping it apart.  It\u2019s an anime that you will be instantly gripped by, or one that will make your mind meander due to the structure of its pacing and various loose ends.  Contractors are one of the most interesting concepts I\u2019ve encountered in an anime.  Certain humans in this futuristic world exhibit special powers at the price of performing an action serving as their contract\u2019s terms, or remuneration.  The catch is, this is NEVER fully explained in the anime.  Who made the contracts?  Were they forced to sign them?  Why is the sky fake, and what do the stars have to do with contractors?  At least give me a hint as the viewer, and not chock it up to PFM (Pure Effing Magic ).  I feel like the series fell short of greatness due to the sheer amount of unexplained plot points.  \\n\\n\r\nHei is a fantastic lead protagonist, quiet and justified in nature.  He is not technically a contractor making him more intriguing, and he easily possesses the most character development of any other main in the series.  The writers do a decent job of not focusing on him 100% of the time as well\u2026 although, some could say this led to the first 8-10 episodes feeling quite episodic in nature.  They would introduce a character, I\u2019d wonder how they would impact the plot, and they\u2019d be dead or cast to the wayside before the ending theme played.  It reminded me a bit of the character attachment problem \u201cAttack on Titan\u201d also suffers from.  Here\u2019s a new character, here\u2019s their background, you like them?  Well BAM, they\u2019re dead now.  On to the next episode! You could take an alternate approach to this blemish however.  Seeing the background to the contractors themselves, and how different each of their remunerations were (most notably the rotund woman who belted catastrophic sounds and her choking remuneration), can help you relate to them better.  It\u2019s all in how you perceive it.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the Hei\u2019s syndicate group is written in well, I really enjoyed Huang and Mao the most of all the characters, even though you never really take a step back into Mao\u2019s past.  A few of the characters were almost entirely unnecessary however.  The intelligence agent, Misaki Kirihara served as nothing more than an unfulfilled love interest for Hei, and her uncovering of the syndicate\u2019s involvement with contractors could\u2019ve been accomplished in another way.  The private eye team of Gai Kurasawa and Kiko Kayanuma were completely pointless, serving only as a comic relief trope.  Their episodes felt mostly like fillers, and may have only existed to expand the 25 episodes.  Maybe that\u2019s just me. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending seemed to blast into a screeching halt with Darker than Black.  Once inside the gate, interactions between Hei and the rest of the cast defied all logic, somewhat as expected.  But once the curtain was lifted on the story\u2019s final result, I found myself saying, \u201creally, that was it?\u201d  I wasn\u2019t stricken by the plot or the dark atmosphere portrayed in the series enough to feel a sense of fulfillment at its conclusion.  It was semi-disappointing, and I was partially hoping for a blow-your-mind style ending due to the widely positive opinions of the show\u2026 it just didn\u2019t come for me.\\n\\n\r\n This type of animation is my favorite, the early to mid 2000\u2019s with life-like character models that aren\u2019t over-exaggerated in any way.  The action scenes were laid out quite well, although I wished they put more of them in the show.  Most of the fight scenes were rather short or entirely one-sided.  The overall aura of the anime was illustrated well in the environments, and I liked how the inside of the gate was drawn.  Voice acting was average, with Hei again taking the cake.  The way his voice would change based on which side of himself he was playing was exciting to watch.  The OP were both strong and gave me an \u201con the edge of my seat\u201d feel coming into each episode, whereas the ED concluded with a somber ballad.  The OST did an amazing job of heightening the suspense at the appropriate time, and I really enjoyed the dramatic string track that played in the most intense moments of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Darker than Black is an anime you\u2019ll love or hate depending on your opinion of the first few episodes.  I wasn\u2019t necessarily hooked from the get-go, but I did hold on to discover the many mysteries the plot had lying beneath.  Not all the mysteries were answered, but the story trudged onward.  I did enjoy many elements of the anime, but I don\u2019t feel that it lived up to the hype for me.  Thank you for reading!",

            "content": "In short, this anime is where the minority must do what they have to in order to survive-it's kill or be killed. \r\nAfter mysterious gates have appeared on Earth, beings known as Contractors and Dolls appear. Contractors are humans who have lost all their reasoning and gain special powers; each time they use their powers they must pay a 'price'-anything from singing a song to smoking to throwing up. Dolls are humans who have lost all emotions and can send out 'spectors' through certain objects (such as glass, water, metal) to find and track people. Most Contractors and Dolls do the dirty work for otherpeople or organizations- infiltration, spying, killing- doing anything to survive in the same world that hates them. \\n\\n\r\nHei is a Contractor who works for the Syndicate, along with a Doll, Yin, another Contractor, Mao, and a human, Huang. Together they do the dirty bidding of the Syndicate, while Hei also searching for his lost sister. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime may not be everyone's cup of tea. It is fairly serious, action directed and starts off basically episodic, as the arcs last 2 episodes long. However in the end, Darker than Black made me very contemplative, about what it means to be human and what justice really is. About how in the large scheme of things, life will continue to go on as if nothing has happened and even if one does something great for the overall population, few will notice. \\n\\n\r\nFor about a third of the season, it is episodic, and while interesting and entertaining to watch, doesn't seem to do much towards plot. But as the anime goes on and the story gets thicker and more details are revealed, you realize that the episodic nature was necessary in order to establish the character of Hei and to introduce the other characters. Also, it helps demonstrate the condition and environment that Contractors and Dolls must live in. Once the initial introductions are complete, the plot becomes much more advanced as you learn people's motives and the arcs tie into one another. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I found most interesting is how the characters evolved, and that is because throughout the anime I didn't really notice that they were changing. It wasn't until the last episode when everything tied together, that I realized this. I was also surprised how much I liked Hei. Hei is supposed to be the bad guy. He kills innocent people, but you end up feeling empathetic for him. He cares about his friends (which is unnatural for a Contractor) and when he is under his alias Lee, he actually is a good guy. \\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black is a great anime that is paced differently and some may like that and others may not. Once started, I think it has to be finished in order to understand the plot, characters and to experience it properly. It isn't until the end that everything makes completely sense. All in all, I'm really glad that I ended up watching this anime.",

I really enjoyed watching it and I fell in love with the characters. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story takes place in our everyday world\u2014the only difference is that two gigantic \u2018gates\u2019 have appeared on Earth, all the stars in the sky are unreal and there are human beings with supernatural powers called \u201cContractors\u201d. This season of DTB mainly focuses on Hei\u2014a young man who identifies himself as a Contractor but displays the characteristics of an average human. The first few episodes are about theadventurous missions that Hei and his team complete. The story is actually pretty fun and exciting to watch. The pacing isn\u2019t perfect though\u2014I feel like some of the scenes would\u2019ve been more interesting if it was fast-paced. The last few episodes give us a glimpse into Hei\u2019s past and we begin to see the formation of a plot. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was very good. The backgrounds were breath-taking and most of the character designs really did match each characters\u2019 personalities. The only character whose design I didn\u2019t particularly like was Kirihara\u2019s\u2014but that\u2019s just my opinion. I also liked how the difference between \u201cHei the Contractor\u2019s expressions\u201d and \u201cHei the average student and part-timer\u2019s expressions\u201d were highlighted.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of DTB was amazing and it really did a lot to enhance my experience watching this anime. The voice actors did a great job in embracing their characters and each character could be identified by their voice alone (this was especially helpful in the case of Mao). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nEach of the characters were unique and they all had their flaws and strengths. Kirihara, hard-working and justice oriented; Amber, smart, positive\u2026 and somewhat insane; Yin, strange and melancholy yet so lovable; Gai the goofy detective and his cosplaying, money-loving sidekick Kiko; Hei, dark, mysterious\u2026 and always hungry; Mao, wise but and self-preserving; Huang, the man with a lot of tough love; and so on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime was like a roller-coaster ride for me and I think most people would find it enjoyable. There are some deep and tense scenes but there\u2019s also lots of comedy. I wouldn\u2019t watch this anime for the romance but there are definitely some notable ships. All in all, this anime is, in my opinion, very enjoyable as it gives you that feeling of wanting to see more.\\n",

Because You'd understand this review better than understanding where babies come from.\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nWhere in this near future world like its 2020 or something, two massive gates appeared out of nowhere, and for some reason, the birth of humans known as \u201cContractors\u201d have appeared out of nowhere because they have contacted a contract, with something... (the plot is a confusing mess) It tries to have some level of different story telling as the camera zooms in through different characters forus to give a shaft about. \\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\n Kicking of with this review, lets start with \u201cHei\u201d our protagonist. Really, he doesn\u2019t get barely to no development at all because of BONES couldn\u2019t even have the brains to come up with a logical plot, they couldn't even make logical characters! There is LITERALLY NOTHING to him, he has like no personality other than looking emo and reacting to situations in a less naturally humane manner. He's just some over powered assassin who has no personality except for a few quirks like the amount of food he eats per minute, and no, very small character quirks and being completely OP does not equal character depth, overall personality or development of such character(s). This indicates that if Hei has no humane trait that will create depth and is just left there as a ruthless killer with bare motives and the vaguest excuse for a flip back story, then this makes him some sort of pseudo one dimensional character that has half the complexity of a talitubby! Sure, seeing him doing different things will equal depth like how he was supposed to assassinate this red head, but instead saves her, but because Hei's motives are so dimmly expained, it builds no complexity, tension or sympathy if he meets such character we don't even know about! \\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s my biggest issue with 95% of the cast, they are often defined by one or two traits and don't even lack a half-cut motive of there actions and personality! Most don't tend to show no care or empathy for others and colleagues. This makes everything feel unnatural, without depth, tensionless, and a failed attempt for basic methods on how to make three dimensional characters. Too many of the contractors (who are the vast majority of the side characters) run in the same category, and tends to feel as if the writers were trying to put more effort into making the powers look cool to somehow create such humanely complex traits, but again, cool super powers are more of an aesthetic plot device to excuse the fact that there are cooler fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThere is again, the occasional good character(s) that fill a small unit percentage of the entire cast, but it all pales down to a very lazy written cast that is only excuse was to show how \u201cCool\u201d there powers were. (or make them more emo if they don't have powers) Speaking of trying to look emo, when I said that there were a small amount of good characters, all of those characters are human. (not all humans) but if where trying to talk about a world when there seems to be a higher being of humans going out of control because of the original human race, You expect something much deeper and thought provoking than a bunch of lousy writers saying \u201cOOOOOH LOOK AT THIS COOL SUPER POWERS!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIf Bones Company don't have the logical senses to make a plot that doesn\u2019t confuse the heck out of You, then this show is also just as confusing as knowing the difference between a mouse and a mouse. There is far too much horribly place pieces of foreshadowing, they don't clearly explain things but makes it so unclear that it drives You into confusion, and at the end of it all its just a big mess. At first, the show runs in simple arcs that last about a few episodes, but as soon as the writing team decided to put all of these smaller stories into one large arc that was meant to put all of these little pieces altogether into a decent conclusion, they started throwing plot holes that don't go anywhere, characters who don't go anywhere and the whole story collapses into itself as a confusingly jumbled mess!\\n\\n\r\nAnd soon enough, You forget about it... BTW: No one develops.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the fight scenes look pretty damn cool, the budget remains very consistent and above average all the way through. Action scenes have a sense of fluidity, a lack of cheap chibi scenes to create forced comedic scenes, creates an illusion that there is a lower level of realism and maturity. The designs of the characters are all memorable in some way in their own right, with each one having very recognisable designs without being too flashy, and they all have this very fine finish. You can clearly tell the effort the animators have put out on this project. Which is the biggest redeeming factor about bones.\\n\\n\r\nMusical scores are simply great, there is such a large variety of memorably great tunes, and the opening gets me damn Hyped to see the next episode, what I really love about this OST, is just the amazing variety that has been put in the style and instruments while still having this really snazzy jazz-like feel. They really do portray the emotions greatly, and serves an impact if You listen to them alone.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nI really do think that this Anime is usually going to be remembered for its visuals and music really. Sure, these are very shiny gold keys, but the door that You unlock with is a little boys room in absolute shambles and fire! I too, back when I was a tasteless casual never understood why this show was so great to begin with when I finished watching it, and this review were still these thoughts of the show. But now that I have grew smarter My knowledge of what\u2019s good storytelling grew, and hopefuly, and slowly, the more Anime fans expand to such hierarchy of knowledge about there mediums way of writing, a story, the better they can tell the difference of a shiny mess, and what\u2019s actually considered to be on par with Legend of the Galactic Heroes!\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n2/10 \u2013 BONES CANNOT MAKE A PLOT THAT MAKES SENSE AT TIMES! DEAL WITH IT!\\n\r\n3/10 \u2013 Characters lack depth, a few good pieces of writing, but nothing much there any ways.\\n\r\n7.5/10 \u2013 Bones Animation is great. Period.\\n\r\n8/10 \u2013 Give. Me. That. Jazz.\\n\r\n3.5/10 \u2013 For an absolute shamble of writing. This makes the show enjoyable due to anyone not caring, and spamming the confusion attack. But brace Your self for some great action and music.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 4/10 \u2013 Sure its a mess, but its flashy and doesn\u2019t leave You too annoyed like Tokyo Ghoul. Oh wait.",

This anime particularly focus' on a man with electric power and his journey to find out what happened on the 30th February 1969 and where his sister mysteriously disappeared to after that day.\r\nThe story does seem quite intriguing however the anime does not tell it well. This is because, since he works for CSI, most of the time, you just see him going on random missions killing other contractors with his happy-go-lucky band.\r\nThe anime is somewhat old so the art style my notbe to everyone's liking.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not too much music from what I can tell other than during the opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters have quite a fleshed backstory to them and you learn a lot about each of the member's of his group.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are what most come for (I came for the romance and was left in tears by the end), and they are definitely worth watching. They aren't too long and most fights are done so creatively that the fights don't become repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I am pretty satisfied with the romance and all so I give this anime a 7.69/10, which coincidentally rounds up to 8/10",

            "content": "Darker than Black is one of those popular series I find hard to like. By no means I find it a lousy show, but despite the number of praises the series received, I can't seem to find myself really enjoying the show. I've finished watching this series ages ago, but I could only find so little to write about. Hence the review the delayed until now.\r\nLet's start with the stuff that I really do appreciate. The songs are awesome; the animation remain high quality and consistent; the writing and pacing is solid; and the character's roles are well played and developed through the course ofthe series.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the problem: I find it really hard to relate to any of the characters, and actually liking them. I guess the most likable guy for me would be Huang, for being more humane, thoughtful and mature than most of the other cast. I feel that most of them either too one-dimensional (the main characters, mostly) or developed too late in the series for me to care about them (the key characters late in the story).\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, as it turns out, it actually incredibly simple, because most if it turns out to be needlessly complicating. Why keep feeding us bit of information about the events of the Hell's gate and Heaven's gate when what we really want to know is our main character's motives, background and relation to the other main characters? I mean sure, he's pretty cool and had an awesome fighting style, but that itself doesn't make him stand out amongst other anime protagonists without the story, which comes almost too late in the series. The series is also irritating in a sense that we kept learning about the supporting characters who are half as interesting and care about even less.\\n\\n\r\nI did find the series enjoyable, really. But it seems like every time I anticipated something interesting to happen, I find myself saying \"oh great, what now?\" because some ELSE boring happened instead. It feels like they're not really interested in selling the main storyline, and that's probably not very healthy for an anime production.\\n\\n\r\nPlot/Concept: *Groan*\\n\r\nStory Style: Excellent\\n\r\nAudio/Visual: Great\\n\r\nValue: 7",

            "content": "~Story~\r\nDarker than Black takes place in Tokyo where an impenetrable field known as \"Hell's Gate\" appeared ten years ago giving powers to people known as Contractors. Codename \"Hei\", the protagonist of this anime is one of those.\r\nThe story is told into a small mini-chapters involving 2 episodes per each. It might confuse you for a while but once you get to know more you'll definitely like it.\r\n~Art~\r\nOkay, the art was good enough. I really liked the fight scenes where you get to see some incredibly fighting animations. For myself I really liked the part where the faces looked emotionless, that's what they had to lookafter all!\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\\n\r\nLike every good show that exist, Darker than Black also had to get some hell of a songs! I believe the OST's along with the intros are very memorable and made a huge impact on this show. I can't say the voice acting was bad but it could be better.\\n\\n\r\n~Character~\\n\\n\r\nI really liked watching Hei trying to act as a foreign student named Lee-kun. He was unexpectedly hilarious at some times. Mao, Huang and Yin, the members of the same Syndicate and the main characters of the story each have quite a unique chemistry between them. Despite the fact that the contractors are supposed to be unemotional, each character still manages to have a unique personality which often even enhanced by this fact. \\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment and Overall~\\n\\n\r\nMy personal opinion of ranking this anime would be a full 9+/10.\\n\r\nThis is one of the few animes that instead of going to sleep, I kept watching and watching and watching. If you like shows about people with supernatural powers, I think you should definitely watch this series.\\n",

            "content": "When I look back on my time as an Otaku, one particular moment sticks out more so than any other and it\u2019s probably my most fond memory:\r\nThe time I watched Darker Than Black for the first time. Now, you may be wondering, \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about Darker Than Black?\u201d Well, if you read the About Me section in my profile, it will say that I had about a 10 year gap of watching anime and only watched my first \u201cnew\u201d show in 2010 and it was Darker Than Black. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ll be the first to say that DTB isn\u2019t the greatestshow, but I will say that it\u2019s a really great show that has some amazing things going for it and I would say it\u2019s a true cult classic as the show is not HUUUGE but does have a large and loyal fan base and is popular enough to be noticed.\\n\\n\r\nSo it gives me great pleasure to review, in my opinion, an absolute gem of any anime and without further ado; OTAKU\u2019S ON THE LEFT (cheer!), OTAKETTE\u2019S ON THE RIGHT (cheer!) & THE YOUNG \u2018UNS (sit down it\u2019s passed your bed time) welcome to my review of Darker Than Black (whatever the fuck that means).\\n\\n\r\nHISTORY CLASS!!! Your favourite lesson of the day:\\n\\n\r\nDarker Than Black (whatever the fuck that means) is an original anime (meaning it was not adapted from a manga) released in 2007 and was created, directed and written by a wonderful man called Tensai Okamura, who was also a director on Wolf\u2019s Rain, a little show called Neon Genesis Evangelion, Medabots (how awesome is that XD) & Soul Eater; he was also involved in the key animation of little known projects like Totoro, Ninja Scroll and the marvellous Cyber City Oedo 808. Back in track, DTB was animated by Studio Bones, a studio I\u2019m a massive fan of, who other work include Wolf\u2019s Rain, Eureka Seven, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 (which is sensational) and Ouran High School Host Club. The anime spanned 25 episodes, generated a 4 episode OVA \u201cbridging\u201d series, a full-fledged 12 episode second season and two manga series.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe story goes a little summin\u2019 like this:\\n\\n\r\nFive years before the beginning of the series, a special anomaly dubbed \u201cHeaven\u2019s Gate\u201d appeared in South America causing a 1500KM radius size of chaotic space. The appearance of such an anomaly sparked a huge scale war, then promptly disappeared (the special anomaly) along with everything inside the 1500KM radius. The results of which caused the stars to disappear and be replaced by fake stars (stay with me here) which act as an identifier for certain people who have now been given \u201csuper powers\u201d, cool enough when the people use their powers the star their aligned to flickers. Now on the opposite side of the globe, in Tokyo, ten years before the beginning of the series, a similar (or indeed opposite) anomaly appeared dubbed \u201cHell\u2019s Gate\u201d which prompted the Tokyo government to erect an Attack on Titan sized wall around the anomaly. The appearance of Hell\u2019s Gate leads to a rise of people with powers dubbed Contractors and their assistants/counterparts known as Dolls. \\n\\n\r\nFlash-forward to ten years after Hell\u2019s Gate and we are introduced to the events currently happening. During the first episode we are introduced to two of the \u201cmain players\u201d in the story to come; Misaki Kirihara, a police officer (to keep it simple) who is part of force specifically tasked to investigate Contractor incidents, basically the Contractor police. She gives us the gist of the Heaven\u2019s/Hell\u2019s Gates and about Contractors & Dolls. She is investigating a specific Contractor, known only as BK-201(the location of the star), trying to find out his identity and some other things that I really didn\u2019t care for. We are instantly introduced to BK-201, introduced to us under the name Hei, known by other Contractors as The Black Reaper; his power is the manipulation and projection of electricity, which is pretty awesome. Now I could go on and on about how badass Hei is but I won\u2019t, just Google Image search him and that will show you. Just know that he has some baggage and mystery \u2013 baggage because we learn that Hei was present in South America during Heaven\u2019s Gate and mystery because it appears that he doesn\u2019t have to pay a price for using his powers, evident by him using it multiple times in one go and it also seems that he is able to bypass the emotional restrictions that other Contractors have on them allowing to blend perfectly into normal society, which leads me to our third character; Li Sheng Shun, REMEMBER THAT NAME! This is Hei\u2019s human persona and it works flawlessly well. Other important characters (that I can\u2019t go into more than the little I\u2019ve went into with these characters because it\u2019s soooooo much more meaningful to be caught in the moment when their development goes great, plus spoilers and all) include, Yin \u2013 Hei\u2019s Doll, Amber, Mao the cat, November 11 & Havoc.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Darker Than Black\u2019s (whatever the fuck that means) story does, what I think rather well, others don\u2019t, is it presents not just the main storyline, but also other well written tales confined to two-part episodes, mini-stories if you will. It really eases you in and gives you character development for Hei that is so great is addressing his personal problem with being a \u201cHuman Contractor\u201d. These stories also fall into different genres away from the main genre.\\n\\n\r\n The first story deals with betrayal and lies through the idea of finding out you have been implemented with a false life because you are in fact a mindless Doll is quite the tragic tale that does nothing but eradicate a person\u2019s entire existence and memories and feelings in an instant. Hei also is at odds with his Human and Contractor sides which really (mind you this is the first two episodes) puts real weight to his character.\\n\\n\r\nThe second story (episodes 3 & 4) is just as bad, maybe even more tragic, with the tale being about a girl who has repeatedly had her mind wiped (and her life replayed) by her father who is desperately trying to produce a cure for her as has contracted the rare strain of being a Moratorium, a person stuck in an in-between stage of becoming a Contractor or a Doll and having no payment for their powers but to suffer severe mental trauma when they do use the power. Her father traverses into Hell\u2019s Gate regularly to procure plants exhibiting the same strain that creates Contractors so that he can experiment on them. It is a really sad situation that Hei finds himself in and these two episodes are probably my favourite of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story does even out and becomes quite the cluster fuck with so many details and made up terms that it\u2019s tends to run away from itself. But when it comes to Hei, the story and cause is always clear and does really come to a tense and exciting end. It\u2019s overall fairly pleasing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I\u2019ll say about DTB\u2019s story is that it tells us how or what something is, and that\u2019s that, no explanations, which can be alright because it can save a show from being too descriptive which does allows us to enjoy the present tense of the show without over-killing us with monologue after monologue, Sosuke Aizen comes to mind. BUT! It can also leave the viewer frustrated to the teeth because the show presents some baffling situation or event that is so pivotal and integral to the plot it\u2019s just by existing, in need of explanation, Attack on Titan anyone? What I\u2019m getting at with this is that Darker Than Black (whatever the fuck that means) sits right in the middle of these two; it explains what it needs to explain within the context of the moment so that the story is ever progressing but it does mention loads of things that are made out to be very very important to the characters and the world that it does leave massive gaps in the chronology.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about Misaki Kirihara, & Hei:\\n\\n\r\nMisaki Kirihara\\n\\n\r\nMisaki is a great human character who isn\u2019t really part of the overall fabric of where the story goes but she does appear enough times to become the female lead although Yin will eventually don the mantle by the end of the series. She\u2019s always wanted to become a policewoman so that she can protect the weak, but her high position now, collecting info on Contractors is at odds with what she wants in her life, she feels like she isn\u2019t helping anyone and feels helpless herself. To her distain her position was attained through way of her father who is the super intendant, the big cheese boss man, so as to get her to her desired rank at a faster pace. She hates this fact because she feels people look down on her because of it and because she wanted to reach that goal through her own means. This is her life and it has a real negative affect on her personal life as she hasn\u2019t lived, focusing her youth on becoming an officer, so there is a sadness to her, but she is a very respectfully strong independent and capable woman who I have a lot of respect for. Plus she\u2019s quite the looker it must be said. When she becomes involved with Hei and his alias Li Sheng Shung REMEMBER THAT NAME! she falls in love with both of them as two separate people even though they are the same, it\u2019s a very interesting dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nHei/Li Sheng Shung\\n\\n\r\nHei first. Hei is the epitome of the perfect assassin, strong, agile, precise, creative, intelligent, and invisible. He holds all of the skills in Aces and in a fight is damn-near unbeatable. Although Contractors can hold their own against Hei, in the end, they always lose. Hei has a past and it does haunt him, though it gives him purpose and reason in this world, one of revenge, which comes to a head in the end and makes way for Yin and a really interesting story.\\n\r\nLi Sheng Shung, is everything Hei is not, clumsy, slumped, simple, uninteresting and oh so human. Li does hold this strange aura about his person that just attracts people to him and fall in love with him. Also, because he\u2019s so uninteresting he is never noticed he\u2019s around till the last possible second and no-one ever suspects why he\u2019s always around when strange things are happening. These two personas perfectly balance charm, baggage, likability, fear, excitement, intensity and relaxation.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nUsually when people ask me about shows done by Bones made after Darker Than Black (whatever the fuck that means) I always say, \u201cIt\u2019s very Bones\u201d. This is because ever since seeing DTB and then seeing something like Tokyo Magnitude and No. 6 the style of art used for the characters is so similar that I coined, \u201cIt\u2019s very Bones\u201d, great line work being simple yet stylish in design, which can be said for the colour scheme as well like Hei\u2019s jacket for example, on the front a simple black trench coat then woomph! Green on the inside, something so out of the context that it looks cool. Even Misaki\u2019s glasses in shape and colour create a good style for her character, Yin\u2019s dress, November 11\u2019s suit, all of Amber, just a simple yet effective stylish design. This also extends to the animation as well, great camera shots, sublime effects for the powers, great perspective shots of Hei when grappling, and overall simple yet really effective. I was immersed into the world by looks alone, which is quite the achievement.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nWhat a sublime soundtrack this is. Crafted by Yoko Kanno who everyone knows. The soundtrack screams personality and atmosphere when paired with the anime with some excellent jazzy tunes, perfectly suited to a slow drink in dimly lit, smoky room. My personal favourite track has to be Yin\u2019s Piano, which I can\u2019t give a reason as to why without spoiling some quality character development, but I can say that the track is a perfect character rendition on a purely emotional level, showing off the subtle beauty, frailty and need to notice Yin. The opening, Howling by Abingdon Boys School is just sensational at getting you pumped up and excited for the action to come without fault every single episode and the ending them, Tsukiakari by Rie Fu is a hauntingly beautiful song with heavenly lyrics that just ease you back into reality.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is superb for this one, with Jason Liebrecht voicing Hei and Li Sheng Shung providing real diversity with the voices, one dark and one light. Yin is voiced by the ever great Brina Palencia in probably her most sensual performance I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s so precious, infantile and softly sad that it melts your heart when it pops up from time to time. Chris Sabat lends his voice to a minor character and Monica Rial voices Misaki\u2019s incredibly attractive friend Kanami. The big names continue with the man of the hour Troy Baker (in a surprise twist for me) put his lungs to November 11, a British man. Amber is voiced by my wife Laura Bailey and Luci Christian, Vic Mignogna & Eric Vale all voice minor characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nAction is rife in this one and it\u2019s always entertaining, really some great fights with a whole host of badassery by way of Hei. There\u2019s a good amount of comedy to break up the seriousness and it is genuinely funny I have to admit. There\u2019s also a good deal of emotional impact during the series, some real memorable heart-string pulling scenes. It\u2019s an incredibly re-watchable show that I\u2019d recommend as a great winter show coupled with the Gaiden OVA\u2019s and the second season (which isn\u2019t all that bad).\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, Darker Than Black (whatever the fuck that means) is for me, a real gem of a show. It\u2019s just one of those randomly good shows, which are just really good. I\u2019ll always have a personal affection for the show and I\u2019ll watch it maybe 3 times in a year and I\u2019ll enjoy every second of it, and I hope that all of you can to. Now that I\u2019m finally done writing this, I\u2019m going to watch Darker Than Black (WHATEVER!!!! THE FUCK!!!! THAT!!! MEANS!!!!!) Hahahaha XP\\n\\n\r\nSUZAKU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LELOUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *bang!\\n",

            "content": "Review in short: - Batman electrocutes a bunch of dudes, makes scores of women fall for him (and leaves them out in the cold) and saves the world.  It's basically Nolan's Dark Knight.\r\n______________________________\r\nHow does Hei like his coffee? \r\nDarker than Black!!\r\nTerrible puns aside, Darker than black was a lot of fun. (Sorry, I won't do it again).\r\nIn terms of setting, Darker than Black puts a new and surprisingly original twist on a very old question i.e. what happens when individuals with superpowers appear among the populace. \r\nThe similarity to X-men is obvious but the method of approach is different as in X-Men are mostlyproducts of evolution (The science is wrong though) whereas the contractors' (The X-men in this show) are granted powers due to a mysterious structure called as a gate, the appearance of which caused the night sky to vanish. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the usage of the contractors' abilities requires a remuneration which can range from mundane stuff like chugging a beer or smoking a cigarette to really bizarre as in aging or cutting your veins. This is quite an interesting addition and separates it from most other superhero stories. \\n\\n\r\nThe story proceeds in an episodic format. With the exception of the final arc, we get 2 episode arcs. The story of the particular arc is effectively resolved at the end of it but through these short arcs, we get to learn about another facet of the world of Darker than black. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, this format perturbed me a lot as I could find no overarching plot but trust me, there is indeed one but it runs in the background and rears its head only after the main characters and their backstories are established. In the end, I was very satisfied with the format and while I did find some arcs to be boring, I must admit that none of them were filler material and every single one must be watched to learn more about the universe and the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the main plot itself wasn't all that great and having read more than my fair share of detective mysteries, I had more or less understood the big reveal a few episodes before the ending. It was kind of anti-climatic. I also felt that the series left a large number of loose ends like what is the purpose of the contracts? Why did the night sky disappear? It would have been great if these questions had been answered. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, Hei was my favorite. He is basically a far more badass version of Batman who has no qualms about killing people (or does he?), can electrocute people, throws knives better than Deadpool and uses grappling hooks with a proficiency that would make Spiderman envious. Oh! and he is popular with the ladies too (So, we can add Tony Stark to the mix, I guess). That said, the guy has quite a few quirks, a dark past and an air of enigma around him that makes him a compelling character to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters Yin, Huang and Mao were also developed well and it was good to know more about them and their tragic pasts. However, I felt that the police detective Kirihara had very little to do with the story and served mostly as shipping material. That was kind of sad, considering that she seemed to be a strong female character who could have been used in a better way.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the main villain, well, there wasn't any. Saying more would probably spoil the plot so, all I would say is that all the characters, even the kinda evil ones have strong motives behind them so, it is difficult to point fingers and say Hey! That guy is bad! This gray morality is one of the best things about this show and adds to its appeal.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the side characters, I felt that the British contractor November 11 ( a more suave James Bond) and Amber ( a cuter version of C.C. from Code Geass). I also enjoyed watching the misadventures of the bumbling 'No. 1' private detective Kurasawa and his cosplaying assistant. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also has a separate host of side characters who appear for only 2 episodes (We'll call them mayflies). You may think that 2 episodes are insufficient to develop a character but surprisingly Darker than black pulls it off and there were quite a few mayflies whom I liked and sympathized with. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I would say that this show takes its characters very seriously and Bones! (the studio) deserves plaudits for making efforts to present such believable and likable characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the artwork and animation, I thought that they were quite average. The same can be said for the background music, voice actors and opening themes.\\n\\n\r\nI also felt that the action scenes in this series were quite nicely done and while they were short compared to fighting sequences in say: - DBZ, they were intense, highly violent and exciting to watch. In spite of his abilities Hei, never seems to be invincible, overpowered or a Gary Stu. This makes the scenes even more riveting as you keep trying to guess how Hei can survive the fight  (Of course, he'll survive but how?).\\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, Darker than black packs a decent story, excellent characters, tastefully done action sequences and an original and interesting universe to sink your greedy otaku fangs into. It ain't the best anime out there but it's not bad either. \\n\\n\r\nDefinitely recommended for people interested in a gritty, action-packed, sci-fi (or supernatural depending on your interpretation of the Gate's powers) anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I must say, I didn't get everything in the beginning, I mean what the heck was a contractor, doll and a gate? But as the story continues, you get to understand more and more of the series. This is just one of those special, non-mainstream series that can become one of your favorites very easily.In some ways I agree with people who say it's underrated, but then again, it's not that badly rated. The bonding with the characters went really well for me. All I can say is stop hesitating and go watch it already, I'm pretty sure this one won't be a let-down as it just drags you along into the story!",

            "content": "Darker than Black (DTB) is a story that's shrouded with mystery.\r\nDTB is an interesting story that has plenty of action, mystery, exposition, and most importantly; originality. The characters are interesting, the soundtrack is good, and the explanation given for everything is actually pretty solid. There's not much else to say\r\nOkay, just kidding, there's plenty to say. DTB follows Hei, just your average emotionless superpowered killing machine who wears a peculiar mask and a pretty badass looking knife... or is he...? Hei works for the Syndicate and often goes undercover as weak-willed Lee Shangsun (geez, I hope I spelled that right) for his missions that usuallyrequire him to spy on certain individuals, but of course, spying isn't the only thing Hei does in his missions. Hei is a contractor, a type of being that people consider no-longer-human due to having no emotions or desires outside of making rational decisions, oh almost forgot (not really) contractors each have some sort of power that comes at a price. Both the power and price of power for a contractor varies person to person, each having a different power and a different price to pay. Our MC, Hei often has to fight against other contractors which makes for some cool fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nHeaven's gate and Hell's gate have some side effects and even though the sky and its stars are fake, they still have a purpose. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of DTB is good but as I was watching it, there were a few flaws in the story. For example, there's the contractors being emotionless, which as I observed the characters that were these contractors,  I realized that these people are not emotionless, that's a big fat fuckn' lie... but the story ended up answering for each flaw I caught on to, including the emotionless bit I mentioned. Exposition on all the small things did the story justice.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of exposition, this story has a lot of it. You won't get a single episode that doesn't constantly explain what's going on. I'm used to heavy loads of explanations but at times I felt there was overkill with this story trying to stuff information down my throat that I already figured out myself without them slowly explaining why something happened when someone else already did. It's not a bad thing to have a lot of exposition (sorry, I'm using this word more than I need to) as it helps to use it in drama with lots of crazy shit, but sometimes it's best to just shuddup and let the viewer try figuring stuff out, the best example that DTB shows of this is in the ending of the final episode, an event happens and without explanation, short scenes are shown that allow the audience the piece together everything after the main event.\\n\\n\r\nThere's plenty of cool fight scenes but unfortunately they don't actually last very long and they become a bit predictable at times while other times they will catch you off guard (maybe) but regardless,  they're still fuckin' awesome, especially since each contractor has a different power.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, nothing else to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is cool.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all interesting from Hei and his small team to the serious police chief Misaki Kirihara to the hilarious private investigator kurasawa and his assistant. Even the antagonists are interesting but for some reason, they just weren't all that memorable other than the reoccurring ones.\\n\\n\r\nThere are about 25 episodes+special but I guess there's also a short OVA series and a second season that's only 12 episodes or something, I'll be sure to check them out at some point before someone kills me.\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black was easy for myself to get into but sometimes I didn't feel interested enough to care about the characters like I do with other anime. The story is original but nothing truly ground breaking but that's okay, because not many things are. I would highly reccomend this to people who like action and/or mystery and remember, Heaven's gate may be closed but Hell's gate is still open, waiting for you...",

            "content": "After watching this series for a second time, I can confidently say this anime deserves a 9/10. Some people cringe when they hear the term \"arc based\" but the was darker than black goes about executing its arcs, (each of them being only 2 eps long) will have you glued to the screen. Characters develop every so slightly after each subplot and subsequently come together to end the series.\r\n          The concept of contractors and dolls is wonderful in my opinion the one gripe i have with the series is that they never explain why they cameinto being. the &quot;gates&quot; just suddenly appeared, but if you dont mind staying in the dark about that the rest of the series is solid. i've heard people complaining about the ending too, that it was abrupt and rushed. I'll admit it might have been a little rushed yet the actual ending to the story satisfied me completely. There isn't much here as far as romance goes, but there are a few relationships portrayed in the anime they don't really take them anywhere. That aside, you dont go pick up a series titled &quot;darker than black&quot; and expect to see honey x clover all over again.  \\n\r\n           Musically this show is awesome, the background music fits so well it spices up almost every scene in fact I'm downloading the OST at the moment. Moving on to the characters, i think theyre wonderful, initially you feel distanced from all of them as if you're simply watching everything go on from a security camera, and you'll probably end up hating some of them *cough hwang *cough* but its easier to sympathize when u learn more about them. I love the way hei changes from &quot;deadly assassin&quot; to &quot;helpless exchange student&quot; in the blink of an eye, i know the concept of heroes with masks is overused, but trust me hes not just another peter parker. That about wraps it up, now get watching !!!",

Unfortunately this type of narrative works very much as adouble-edged sword for the show this is because while the \"mini-arcs\" add more world building and add more to the show's overall lore the story itself is rather bare-bones which forces the show to rush itself near the end without answering many fundamental questions about the show nor having at the very least a satisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nAs interesting as the world of DTB built itself out to be what take the show down to the ground is its unbearable characters. When a CAT is the best and most interesting character in the series you know you've done something wrong. With characters dying left and right every 2 episodes or so makes it basically impossible for DTB to find any character development within its characters, but that's not really the major problem here. Due to the contractor's nature of having no emotions the majority of the characters themselves come off as well bland even if most of the major characters get backstory to them.\\n\\n\r\nShort Overview on the major characters of the show:\\n\r\nHei- The ultimate soldier, carries out all the missions. Unless hes using his supernatural powers Hei is as boring as they come with ultimately being your typical badass.\\n\\n\r\nHuang-One of the few tolarable characters in the show. Acts as the boss to his squad delivers orders from the \"Syndicate\". Gets the short end of the stick due to having less screen time than the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nYin-being the \"doll\" in the show Yin has even less personality then the contractors themselves and for some reason her importance is increased cause the writers felt they would make her useful.\\n\\n\r\nMao-The best character. The talking cat adds some nice comic relief to the show and is easily the most interesting character due to his appearance while also being shrouded in mystery.\\n\\n\r\nKirihara-Kirihara feels rather useless throughout the show and more so in the 2nd season. She never adds to the plot even though shes the only human in the show and feels like a \"tag-along\" type of character.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation :7/10\\n\r\nThe show's art is rather average maybe slightly above average but nonetheless nothing felt out of place except one thing... PIZZA HUT. Code Geass has nothing on DTB when it comes to Pizza Hut ads, almost every episode has in some way or shape a pizza hut ad. The animation itself though is rather good and this is especially shown during the action scenes. Due to the contractors having unique abilities Studio Bones had to find a way to make the action look fresh and unique every time and well they succeeded.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 7/10\\n\r\nThe OST for DTB is very western influenced with in its soundtrack a similar case can be found in the previously mentioned anime Baccano! so if you enjoyed the OST for Baccano! you should probably check out the ost for DTB and vice-versa. Overall it added my enjoyment for the show.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 5/10 Enjoyment : 7/10\\n\r\nAs much of a mess the characters are and that the story is rather weak I cannot deny that DTB's world building doesn't deserve some sort of praise actually with such a world DTB would make a good video game more so than an anime. Moreover I can also say seeing anime Batman(Hei) kick everyone's ass with his powers was quite entertaining. In Conclusion turn off your brain and watch Hei do his thing in this popcorn material flick.\\n",

            "content": "Main  \r\nThis is one very well put together anime that caters to the viewer on several levels: aesthetically, intellectually and philosophically. I'm not sure how such a great series like this manage to fly under my radar or not manage to get much media attention but I actually stumbled across this series on one of those video websites like, YouTube or Stage6. But as soon as I saw it, I knew it would be a good one...and then read the reviews about it which confirmed it. And I too would most definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in this show orto anyone who would like to watch a really awesome anime that delivers the perfect combination of lots of action, intrigue and humor.\\n\\n\r\n Art-Style \\n\r\nI liked the way this series looked. Everything about it was just so very neatly drawn and clear and clean-cut looking. When it was sunny, it was sunny and nice, when it was gloomy...it was gloomy and nice. A lot of splendid artwork was done throughout this show, from the people/characters to the various cars driven to a lot of the city scenes and horizonscapes and even the night sky, which is integral to the story.\\n\r\nThe animation was done by one of the many, many mega-anime companies [that I have a hard time keeping track of] so the art is virtually flawless. This is an action oriented series so there are a lot of fight scenes....some with a lot of quick, intricate movements for the hand to hand battles and others that are a whole lot more grandiose and breath-taking since they involve using various super powers.\\n\r\nEither way, there is no way you will not be impressed by any of these action sequences. There is also considerable gore.....which to me, is what makes anime so great.\\n\\n\r\n Sound \\n\r\nUnfortunately, the music of both OPs and Eds left me uninspired. It was just horrible......actually inconceivable to use such utterly boring, forgettable, vanilla sounding J-POP music for this series. I can and will never be able to fully express how completely un-befitting that music that was for this show. Had this is a show taken a page out of either Ghost in the Shell's or Cowboy Bebop's book and used either a techno or jazz and blues music format, it would have been awesome, and the series would have been perfect. Actually, if the viewer listens closely to a few of the BGM tracks playing throughout some of the action scenes, you'll hear some jazz reminiscent of Bebop.\\n\\n\r\n Story \\n\r\nThis story is probably one of the most original and by far most awesome I have come across in a while! Many have said that it is not and that it has copied some American TV shows or X-Men which is preposterous since animes have always dealt with themes involving super powers and the only thing I see similar to X-Men is that they both have a black female who can manipulate the weather. Either way I rarely watch American TV and I loved X-Men, so to me this show was simply kick-a__!\\n\r\nDarker than Black is one of those shows that does not have just one simple story, it's more than just about one young man's journey to find his missing kid sister. There are several layers and story lines to this series and even greater more diabolical plot beyond those... and it's all done so very well. Anyone could walk away from this show drawing from it any number of satisfactory conclusions.\\n\r\nSo there is a lot more to this anime just having a cool sounding title because it is one of the rare few animes that have successfully combined the philosophic and intellectual nature of a Ghost in the Shell with the emotional artistry of a Cowboy Bebop.\\n\\n\r\n Cast/Characters \\n\r\nCharacter design was very good, it stayed within what I call &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; anime format which is: large even-spaced eyes, pointy chin, glossy spiky hair. I prefer anime characters to stay along that line. Tho there were quite a few that were a bit different but still nice to look at and what I would consider attractively drawn by anime standards like, Huang or the crotchety old landlady or the fat opera singer lady of destruction. Yes, they were all very attractively drawn.\\n\r\nI also think each of the personalities of the characters were done very well, [very good voice acting!] backgrounds and profiles were given the opportunity of fully develop. Some of the personalities you'll instantly like while others will grow on you over time even the people who you think are bad guys are really somewhat OK and likable or at least you'll find sympathetic.\\n\\n\r\n Worth it or NOT? \\n\r\nA totally awesome show! Don't let this one pass you by! Even if it didn't get a lot of press time like a bunch of the other animes, even if this doesn't get played on any TV Networks like, C/N's Adult Swim, this doesn't mean the show was not good....it's probably due to the violence and gore. And even if you've seen a thousand X-Mens and X-Men-like shows, you should still watch this one because it's cooler, has more humanist elements, has gore, more philosophical....and because it's anime.",

            "content": "*This review is archived from my account on Anime-Planet*\r\nCritic's Log - Earthdate: June 17, 2012. Review #9: Darker Than BLACK\r\nA heart of Darkness is a heart full of Hatred and Deceit, A dark heart's lust for power can never fill his avarice to the fullest, he will continuously consume power because he resents people that have it. His wrath will eventually lead to his despair and his arrogance will give him a heart that is Darker Than Black. Is it possible to have a heart that is lighter than black or darker than white? I do not know myself because I still search, and then...The trials of a journey begin.\\n\\n\r\nOkay... Enough with the poetic philosophical mumbo-jumbo. Here's Darker Than BLACK!\\n\\n\r\nTen Years ago, an unknown and abnormal area known as Hell's Gate appeared in Tokyo, altering the sky and wreaking havoc on the landscape. The real stars disappeared and are replaced by fake stars. During this time, people possessing various special powers have been appearing, each capable of different supernatural feats. These people are known as \"Contractors\". Each fake star has a corresponding Contractor which reacts to their activities. They are also kept secret from the masses. These contractors are known to murder in cold blood. They also kill their emotion with logic and rationale. Their abilities on the other hand at the cost of their humanity, Contractors are also named because of a involuntary compulsion to pay the price each time their power is used. Various nations and organizations around the world are training these contractors as assassins and spies resulting in aggressive battles for objects of value and information. After the Heaven's War, The United States have lost their position as a superpower to a mysterious organization named The Syndicate, The story is about a Chinese contractor named Hei as he undertakes various espionage and assassination missions in Tokyo under the direction of The Syndicate.\\n\\n\r\nTo be technical, this is a Studio Bones production and Studio Bones still has good animation quality. Darker than Black does not disappoint in the animation department. The animation looks really good even though computers may have been used as part of The Animation. The animation isn't perfect in this show, but it looks really nice. The action scenes are nice. Kudos to Studio Bones.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the animation is great, there are some big problems with Darker than Black. The story may vary your mileage and I have many reasons why I say this... The pace in this show varies on speed and that might not be so bad. The big problem with the story is that the narrative tense does feel disorienting. Let me explain this, there are times when flashbacks are shown in the prologue of some episodes and then you see the present events occur after the opening. There's also a lot of things explained as the show progresses, this is an anime you need to pay attention to so you need to wake the fuck up while watching Darker than Black. I will give Tensai Okamura some credit that his direction in this anime is a bit different than some other anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major flaws of Darker than Black is that it feels like the story isn't developing where it should be, Darker Than BLACK does develop a bit at the start of the second half in the show but it does take a while before the show gets somewhat interesting. The ending is rushed and at the time I am writing this review, I am a bit skeptical about the second season of Darker than BLACK.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major flaw is that the Minor characters seem to have the more interesting storylines than the main characters themselves and I did find some of these minor character's intriguing. The main casts of characters do get backstories but they are not as intriguing save for Yin's Backstory and Huang's backstory. Hei's backstory was a bit interesting but I don't have much to say about what intrigued me about it. The variety of the powers that the contractors have is nice too. The character development is a mixed bag for me and I was this close of calling the character development \"Shoddy\". There are some characters I find boring and I found some to be quite interesting. Hei is a bit complicated for me to enjoy watching. I admire the fact that when he assumes the alias \"Li Shenshung\" you wouldn't suspect that he's the infamous \"BK201\" or \"Black Reaper\", but when he is the Black Reaper, he's a badass (to some degree). Yin on the other hand does develop a bit but not too much, since she is a Doll, your expectations will vary. Huang is the only main character that is 100% human. I like the two part episode about him and Shihoko. Mao is okay. Again, the minor characters seem to have the more interesting storylines than the main characters and that can be considered a big problem. It may also feel a bit unoriginal at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for Darker Than BLACK is composed by Yoko Kanno who is well known for composing the music for animes such as The Vision of Escaflowne, Cowboy Bebop, Wolf's Rain, and Ghost in The Shell. The music is okay in Darker than BLACK, but Kanno- san has done better, Also, I found it quite nice to hear Mai Yamane in a song or two. If you don't know who she is, I'll tell you... She's the singer that is well known for her work in Cowboy Bebop, if you know the song \"The Real Folk Blues\", she's the one singing it. But I will say that the first opening kicks ass, and the first closing theme is pretty good too. Last but not least, the moments where you hear some jazz in the show. I think it's a nice touch... Kind of reminds you of Cowboy Bebop a bit.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to voice acting. The subtitled version is excellent, however... so is most of the dub. I will admit the subtitled version is good, The dubbed version might be the most appropriate choice because of the settings and some of the character backgrounds. Even though Funimation is notorious for re-casting the same voice actors at their disposal, I did not mind the dub too much. Hidenobu Kiuchi is great as Hei and Jason Liebrecht isn't bad as Hei either. Misato Fukuen is pretty good as Yin while Brina Palencia was okay as Yin, Masaru Ikeda and John Swasey play Huang pretty well. Ikuya Sawaki and Kent Williams are pretty good as Mao. If there is one character that had a pretty good performance on both the dubbed and the subbed version, it was the late seiyu Tomoko Kawakami and Laura Bailey as Amber. You can't really go wrong with either version so whether you want to watch this dubbed or subbed is totally up to you, they are both pretty good. Zach Bolton (who worked on Shin-Chan) was repsonsible for the ADR direction and he did pretty good on the dub on this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDarker than BLACK is available by Funimation, the OVA \"Beneath Cherry Blossoms in Full Bloom\" is released with Season One and is a side story of the show. The Second season of Darker than BLACK called \"Gemini of The Meteor\" is also available by Funimation, there is also another OVA called \"Darker than BLACK: Gaiden (Side Story)\" it is also available from Funimation. A manga of Darker than BLACK is available from Yen Press and there is another Manga adaptation of Darker than BLACK but hasn't been licensed here yet at the time I am writing this review.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, Darker than BLACK is a somewhat unique series that might have some unoriginal elements. You might find this show really cool if you can get past the mixed bag of character development, and the story's narrative tense. This is one of those animes that I think is not really bad but I think it's not really good either. Do I like this show? Yeah, I thought it was pretty cool. It's not really on my favorites list...\\n\\n\r\nI give Darker Than BLACK a 7 out of 10. It is GOOD!\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to comment below, and have a good evening",

            "content": "Darker Than BLACK, A wonderful show. All in all, it's quite breath-taking. The first few episodes are a little boring, but they're all worth it. After those few first episodes, the show got a bit more intense. Also made everything more interesting. I loved how the creators made every new character relevant the the whole series, instead of the character coming and leaving after some small section. Each character had an important role, and somehow helped the series get the the end.\r\nThe plot was lovely. It kept going, and there was plenty of action, with the same amount of talking. Not too much of either.The art was fantastic. Everything looked real. When someone walked, it actually looked like they were walking. Not like they were sliding across the street. The sound was just great, too! The background music didn't really seem to be there. The music perfectly fit the scenes, so it seemed like the sound was just coming out of nowhere. The opening songs and ending songs also fit the show. They matched the suspense of each episode. I will never get enough of the DtB Characters. They all had their own distinct personalities. They all looked wonderful. They were all unique in their own way. The only thing that was the same in some characters was in the dolls, which had the same eye shape.  My enjoyment was wonderful! I loved the whole series. After each episode, I wanted to continue watching, even if I had to sleep. I didn't want it to end. The only 'flaw' to me was that the ending was a bit unsatisfying and didn't explain the rest of the details that the creators partly mentioned throughout the series. Overall. Darker Than BLACK was magnificent. I loved just about everything about it. Definite re-watch.",

            "content": "Well I just finished Darker than Black and enjoyed the series quite a bit, although I was a bit disappointed at the ending.  Story wise it is solid, although like many animes, the intensity does not pick up until half way through the episodes, with the main plot taking a backseat to side plots.  However, this was not entirely a bad thing, as I feel the main strength of this anime was in the characters and their individual stories.  The action in this anime is solid as well, with many stealth, infiltration and fighting scenes throughout the anime, and the art iswell drawn, if not spectacular.  The music in it is good too, integrated well in scenes throughout the episodes.  I recommend this to people who like action, mystery plots that also have a touch magical power to it.  Animes I have watched that are most similar to Darker than Black are probably Ghost in the Shell and Trinity Blood.  Overall i give it an 8/10!",

            "content": "Damn it I wanted to like this so badly. The setting and world making developed for this series were incredibly interesting, I just wish the rest of the series would've followed suit.\r\nThe art was much better than most series. There are a few fan service scenes but I let it slide because it was handled nicely versus other shows with less moral (re: High school DXD)\r\nThe sound was good but has a very limited selection. They beat the deadhorse on this one.\r\nHalf of the characters were hit or miss. Some were cool (Hei and November), some annoying (Kiko and Gai), and one was show stealing(Amber).\\n\\n\r\nNow the story. It really annoys me that a story with a good badass lead in a good setting doesn't receive a good review from me. The reason, the plot stunk. \\n\r\nI think half the episodes were written by a gorilla banging on a computer. So many parts don't matter and take away from the parts that do. Few shows can make the episodic thing work (like Cowboy Bebop) but this one didn't. Hell, it took me almost a year to watch this entire show because I just couldn't power through. The only reason I finished instead of dropping this series was the appearance of Amber. This is one of the few shows that I can genuinely say if they made it shorter It would've been better.\\n\r\nSo many questions are asked that are never answered. Throw in a few plot holes for good measure. Finally finish it off by having the character bend to the plot's will instead of having them behave in character and leading to a believable conclusion. A bit of a waste but if you enjoy action and ignore the near non existent plot you'll enjoy it.",

            "content": "Darker than black, a cup of coffee may taste bitter at first. However, after a few more sips, the honey tongue blends in with the darkness, diluting the coffee from bitter to bittersweet. \r\n**Water forest music plays while I speakth of dis philosophical quote. \r\nStory: 9 \r\nThe story establishes its social and political setting torn between human-superintended factions known as syndicates and supernatural-power-possessing humans, who look just like all other humans, known as Contractors. Contractors have originated from the opening of the \"Gate\" in South America, five years before the time of the story. Some work for syndicates, and most have been dispersed in society,unknown to the general public. The MC, Hei, is one of the Contractors who belong to a syndicate and carries out orders which often involve assaulting contractors from other syndicates and eliminating contractors who are unaware of their abilities.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I love how \"Darker Than Black's\" episodic storytelling reveals details about its established society before driving the main plot. The first twenty episodes introduce many subplots of Hei carrying out orders for his syndicate, reflecting on the nature of contractors and syndicates. I do think they could've been better paced because certain parts are somewhat bland and vague, but regardless, the writer's done a great job to familiarize the audience with his/her creation and eventually develop the story to conclusive finish. Trust me, you will be flushed with the satisfaction of a wholesome conclusion which ties up all the main events in the episodic episodes. Just gotta make sure you get the main gist of the story before you reach around episode 20! \\n\\n\r\nOh! I'd also like to mention that the comic relief is well placed and there are some pretty hilarious moments including Mao's kitty dreams and Hei's bra shopping scene (I ship Kirihara and Hei xD).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nI really like the character designs! They accurately reflect the characters attitudes and ideals, like Alice Wang's rich-thug look and Kirihara's pink lip gloss of justice -- coming from the top of my head... Sorry I'm not that great at expounding art, but well, you'll understand what I mean when you watch the anime. \\n\\n\r\nI do have a bit of a complaint about the over-stolid eyes of Yin and Hei, and although I understand the artist is purposely giving them an indifferent look, they could, in my opinion, look profound and indifferent at the same time if their eyes were more intricately designed. It's not too big of problem, however, since both of them are indeed profound characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nOn every episode, I wait until the end just to listen to a deep, philosophical prologue narrated by the chief of Public Safety Bureau, Ms. Pretty Kirahara in a Chinese dress, backtracked by the nostalgia-evoking \"Water Forest\". There are also other memorable soundtracks throughout. The names of which I do not remember, but they are played in moments such as when Gai Kurasawa is fighting over a ridiculous argument with his weaboo trash assistant or when Hei and Nick are staring up at the fake stars. \\n\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs are just so-so but its soundtrack is memorably nostalgic and bittersweet, so I will give this one a 9. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nLike I have mentioned a sentence ago, the writer makes a deft use of depressing but beautiful backstories to appeal to the audience. They are key instruments to expounding character traits, which I think are outstandingly well-done like pork tendon. I especially loved Huang's revelation of his backstory with Shihoko, and although I can't really you who they are without avoiding spoilers, he, like most of other characters' backstories (including the minor ones!) in the story, evoke bittersweet feelings darker than black. Characterization is really the treasure of this anime, as multiple main characters like Hei are given facets of contradicting attitudes such as sarcasm/humour and seriousness. Not to mention, best detective Gai Kurawasa and his weaboo trash assistant is the best comic duo ever (kyaa). Oh, the blonde thug of the yakuza is a funny guy, too, although he kinda sucks at making decisions. Oh well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI think I have went through enough detail to tell you that this anime has been a very enjoyable experience for me. It doesn't leave me hanging on a cliff like \"Boku no Hero Academia\", it doesn't require me to turn of my brain like \"Maze Runner\", and it doesn't induce my hibernation like \"Five Centimetres Per Second\" (It is a thematic masterpiece but at the same time it really is slow af). It gives me just the right amount of enjoyment, allowing me to digress its portrayed themes of prejudice, social divides, instinct vs. rationale etc. into my world while grasping my interest with its bittersweet and momentarily comical tone -- a nice balance indeed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 \\n\\n\r\n\"Darker Than Black\". Man, I just love this anime. I can't talk enough about the anime's dark roast coffee blend of bitter-sweetness! It definitely has its flaws, but they're so insignificant compared to its great control of plot, satisfying ending, and memorable characters and themes. \"Darker Than Black\" is worth the watch. You might even become a better and more insightful person once you watch it!\\n",

            "content": "Critical Review of Darker than black\r\nDarker than Black is a show involving people who have abtained superhuman powers from a place called Hell's Gate. The show revolves around a medium-small cast of people which includes a contractor, a doll (also a product of Hell's Gate), a human, and a cat which was a contractor that lost his body. The shows arcs are generally 2-3 episodes long with an underlying main plot which flows throughout. \r\nThe start of the show is somewhat confusing with an unclear main plot and little to no character introduction. The first scene lends to the idea  that the show willrevolve around a dark city which has been plunged into a war that many of its people don't understand. As you go along in the first couple of episodes you learn of contractors and their powers as well as their remmumerations which is explained more clearly as the show progresses. As the story continues through its short episodic arcs, the viewer learns more about the individual characters and their unique atributes that seem to make their characters who they are.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the overall story is sometimes muddled, the way that it is told is very interesting as the world around the characters develops. The generally realistic character design with the darker backdrop of the world that they live in makes for a show with an almost perfect mix of action, suspense, and mystery. It also has points in its story where it breaks from its seriousness and presents a lighter story. The way that this lighthearted arc is set into the story does not seem unnatural and instead gives another side of the characters that cannot be seen if the scenarios they were a part of were always as serious as the story. This anime does a great job of creating meaningful action and adding it into its intricate episodic plot. There is never a moment where the action seems forced and each fight seems fresh. The animation of the action sequences is very well done as a high budget product of Bones studio. Each one of the protagonists contributes to the fighting in their own way and the viewer should never get bored of the fights. The OST does a decent although not amazing job of contributing the artistic appeal of this show. The OST involves many genres of music which seem to be implemented fairly well as you may hear jazz, orchestral, or even rock throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the drawbacks of this anime is that it is episodic and sometimes difficult to follow. At many points in the anime the main plot is not very clear and there is not really a set goal for its characters or a direction in which they must head. This is fleshed out towards the end of the show but may be hard for a viewer to sit through if he is not interested in any of the characters or artwork. Although this is not necesarrily a drawback, the structure of the show does not revolve around one singular character. Although Hei is often the focus, a two episode arc may switch to another set of characters with little to no influence from someone else. This may set a viewer off if they are interested in only one character as the show makes it a point to give plot to multiple influences.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story comes into its final 3 episode arc, the previous 22 episodes and their mini arcs tend to come together as the main plot finally reveals itself. All of the mini arcs do their job of presenting characters, scenarios, and background before the final arc pulls together everything that had been revealed prior to the arc and finally focuses on a core plot which revolves around Hei, Yin, Mao, and Amber. Without spoiling, the ending is very symbolic and the rest of the story was merely a lead up of tensions and backdrop for the finale to bring together in a wistful and heavyharted climax. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this receives a 9; if only for its artwork and pure enjoyment. There are some themes although they are not fleshed out very clearly. The characters each have an interesting and unique piece to them and character design receives an 8. The ending brings an otherwise secondary main plot into a riveting ending which garners the overall story a score of 8. This show should be watched by those who enjoy intense action sequences and somewhat dark subtext and plot.",

            "content": "We live in a deterministic world. From the moment we were born, there lay a set of rules waiting for us that outlined the clear distinction between right, and wrong. We have thus grown accustomed to justifying our actions through these predetermined \u201cguidelines\u201d. But what happens when the world one day begins to forget these rules? What becomes of our morals? What becomes right...and what becomes wrong? And more importantly, will there even a distinction between the two? \r\nDarker than Black is the end product of a seed that has grown to envelop the entire plot, a seed of which all actions and consequences branchfrom, and therefore as a result, a seed of which all characters are ultimately intertwined with. \\n\\n\r\nThat seed, is rationality. More precisely, Darker than Black ponders on the question \"is rationality merely an excuse to justify one's actions?\" And to answer that question, it had to effectively dance in the flames, while holding a double edged sword.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because the series takes a very clever, and unique approach when addressing the above question. It begins, by tossing the viewer into a world of confusion, of which behind each character's actions and consequences, there lies no explanation, no motive, no purpose, no emotion. Or so it seems. Rather, certain pieces of information have been purposely left out in order to engage the viewer's own curiosity and imagination. You'll notice that the rationality of much of the opening portions of the series is really up to your own interpretation, and that you\u2019re challenged with the task of determining which rationality from which character is \u201ccorrect\u201d. This lack of distinction between the \u201cgood\u201d and the \u201cbad\u201d, and instead in its presence, the viewer\u2019s interpretation of \u201crational\u201d and \u201cirrational\u201d is characteristic of Darker than Black, and is also prevalent throughout the plot. \\n\\n\r\nSo in other words, we can say that Darker than Black withholds certain information key to character development (motives, purpose, background, etc), that otherwise is normally given in other animes, in hopes of engaging us to view the characters and the environment in a much more different perspective. Does it work? Yes, and for two different reasons. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, it\u2019s because as the series progresses, though only slightly as if the creators wish to only offer you a taste of the truth, small details are indeed revealed regarding each character's past and purpose. And what this does, is that it allows the viewer to quickly immerse themselves within a plot of hide and seek, looking for and piecing together the bits of information given one by one. Ultimately, we\u2019re able to better understand the rationality and ideals that each character abide by, and a comparison with the viewer's own interpretation formed during the earlier portions of the series is made. Hence you will find your position behind each character change as the series progresses, and as you begin to understand them better, what may have seemed to be a mindless killer may slowly begin to appear as a soulful figure. This slow journey of \u201crealization\u201d of each character\u2019s true colors is one of the defining factors that makes Darker than Black not only so grasping of one\u2019s attention, but also so memorable. In fact it's quite analogous to how one would eat at a luxurious 3 Michelin Star restaurant. By eating small cuts of a stake slowly rather than eating it whole in one bite, it allows one to better savor the \"flavors.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the second and more important reason, is that by putting a lesser and slower emphasis on each character in terms of character development, it allows for the series to put a much larger emphasis on the environment. Therefore the characters become only the tools of which a melancholic, sentimental and believable setting is built upon. Consequentially this also gives the series the flexibility to focus on themes such as discrimination, betrayal and self-worth in a much more dark and realistic manner than otherwise would be the case. As opposed to the traditional upbeat, justice oriented mindset often incorporated in comics and some animes, Darker than Black portrays the gloomier truth of how a world actually responds to the introduction of a set of unique individuals with inhuman superpowers. And how aside from chance, there would\u2019ve been nothing that set those individuals apart from you and I. There is no sense of justice, righteousness, or respect. Rather, corruption begins to run high as countries begin the new \u201carms race.\u201d The individuals themselves slowly become nothing more than the tools of others, given either the option to work for unnamed organizations in hopes of obtaining the slightest essence of purpose, or to wander an aimless life shunned by society as a result of their uniqueness. Many choose the former, and as time goes by, they begin to lose their \u201chuman\u201d aspects, degrading emotionally until only their core principles are left. These principles range from honor to love to negligence, and the story progresses through us observing how they contribute to either the downfalls of some, or the triumphs of others. Notice how the story therefore turns into one told through the environment and the interactions of a large base of characters, rather than the personal development of a set few. Plot progression occurs more through us understanding more about the world of Darker than Black and the personalities of its inhabitants, and less through the personal emotional development of the main characters. An unique plot requires an unique story telling method. \\n\\n\r\nNow recall earlier of my analogy of the \u201cdouble edged sword.\u201d That wasn\u2019t meant to simply be an attempt to hide a metaphorical meaning behind a linguistic decoration like the title of the series. Rather quite literally, the anime\u2019s story telling method works both to its benefit as well as to its detriment. After all, there\u2019s a reason why the category \u201ccharacter development\u201d exists in a review. It\u2019s because it brings meaning to the plot. To the climax, the final realizations, the ending itself. By straying away from the traditional method of prioritizing character development, the series failed to state the \u201creason behind it all\u201d, the \u201cmessage of the plot\u201d if you will. I felt no magnitude of importance from the final scenes of the series because lack of character development had led to an absence of a feeling of accomplishment for the changes the characters had undergone. Yes, I was shown an unimaginably believable world filled with characters of all personalities. But what am I supposed to conclude and learn from this? That the world is a dark place? That lack of purpose leads to the degradation of oneself? And if so, that\u2019s hardly a worthwhile achievement after a 25 episode series. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Darker than Black was a series who\u2019s compelling story grasped me from the start, but at the same time distanced me with its hollow characters both main and supporting. It felt as of the creators took the goal of creating \u201cmysteriousness\u201d just slightly too far, and ended up with characters that simply lacked substance. Coupled with the lack of character development overall, it ended with an \u201cempty feeling\u201d rather than a satisfied one. Nevertheless however, its creative portrayal led to a game of imagination with my mind, and its dark atmosphere secured its place as an anime that questioned and depicted a world that was both emotionally stimulating and unforgettable. \\n",

Yes please!\r\nIn terms of story this anime is worth a watch, because even though it does have some of the stereotypical elements for this genre of anime it has a twist of mystery to it that lends to a somewhat unique strength, and weakness. The fact that mystery is tied in to the story makes it somewhat difficult to immerse oneself in to the story initially, but it also ends up adding an extra dimension to the plot and making it interesting. In terms of interaction with the characters, this mystery is what allows for the further development of the characters asthe story progresses, and makes what at first seems like a simple struggle between good and bad into something far more unsure and intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are interesting and relatable, and one of the strengths in the story is the fact that it is able to incorporate an appropriate if not masterful touch of comedy that does not seem out of place. This is one of the few series that makes the plot truly believable and the characters truly human and relatable. There will be emotional connections made with the characters' struggles.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the mood, this anime is exceptionally dark and serious. This is something I have not seen done in a captivating way often, but it is done here. \\n\\n\r\nThis is anime is for those looking for something serious, dark, and interesting. The only issue is some may need a little patience and perseverance to get into it. Although not high priority, it is a worthwhile watch.",

            "content": "Using my rating system:\r\nStyle - Brilliant. This show was extremely stylistic. The character designs and art was amazing. The animation was well done, the choreographic sequences well thought out. 3 out of 3 for this. \r\nCharacter - Very good but not quite perfect. Character development was one of the strongest points of Darker Than Black. In the first season there was character development in almost every episode, albeit most of them centering around disposable characters who were either immediately killed off or sent away. The last episode was a nice touch in that it brought back all of the dead or gone characters and gaveall of them something to say, and what they said was in character as well. In particular, Huang's development from someone who despises contractors for killing his best friend into someone who sacrifices his life for contractors after learning the truth about his former best friend was very nicely done. However, we don't really learn all that much about the main character, Hei. All we know is that he loves his sister and hates Contractors. It would have been better if the series focused more on Hei, rather than one-shot characters. So overall a 3 out of 4 for lack of character focus.\\n\\n\r\nStory - This is where the anime falls short. The story is actually quite nonsensical. So-called \"Gates\" appear out of nowhere, along with Contractors. None of this makes any sense and no attempt is made to explain this. There are vague references to particle physics but I think that only serves to increase the confusion even further. In summary - people randomly gain superpowers along with the power to suppress their feelings, but these people will all disappear when a certain natural artifact is destroyed. Hei prevents that artifact from being destroyed, thus saving the Contractors from extermination. Then there's the deal about Amber being the first contractor and the meteor shard being able to grant any wish inside the Gate...you know what, nothing makes any sense. 0 out of 3. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 6out of 10, dropped 3 points due to lack of character focus and nonsensical plot.",

            "content": "What do you get when you cross the X-men with anime? You get Darker than Black, an interesting little story about super powered humans and their never ending war against humans. Is it any good? Let's find out.\r\nStory:  Super powered humans known as 'contractors' are wreaking havoc and have been for quite some time in Tokyo. Each of these \"contractors\" have a unique super power that they use for their own personal gain. These contractors are presented in an interesting manner and the story behind them is the Anime's main story. Talking about it without spoiling anything is near impossible, but I will sayit is an intriguing tale that unfolds rather nicely and at a brisk pace. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Stiff and limited animation combined with some \"been there, done that\" art give the series a bland look. The characters themselves are well drawn/designed but not much can be said about their bland city scapes. The fight scenes look nice, though. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Some electric guitar riffs and the ocassional classical score set the mood here. The voice acting is very good, but the actors don't have much to work with, since the lines are delivered in a deliberately stoic way. The english dub is by far one of the best dubs I've heard along with one of the catchiest theme songs (Howling by Abignon Boys School). The one used after the season's half way mark (A song by Ane Cafe) is pretty catchy, but the first one personified the series better. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Some well designed albeit stoic characters drive the story forward. The characters here are very interesting, well developed and entertaining. Each of the contractor's special powers helps to personify them very well as well as the \"payment\" they have to make after using their powers. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.8/10\\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL REVIEW:\\n\r\nHere's where I write my shamelessly biased opinion:\\n\r\nThis anime is great. I mean GREAT. It is one of the best animes I have seen. A friend of mine recommended it to me and my expectations going into it were lower than low. I watched it with a scowl on my face but I was quickly won over by this show. The characters were what really got me. They are deep, interesting and very entertaining. The main character (Hei) is a very intriguing person which is developed quite nicely throughout the series. \\n\r\n The story is also great. It's mysterious and well paced. Most Animes pace their stories very very slowly, but Darker than Black manages to keep things moving without much filler. It's not a funny show in the least, but midway through we're introduced to a detective and his obnoxious little wench assistant. The detective serves as good comic relief since his story is interesting and he's a good character, but the little pink haired she-troll is cringe inducing.\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: Watch this. Seriously WATCH THIS SHOW. But DON'T watch its second season. It's horrible.\\n\r\nPersonal score: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"If you pretend to feel a certain way, the feeling can become genuine all by accident.\"\r\nA Review of \"Darker Than BLACK: Kuro no Keiyakusha\":\r\nI gave this show a lot of flack when I began watching it. In essence, the show bored me. Darker Than BLACK is not a show one goes into planning to watch an episode or two every couple days. In all honesty, the best way to watch this show and get the most enjoyment out of it would probably be to binge watch the entirety of it in a day or two. However, despite the many flaws that Darker Than BLACK has,my opinion of it has changed drastically since I started it.\\n\\n\r\nDarker Than BLACK: Kuro no Keiyakusha (or Darker Than BLACK: The Black Contractor) follows the struggles of Hei, a human with supernatural abilities that put him under the label of 'Contractor'. Contractos are basically humans with super powers who are hired by other people or organizations to perform dangerous tasks, which more likely than not means killing someone. There are a lot of elements of mystery in this show such as 'where did these powers come from?' and 'how do random everyday citizens deal with these contractors?'. Unfortunately, this is Darker Than BLACK's downfall. The shows spends so much time trying to promote this feeling of mystery and a dark mood that is completely forgets to explain anything well enough to be full comprehended. For example, the main portagonist's ability isn't even fully explained until several episodes into the show, which is after we've seen him use said ability many times. There's just so much in this show that is left unexplained or not fullt flushed out that it makes the viewer feel stupid, as if they missed something very obvious, and I really don't like that. However, one thing I will give the show props for is having mini-arcs that take up 2 episodes each (3 for the final mini-arc). It's really nice knowing that not only will the arc be more flushed out than one crammed into a single episode, but it also allows you to plan your watching of the show easier so you don't need to worry about excessive cliffhangers.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to say the characters are the force that drive this show, but that wouldn't be completely true. Instead I'll say that the force driving the show are the SUPPORTING characters, which is not something said often and not something I'm entirely sure is a good thing. The supporting cast changes almost every mini-arc, but it works out because their stories are very flushed out in the two episodes that the appear in, so there isn't much need for more development. The problem in this show exists with the main characters. It's not that they are porrly done or that they're bad characters as a whole, because they simply aren't. The issue is that they receive far less development and have less of an impact on the story than many of the supporting characters. In fact, for the first several arcs, Hei feels like a supporting role in his own show, like a vigilante who just sort of appears when called upon. This doesn't apply to all main roles, however, as the characters of Misaki and Huang actually get backstory episodes and do experience good development.\\n\\n\r\nSo if story and characters don't make a show, one must rely on sound and animation. And luckily, Darker Than BLACK handles these exteremely well. Starting with the openings, both \"Howling\" and \"Kakusei Heroism: The Hero Without a Name\" are very energetic themes that make you excited to watch the show, and for me were the driving forces to continue the show at some lower points towards the show's start. The soundtrack is good elsewhere too, and while there aren't really any tracks that specifically stick out to me, they did their part of making the show enjoyable to watch. For animation, this is what I believe to be the high point of the show. There are many actions scenes related to the superpowers of various contractors, and they are all done amazingly. I also like how the show sticks to it's title and uses a very dark color palette. It adds a lot to the atmosphere and makes the viewing experience all the more surreal\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, should you watch Darker Than BLACK? Well...it depends. Lots of things aren't explained until at least halfway throught he series and even then aren't explained to their fullest potential. As stated before, this show did turn itself around from the dullness of the beginning few arcs, but it took almost too long to get there. If you intend to watch this show, try your best to binge it, because that is how I think you will enjoy this show to it's fullest potential.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+Opening themes are both entertaining to listen to and fit the show very well\\n\r\n+Episodes divided into 2-episode mini-arcs\\n\r\n+Supporting cast is very well done and make each mini-arc worth watching\\n\r\n+The soundtrack is very fitting\\n\r\n+The animation is handled perfectly, especially during action sequences\\n\r\n+Very interesting story and concept\\n\r\n+Nice, fitting ending\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-Nothing is explained until at least halfway through the show and\\n\r\n-because of this, the beginning feels very slow and tedious\\n\r\n-Main characters aren't really that great most of the time\\n\r\n-Pacing. Pacing. Pacing\\n\r\n-Everybody dies (obviously an exaggeration, but don't get too attached to anyone)\\n\\n\r\nSo, Darker Than BLACK: Kuro no Keiyakusha did a 180 on me. I definitely started out disliking this show greatly and it frankly bored me. However, after giving it more time to develop after the halfway point, it showed that is was a very competent series with an intriguing story and a variety of good characters. With solid animation and sound throughout, I can now definitely recommend this show, as long as you are willing to give it a chance to grow on you, as opposed to going in expecting to be instantly wowed.\\n\r\nAnd that's why Darker Than BLACK: Kuro no Keiyakusha gets a 7 out of 10.",

I was a little turned off by the WTF ending and pseudo-astrological techno-conspiracy babble. Recently I discovered several mentions of it on TVTropes, under tropes that I don't recall seeing in the series, so I decided to rewatch it, especially since season II is upcoming.\r\nOnce again, I'm reminded of how tightly and gracefully choreographed the action is. But this time, I realized that DtB's true forte is in the telling of its characters' stories. The series handles character development with adeft but loving hand, showcasing in very humane ways their longings, inner struggles, losses and nebulous but persistent relationships. If one accepts the technomumble at face-value, as simply a manner of world-building, a stylistic backdrop, then the show becomes a meditation on the larger themes of identity, grief, personhood, redemption and loneliness. In this way, it is similar to Mushishi, in that the mushi simply serve as an excuse to delve into the circumstances and consequences of what are often heartbreakingly human failures.\\n\\n\r\nSeen this new light, DtB is really a series worth watching.",

The twists truly threw me for a loop, the writing is clever for the most part and the concept is unique with a really cool main character to follow.\r\nThe only genuine issue I have is the tonal juxtaposition between the main story and the light-hearted filler-ish episodes with a certain incredibly cheesy detectiveand his stereotype secretary. They do grow on you after a while but the transition initially was pretty jarring, annoying and broke up the story somewhat unnecessarily just as things started to get truly interesting. It's one of my favorite shows from the mid-2000s, but not without its flaws. Darker Than Black is an 9 out of 10 from me.",

As the story progresses, you learn more and more about the world occupied by these assassins, such as what Heaven and Hell's Gate are. \r\nThe first half of the series is split up into 2 episode segments where the infamous contractor BK-201, otherwise known as Hei,a contractor stuck in a cat's body named Mao, a seemingly emotionless doll named Yin, and their supervisor, Huang, carry out various missions. The second half is where all the climax reaches it's point and everything becomes clear. \\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black has a gripping and marvelous story packed with action and tension!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black has really good artwork, even for an anime.

            "content": "Darker than Black is one of those rare anime that isn't adapted from anything. It's been adapted but it started as an anime. It was written by Okamura Tensai in 2007. Okamura has been involved with several anime, some good and some terrible, but this is the only series I've seen that he did the writing for. So, let's see how he did. \r\nThe plot is pretty simple. There's a gate in Tokyo from some kind of incident that's never explained. What's important is that, because of the gate, several humans have developed super powers, some have become living dolls and the stars have becomeartificial. The artificial stars each correspond to a different super powered human called contractors because they have to pay a particular price when they use their powers. The episodes mainly follow a small group consisting of two contractors, a doll and a human working for a mysterious group called the Syndicate. It's similar to Bakuretsu Tenshi in that there's an over-arching plot but most episodes have very little if anything to do with it. Most of the series involves two part episodes of the main group going on various missions. The action sequences are solid and the episodes are usually interesting but there are a few issues. The biggest being the ending. It's very anti-climactic and some of the elements leading up to it are very weakly executed. Another issue is that some of the episodes are pretty weak.\\n\\n\r\nLike Bakuretsu Tenshi, this is primarily a character driven anime. The major characters are very well developed and have a lot of interesting facets. None of them are truly noble or heroic. All of them do some pretty terrible things but they're all very sympathetic characters who are just in bad circumstances. The fact that they do do some terrible things makes them seem more realistic and compelling. The only real issue is that some of the supporting characters are flat and very much extraneous. \\n\\n\r\nThe art varies. Usually it's really good. It has a dark tone, well defined characters, and good backgrounds. Sometimes that changes. They have one episode in particular involving a contractor who blows people apart but all they show after he's done are people with neat holes through them and a little bit of blood. It looks really obviously fake. The target audience for this is young adults. There shouldn't have been an issue with them making this sort of scene more realistic. If they really didn't want to, or the network standards stopped them from doing so, they should have avoided showing the bodies up close so frequently so it would be less noticeable. There are other scenes like that throughout the series where the art suffers, but there really aren't many. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is good, particularly from Mizuki Nana and Kiuchi Hidenobu. There are a few actors who give very emotionless performances but there's an obvious story reason for it and they do a good job of it. The music is mostly good, although some of it is a little weak. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1.5/10. There are a few scenes that seem a little homoerotic but there are very few and none of them go anywhere. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Darker than Black is a 7/10. It's a good anime. If you enjoy character-driven, episodic anime such as Bakuretsu Tenshi you'll probably enjoy it as well. If you want something with a more solid over-arching story, you'll probably want to watch something else.",

            "content": "Story: This anime was written and directed by Tensai Okamura who is responsible for animes like Sword Art Online or Soul Eater. The story is inteligent with not so many boring scenes. The story unfolds gradually with us getting to know more of the protagonist's back story from episode to episode. I criticize the detective episodes which I found boring. \r\nMain Characters: \r\nHeii (BK201) as main protagonist is \"emotionless\" killer and man who gained contractor powers. I've found him pretty decent , very well made and of course he was really good killer. For these reasons I quickly started to favor him and his backstory.\\n\\n\r\nYin , Mao and Huang they are also the main characters of the anime but they just support the main character Hei.\\n\r\nYin is emotionless doll , Mao is contractor without body and Huang is simple human.\\n\r\nFrom these 3 I really started to like Yin in the end.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki Kirihara is also one of the main characters but I think of her as Sakura of Naruto XD simply, useless.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Studio Bones showed us that they can make a pretty decent show like it was with Noragami or Fullmetal Alchemist. Animation is fluent and natural even with Heii's spiderman strings :D\\n\\n\r\nMusic: To be honest I don't remember the ending or opening one day after watching this anime. There is the main problem. The music was shapeless , BUT one of the OTSs ,the total eclipse, was one of the songs that when you hear it ,you've got the goosebumps ,because you know that s**t is about to go down.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI know that my english isn't the best but I hope I helped you with your next anime choice.\\n\r\nIt's my first review so I would be gratefull for your comments and constructive criticizm , good or even bad.",

            "content": "Darker than black is Japan's version of X-Men in an anime series form. They both share similar concepts like \"mutants\" and \"contractors\", and neither show explains how an individual gains supernatural powers. But I'm not here to make comparisons, because frankly, I like DtB more.\r\nStory: \r\n\"Bearing the sins of the children of earth, the moon began to consume it's light.\"\r\nThe story is told in an episodic form, with 2 episodes covering one short arc. To be honest, the first episode in every arc is a bit boring because there's more dialogue than action. (I found myself dragging my feet to watch the first couple ofepisodes until you reach the end and realize that what you watched was a masterpiece) And when there is action, it's orgasmic with wonderful choreography and animation. That's not something you see usually. \\n\\n\r\nYou'll find yourself asking a lot of questions, a few will be answered later on but most will go unanswered. But that does NOT affect your enjoyment of the series. I guarantee you will be confused with the numerous terms and words thrown at you and you'll have to use the dictionary(\"Remuneration\" was a word I didn't know) or search on the wiki to see what they mean. Although it doesn't bother you when you finally understand them or not. \\n\\n\r\nYou may worry if the story has a good closure, as anyone worries whether the main character will actually fall in love in a RomCom, I assure you the story ends with a satisfying conclusion \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe art is well done and there are a range of different and distinct character designs, but kept simple. (Not like those disproportional eyes in relation to other facial features).  Hei's attire is pure badass, a simple black trench coat and a white mask with a purple bolt to represent his power(hint: It's electrifying people). Many people compare him to batman, which he does look like slightly, with less emphasis on his theme (Batmans got well, bat ears and a bat logo across his chest) like an assassin should. (I swear April looks just like storm from X-men)\\n\\n\r\nFight scenes are beautifully choreographed as said before, and the different contractor powers unique to each character are sexy. Gotta love that blue outline and glowing red eyes when contractors activate their power. MHMMMM WEI'S BLOOD DISINTEGRATION POWERS SNAP SNAP SNAP coughroymustangcough.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nYokko Kanno is the composer responsible for the music in this series. She's a renowned composer famous for her music and DtB is no exception. The jazzy themes that play during fight/chase scenes (e.g. see: Go Dark) are different from intense classical music you may usually hear during most of those kinds of scenes, but they fit well nonetheless. Some standout pieces are: \"Go Dark\", played during fight/chase scenes, \"Yin No Piano\", a piano piece that would be considered Yin's theme, and finally \"Nobody's home\", which plays initially at the end of the second episode(where a certain contractor's dead body is found by the police in a river) and during sad scenes. When it first played, it gave me chills down my spine, and that was when I knew this series was gonna be good. \\n\\n\r\nBoth openings aren't too bad either, and the second one's pretty catchy. Hope y'all enjoy the music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\\n\r\nHei is a badass and fun to watch. That's all. (JK They're all great)\\n\\n\r\nThere are also many additional side characters such as comedic relief Gai and his assistant who was hilarious, April, July and November 11. One could argue that the presence of the police officer Misaki was unecessary, but I say it's to provide a different perspective through the eyes of an ordinary human. She also helps explain some detail the viewer will likely need.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series so much I occasionally fantasize about being Hei, swinging from buildings with his grappling hook and electrocuting bad guys. Ain't that great? Thing is to be Hei takes a lot of effort, you gotta be a gymnast, be able to do parkour, martial arts, throw knives AND be a contractor. Sigh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n\"If you pretend to feel a certain way, the feeling can become genuine all by accident.\"- Hei\\n\\n\r\nThis series is good and there's no need to pretend to feel it. So go watch it!\\n\\n\r\nIt would be great if there was a third season, or a movie, or a game, just give me more...\\n\\n",

            "content": "haven't done a review in a long time because of all the computer troubles. But I had to do a review of one of my favorite animes. It is one of the best series I have seen. I first started watching this on Netflix and my mom walked into a guy breaking his own fingers and freaked. But I convinced her to give it a chance. She loves it now and sings along with the ending song Tsukiakari lol Not to mention she found the main character extremely hot ( HE IS !!!!! )\r\nLet me start with the story. Darker than Black or Kuro noKeiyakusha\\n\\n\r\nIt is based in Tokyo where 10 years ago a force called Hell's gate appeared in Tokyo. When it came some people started becoming heartless ,merciless  contractors. They are sorta like the Terminator but they can blend in with society and act like a normal person. When really they are powerful . But the down side is they have no remorse for killing and always follow a objective.  The government keeps it secret from everyone else and there is a special task force to control the contractors. Parts of the world use these contractors though for military and missions. A group called the Syndicate uses Contractors for a war  called \"Heaven's War\"but it goes wrong and causes chaos.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a man named Hei who is a contractor trying to find his sister after she goes missing at Heavens war.Hei is a spy and assassin but is different from other contractors. Unlike the other contractors he seems to be following his own agenda and actually has feelings. But yet he has the powers and incredible strength. He kills day and night and always stays elusive. No one knows who he is because he hides behind a  awesome mask and trenchcoat. Hei is shrouded in mystery to people but they only see him  as a happy normal man with his fake name of Lei. The government is trying to find the man behind the mask that they call \"The Black Reaper\"\\n\\n\r\nWatch this because I gave this a 10/10 and it is dramatic, beautiful, action filled and amazing !",

            "content": "WOW, this anime dates back to when I was just 9 years old. The year 2007 brought up some awesome shows like Death Note, Naruto Shippuden, Kaze no Stigma etc. including this post's topic Darker than Black. With 25 episodes it got an overall rating of 8,31 and ranked as #202, what I don't get, because personally I would give it a 6,5. Why? Let's discuss... \r\nPlot and Storyline:\r\nI am sorry if there are fans of this anime that are reading this but I really didn't like this anime. It tired me and I was about to give it up a couple of times. Itwas because the whole time something was going on but I didn't know why. Every episode was kinda the same without any goal or reason. Trough the whole anime a tiny spark of what the main character is trying to reach keeps flashing but it literary just matters in the last 5 episodes. Besides, the last 5 episodes made the show. \\n\r\nIn the beginning of the story you meet Li, a guy that moved from China to Japan to study there. But Li or better known as Hei or even BK201 just wants the outside world to think that. See, 13 years ago two gates appeared, the Heaven's gate in South America and the Hell's gate in Japan. (Just to make things clear, the whole series is about these gates but nobody knows what they are or when exactly they appeared. This is the biggest plot hole I ever came across). With the appearance of these 2 gates special people with powers called Contractors and Dolls emerged.(What brings us to one more plot hole, with whom did they sign that contracts?). The thing is Contractors are merciless killers with no emotions and Dolls are just dolls with powers, they are being controlled. Hei is also a Contractor and that's about the whole story. Let's move on to the Characters...\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIn the series it's said that the dolls and contractors are emotionless, but I don't think so. They've been just told so and that's it. However you still don't get to meet any character because of that. I analysed two of the main characters but it's really hard to say something special about them...\\n\r\nHei: BK201 is his code name in the police. He really is a merciless killer but deep down there you can see a spark of good inside him. That tiny spark was lit by the flames of his past, that vanished with the destruction of the Heaven's gate in South America. He is trying to understand what really happened there and he will find out but in the very end...\\n\r\nMisaki: The Section-Cheff of the Foreign Affairs Section 4 who is investigating matters that concern Contractors. She is a hard-working young lady that gave her life a full-time job. She tried to escape it a couple of times but no. She always keeps coming back to her suit and gun. What she really proved in the end is the humanity she believes in. At least someone. \\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nWhen I heard Haven's and Hell's gate, I imagined it kinda like a spirit portal in Avatar: Legend of Korra, but instead it came like Attack on titan. The gate as I saw it was nothing else than just an area surrounded with huge walls. Boom, interest ruined. When it comes to the character looks and screenplay I liked it. Just the eyes of some characters including Hei were strange somehow. What's more the animation and diversity of the Contractor powers were great. Nine out of Ten for animation.\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nSee when I watch anime I am usually sad because it's ending. Well this time I was just glad that it finished. An anime shouldn't be like this. All the plot holes, (and I am not talking about some background stories of supporting characters) really just made me tired. Maybe some flashbacks from the past and 10 episodes less would have made it better. I think the makers had no idea of what they were doing. Still the main reason why I was so disappointed is that I searched for a good anime about powers. I got powers, but that alone is not enough. Good thing Naruto is still airing. \\n\r\nA bit of action can't fix that much of a plot hole. Sorry Darker than Black but you're not a favorite of this AnimeGirl....",

There are contractors that appeared after Hells Gate who have inhuman abilities for a certain price. They work for a secret organization called \u201cthe Syndicate\u201d and the rest is a mystery. Hei is one of them, the anime starts with him doing different missions (each mission is unique and interesting) and then it kicks it up. Later you get to learn more about the past, Hei\u2019s team mates,Syndicate and their plans. The way they tell this story is amazing, the suspense is awesome with many mysteries.\\n\r\nCharacters: The presentation of the characters is also done almost perfectly. Each one of them is unique and realistic compared to other animes. Most of the main chars carry some memory/mystery from the past that make them one of a kind.  They are designed well and deep, great art work too.\\n\r\nAnimation:  The animations are flawless to me, clean, well made and high quality. The action scenes are very detailed and enjoyable. Now you can get it in HD 1080p so it looks even more amazing.\\n\r\nConclusion:   This is definitely an anime that would fall in my top 5, its great from all points of view, great story, development, keeps you interested and a lot more. One of the best things I like is the mysteries behind the characters and the story. It leaves you with many questions and suspense.",

Character development was the worst I have ever seen. I did not get attached to the characters even slightly, I know nothing about them and I'm atepisode 16, let alone anything about the main storyline, which constantly remains a mystery. This show is a lot like Lost, cool concept, interesting art, but no direction.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I had a hard time feeling engaged with the story because I never got properly attached to the characters, it feels like a chore to watch this anime.",

            "content": "Darker than BLACK is an interesting series brought to us by animation studio BONES. It's also an oddity in anime where the battles are more interesting than the actual show. Read further for my explanation.\r\nUnlike most anime, most of Darker than BLACK's episodes are almost entirely two-parters. The plot is usually the following: Hei (in his \"college transfer student\" Li persona) interacts with people (talking to his apartment neighbors, go shopping, etc.), then talks to Mao, gets a mission from Huang, does it, meets someone, some plot occurs, Yin may/may not show up, and the contractor of the arc dies or gets away. On itsown it doesn't sound like much, and you'd be right. Hei is a cool, versatile character, but he's also a bit dull in his Black Reaper. The other leads - stoic doll Yin, grumpy human Huang, and talking cat Mao - fill up the quartet. My personal favorite was Mao, who occasionally lighten the mood with some humorous insight/reactions. Huang's interesting in that he is the only one of the four who is 100% human, but he's often pushed aside amongst the other cast members. Yin's character design stands out quite a bit, and her later character development actually explains quite a bit of her past, more so than I thought the show would.\\n\\n\r\nOne of Darker than BLACK's biggest strengths/weaknesses is the commitment you're required of the show. If you want to learn more about Hei, Yin, and Huang, you're going to have watch the entire series from beginning to end, since a good chunk of their backstories (save Yin's) aren't revealed until nearly the end. This isn't a bad thing, because it gives you a reason to continue watching the series. At the same time, the show can be a pain in times to sit through; no matter how much I tried, I couldn't get into the main plot of the series. Not only does the focus of Hei and his past jump around to several different views  more than I thought was needed, but it's also not very gripping. I found myself more interested in the simpler stories, etc Huang's past relationships, and even the humorous detective Gai and Kiko. I know Hei is the main character, but his past just eats up so much of the time in the series, the other main characters barely get an episode or two about themselves. Mao is brushed off almost completely! This isn't helped by policewoman Misaki's storylines, which are often entangled into (or shown in-between) Hei's missions, which only brings about even more names/terms to remember.\\n\\n\r\nIt might be confusing at times, but fortunately Darker than BLACK's battles are pretty good, especially the Contractors Hei fights against. Not just their powers, but the fact that each Contractor's abilities come at a price. Some are of them are quite costly, while others are light-hearted and even humorous. (One Contractor has to kiss people upon using her abilities. Yes, I'm not joking.) Sure, most of these powers have been seen in American comic books - X-Men especially - but the Contractors' prices for the use of their powers adds quite a bit of flavor to the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Darker than BLACK is many things, one thing it's not is pleasant. Deaths happen periodically, and few of the Contractors introduced in an arc live past it, much less are ever seen again. Even the more light-hearted episodes  have their dark turns in them. Except for Mao and some of the daily scenes with Hei dealing with his rowdy apartment neighbors, Darker than BLACK's only other consistent source of humor comes from self-proclaimed \"best detective in Japan\" Gai Kurasawa and his assistant, the bubbly, pink-haired, anime/manga fantatic Kiko Kayanuma. They clash more than a bit with the typically serious tone of the show, but they also at the same time provide a nice break from the series' drama.\\n\\n\r\nAs earlier mentioned, the art is pretty solid in Darker than BLACK, courtesy of BONES. The characters are all pretty easy to tell apart with few exceptions, and some designs (like Yin and Amber's) are colorful and quite memorable. The animation isn't stellar, but it never gets embarrassing or awful. The music score by Yoko Kanno perfectly fits the series' mood and never feels out of place, even in the more lighthearted scenes. The Japanese voice acting is pretty standard, with the exception of the late Tomoko Kawakami as Amber. Amber was one of Kawakami's final anime roles before her unfortunate 2011 death, and it's good to know that one of her final anime roles was a very solid one. \\n\\n\r\nDarker than Black looks like the kind of thing I would have tried when I was getting into anime. It takes elements familiar to Western geeks - superheroes, spies and syndicates - and colors these concepts with interesting twists and details, adds cool animation and music, and drops it in a weird urban post-apocalypse. It feels like a safe choice for any casual fan",

            "content": "Finally, a series that addresses how people with super-powers would be viewed by the government: a threat.\r\nSTORY: Darker Than Black is a perfect mixture of action, mystery, and superpower fiction.  It takes place in a world much like our own, except there was an incident leading to the existence of \"Contractors\" who are imbued with powers like electrical blasts, possession, freezing, weather, etc.  Each contractor must pay a price after using their powers - which can range from fun (like drinking), nothing major (baking), annoying (smoking for a non-smoker), or terrible (drinking the blood of children).  The Contractors are also said tobe purely rational, although it is difficult to see that 100% the case and one ends up wondering if it is more of an initial manifestation state that is later reinforced by expectation.  There are also \"Dolls\" that are emotion-less telepathic like entities that can monitor Contractors but do not seem to exhibit any personality.  The story starts off as a mission-of-the-week type series involving the protagonist who serves a mysterious, seemingly-criminal entity called the Syndicate, but evolves into a Contractors v. Normal main series that is quite enjoyable.  The story line is meant to be dark, but not existential bleak dark.  Think instead dark but fun.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Top notch work by Bones.  This studio tends to put out the best stuff.  The fight scenes are great!\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, as it follows the storyline - whether action packed or melancholy perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Almost all of the characters are well developed, not just the protagonist.  Even characters that originally seem like a one-note get fleshed out nicely and usually surprisingly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  This is my all-time favorite anime series.  In my view it beats everything I've seen.  I've been looking for a better anime series, and after watching Geass, Gundam, Eureka 7, Gurren, Phantom, Bebop (saw it before), NGE, and others I have yet to find one.  If Bones decides to stop after the OVA's it's currently putting out I'll be bummed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The best of what anime has to offer, don't miss this one!\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime has got to be one of the hardest animes to follow that I've watched. The plot was just very complicated and the ending still leaves me with questions. Any way lets dive in.\r\nSo the plot is about that Heavens Gate has opened up in South America and I believed it ended up destroying it, and now an organization called the Syndicate is trying to open up Hells Gate in Japan to kill all contractors. What is a contractor? Well a contractor is a person who has traded his conscience for special powers. It gets a lot more complicated and there are a lotmore facts added on to the story or something, but generally for me, it was hard to follow. I'm not gonna tell any spoilers, but the ending was just a huge question mark for me. It left me saying ,\"How does that solve anything?\" If you already watched it, well you might see what I'm talking about, unless you completely memorized every single plot element and think that there's no plot holes or something. So the ending just left me confused.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'll talk about the characters. Hei, our protagonist, is one of my favorite anime characters and is the only thing keeping this anime alive for me. Without Hei, I would've just probably fallen asleep while watching Darker Than Black. Why I like him? He does like to eat a lot, he's a badass, and I just tend to really like anti heroes in anime. Seriously, antiheros are my favorite type of characters in anime. I guess he also kind of looks like me, but thats just a personal reason. He is also very caring to another one of the characters, Yin. So Yin is a doll and a doll is a person, usually little children, that really don't have a conscience or free will. She's just very quiet cause that's how all of the dolls are in this anime. Some other characters include Huang who really doesn't get much screen time, but there was one episode that talked about his backstory. There's also Mao, who is a contractor in the form of a nekko cause I think his power is to switch bodies or something like that, but there are probably restrictions to it. There are also these two characters named Kurosawa and Kiko who appear in a few episodes throughout the anime. They're just your typical comedic filler characters. Another major character is Misaki who is hunting down Hei cause I guess she's in the FBI or something like that, but she's not actually a bad guy. The last character I'm going to mention is Amber, and she's why I was so confused at the end. I'm not going to tell you cause of spoilers. Hei is the only really good and memorable character in this anime and he's the only reason why I don't hate it.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the action scenes a lot cause it was very fast paced and realistic unlike Dragonball Z where you have the characters stare at each other for 5 minutes until they begin (DBZ is still epic though). It seemed a lot more realistic I suppose. The openings and endings weren't anything too special. I did like the art cause I guess it fit in really good. I watched it in sub and I think it might've been another reason why I didn't enjoy it as much cause I'm a dub fan.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it up, this anime wasn't anything too special for me cause the plot was very confusing at the end. If you go watch  Darker Than Black Gemini Of The Meteor, the ending there was also kind of like that. If Hei wasn't the main character, I think I might have dropped this anime cause the action scenes while good, probably won't keep me too into the anime if the plot wasn't so confusing. All the other characters were mostly forgettable in my opinion. So yeah, Thx for reading.",

            "content": "The story is set at a time when giant no man\u2019s land known as Heaven\u2019s Gate and Hell\u2019s Gate suddenly appear into the world. It is not literally a gate per se but a very huge piece of land mass completely non-habitable at the opposite side of the Earth. Mysterious things came into being with its appearance. The place itself is feared so much as it led the humans to create a massive wall around it in order to hide the fearsome unknown inside it. Also with it are the appearance of the fake stars (replacing the real ones) and the appearance of the contractors,dolls among others.\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on the contractor Hei and his group, being agents of a mysterious organization known as the \u201cSyndicate,\u201d they do detective works, assassinations, intelligence gathering, and in many circumstances fight with other organizations. \\n\\n\r\nThe beginning was very confusing as not much is explained to the various mysteries revolving the world of Darker than Black, the pacing is more like a snail pace and the series are divided into several arcs each having at least 2 episode that are interdependent from the other arcs, it could very well be standalones but each offer hints that when sum up together actually tells the story. While some arcs may be a bit uninteresting, there are several others \u2013 the one that focuses on the actual story are very well done. The pacing eventually gets better during the middle part of the series with the introduction of some key characters and groups that will become the main focus of the series towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe mysteries surrounding the Gates is actually the series strongest element in my opinion, almost nothing at all is revealed about it but the series actually spend a lot of time with the characters and organizations trying to solve the mystery behind it, some of which will succeed and others will not but it all comes with a prize and I applaud this setup because I\u2019m with the people with the mentality that some mysteries are better not explained (let the viewers imagine the rest), explaining it only kills the enjoyment, the thrill, and the tension that comes with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is conveyed in a more serious tone. The background art is rather bland but there is something about it that will make the viewers says that it is done in style and of high production values. The same thing can be said with the character designs; the characters are designed in such a way to appeal to the more mature audiences.  The animation is fluid and life-like especially the movements of the characters and the fights scenes are very creatively choreograph which sometimes can be visually impressive.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the Opening and Ending Themes are great, very catchy and enjoyable to listen. The soundtracks on the other hand are pretty decent which are good to listen when watching the series. As for voice acting, the actors did a pretty good job giving life to the characters they portrayed in the series. I especially like the voice of Kuichi Hidenobu as Hei, he made Hei into someone very cool sounding as well as a dependable. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost all the characters in Darker Than Black are likeable. Hei as the main character has some very good character development. At first he is very cold, lifeless, emotionless, but as the story progress, he eventually started showing emotions and more human character. The same can be said for the other characters on his group, at first they all act like every day is just another day of work but as bits of their histories are eventually revealed, they all acted looking for each another especially in their most challenging times. My favorite character beside Hei is Yin, she is called a \"doll\" also being cold at first, lifeless, emotionless at first but her development is also quite spectacular on the end. The series boast some really huge number of characters, all-in-all they did a very good job in portraying their respective roles be it major or minor ones.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of contractors doing \"remuneration\" as payment for using their powers is a very refreshing concept. I particularly like it because it post several limitations to the users which generally mean that they cannot just go around and fight as they will adding a more realistic feel to the fights and made the characters more vulnerable instead of being invincible and all powerful. This check and balances made the series a great find.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is full of mystery, action, secret organizations, sci-fi concepts, and great characters, add to it are good production value, nice animation, a well designed story and a carefully constructed plot. As a whole, Darker Than Black is very solid and fun to watch amidst the slow pace in the early parts of the story and an ending that leaves a lot to be desired which comes up pretty open ended. As for my final note, the series is recommended for viewers with interest on the aforementioned themes above.  \\n",

            "content": "So \"Darker than Black\" drew me in by the title.\"Darker than Black\"?That's a pretty cool title.Anywho,this series is okay,for a series that explains little to nothing, has almost no character development and is a little overall confusing, it does a good job to entertain.\r\nThe story is pretty complicated to begin with. Some explosion occurs five years prior and we lose Latin America(might be the other way around though 'cause I'm forgetful)and then the sky disappears and they build a gate around Tokyo to keep them away from some forbidden area. Oh and some supernatural beings that look like humans appear that are called \"Contractors\".We enterthe life of one; Hei and his adventurous of fighting and killing pretty graphically other contractors.\\n\r\nI can say it's pretty interesting, the episodes are in arcs and only midway to the show they start to have some little consistency and follow some story. Other than that it's just Hei going along with the orders he is given to \"eliminate\" some useless material.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nSo let's start with the art. The art is pretty, it's obviously on a low budget but however it manages to be nice to look at.Character design is nice and very beautiful.The art's a bit strange though since they supposedly lost their sky and have a counterfeit which at nighttime is green.Yes people,green,the sky is green at night with lots of fake stars.\\n\r\nThere is one element I really liked that I only noticed it when it actually started to happen it real life.The element of rain.It rains a lot for a large amount of episodes of this series and not for dramatic reasons,it just rains. Like Hei steps out of his house to go buy some groceries and it starts raining.The rain added a very mysterious and cool atmosphere to the show.\\n\r\nIt has very enjoyable action, nice movements,interesting opponents. The opponents actually have a personality here other than the usual we see in such genres and most of them are very likeable.\\n\r\nThe characters are fairly interesting,Hei is shady,literally,he shows a different personality according to whom he speaks to.He really is this gloomy,serious dude but to most he is this shy,clumsy and polite fellow who always says hello.Yin is promising but we don't get much about her. Huang is much more likable then at first.The cop lady is forgettable and rather annoying.Her presence serves nothing at all to the show.To be honest all the contractors are much more interesting then the \"normal\" people.\\n\r\nThe music is okay, the OP is nice, done by the Abington Boys School,they usually have nice tracks.The EDs are forgettable.The OST is okay,it has a variety of music from jazz, to pop to rock.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nThere isn't much explained,ever.Like you watch the whole thing expecting something to happen but it doesn't.Even the last episode is like...totally random.I mean literally, it's just random.\\n\r\nThere is some comic relief by a detective and his secretary?(I'm not sure what she was).They were pretty random too, like you have all this gore and fighting going on and then them who look like they came out of Lucky Star or something.They added nothing to the story either,it seemed that  the plot was aiming for something more serious but these guys just blew that away.\\n\r\nThe use of CGI is annoying.It's used for the cars, but you see a lot of cars here and everytime I just wanna bang my head against the wall it's so bad.\\n\r\nThe characters are ALL promising but none of them get the attention they deserve.Okay Hei does,but you really don't understand anything by what they give you!\\n\\n\r\nOverall you have this promising plot that looks likes it's going somewhere but doesn't(and I heard the second season is just a different arc) and promising characters that are left hanging on a cliff.This story tried to be good, it succeed in many things but failed in many others.It really is all over the place, like the final episodes are so darn complex, it's like the writer wanted to say all these things but didn't have the time so tried to explain everything is one episode of 20 minuets.\\n\r\nDarker than Black is enjoying and if you choose to watch this you will be entertained there is no doubt about that.But don't expect anything too deep and don't expect any conclusion 'cause nothing is ever concluded or explained.\\n",

            "content": "Darker than Black is one of the best of its kind. The anime covers not only incredibly visually pleasing action sequences, but a good story to boot (something I find difficult to see meshed together). \r\nOne of the most crucial elements in creating an action anime is to be sure the viewers like what they'll be seeing a lot of: action. Darker than Black, a product of Aniplex, never disappointed me once. The fights are fluid, speeds wavering between slow and quick, and seldom include distractions. They're made expertly to keep the interest of the viewer in tact, and they never last too long. Saygoodbye to three episodes of the same battle in the rain, because this anime keeps fights short and sweet- only frequent.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the action sequences would be enough to appreciate, but I was pushed further into my gratitude with the accompanying music. Yoko Kanno, musical composition for Cowboy Bebop (and a whole lot more), was the mastermind behind the art here, and oh how it shows. A few of the songs, sound similar to what you may have heard in Cowboy Bebop, or hear if you've never seen the show, even bringing back the incomparable crackled voice of Mai Yamane. \\n\\n\r\nWith the quality of the production being high, high, high, all that's left is to dig into the story itself. While the characters play typical roles of another action anime you may have seen (go on, pick one), they manage to be clearly defined characters, rather than just stamps for the sake of the plot. While some recurring side roles may be a little weaker, I feel it's safe to say they aren't too bothersome. The focus veers away from their roles anyhow. \\n\\n\r\nI was greatly impressed with the story. While at first, I felt the plot was left with a few holes, and kept quiet and vague just because that's what action anime typically does best, I found as the story progressed, that it's all done of purpose, and with very good reason. I'm staying away from summaries and spoilers here, so I'm going to cut it short, but I was overwhelmed with joy at discovering an action anime that keeps it's motives hidden to reveal them when it makes sense to be revealed. Frustration played little to no part in my watching of the show. \\n\\n\r\nGranted, there may be some weaker points, such as; why does it take until the last six episodes to start gently laying down the point to why things have been going on (a little more information might have been helpful before, but at least I wasn't left in the dark, or pummeled at the very end, right?), or why did that man's hand suddenly become a fourth the size of his face (the wonderful animation flaws of Aniplex. I'm pretty sure I spotted a mystery dot appearing and disappearing for a few seconds on a white wall, too). But for an action anime, I still remain impressed.\\n\\n\r\nGood work, Darker than Black! \\n\\n\r\n-shoujokiss7",

            "content": "First off you must trust me when i say, Darker Than Black, is one of the Amine that you are better off not watching. If you condemn yourself to such a miserable action, it'll be a waste of your precious time doing laundry or anything trivial for that matter.\r\n    Originally I had Darker Than Black on my Dropped List, however due to its excessive occurrence on people's favorite list i decided to give it another chance. And Oh God i wish i hadn't. Starting with it's pathetic Story, Hell's and Heavens Gate appear and alongside their appearance theappearance of contractors and certain beings called dolls. You soon feel the presence of an organization also know as the syndicate lurking in the shadows, several other factors emerge such as foreign intelligence, foreign organizations, all these playing the role of disrupting the peace in the city of Tokyo. All this happening without the knowledge of the citizens, thanks to the process of Memory Erasal, which you do not capture a glimpse off , through the entire series.You lose track of whose working with who shortly after the beginning of the series, and things starts to mess up. Several Unanswered Questions and Unjustified Events start to pile up, and you innocently believe that all these will be answered later on in the series. You realize your falling flat on your face towards the last 4-5 episodes of the series where you thought its time things got clear, and they don't. In the end you will sit for a few minutes trying to figure out what the hell did just happen. Overall all the writer really messed this up. His inability to conduct reasons for the events that occur throughout the series, and the lack of consistency of the story line is crystal clear. In my opinion the writer sought interest in various big ideas within several different Anime and tried to mold them all into a single storyline, which in turn turned out to be a serious failure. The storyline and it's many details and unanswered questions, proved to require a lot of work and time to attend too, therefore it was decided to lay off matters with a quick and irrelevant finish.\\n\\n\r\n    Concerning the Art, am not that much of an expert,however i can say they've done a good job throughout the series, except for the times when they used Computer Generated Images for cars and vehicles. \\n\\n\r\n    About the Music well its the most decent thing about the series. Various soundtracks serve the role of emphasizing the impact of events onto you. \\n\\n\r\n  Another major failure in the series are the characters. Although stated numerous times throughout the series that contractors and dolls have no soul therefore have no emotions, they are the ones that show most emotions. I don't know what the writer wanted to accomplish with this paradox, however it will leave you in a state of dilemma questioning the actions of each character. Another major detail i should point out is the unjustified behavior of the characters, you simply wont get the reasons behind their actions, or the basis behind their relationships.\\n\\n\r\n   Well i must admit, if it was not for the few and brief (and i emphasize both) moments of pleasure, the level of enjoyment would have been 0.\\n\\n\r\n   In the end i know many of you will hate me for this review. however i gave my honest opinion about it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n I forgot the excessive Pizza Hut product placement.",

            "content": "In four word : confusing yet brilliantly intirguing.\r\n(review in short at bottom)\r\nStory : at first Darker than Black starts out really well in terms of story, introducing the characters and building up to the climax ect. But I found that at one point they threw a few too many confusing terms at you such as anti-gate matter particles ... so much so that I got a bit confused when the ending came around. However by the time the series had ended I had a basic understanding of the ending. Despite the confusion it is possible to follow the story and completley enjoy the characters andtheir exploits. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt : I frankly love the drawing style of this series, all the characters are very well drawn and all of the individual techniques of the contractors are portrayed well. Another highlight of this series is the animation, because this series is quite heavily combat based you should expect great fight scenes. Darker than Black doesn't dissapoint, the fighting excells with fluid and precise animation. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound : Darker than Black has some pretty good music (especially opening one , Abingdon Boys School - Howling). Both openings fit the series well along with the endings. Even the osts are very impressive and match the dramatic and light parts of the series. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : for a resonably short series it's quite impressive how much development each character gets for example you have Hei's past at war, Yin as a child and Huang getting decieved by a woman. All of the character development leads to an intersting and entertaining plot. Darker than Black has a large amount of interesting minor characters, even if you don't get much information on them you still get the enjoyment of witnessing their powers as a contractor.8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment : overall this series is a pleasure to watch and is quite mentally stimulating. It has great art and sound along with a host of interesting and individual characters. You may get a tad confused but it's easy enough to rewatch for a better uderstanding. A smart and well developed series. 8/10",

            "content": "WOO Darker than Black. Despite what you've probably heard about the second season being terrible (key words \"what you may have heard\" not that \"it is\") the first season is just one of those super solid shows. In the show an unexplained event happens prior to the main story that basically gave a lot of people different kinds of powers (super cut and dry, I don't need to elaborate much more). Said people are called contractors, as they must hold a contract of habitually doing something every time they use their powers. The synopsis is unexplained but simple, but the story is rather sporadic. Themain arc focuses on a group of police officers looking for contractors in Tokyo outside of a walled area called Hell's Gate. Amidst their journeys they frequently come across the protagonist named Hei, an assassin who works for a contractor group called the Syndicate. First let's talk about Hei, he's what drives the show, and while stoic, his quiet personality fits well with what he's supposed to be doing. Not much is revealed about his past, but it hints at it with his many experiences with other contractors, another guiding factor of the show. The plot adds to this as well, as it feels like a typical cop drama meets X-men type deal, and is a fairly unique skeleton for the plot that adds to the experience. The action throughout the show is entertaining, but it's redundant that I should say that, but I liked that most fights were pretty different from each other, as all contractors who fight Hei have different abilities. Speaking of the abilities, the environments, action, and characters are all extremely well animated, drawn, and colored, and that's perhaps the best part of the show.The only problems I had with the show was the constant serious tone, only to get a moderately forced bad chemistry detective duo later in the season. And as I said before the show never fully explains what happened prior to the series chronology or why it's significant (i.e. everything about Hei's sister) and that was frustrating for me personally. And that means only one thing, I have to attempt season 2. However I would recommend this anime to pretty much anyone, the plot is balanced even if they skim over too much that needs explanation, characters interesting, and it's very pretty. Good show.",

Remember that Hei means black in Chinese and Bai means white.\r\nOverall: Animes similar to Darker than Black are truly very rare. It is unique with its mind blowing awesomeness. It doesn't try to buff itself with ridiculous power ups like Bleach or Naruto, but rather uses its great storyline to keep the viewer interested. It explores the idea of conscience in humans while mixing in amazing action scenes, original antagonists with unique and non-cliche abilities.\r\nCharacter: Most character are developed enough to make you sympathize with them, those who aren't developed areundeveloped for a reason. At least it feels that way rather than leaving the viewer wondering why they were there in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I loved all four ops and eds,they are bands that had performed for mainstream animes like Bleach, Naruto and Gundam Seed Destiny. If you liked the anime, you will almost definitely love the music.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Because it is relatively new, it has great action scenes and they're not completely computer generated that leaves you with a cheap sense of over budgeting like blassreiter.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Amazing, anything i would try to use to support would be considered a spoiler.

Whenever he shows up, your heart starts to race because everything had lead up to that moment and you know he's going to make something happen. \r\nSeriously, watch this show. It has gore and violence, but nothing any more excessive than what the story allows. Something I really have to note, Hei, is not invincible or unbeatable like other protagonists who just blindly punch enemies into submission. The protagonist often retreats just like the antagonist.Often is key here, and when he does, you realise that something about him is... different.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Updated for accuracy and details\\n\\n\r\nStory: Excellent, while some might not like how it ended or how information was revealed, it never needed to be revealed in any other way. We see things happening through the eyes of Hei, and Misaki, who you could say are on opposite sides, but you don't know who's good and who's bad until the end. I thought the story was perfect, but I have to give it a 9 simply because some things won't please everyone.\\n\\n\r\nHei was a killer when he was younger, before he ever got any powers, because of his sister, but continued even after she disappeared. He's an interesting character and he's one of my favourite to watch simply because I'm constantly impressed by what he says or does, and how well he fights. He's not indestructible, but he is usually tactical. But! Every special power user, or contractor has to pay a kind of price, from eating a flower to drinking blood in one disturbing case.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about this show is characters and character development, but I'll get into that later.\\n\\n\r\nArt: They save most of their money for the fight scenes, and it's worth it. It's amazing to watch people fight up close where the slightest touch could result in someone's head being blown off. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Perfect, I love the voice overs in English, I love the sound effects, environment sounds and audio tracks. As soon as the Black Reaper shows up, music kicks in and an intense fight follows.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I've watched this show 3 times already and still love it. The OVAs are great too and generally have to do with Hei and Yin's relationship\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, some people may not like how it ended. I just wish it never did end. Easily above 9.5/10, which after rounding, 10/10",

            "content": "So what happens when you expose a group of people to a supernatural and unexplained phenomenon that breaks out of blue in our small small world? Sometimes they die. Sometimes they get insane. Most often they obtain supernatural powers.\r\nAt a glance Darker than Black is same old formula: an unexplained occurs, people magically obtain equally magical abilities and then Professor Xavier, pardon me, someone with enough brain figures out a way to brings such people together and put them to good use, for better or for worse. And then some choose path of evil, some choose path of good and some choose to be asuperpower for hire. In Darker than Black it's mostly the latter.\\n\\n\r\nPlot.\\n\r\nLike I mentioned above, Darker than Black may seem like an old formula but yet it has new taste to it. And so two mysterious anomalies known as Hell's and Heaven's Gate appear out of blue in two distant parts of the world, rendering areas around them into completely isolated areas somewhat akin to silent zones. What's more, somehow natural stars are gone from the sky. Meanwhile more and more people start manifesting supernatural abilities. As Darker than Black starts, there is little known initially about either Contractors, or Gates, or the link between the former and the stars. What makes this anime different from others with same concept is that the nature of Contractor is defined by word itself. They have to pay - sometimes severely - for the powers they use. And so following a contractor BK201/Hei who's working for mysterious syndicate we learn more about the world, the contractors and their types and his own personal quest.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no linear plot from point A to point B whatsoever. The story is, by and large, quite episodic, built in 2-3 episode arcs. What ties all these episodes together is Hei's personal quest rather than any particular events. That being said, the episodes offer diversity. We have episodes that focus on main characters, those which focus on supporting characters and those which are there just for the sake of humor. I can't say that in the end we learn everything, but most important questions will be answered - and rather satisfyingly at that.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nThe art is very solid, offering clean designs and vivid, lively colors. The surroundings are rendered beautifully, with full attention to light effects. Special effects pertaining superpowers are done well: nothing extraordinary but quite nice, with smooth animation. The character design is not exactly breathtaking but it's memorable enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack composed by Yoko Kanno is absolutely fabulous. Darker than Black sports a wide range of ambient music, ranging from airy jazzy tunes to gorgeous instrumental pieces, my favourite being Yin no Piano. Battle and action themes are adrenaline-filled and will please rock lovers. The voice acting is great, especially for the protagonist. You can always hear the switching of his personality, each \"mode\" having a very specific manner of speech and voice tone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nI loved practically all the characters, and this anime presents quite a party of truly different ones. There's quiet and perpetually melancholic medium, there's an awkward cop, there's a perverted middle-aged detective, there's a Bond-like agent and much more. Hei/BK201 undoubtedly steals the show with his unidentified personality; his professional and private personalities being like black and white and you'll be always wondering who he truly is, why he is like that, and whether he was the same prior the events of anime. The antagonists of the series could be sympathized with, which in fact makes certain episodes only more dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\r\nDtB is a truly interesting anime which manages to combine a solid plotline with episodic narration. It has action, it has mystery, it has drama and it has humor and it has some bittersweet romance, believe it or not. Most importantly it's a classic, winning formula with a little fresh twist that definitely deserves your attention.",

            "content": "DTB starts off with a great two episode introduction, which exposes the various premises and general state of things with contractors, dolls, hell's gate, fake stars, etc. The story is divided into 25 episodes, usually with every two episodes constituting a story involving the main character, Hei, and his interactions with other contractors, dolls, and people. Many of these stories contain flashbacks highlighting and explaining parts of a character's past. \r\nThe series contains a central plot involving the appearance of contractors, hell's gate, and a mysterious event involving heaven's gate that occurred in the past. This, however, is usually kept in the periphery, mentioned onlybriefly from episode to episode despite being the gravity of the whole story until the final. The main plot is foreshadowed and explained a little halfway through the series in a two-parter analogous to cowboy bebop's jupiter jazz: while spike's past is one of the most important things of the story in cowboy bebop, the plot follows various mini-events that occur, hinting at what's going on halfway through the series, and concluding with the finale. this is similar to what happens in DTB. The episodes not related to the main plot, however, are almost always interesting and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some really cool ideas in this anime, my favorite being the motif of Hei's dissonance between cold rational and emotion. He is a really great product of the show in terms of character development, and the finale does a great job of coming to terms with this theme. Some other ideas seem underdeveloped though, such as the replacement of stars w/ fake stars, and the strong concentration on Hei distracts from other characters (such as Amber) who I wish were developed more.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight sequences are pretty cool. The animation for them is done well, and though the duration of the fights are usually pretty short, it's always interesting to see the different contractor's abilities and obeisances, and how they relate to the characters themselves. The show is not action-driven though, and the fight sequences really serve mainly to complement the characters/story.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the most frustrating thing about this anime is the vague introduction of the premises, which should have been explained more sufficiently and earlier on. I went through the series (25 episodes) in about 4 days. Some episodes are better than others, but overall its a great anime worth watching with some interesting ideas worth thinking about.",

            "content": "Superpowers, noir, action, suspense, and secrets. These are the ingredients to the recipe for Darker Than Black. This anime is undeniably familiar when it comes to it's concepts and some blatant influences, but it's not completely unoriginal, and it's not bad either.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nThe story of Darker Than Black is based around Hei, a super-powered agent working for a shady organization known as The Syndicate. The show takes things from here and slowly, very, very slowly, details and opens up the plot, setting, and backstories of characters. This is done in an episodic structure similar to Cowboy Bebop or Ghost in the Shell: Stand AloneComplex; with some quality episodes outside of the main plot, but also a little bit of filler too.\\n\\n\r\nThe central concept of the universe this anime takes place in is Contractors. Years prior to the beginning of the story, a world-changing event occurs and the result was Contractors. These people, not considered human or capable of emotion, have powers that come with a \"contract\" price to pay every time they are used. This concept is a unique take on super-powers and it becomes something of an event every time you get to see a new Contractor.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned things open up slowly, and it wasn't a problem for me, but it definitely will be for some. You better be ready to pay attention when you're watching Darker Than Black, because all but one episode are two-parters. Lots of stuff is left unexplained for periods of time but when it comes time to get to the details, there is no shame in the time the show takes to get into it. This was something of a drawing point though. The mystery of everything that is going on and wondering about it is part of what makes watching this anime so interesting. Interesting may be the buzz word that goes off in most people's heads often during the course of most episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe main complaint I could have with the plot here is that it gets so interesting that I found myself clamoring for a bit more. It was good, but felt like it could have been better at the same time. The last episode leaves lots of things inconclusive, a risky note to end a story on. There are also lots of flashbacks, and it's not always obvious what time the story is taking place.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm a fan of Bones' animation. This isn't their best work and it may not be the most fitting for the serious tone of the show, but I'll be damned if it isn't high quality. Character design stands out very often, with plenty of unique people to look at and Hei's mask being something that immediately feels iconic upon seeing it. Action scenes are full of breathtaking moments and polished movement flowing through great scenery in a usually dark color palette. All the powers you see bring a nice level of variety to the stuff Bones gets to pull off with the animation and they do get quite creative at times. The only thing to knock with the animation here is the style seems a little unfitting for the tone of the show. For an anime called Darker Than Black, with such a serious tone, I think something apart from the safe standard approach could have paid off big here.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nYoko Kanno composed the soundtrack, which is usually all there is to say. This isn't her best work either but it's above average for sure. The opening themes are great, the ending theme is pretty basic, and the bulk of the OST that plays during episodes ranges from decent to amazing. Many of the tunes get repeated like with most anime, and it's for better with some and for worse with others. Most of the main songs that you'll recognize hearing are for better though. There's also some very high quality music in the final episodes that probably should have been used more often. It's a very good soundtrack but at times it feels unfitting, with some songs that seem like Cowboy Bebop throwaways.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting overall is pretty good. There aren't any specific performances that stood out, it's more of a top to bottom solid cast than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where things get odd. A common note people tend to make with Darker Than Black is that lots of characters other than the main cast seems to develop better. I'm inclined to agree. Even lots of the one-off Contractors seem to be extremely interesting in certain episodes. I think the problem here is that when it came time for backstory on the main characters, it was a good starting point, but backstory isn't always enough. Huang for example, isn't a Contractor, isn't really a main character, but turns out being very well developed with backstory episodes and changes that can't go unnoticed as the show goes on. Misaki Kirahara and Mao on the other hand, two characters with potentially the most interesting viewpoints of the show (one is a cop tracking Hei, the other is trapped in a cat's body) and more plot importance don't get nearly enough time in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nThis wasn't a problem with the protagonist Hei, as the entire duality of his undercover and Contractor persona was fascinating and becomes important to the resolution of the show itself. Yin however, had a fantastic arc on her backstory which remains one of my favorites of the series, but her character never really goes anywhere after this, and the episode was at the halfway point of the show. It's weird because the portrayal of Yin is that she's the second most important main character but it never really feels like that's the case.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on about people like November 11, Amber, Havoc, and others, but it becomes apparent early on that while characters you can enjoy who develop are plentiful in Darker Than Black, it may not be the ones you expect. It makes scoring this category difficult, because there are plenty of interesting personalities, but the ones that feel like they should be more important aren't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDrawing clear inspirations from things both within anime and outside it, Darker Than Black is an admirable attempt at bringing so many ideas to the table that it would seem difficult not to enjoy it on some level. There are crazy fights, a puzzle surrounding the story, and even some humor, though the latter was something I found lacking given the business-like nature of the show. At it's core Darker Than Black finds strength in the animation of it's action scenes and the mystery of it's plot.",

            "content": "Story: The story does a great job of pulling together the characters presented at a steady pace. By the 15th episode you can feel the gravitational pull between the characters and the main themes and story arcs begin to be explored. Contractors are heartless and logical, Dolls are intuitive and expressionless and humans are...well...human, lol. All parties mentioned are pushed to the limits of morality, self-interest and evolution/change. The beauty in the story to me is its ability to make you feel and pull for two people on opposing sides. The paradoxical nature of the interactions leave you in a gray area of morality withoutthe appalling feeling of choosing the better of two evils. The realness hit me to the core and when I finished the first season I was ecstatic to find more. I dove right into the OVAs and the second season, but I'll save that for when I write those reviews. The last point I will make is that the story does a great job of not being overly predictable or redundant.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I enjoyed the character designs, the colors and tones.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I enjoy Yoko Kanno's work and that holds true for the score used in Darker Than Black. A couple of tracks that come to mind are \"Water Forest\", \"Go Dark\", \"Guy\", \"Contractor\" and this one song that is not on the OST. It comes on when you first meet November 11, its also heard in a few random action sequences.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I gave character a 10 and story a 9 because I fell in love with so many characters. The story as a whole was great but the characters themselves are written extremely well and I felt genuinely interested in what was on the horizon for each character as their individual stories proceeded and intersected.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I give it a 9 because I feel this anime is a 9.5 and a 9 in no way takes away with how much I enjoyed this anime. I do plan to re-watch this series multiple times. Definitely an instant classic in my library.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I stand by my 9.5 that I stated earlier. I think I can't give it 10s across the board because I feel too bias and I feel that I need a season 3 or some more OVAs to satisfy my interest. The music and art frame the anime and live true to the name. The story and characters pull you in and keep your interest. I enjoyed all the action, the trippy/cool powers contractors and dolls have. An overall great experience!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. This is my very first review. I'll be back to finish off the Darker Than Black Gaiden and Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor reviews.

When I first saw DtB's synopsis I can't say I was very ecstatic on watching it. But, I'm glad I was wrong because the show's story was pretty original.\r\nContractors, hired assassins who are said to not have almost any emotions,and could kill someone with absolutely no remorse.But, Hei  (or Li) is different thanthe rest of the contractors.\\n\r\nNot a bad start for a story :)\\n\\n\r\n   Art : 8/10\\n\r\nNice art, no real &quot;major flaws&quot; in the character design, or stuff like that. I can't say that the outline of the contractors when using their powers is very appealing though.Other than that little annoyance, everything is okay.\\n\\n\r\n  Sound : 7/10\\n\r\nThe first opening...didn't like it. The second one was a lot better, but not outstanding. I liked the ending with the beach a little. The voices were good, but nothing special. They just did their job.Sound was ok, but not the series' forte. \\n\\n\r\n  Character : 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty interesting and quite original. Like a talking cat, a chinese skinny-glutton or an old &quot;nice but at the same time grouchy&quot; man.\\n\r\nThe police lady kinda bugged me a bit, because she was pretty annoying. There were a few other characters that I didn't really like, but the rest were fine.\\n\r\nMy favorite DtB character is Havoc.\\n\\n\r\n  Enjoyment : 6/10\\n\r\nWell, I kinda dragged myself into watching this show. And at about the half-point of it, I was barely watching one episode a week. So, I can't really say I enjoyed watching it, as I was waiting for the ending to come faster. But, I have to admit that the last couple of episodes really kept me into it.\\n\\n\r\n  Overall : 7/10\\n\r\nOverall, it was fine. That's all I have to say. It was a &quot;worth-watching but nothing special&quot;- kind of series.\\n\r\nI recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Black Lagoon or Speed Grapher.Or even Ergo Proxy.\\n",

            "content": "Darker Than Black is one tight package. It's a highly enjoyable series with an intriguing premise, a plethora of send-ups to the rich history of anime, spot-on art direction and a set of story arcs that are vast in scope yet end before overstaying their welcome. \r\n\tThe premise of the story, where in select humans are given super powers in a catastrophic accident, is not particularly unique. However, the show manages to tackle the same topic that many have before without feeling stale at all. Although the idea is not new, Darker Than Black manages to stay fresh by examining the dilemmas of its richcast of characters in believable and interesting ways. Nearly all of the the characters have fleshed out back-stories, many of which are very compelling. Even characters who initially seem 2-dimensional and unlikable, like the syndicate affiliated Huang, come into their own and become extremely sympathetic.\\n\r\n\tThe story even has a sense of irony and poetic justice, as the \"contractors\" (as these super humans are called) must make payments for their powers. This may consist of smoking a cigarette, aligning objects into obscure patterns, composing a poem, or a whole plethora of bizarre and sometimes fitting punishments. The reason for these payments, like many other aspects of the plot (including the catastrophe that gave these individuals their powers) is kept fairly vague. It's a decision for the better undoubtedly, as it creates an air of mystery and confusion throughout the series. It's best to not dwell on the things that are unexplained and simply enjoy the narrative as it unfolds with the scarce explanation that is provided. Really, I still don't know exactly what the story was about, and I'm completely fine with that. All I know is that it was a pretty damn good ride- one that I won't soon forget.\\n\r\n\tThe other piece that makes Darker Than Black so enjoyable is the quality of art, music and voices. Bones studio, most famous for their Fullmetal Alchemist adaptations, are behind this series and bring their accomplished and highly professional look to it. Character models are consistent and expressive, backgrounds are atmospheric and convincing, and there is nary a moments of weak animation to take you out of the experience. The overall visual tone is extremely even too, avoiding the pitfalls of low-budget middle sections that many series find themselves in. Opting out of cartoonish anime \"shorthand\", the series is a decidedly serious looking one, if not necessarily always as serious feeling show, as moments of levity are strategically placed throughout the narrative. \\n\r\n\tDarker Than Black, for all of its strengths, does leave i bit to be desired. I haven't watched the second series yet, but honestly a series should stand on its own without using the possibility of a second as a crutch. Without revealing anything, I will say that it doesn't end on its strongest foot, leaving you a bit high and dry. Also, I kind of with things had gotten a bit more bizarre and surreal. There were certainly signs pointing in that direction, and even plot elements that would make contextual sense for things to get more psychological. This isn't the mindfuck that it could have been, but I suppose not all things can be. One can dream.",

BUT Hei is so cool! haha. i like to patronize weird but strong characters. Hei reminds me of L Lawliet from DN because of their eyes... okay, they're both cool but Hei is supernatural..wait, L is supernatural too, right? i mean, his mind is... okay, enough of that.\\n\\n\r\nif you like action and supernatural (and astronomy), you really should view this! it goes a bit gore-y but compared to others, it's bearable. i just got a little caught up by the plot. @__@ but i think, you'll eventually understand. i'm slow to pick up so i think understanding wouldn't be a problem for you. ehe. i think that'd be all for now.\\n\\n\r\nowaru :)\\n",

In an effort to survive, normal humans bind them under paid contracts and use them as spies or hitmen. This is the basic storyline of the series. \r\nI found the series pretty interesting. Although slow paced to begin with as the story progresses it takes you with it. The story opens a lot of questions but fortunately they are all solved by the end and if you really like the story you can always continue with the second season.\r\nThecharacters are interesting and have their stories revealed in a way that fits the story perfectly. Introduction of new characters is consistent with the plot but not frequent.\\n\r\nI would not recommend it to people who don't like sci-fi or far reached scenarios.

            "content": "I won't bother with the synopsis and get straight to the review, hope you find it useful.\r\n\tStory: The first 22 episodes of the series are made of eleven 2 episode story arcs, each focusing on one or two characters. These stories are undoubtedly the best part in the darker than black franchise. 2 episodes give just enough time to tell a well developed  story, and I'm always surprised how much the series be accomplished in merely 2 episodes. The content of each arc are never repetitive and have something new to offer each in arc. \r\nThelast 2 episodes of the series that deal with the final showdown are rather disappointing in comparison, and left a lot of unawsered questions , and the second season does little to help and add more to the mess. The back story of Hei was only briefly touched on through segments of flashbacks, even though it was essential to understanding the character. The anime had perfect chance in episode 23 for flashbacks, but instead we were given a \"day before war episode\" where nothing really happened.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\tCharacters:  The main character Hei has the cold distant deameanor all slick assasins in anime have, but combines depth and sensititvity while keeping his coolness intact, making him easily one of my favourite anime Characters. Even though his persona as a kind, introverted partimer completely differs from his persona as a ruthless assasin ; his action makes you realize they are undoubtedly the same person.\\n\\n\\n\r\n There is also a large cast of supporting character, and most of them are surprisingly fleshed out given the amount of screen time they had. Personally, I find it hard to dislike any of them. The anime never waste anytime when it comes to characterization, despite being an action anime, the series focus more on the character interaction  instead of fighting.\\n\\n\\n\r\n One thing that deserves mentioning is how easily characters die in the show, which is pretty fustrating. Just when you start to sympathisze with the characters, they get stabbed to death by ice pricks, dissapear into dreams or bleed to death on the street.  I don't know if it's to show the unpredictabily of death or if the producer are too lazy to deal with accumulating amount of side characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\tAction: As most reviewers will tell you, DtD have great action scene with fluid animation, that are well choreographed. Compare to other contracter hei's electrical power are less spectacular, causing him to be overwhelmed most of the time during a fight. Forcing him to act like a genuine assasin using his wit and stealth. preventing the fight scene from degenerating to mere comparison between power level.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\tOverall DtD is a very enjoyable anime, despite it's disappointing ending. You might have to watch twice it to know what's exactly going on in the story, but the character interaction and fight scene itself are very enjoyable even if the story is hard to follow. If you enjoy dark anime, that does not dwell into the realm of emo-ness and melodrama, definitely give this a try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Be warned, this review may contain /spoilers/.\r\nDarker Than BLACK is an anime produced by BONES, released in Japan in the year 2007. The anime centres on its four main protagonists, during several, short story arcs.\r\nThe four main characters are Hei, Yin, Huang, and Mao. They all have Chinese names \u2013 these are codenames. The only actually Chinese person in the group is Hei (whose name means \u201cblack\u201d in Chinese). Yin is Finnish (her name means \u201csilver\u201d), Huang is Japanese (his name means \u201cyellow\u201d), and Mao\u2019s nationality is unknown (his name means \u201ccat\u201d). All the characters have different personalities and distinct ways of acting. Huang, Hei,and Yin\u2019s histories are all touched on in the first season of Darker Than BLACK, while Mao\u2019s receives less attention. His background is only touched on in depth in the second season (Ryuusei no Gemini). The side characters are also interesting, with their own personalities and motives. In particular, I like Kirihara Misaki, a policewoman who could be called the main character of the \u201copposing\u201d force to Hei and his team.\\n\\n\r\nDarker Than BLACK has an interesting setting; futuristic Tokyo, where the appearance of \u201cHell\u2019s Gate\u201d has caused beings called \u201ccontractors\u201d and \u201cdolls\u201d to emerge into the world. Contractors are individuals with special abilities, such as the ability to create lightning or teleport, and they can use these powers at will. However, they must perform their remuneration during or after they use their power \u2013 this can be anything from eating cigarettes to breaking one\u2019s fingers, and is usually associated to something the contractor has previously done. There are some contractors (like Mao) who have fulfilled their contract and therefore do not need to perform their remuneration, although this is rare. Contractors are very logical individuals \u2013 they have detached themselves from their emotions and any ties they had with family members and friends. Dolls are spiritual mediums that have the power to \u201csee\u201d using specific mediums, like glass or water, while being invisible to others. They have no emotion whatsoever and are incapable of making decisions for themselves. It has been shown that dolls are \u201cmanufactured\u201d and sold as products and goods, particularly in underground organizations like the mafia or yakuza.\\n\\n\r\nHei and Mao are both contractors. Hei can produce and conduct lightning, and Mao can possess the bodies of animals. Notably, Mao lost his human body and is therefore stuck in the form of a black cat. Yin is a doll whose medium is water. Huang is the only human in the group \u2013 he hates both contractors and dolls and makes the point of voicing this periodically. Hei is an interesting contractor, since he doesn\u2019t have a remuneration and still makes most decisions based on human emotion. Reasons for this are revealed near the end of season one.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode, we are introduced to Li Shungsheng, a gentle student from China, who is actually a masquerading Hei. Things get complicated when we learn Hei works for \u201cthe Syndicate\u201d, a mysterious organization with an unknown agenda. Darker Than BLACK is primarily a series of short, two-episode story arcs, with the longest one being three episodes, at the end. Although it is told in such a fashion, it never feels episodic \u2013 the plot manages to interconnect the various arcs into a bigger plot. The arcs are something like threads in the tapestry that is Darker Than BLACK, with every character being introduced for a reason \u2013 to further the plot and so that we may learn more about our four main characters. The arcs are interesting enough to catch the viewer\u2019s attention and cause is to want to push through the end, to see how exactly the stories are connected.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters develop as the series go on, Yin in particular. From an emotionless robot she becomes something that could be called a \u201chuman being\u201d, albeit a quiet one. Hei also shows signs of development, which is something even the characters point out. Huang and Mao are somewhat static characters, although Huang\u2019s lack of development is a given when you find out his past. All the characters are realistic and life-like, and all are interesting in their own right. Watching Hei juggle his real persona and the personality of Li Shungsheng at the same time is amusing and adds some comic relief to an otherwise very serious and dark anime. Darker Than BLACK makes you think.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Darker Than BLACK is a fluid, interesting, emotional ride that takes you on a rollercoaster through the depths of the human mind, prejudice, and relationships.",

What is this / t\\what this for ? who are they ? and etc. but after you watch till 6 eps, you will find out that the story tell about Hei with his friends and their power with sindicate. And real mission (the only one) of Hei. \r\nThe episodes fit together into a continous story, why did it happened and etc.\r\nthe story is unpredictable too which one makes you wanna watch this till the last eps.\r\nART\r\nThe style is not really realistic,but for me the art is realy awesome. It's tell you thevisual is match with the mood of it's char. and I'm sorry I can't write a review of ART. I don't really understand abour ART, but AA the art is awesome for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThe seiyuu/character voice actors fitting for the characters they portrayed  very well. I love the seiyuu for Hei, Yin and the black cat.\\n\r\nThey play their char well and makes me feel that he / she is fit with their age, not too old / too young.\\n\r\n    The background music fitting for the story and atmosphere, with the effect of it's situation. oh btw I didn't like the opening song. I don't know why but it's not match with the opening animation. AAAAnddd, yeah I love so much Tsukiakari by Rie Ru @ the ending song of this anime. It's really fit with the animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nthe character designs unique, but I found that Amber look similar with C.C from Code Geass. Hei appareance are good looking, the old man and 4 / 5 chars found similiar with char in a\\other anime. for me, I guess so. but all char got their self unique. \\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\n I really enjoy watch this anime, and I'm gonna watch the S2 season . and I hope there's a possibility to make a 3rd season of this anime. Like Code geass I really hope the adventure of Hei and their abilities not end in the 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nScore *****\\n\r\nMin : \\n\r\nFor me I love pair Hei and Yin or Hei and Amber.\\n\r\nif you (the prod / storywriter) add more romantic by situation scene in this anime, it will be more awesome. Show us that the Dark Reaper has a feeling with ladies there. ^^  b",

When I saw it for a second time I was pretty disappointed by how much I didn't realize it wasn't that good. The initial plot was awesome where all of these contractors with special powers did different contracts for money but then the plot that our character is wrapped up in is pretty lame. If you want to watch for the fights then have atthis anime the fights are well done with excellent animation. The intro fits the anime and is pretty catchy at points. Character wise our MC is badass cold hearted guy but his plot in the story I think is done pitifully. The side characters are almost pointless. His potential love interest is cool. She is pretty much just like him but is hilarious at points in the show. Others aren't really important. If you can make it through just season one stay here don't go to season two. I thought this show was ruined for me after the last episode but then I watched the OVAs but and that was tough because it ruined me emotionally but then season two came along and just ruined the show entirely for me. All in all Darker than black was pretty good it had it's ups and it's really down low points in the anime but it is defiantly worth checking out.",

            "content": "Story - The plot is really quite incomprehensible. Gates, contractors and dolls are never adequately explained. They never explained WHY they wanted to get rid of the contractors, some of whom are under their employment. Hei somehow magically learns to use his sister's ability to alter matter on a quantum level at the very last minute and changes all antigate particles into gate particles, thus saving all contractors from genocide. There seemed to be some kind of overarching theme in this series that can be only described as \"people with superpowers are still people!\" which seemed rather bizarre and irrelevant to just about everything. \r\nArt- The art is amazing as expected from Bones. The series is very well animated and does not skimp on action scenes, which have excellent choreography although are relatively short compared to some shounen series. The character designs are excellent. \\n\\n\r\nSound - Not great considering it's Yoko Kanno who has done some great pieces in the past. The jazzy music fits neither the action nor the talking scenes. Track 24 is possibly the only one that captures the mood of the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The characters are not exactly cardboard cutouts but neither are they very well fleshed out. For starters, we almost never see Hei truly relaxed. He always wore a \"nice guy\" persona whenever he wasn't wearing the white mask of doom. The same is true for most other major characters in the series. Minor characters such as Havoc and Shihoko are developed fairly well for two episodes, where they're relaxed and spill out their true thoughts, and then they're killed off and have no bearing on the story ever again. It's quite frustrating to invest two entire episodes in a quite likeable character only to see them killed off for the rest of the series, especially when the main characters were developed nowhere to the extent as these one-shot characters were. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I thoroughly enjoyed this series, even though I couldn't relate to any of the characters and I thought the superpowers were really badly used. I especially enjoyed watching the development of characters like Havoc and Shihoko, which made me feel frustrated when they were killed at the end of their two-episode arcs. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - Very enjoyable even with all its flaws in character development, story and sound.",

So, this is the story of cool man McCool and his adventures of being a BAMF. In a world of superhumans it is hard to truly know who is the strongest, and the main characters powers definitely don\u2019t compete, that is why he is awesome. He is an assassin who is constantly against people with greater gifts then he, but he always manages to succeed. The main character goes through a lot of internal conflict which the show only subtlety shows, but feel this adds alot for a show which often has small dialogue overall. The feel of \"cool\" is emphasized by the music which rivals that of bleach and death note. Now this review only speaks for the first season\u2026in the second season he gets burdened by a horrible supporting character and they got rid of all the good ones. So just pretend the second season doesn\u2019t exist also just like death note. So if you want to watch an anime that gives you those \"This is awesome\" vibes then I highly recommend this show.",

He randomly get into jobs where there's a case or incident because he supposed to have missions ( well he does ).\\n\\n\r\nI honestly think that the main issue with this series would be that they don't provide us enough background information of the characters.

It may be a bit difficult at first to get into but it is completely worth it!! If you're into dark atmospheres, interesting story lines, give this one a shot; you'll love it!!\r\nStory: 8\r\nFirst, the story. I gave it an eight because the plot was exciting and riddled with plot-twists but still managed to fit the anime's previously-mentioned atmosphere. It is about these superhumans called Contractors, each one with a special type of ability for which s/he must pay a price, sometimes even with their bodiesor health or even lives at risk. It was made for an incredible manga/anime, which DTB definitely is! But then again, I didn't give it a 10 because personally, I didn't think the story was unfolded properly to be easily understood, so for the first few episodes I found it a bit difficult to follow up without a few guidelines. Also because I hated how they introduced amazing characters with interesting backstories and personalities, and killed them off or got rid of them in the same or the next episode. Oh well, maybe it's just me. Not gonna criticise the fanservice because a) it wasn't too heavy and the characters didn't have to do anything far out of place IIRC to show it.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI loved the animation, it was different from most anime I saw and I found it great, amazing actually!! Keep in mind that it wasn't produced in this decade, but it still delivered for amazing action scenes and excellent backgrounds and looks overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI easily gave it a perfect ten because nothing was wrong with the voice-acting, it was simply amazing. Moreover, its opening/ending soundtracks easily made one of the best collections. They chose great bands for great songs. I found the background music to be so good and fitting for every scene it was used in, whether it was sad, exciting, suspenseful, comedic, anything!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe different powers, personalities, remuneration methods, and the syndicate/contractor/doll variations are all very big important elements of this category. Let's start with the main character: Hei, a contractor who outside his job acts as a transfer student named Li Shunsheng, from China. Since he's not a real contractor, he is able to have emotions much like humans and a could-be-called-complex personality, he's likely to judge any situation he's put in through both logic AND emotion, unlike the usual contractors who can only do so through logic. This is such an interesting addition to the story. The other main characters and supporting ones are also great, with intriguing backstories and without noticing I became very curious as to know how each character that's a doll or contractor came to be that way. Overall, awesome characters that are sure to have you hooked.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThe confusion was a bit too much for me, so it was hard to watch at first (as I've mentioned earlier) but when I got further into it, I couldn't stop.

            "content": "This is a review of both seasons of Darker than Black, by the way.\r\nLet's discuss Bones Studio. I have seen Fullmetal Alchemist, Soul Eater, and FMA: Brotherhood before this, and I liked them all a lot. The same goes for Darker than Black. If I had to choose a show that this reminds me of, it would be the second half or Fullmetal Alchemist. They have the gritty tone, the philosophy, and similar character moments. This makes sense; both the second half of Fullmetal Alchemist and Darker than Black are original works by Bones. Darker than Black is, like, part supernatural, part psychological thriller, partnoir. In it are plenty of decent characters, great artistic writing moments, and a thoughtful commentary on what it truly means to be human. This is a very good combination of action show and philosophical art piece. The dub by Funimation is also pretty impressive. Jason Liebrecht, John Swasey, Alison Viktorin, and Kate Oxley all do good jobs. I would highly recommend checking this show out. Darker than Black gave other original works by Bones like Wolf's Rain and RahXephon higher priority on my Plan To Watch list.",

            "content": "First and foremost I have absolutely no idea what the title has to do with actual plot of the show. That said it didn't interfere with my overall enjoyment or ability to watch it. \r\nStory: \r\nEssentially taking the idea of assassins with superpowers going from there the plot of Darker Than Black is fairly interesting. Contractors, as they are referred to in the series, are the power wielding assassins working for a mysterious organization known as the Syndicate. As these contractors become more of a problem the Japanese police force assigns a special unit to investigate them. \r\nThis show requires a lot of patience asthe pacing in the beginning is a bit slow and raises more questions than it answers. For example the first good chunk of the show deviates from the bigger arc and follows a standard \"opponent of the week\" formula. It isn't until well into the back half of the series that the main arc picks up again and questions are getting answered. That said I still found the side stories fairly compelling. They also involve at least one of the main characters to some degree. Which prevents these side arcs from becoming meaningless filler. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nBONES is a studio known for producing some really beautiful animation. Depending on the animation director you may notice similarities in character designs among the various shows they have worked on. In the case of Darker Than Black, I believe the character designs were done by Takahiro Komori, and based on original designs Yuji Iwahara who is best known for his work on King of Thorn. The art style overall fits the show. The character designs are simple but not so much they turn into blobs once they're in the background. Speaking of backgrounds both scenes of Heaven and Hell's gate were absolutely stunning in my opinion. I also must give credit to the action sequences. They utilize a variety of angles and perspectives, creating suspense at the right moments. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC:\\n\r\nThe music and soundtrack was composed by Yoko Kanno, who composed the music for shows like Cowboy Bebop. So right there that should give a hint to the quality of this soundtrack. The opening theme for the first half of the series is  \"Howling\" by Abingdon Boys School, and the ending theme, \"Tsukiakari\" (\u30c4\u30ad\u30a2\u30ab\u30ea?, lit. \"Moonlight\") by Rie fu. Both of which I found extremely catchy. In fact everytime I hear \"Tsukiakari\" it becomes stuck in my head for about three days. The second half of the series uses \"Kakusei Heroism (The Hero Without a \"Name\")\" by An Cafe and \"Dreams\" by High and Mighty Color for the opening and ending themes respectively. The background scores fit their scenes and help carry the story along. \\n\\n\r\nAUDIO:\\n\r\nI have only seen bits and pieces of the original Japanese so I can't really provide much commentary on that as I don't have much to work with. The english dub is done by Funimation, a company known for producing quality dubs. Jason Liebrecht is absolutely perfect as both mild mannered exchange student Li Shenshun and Hei. He is able to move from one vocal range to another without sounding forced and allowing the two characters to remain more or less separate from each other. Also points to John Swasey who voices Huang. Swasey being another actor known for their diverse range. Finally MAJOR bonus points to Kate Oxley who voices Section-4 Chief, Misaki Kirihara. Prior to this show Oxley, being fairly new, was best known for her role as Momo Adachi in the shoujo anime Peach Girl. Kirihara being her first serious role, she absolutely nailed it. She was able to convey a serious tone without sounding too robotic and shy away from sounding too girly or young. Safe to say her performance here is most likely what lead to her being cast in Psycho Pass. Finally Brina Palencia is able to convey the necessary robotic tone of Yin without sounding monotonous and boring. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nHere's where the show's biggest weakness lies. The overall development of the characters is slightly inconsistent. The main character Hei isn't really given much backstory until MUCH later into the show and to certain extent the second season. He also has a tendency to float in and out of the story and randomly show up at the end of certain episodes regardless of his role in that episode's story. The other two main characters, Yin and Huang are given slightly more detail in their respective episodes than Hei is in the entire series. Even some of the supposed bad guys get more background info and many of them end up redshirts anyway lasting maybe an episode or two. This was all somewhat of an issue for me because I really wanted to know more about Hei and the Syndicate. Being what I assume is the somewhat anti-hero we're supposed to route for, I wanna be able to route for him! But it's difficult to do that when he's given little backstory and barely in the show for a good portion of the time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: \\n\r\nDespite it's flaws I really do like this show. In fact I own both seasons on DVD.  On the upside the animation, music, and voice acting are all 100% solid. The overall concept is interesting enough on its own. On the downside the plot is extremely slow and poses more questions than it answers. And the ones that do get answered are not up until the very end. Character development is inconsistent as some major characters are given very little backstory and some minor characters are given more despite lasting a very short amount of time. I still consider this show a classic and it does have a special place in my heart mainly because at the time I watched it there really wasn't anything else like it to compare it to. \\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: \\n\r\nIf you're deciding upon watching it or not, I would recommend streaming it (legally!) first, form your own ideas about it and going from there. That said if you're a sci-fi fan including supernatural powers and mystery I say give this a shot.",

            "content": "I have seen Darker Than Black (DTB) soo many times - ultimately because I love it. But my consistent return to the series has allowed me to deconstruct it, so let me continue wholeheartedly unbiased.\r\nFirstly, what I think makes me watch it over and over again, is the significant character development that flows evenly over the episodes.\r\nNormally I hate the episodic 'to each episode his own' presentation of storyline (i.e. Jigoku Shoujo), but DTB seems to take this in it's stride. Showing the narrative through other's eyes and experiences - as well as the main characters in rarity - allows new content to constantly engageus, adding an apt authenticity to the mix as the natural progression of events and characters are showcased in a very organic fashion.\\n\r\nThe dramatic irony of keeping the main characters out of the bigger picture also lengthens the charm, resulting in a mystery, unravelled unwittingly by the audience at their own pace.\\n\r\nEvery character transforms in this anime. I mean EVERY character. Whether it is the slow realisation of fate, or the quick yet influential paradigm shift between one episode and the next (a la Kenji's ball growing), adaptation is vital to the survival of dramatic veracity and cohesion of DTB.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is another praise to the series. The neo-noir feel paints the city in palettes of browns, greens and purples, which is cleverly reflected in the costume of the Black Reaper. The characters are distinct, with their own tells and quirks, unique enough to stand on their own, but similar enough to synthesis a conglomerate of functional characters. I did however find myself wishing that the nationality of the characters was made more distinct (with the risk of stereotypes and racism it might have been good to avoid it) as I didn't even know Hei was Chinese til I googled it! That being said, Alice Wang/Wei were tastefully true to their culture, the ChiPao relevant, and I definitely appreciated that.\\n\r\nThe action takes the cake in this anime. It is so artful, engaging, creative, and fluid. Hei has a definite style, and this remains throughout. The opening always had me cheering, the snipets of fighting and art outstanding.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music was great, I found myself singing along to the themes (in Japanese, imagine my surprise), and the digetic sounds certainly sustained the tension and engagement.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like (it may seem unfair and anal) was the cheap narrative method to establish the situation - inner monologue explaining what has been consistent for years, whaaat, lack of background/orientation of the South American war, the overuse of deathstares, hit and miss comedy of Mao, Hei's sudden love for Yin, and the constant breaking of the \"Contractors have no feelings\" rule that we are reminded of incremently. The real detriment is the dialogue because of story purposes, rather than dialogue because that is how the Characters are likely to act.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is getting long-winded. Obviously I thoroughly enjoyed this season (I don't ever want to think about the second again!), even though it is generally not the genre I would pursue, my gamble paid off; and hopefully so will/did yours. I definitely recommend watching Darker Than Black: Kuro no Keiyakusha, because on first glimpse, it is certainly flawless.",

            "content": "Story: 7/10\r\n \tThere are two gates, one appeared in South America a decade ago, and the other Hell\u2019s gate has appeared in Japan along with a group of beings known as contractors who made sort of deal with the devil in order to gain superhuman powers, in turn turning them into government killing machines for the most part. It then follows a group of contractors controlled by the syndicate detailing their escapades and shenanigans . The plot isn\u2019t really straightforward at all and it takes a really long time to figure out what's happening and what are the motivations to most of the main character'sactions. It starts off as a sort of monster of the week episodic show where they take down various different contractors. Most of the stories involve hei and his group of allies, but the show isn't consistent at all quality wise, and the only times I really like the show is when Gai Kurasawa and Kiko Kayanuma are involved in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n \tThe main character is the \u201cBlack Reaper\u201d Hei, who is a contractor who is Badass fighting contractors at night, and Lee a hardworking and glutinous citizen at day. Most of the main characters are contractors who don\u2019t feel any human emotions and are therefore extremely reasonable, and that\u2019s a problem. While they are able to pull off extravagant stunts due to this they are also pretty hard to relate to when they don't reveal/have any human emotions. Due to how large the cast is there isn;t too many characters that is developed significantly, so it's funny that my two favorite characters have little to no character development with Gai Kurasawa or Kiko Kayanuma. Kiko Kayanuma is joy to watch because of her carefree spirit, her confidence, and her huge passion for anime/manga and other weebish activities\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/ Art Style: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n \tThe action scenes are well done, and some of the contractors powers are blast to watch, especially the one where he can draw his own blood, than make any surface the blood is touching vanish into thin air. The show looks pretty good, with how dark and retro the city skyline and skyscrapers look. Overall, well done and fitting for the series title. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n \tThe Opening while I enjoy Japanese rock music feels a bit too edgy for me, or that it at least feels like it's trying really hard to be edgy and cool. Which also fits with shows name. I mean what's cooler or edgier than a color darker than black. The second opening is bit of a step down in the music department and in memorability but the animation and pacing of the opening is a bit better in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n\tI thought that the series was okay until around episode 17 then it was pretty good/ great till it finished. The main problem was that the characters were developed enough until the end, plus there was not enough of Gai and Kiko in the show as a whole. Still even though I have mostly stated negative statements in this review, I believe that Darker Than Black is still a fun show overall, and that it is worth the watch, the it starts off slow for a while and doesn't really pick up a lot of stem until it's nearly over. I feel like if the plot was structured differently and if we learned about some of the character backstory and reasonings sooner rather than later then we would have been able to grow a stronger connection with the main characters strengthening our attachment to them and to the show in general. Darker Than Black is a show with a quite a bit of potential that could be hopefully expanded upon with better new material.",

            "content": "In retrospect, and because I seemingly have an incurable urge to compare things, Darker than BLACK is reminiscent of a grimmer, anime version of Wild Cards (the books). While there are no superheroics, and even contractors (the super powered characters) are relatively rare, the sheer range of the various powers as well as the odd remuneration that their use demands reminds me conceptually of the jokers from Wild Cards. While on the surface Darker than BLACK is a grim action series it also examines some fairly complex issues, such as what exactly it means to be human. But it does so without the heavy handednessor the awkward self consciousness that other similar shows have exhibited.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters in Darker than BLACK are also extremely well realised and believable, while not all of them are likeable, nearly all of them are entertaining to watch. Also for those interested in such things the world that Darker than BLACK presents would be eminently playable as an rpg setting and should I chose to run non-traditional supers at some point in the future I would be sorely tempted to use the setting presented here (possibly seasoned with some material from Kaze no Stigma).",

It is an episodic anime based on a hero (anti hero in this case) who dose various missions each episode that loosely ties into the premiss of the show. The story of Darker then Black is actually pretty interesting and it would of got a 10 if there was actually a plot. However theres not and the story just gives background information and explanations for the missions. Most of the characters in this series are pretty bland or pretty generic. The maincharacter Hei is interesting however his personality isn't really defined and he comes of usually pretty dull. Some interesting characters are introduced like November 11 and the detective but they become side characters that only appear in a few episodes. The show has some good action scenes however fighting is not as prevalent as you would expect from this type of anime. The art and animation is well done and the anime features one of my favorite openings. This anime is decent and i suggest action fans to watch it if they have time. Because the show is fairly episodic with mini arcs lasting no longer then 2 episodes it is a show that you can pick up and put down fairly easily. It will not make you insane to see what will happen next. Its a slow pass anime that you can watch at your own pace. It is not one of the best or most exciting amines I have ever seen and it is highly overrated however it is not a bad show and if you have some spare time I suggest you check it out.",

            "content": "DaikiClub Bro Time-Saver Review:\r\nBLUF: Darker than Black is, in one word, fun. I enjoyed it and you will too if you like action. It does fall short in character development and plot though. 8/10\r\nStory- There was a story? Just kidding. But seirously the story is the main problem I have with this show. The first 20 (of 25) of the episodes are mostly episodic with a few plot points sprinkled in. The first half of the anime is basically villain of the week. Eventually the story does come, but it isn't that great. It makes sense and I liked the climax and resolution, the problemwas that it just ended. I thought there had to be another episode, but there was just a really stupid OVA (episode 26). 6\\n\\n\r\nArt- It looks pretty good. The action scenes are great and it visually sets the tone for the show. I liked it, but it honestly isn't anything unique or special. It's Bones, you know what it's going to look like. 7\\n\\n\r\nSound (dub)- This show has an amazing OP 1. I would've said the sound was just ok, but that opening was straight fire and made it sound track memorable. There wasn't really any problems with it either. The dub voices all fit their characters pretty well and I liked the dub. Sometimes the characters lacked inflection, but I think that was just the nature of the role. 8\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- This show did a terrible job explaining the character motives for 12 episodes. Like I said earlier, it was just villain of the week, but then BAM! The character backstories are revealed and they're pretty good honestly. I think the secrecy of motives and backstory was intentional because the contractors and dolls are so private and secretive. I really liked the characters and thought they were all unique and fun to watch, even if they barely developed. 9\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I watched this show at the perfect time. It's just light enough to keep you enjoying the action, but still had emotional depth. I was coming off Erased and Ajin, so this felt great to watch. It was a lot of fun. I enjoyed every episode and would definitely recommend it to any anime veteran or beginner. 10\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR- You (and I) are 9 years late, but this is a gem of a show. Watch it and enjoy.",

So give it a try and enjoy.\r\nStory: Darker than Black is about a world where two mysterious gates appeared, called Heaven's Gate and Hell's Gate. Along with the emergence of these two places people calledcontractors appeared. Contractors are people with powers from an unknown origin, but have to pay a price for using their power, hence the name Contractors. The price can be anything from smoking a cigarette to self mutilation. Along with the Contractors are a whole night sky filled with new stars, each star representing a contractor, so when a Contractor dies a star falls. Now in this society, Contractors are kept as a secret by all governments, and at the same time used to hunt each other down, since Contractors are mainly concerned with their own survival.  Now the story might at first be somewhat confusing but it starts to makes more sense later on. It is rather quite fast and there isn't much sub-plot. There are plenty of action and fight scenes. After the first few episodes the story line is a lot easier to follow, so don't get stumped after watching like the first 3 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The story mainly takes place in a heavy populated city. The artwork of the background is pretty good. The artwork of the characters are rather nice, the fighting between characters seem somewhat believable, but there are some moments where it just seem like impossible.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is good, the soundtrack, especially the opening theme definitively fits the tone of the story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The story mainly focus on Hei, the Black Reaper. He starts of being a really cold hearted like person then slowly opens up. Which is really strange for a Contractor, even causing many Contractors to doubt whether if he was a real Contractor. The anime does have episodes that helps give more background information of each character, but again, it still ties along with the plot, so there is almost no stopping on the plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Overall I really enjoyed this anime. It was really good, the action was great and there wasn't so much blood and gore as I expected. The story line was quite great, I thought that it was well developed and pose a great scenario about that question \"What if there were humans with powers? How would they be treated?\" I thought it was quite interesting, it resembles the X-Men type of human with powers but can't be seen thing. But I thought it was way better than X-men. Then ending was quite interesting though, I had to watch it twice to kind of understand about what happened. Well give this anime a shot! Hope you enjoy it!",

There were so many things and so many directions it could have gone to have made it a better story and more enjoyable to watch.\r\nThe first thing I have to point out because it's been on my mind from the beginning to the very end of watching this first season on a 2 day span. Pizza Hut. I can't stop thinking about it. There were signs everywhere. Would I have enjoyed the show more if I atefrom Pizza Hut? Possibly. I don;t know and I guess I'll never find out. If anyone knows if it's more enjoyable that way, please don't hesitate to inform me.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime can get interesting at times it can intrigue you, in fact if you stick it through, I\\n\r\nm sure you will. I'm such your curiosity will allow you to wonder and to ask lots of questions. But you know what? \"F**k you!\" said this anime to it's audience, \"I won't answer any of your questions.\" Followed by a, \"You will watch what I show you and you and there's nothing you can do about.\"\\n\\n\r\nSO many of my questions have still been unanswered. Nearing the end when the contractor were fighting the humans, I saw so much abilities and potential usage of said characters and abilities that it could have been way better. Honestly I don;t know why this anime got such a high rating on MAL. I'm not the kind of person to judge an anime so harshly. Yeah this feels harsh to me, and I was entertained a very few amount of times so i wont disregard that.. BUT... this just goes to show that darn... well I guess it must be a regional thing for it to have gotten such a high ranking. Since I've already watched the first season and since I like to follow things through to the end, I will be watching the sequels as well.. I hope it gets better though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10... it's fine.",

These contractors fight against the main character who is also a contractor. \r\nStory:\r\nStory consists of basically 2 episode story arcs. Each story introduces a villain that has his own unique power and the main characters have to stop him usually. Most of the arcs are interesting while some are boring. \r\nArt:\r\nMajority of the show takes place at night. The animators did a pretty good job and transcribing a dark, brooding atmosphere. However the animation will rarely wow you like a show like mob psycho 100 will.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThere are 2 openings which both sound absolutely amazing. The soundtrack is also solid. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are what make this show great. The show consists of 4 characters that have to work together to get shit done. The protagonist is a straight up badass and one of the best main characters in Anime. He is a stoic killer with little regard for his opponents life. Another character is a black cat which that always a smarmy, fitting joke at the ready. The 3rd one is New Yorker that has a heart of gold. Finally theres a girl that is emotionless and barely talks but makes up for it with her cool abilities. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy main gripe with the show is the same as Cowboy Beboop. Each episode has very little buildup towards the finish making the ending of the show very lackluster. This is the only thing keeping the show from being a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nStill a very good show 8/10",

            "content": "After watching DTB for the third time, I decided that it was time to write a review for a series that I feel is pretty underrated. Since this is my first time writing a review, I'll keep it simple.\r\nPROS\r\nCharacters. Both main and side characters are a real pleasure to watch, complete with their own back stories and this helps viewers connect with them more. As you progress through the story, characters that you might have initially disliked will turn into ones that you can actually empathize with, or maybe even start to like.\r\nPlot. While the basic plot itself is pretty standard stuff (dystiopian future, specialabilities, unknown forces, etc.), the side plots and little twists and turns are what make DTB a true pleasure to watch. Aside from the final few episodes, the first two halves of the series are divided into mini arcs which usually consists of 2 -3 parts. That doesn't mean the finale itself is not a good watch, for it is certainly an interesting finale to the series.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork. The scenes are really well drawn, and the atmosphere surrounding each episode suits the tone quite perfectly. Action scenes do not disappoint and are hugely entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nMusic. I found the music very suitable for the tone of the show as well. Comical, dark, soothing, nostalgic, melancholic. The composer did a fantastic job.\\n\\n\r\nCONS\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue I have with the series also involves its greatest strength, the characters. I found a few of the side and main characters lacking when it came to development, as if they used simply to evolve the plot, or to help the viewers gain insight into the overall story. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL. A great series to watch, with extremely intriguing characters that serve to strengthen what was a pretty basic overall plot. But then again, how many original plots can we come up with until we run out of ideas, right? Definitely worth a watch.",

            "content": "Having just finished this series, coupled with my inability to fall asleep\u2026 here\u2019s a quick review.\r\nDarker Than Black follows the story of Hei, a contractor. A contractor is essntially a mutant. Humanlike in appearance, but with abilities. Abilities that range from gravity manipulation, to being able to make blood explode with a click of your fingers. Obscure, I know. Anyway, I won\u2019t provide a detailed synopsis, as that can easily be done by a quick Google search.\r\nHowever, to give an understanding of what the series is about and whether you\u2019d like it\u2026 I\u2019ll sum it up like this: Think the blockbuster sci-fi Inception\u2026 Now, thinkX-MEN. If these two series got together, in a hotel room\u2026 with some Barry White and scented candles in the background\u2026 the outcome, 9 months later, would be Darker Than Black.\\n\\n\r\nI have watched the first series; which is 25 episodes long. The second series is now also out. And it is good, no doubt. There are many things it does superbly. The animation is crisp, high quality and vivid. The music is powerful and compliments the scenes perfectly, whether it is adrenaline fuelled fight scenes, or the more emotional ones. The characters too, are for the most part original and interesting. T\\n\\n\r\nHowever, and this is a big however, DTB falls down on the key areas for me. The story is at times too slow paced and you feel like saying \u201cOkay, stop talking for 15 minutes and actually do stuff!\u201d Aside from that, the information is at times too hard to follow. I found myself confused in several parts as to what was going on, who certain characters were, and why they were doing what they were doing. In the end, I found myself watching the last couple of episodes just to finish the series rather than becaus I really wanted to see what happened next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a solid sci-fi anime. If you like X-Men and Inception, you\u2019ll probably like this. It is also quite a grown up anime, there are comedy and silly parts in it on occasion, but it is quite a mature series.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, from me, Darker Than Black gets a 7/10.",

            "content": "The story line in Darker than Black is nothing less than exceptional. I never knew exactly what was going to happen next and was always on the edge of my seat waiting to figure things out, despite the impossible struggle of understanding until the story was good an ready for me to. Even when I started watching this beautiful creation the second time, my experience was similar. Of course I knew what was up the second time around, but the excitement and emotional highs that the anime gave me were the same. To be honest, story lines aren't really unique anymore, but Darker than Blacktook its genre and put a real twist to it and I have yet to find anything really similar. It is truly an amazing anime and most likely my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is really good too! If you are the type of person that only likes shoujo art though, this might not be for you. It does have a more shounen flavour to it. I on the other hand think that as long as they don't look like blobs then it is probably fine. The artwork is clear and really consistent and overall I just think that it matches the story and colours the story quite well.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not sure what it means by sound but if we are talking OST's, sound effects, or even the voice actors themselves. I think that this anime is excellent in that. Whether watching the English dub or watching it subbed, I have done both as at the time I first watched it the second season was not dubbed yet, I think that anyone can agree that the voices really match the characters well! I do prefer the dubbed version in this case, but the voice actors do an exceptional job with the characters. They sound real and alive, just like it was the actor themselves on the screen, it is brilliant. The music track of the anime also is really great.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I couldn't possibly say enough about them. Hei is actually the most in depth character I have ever seen. He is such a multi-layered character that I really can't get enough of him.Yin is another excellent character with many sides! Overall, I found that all the characters were rather in depth and complicated and rather than hinder the experience of the anime, it just made it that much more amazing.\\n\\n\r\nBy now I think it is obvious that I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I watched it several years ago, but like I said, have started to rewatch it, that is how amazing it is. If you knew me, you would know rewatching is not a think I do. However, whenever I talk about this anime I get incredibly excited. Sometimes I cry. The story is just so moving and brilliant that I can't help feeling a personal connection to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a beautiful anime! Even if you don't think you are an action person please watch! The story is so much deeper than that and there are many other genres that are very important to the plot! It is an anime that can really be enjoyed by anyone!",

            "content": "Story-7: the story is fairly simple. A group of 'contractors' get introduced to the world when an area called 'hell's gate' appears in Tokyo. Contractors are people with certain powers who work for 'syndicate's'(that's all I'm going to say). The story follows one contractor called 'Hei' who works for a syndicate, every episode shows Hei performing a task for the syndicate he works for which usually last around 2 episodes. All in all, the story was simple but very well done.\r\nArt-8: the art in DTB looks unique and amazing. All of the character designs are out of this world and the background's and the wayeverything is drawn looks gorgeous. However, sometimes the animation in certain other things looked off at times, although this wasn't an issue.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10: honestly, what else can you expect from yoko kanno? An absolutely beautiful soundtrack with every song working effectively in the scene it was played. Both of the opening themes are also some of the best I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7: overall, the characters in DTB were well done. Hei is a complete badass and you want to know more about him(although the series gives us vague snippets of his past near the end of the series), yin is just amazingly written, everyone else in hei's syndicate was also well written. Some of the other characters in my opinion were a hit and miss, including misaki who I didn't care for at all. I think that all of the contractors had Cool and intresting powers but they weren't developed enough which made me rate the characters a little lower than I should have.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-6: the first 14 or so episodes were fantastic. Around episode 14 explains yin's past and that is probably one of the best episodes I've ever seen in any anime ever. I'm being serious. However, the final 12 episodes were a a complete drag to get through. They were boring and predictable. You knew exactly what was going to happen, 'Hei finds contractor he has to fight, he kills them, the end'. This is what all of the final 12 episodes were about(except for the final 2 which were great). At times I found myself having to try and watch some of the final episodes and just ended up Turning it off. I don't know why I didn't like the last half as much as the first but this is just what I think.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7: is DTB worth your time? Absolutely. It is a fun and great looking series with good characters and an almost perfect soundtrack. But, the last half of the series drags far too much out. However this honestly depends on what you can stand and how patient you are with any series.\\n\r\nHowever this isn't a bad series by any means, you should definitely go out and watch it if you have the time.",

If you like supernatural action anime, DtB is for you. The fighting scenes are awesome, though usually fairly short. To me the series seemed a little more serious than other shows of similar genres (though DtB is rated M/R I don't really think it's that bad, there is blood and finger breaking, but I don't think it's mature material, of course it depends on your own tolerance for blood). DtB seemed to be lacking \"actual\" humor,as in the characters don't do or say anything exceptionally funny. But it has its moments. The characters are ones you won't forget, not to sound cliche, but by then end of the series you'll really feel for them. \\n\r\nI would defiantly recommend Darker Than Black to anyone who likes supernatural ass-kicking. \\n\r\n(I prefer the original version versus the (English) dubbed one, so if you don't mind reading subs I would encourage that you watched the Japanese version)",

I was looking forward to something that would rival Code Geass, but it seems that I was not able to enjoy it as much as I did. \r\nSTORY: 7/10\r\nThe story is original and interesting, however it could have been developed into a much more complex, full anime if there was more explanation and more episodes leading up to the ending. The whole thing seemed like little chapters that had little relevance to anything and the end was basically episodes 20-26. \r\nART: 6/10\r\nI have VERY high expectations for art, so thisrating is not too bad for my standards.

            "content": "Darker than Black was a fairly pleasant anime to watch. I've heard a lot of good comming from this anime, so I've decided to give a try. I wasn't overly surprised by it. It is an original concept and a fairly good idea behind, but they never dwell enough into it. We get this world where two mysterious gates appeared who knows why and who knows how. It is never explained. Not only that. It also changes some humans into contractors, giving them abilities beyond what a normal human being can do. There is a price to pay that differs from person to person. Again,it is not really explained why that is.\\n\\n\r\nNot that the idea of people with superpowers is wrong, but a good explanation is needed. The contractors are linked to the Gate and...? It stops there. As far as the payment goes, some are quite plain and some are just gruesome, like eating cigarettes or children. They do mention at some point that it could be link to a trauma the contractor went through when he was still ''human''.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise, there is a lot of plot points (I mention them above) that kept me from enjoying the show as much as I would have otherwise. The two-parters episodes felt really episodic. The storyline still got across, but not enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, Hei was a breath of fresh air. With his two personalites, going back and forth between them, he was really well played. As for his team... Some of them had a background, others didn't. It would have been nice to know at least a little but more about Mao. You have this talking cat, and we know he has lost his original body, but how? It is never answered, or nothing that is related to him. Yin is still weird. We got her history, but how did she became a doll? Dolls are never explaned either. The backgrounds characted are nice but there is nothing much to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good, between slower/faster scene. Some of the action scenes were a nice balance of fast-pace action and slow-mo, to let us fully see what is happening. Expected nothing less from Bones. The drawings were good, but not great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this serie. The story plotholes were a big thrownback.",

            "content": "During one ominous night, a part of Tokyo became what is known as \u201cHell\u2019s Gate\u201d, a field that seems to be closely tied to the emergence of Dolls, emotionless spiritual mediums, and Contractors, assassins with superpowers who only rely on their logic. Our main guy, Hei, is one of these Contractors, currently working for a mysterious crime organization only known as the \u201cSyndicate\u201d. Another thing you should know about Contractors is that after they use their powers they have to fulfill their contract by performing some specific activity, that is harmful and unpleasant to them. This element is one of my favourite things about theseries, since it really helps to distinguish it from other series where people have superpowers, and it gives the show sort of it\u2019s own personality. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY 9/10\\n\r\nThe first 22 episodes of Darker Than Black are broken into 2 episode arcs, which is the reason I initially started to watch this series. I am a big fan of episodic shows like Mushishi or Jigoku Shoujo but Darker Than Black is a little different. All of the arcs are somehow related to the main plotline or at least reveal something interesting about one of the main characters. The last three episodes conclude the story in a truly spectacular manner that leaves you wanting more. I\u2019ve seen some shows with mysterious premise that have a terrible ending but Darker Than Black is definitely not one of these. Another thing about the series is that it never spells out for you what is currently going on. You have to figure out a lot of it by yourself by reading in between the lines but no matter how much you try some parts of the plot will remain unknown for the whole 25 episodes, which is why I took of the one point in the story ranking. There is a sequel though so there is still hope that it will shed some light onto the mysteries of Darker Than Black.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 6/10\\n\r\nIn my opinion, characters were the weak point of this series mainly because of one thing, the main character Hei/Li/BK201/Black Reaper... I\u2019ve seen some people who really like this guy, and I can kind of see why, but personally I think that he is the worst thing about this series. He really has two different personalities; one as an innocent transfer student who\u2019s annoying as hell and another one as a cold-blooded killer who changes his face expression once per arc, at best. He goes through a fair bit of development but you can\u2019t really tell that about him. Same monotone voice, same facial expression, same fighting style and even when he steps forward and does something big and unexpected it\u2019s still more of the same. He\u2019s not a broken character by any means; it\u2019s just that I can\u2019t stand him. Although the supporting cast was a little stereotypical they were well developed and most of the side characters weren\u2019t underused.  \\n\\n\r\nART 9/10\\n\r\nArt is definitely another strong point of this series. It is not quite up to the likes of \u201c5 centimeters per Second\u201d but the animation creates a great, gloomy atmosphere that\u2019s really at the core of the series. The abilities and the fights are animated skillfully, because even in wild and intense fights you always know what is going on and even when some of the fights aren\u2019t that great, the animation usually makes up for it. The characters each have their unique look so you\u2019ll never mistake them for others and even the CGIs manage to blend in quite well. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\r\nThe first opening is kind of neat because it features lines that directly relate to the series but it also has a sequence where the opening titles appear in a way that kind of hurt my eyes, so I usually ended up skipping it. The second opening is solid but nothing captivating. Both endings are on the mellow side, but the second one is kind of odd and seems to be made for some romance/slice of life anime. The backing sound through ought the series is good and, again, helps to reinforce the atmosphere, although I am not a big fan of some of the strings-heavy classical pieces. I think some dramatic piano music would fit much better with a series like that. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 7/10\\n\r\nDarker Than Black is a good series that has a good storyline with great ending. The technical aspects are also really well done, and the pacing is good too but the thing that bothered me a lot was the lead character who annoyed the hell out of me. However, I\u2019ve seen a lot of reviews that praised the main guy so it might be just me and personal preference shouldn\u2019t keep you away from seeing a solid series like Darker Than Black.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 7/10\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nTOTAL 39/50 = 7.8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe review ratings round out to 8/10, but personally I rated it a 7 just because I don't think that it is quite as good as other animes I rated 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe ratings round out to an 8 but, personally, I rated it a 7 just because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as good as other animes I rated 8.\\n\\n",

Hei, a contractor with abilities related to electricity, is the protagonist. His struggle seems to be finding his actual purpose in the world besides being a killing machine. The actual origin of the characters and events in the plot are explained very vaguely; I'm assuming that they lead the audience to make their own interpretations throughout the show. Because of the lack of background storytelling, Darker than Black can become a little confusing at times, but nevertheless it remains to be a classic.There's so little to explain about this series, but I believe it mostly speaks for itself.

            "content": "\"One of the easiest formulas to execute in the supernatural genre is each relevant character having a specific skill from berth. Each time we see a new character we are introduced to a new gimmicky skill set that our hero\u2019s balanced ability has to overcome somehow. Its really handy because you only have to explain how everyone gets these abilities once and it applies for everyone. Darker then Black is one of the best examples of this formula.\"\r\nDarker than black is a very solid series that\u2019s quality degrades the closer you reach the end.The series starts out strong with good characters and a diverse setting.As the end nears the pace begins to ramp up steeply. By the end we lose sight of the characters and their motivations. Despite how well made and diverse it is, Darker than Black is a series that falls apart right when it matters most.\\n\\n\r\nDarker Than Black follows your typical supernatural setting. A cataclysmal even created false stars in the sky and gave creation to supernatural beings with powers that vary greatly. Its biggest strength in this regard is its diversity. Rather then head the elemental route, Darker Than Black offers some truly unique abilities. A fat opera singer with deadly volume, a man with explosive blood, we are presented with an array of abilities that diverge far from the standard pokemon type chart style abilities. Combine this with a rich cast of interesting characters and you have the backbone for a solid B+ series.\\n\\n\r\nThe first fifteen episodes or so are mostly about becoming acclimated to the world. Much of what happens is to flesh out the characters that will be in play and what our hero\u2019s motivation is. Many of these episodes are simply filler type episodes that have random side quests and world building tours. From there on the speed of events begins to quicken very hastily. Most episodes consisted of individual events or missions. The last third however is a tangled series of events that stream out at a rapid pace very dissimilar to the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs the climax approaches Darker Than Black introduces a new antagonist. We have no prior exposition to these people and, despite having ties to the protagonist prior to the series beginning, they feel as if they come out of nowhere. From then on there\u2019s little time left to cover everything that is going on. By the end our protagonist is presented with a choice that comes out of nowhere and a decision that makes no sense. There is a major change in character that occurs without any foreshadowing or explanation. A switch gets flipped and everything is changed. Then it ends.\\n\\n\r\nDarker then black confused the crap out of me. Everything was very manageable and controlled. Then a green haired chick appears and Hei stops acting like himself. We never get a complete explanation of what happened. The next series jumps ahead multiple years to a completely broken Hei. Did we witness the shattering of his character or what? What happened to Hei was framed as a breakthrough of enlightenment but when you step back it makes zero sense and leaves the ending to Darker Than Black in shambles. This series could have been much better has it take the time to explain itself.\\n\\n\r\nSource :http://lumbercrack.tumblr.com/post/80738651529/darker-than-black",

There is a well array of action based drama and character narration. Certain things happen throughout this anime that make say \"man what the hell happened before all this started\". Its a true demonstration of a mystery. The characters are quite interesting as well as their super human abilities go. Its fun to see how the main character deals with his foes. He has a unique style and personality As the story unravels you really become attached to itand just have to see how it all pans out. I fell like there could have been better reasoning for certain things in the anime and a stronger more defined \"force of opposition\" i suppose but in the end this anime wasn't about heroes. It was more so about the characters finding closure within themselves and thus a better understanding of the people they live amongst, which aren't always human. I say this anime is definitely worth the watch and there is actually a 2nd season on its way too so if you do enjoy Darker than Black youll have something to look forward to.",

If you are familiar with Cowboy Bebop and enjoyed it, chances are you will enjoy Darker Than Black.\r\n-The story is mostly, episodic , but does follow an overall story in the background, which becomes a lot more apparent in the later episodes. Although, the show willleave you in the moment that you long for more, it might be better for those of you who do not want confusion to stay clear of latter seasons. As the conclusion, in the first season is well reached. But  I myself, did not heed to this warning given to me by other fans of the series, the later series are watched at the cost of severe decrease in writing and character development.\\n\\n\r\nBut just WATCH THE SERIES!

            "content": "Note: This includes a review for the Second season and Gaiden OVA as well\r\nBones does a fantastic job with the Darker Than Black series in creating a dark fantasy world where humans and \"contractors\" with supernatural powers are at odds with each other over not just control/power but also the right to exist. The MC, Hei, is so intriguing with his constant struggle between his human and contractor side (not to mention that he is a complete badass). The rest of the crew including Yin, Mao and even Huang make a very dynamic team and each has a very dark and complicated past. Even theother supporting characters get fleshed out pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season is an absolute thrill and I couldn't stop watching till the very end. It does a great job of having individual arcs (that are each 2 episodes long) which introduce us to tons of great characters while slowly delving into the deep and satisfying overarching story. There's a ton of plot twists and you honestly don't know where everyone's true intentions and motivations lie. The quality is great throughout and the action and anticipation keeps on building until the very last episode. However, the second season (Gemini) and OVA (Gaiden) are definitely not as strong as the first season (I mean it's a tough act to follow) but are still enjoyable nonetheless even with their flaws. Particularly, I just wish that Hei was a bit more of the focus in the second season rather than Suo. Also, the season 2 ending...\\n\\n\r\nThe action is awesome throughout the entire series and you see a good variety of different powers amongst the many contractors that we meet in this series. You can tell Hei is a badass but he isn't super over-powered compared to the enemies which makes the battles more entertaining. The dub is pretty solid for this series with Hei rocking his best impersonation of the Christian Bale Batman voice. I'd definitely recommend at least watching the first season as it is a staple of the darker action/thriller anime genre for a reason. You won't be disappointed in this Bones work. And I just gotta say that I still love me some Misaki.\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10",

            "content": "Okay, firstly this anime rocks. I'm not joking, it's one of the most gripping and thrilling animes (for me) to date. Written and directed by Tensai Okamura and produced by Bones, this anime tells us the story of what happened as a result of a certain anomaly at 'Heavans Gate' in South America. As a result, at the opposite side of the world in Japan, 'Hells Gate' was opened and massive changes happened to the country.\r\nThe night sky is a reoccurring theme in this series. The real stars were replaced by false ones due to the opening of Hell's Gate. With these fake stars camethe Contractors. These are people [not sure if you can call them people as they have no emotions whatsoever but meh that's your decision] each have a different 'power' and a different price for that power. They have no emotions, they don't feel, they can only think rationally and what's in their best interest. As well as this, each Contractor has a corresponding star in the fake night sky, which allows the normal humans to track what each contracted is doing. Throughout the anime, the humans (that know of these Contractors) refer to them by their star names (eg BK-201 is the name for Hei). \\n\r\n[getting a bit complex right?]\\n\\n\r\nHei is a member of an organisation known as 'The Syndicate'. This organisation is considered to be some underground group with no real motif. But as the series progresses it becomes apparent that it's operatives work with Contractors in order to regain peace in the world and they strive for the destruction of Hells Gate. \\n\r\nIn my opinion these is a lot of background knowledge needed to fully understand this anime, maybe rewatching season 1 before progressing to Ry\u016bsei no Gemini would be more sensible than blindly binging on this show.\\n\r\nThe characters really become noteworthy and it was a pleasure to watch this show. I personally didn't enjoy that I had to watch the episodes over and over again to fully understand it but I guess that's the beauty of it.\\n\r\nThere's a fair share of humour, especially from Mao (a cat who talks) who's sarcasm is unrivalled  but on the other side of the table, there are copious amounts of genuinely heartfelt moments (mainly between Hei and Yin) that you as a viewer can really relate too. \\n\\n\r\nPlease note that I neither have the energy, nor the words to fully review each and every character in this show.. Mainly as I'd give away quite a bit but also it's open to personal interpretation.. In my opinion this is a rare anime that should remain a favourite of mine for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating for this anime is a solid 9. It did get boring at times and it was somewhat predictable in places but my god was it brilliantly written. I think that it's the kind of anime that you watch on a rainy day (mainly as there's A LOT of rain in this anime, I dunno maybe it's just me)\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/9\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\nStoryline: 9\\n\r\nRewatchability: Medium to High\\n\\n\r\nI hoped you enjoyed reading this review as much as I did watching this anime, if not, tell me why in the comments or pm me to discuss it further - I'd love to hear from you lot! Give me suggestions for what to watch next, I want to keep these reviews regular! Next on the list is Kill La Kill\u2026\\n\\n\r\nPeace and Love,\\n\r\nShvdowd\\n",

A green-haired, white-jumpsuited girl? A superpower? Sounds familiar. These traits have made Code Geass great and are in Darker than Black as well!\r\nThe main character, Hei, has the stereotypical dual personality that most superheroes possess-- on the surface he is an ordinary transfer student, but underneath all of that isactually a contractor (people with special abilities given by the \"Gate\") who wears a black coat and mask and has been dubbed with the name, Black Reaper. Each character in the anime has a unique personality and past, and develops as the story progresses. The more you watch, the more you'll uncover secrets and events that make them who they are. Some big questions aren't answered until near the end, which only makes you want to watch more! Even the side characters are interesting, since it's always fun to find out what their powers are and what the price to that power is.\\n\\n\r\nEach fight in the anime is intense and exciting, with excellent animation and epic background music, and every once and a while a fun episode or scene to lighten the mood.

            "content": "One of the major prerequisites for me to liking an anime and to be able continuing watching more than just a few episodes is that I must like or at least be able to stand the main character.\r\nIt's been a long time since I liked an MC this much. Hei (aka the grim reaper) basically defines what it takes to have a secret identity; to be able to be one person - a well-to-do, somewhat clueless, quiet guy - and to turn around and be someone completely different - a ruthless agent of death tracking down rouge 'contractors'. When you merge these two persona's youget a well matured individual whose really just seeking the truth. When you witness him in action you come to realize this is a guy whose very good at doing what needs to be done. There's no epic fights or drawn out discussions. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in this series are well created as well, especially, the crew working with Hei. At first I thought they pulled the cliche with the talking cat, but there's a good reason for it and it adds for some good random humor relief. Huang, the older man, is another character I had to warm up to and eventually really liked. Kirihara is another good character which they really worked on throughout the whole show. Though, I don't think they made a big enough impact with Amber. Was she once Hei's love? How did they meet? What happened in between that S. America event and the time of the show?\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is above average. Thankfully there's no shortcuts with the action sequences and nothing seems to be recycled. I like how this is a show with super powers but unlike most, the super powers isn't the star of the show. The fight scenes are strategic, especially with the way Hei fights. Even if one of his knives miss...it doesn't really miss.\\n\\n\r\nThe story would be better if they explained more as to what the f*cks going on! By the end of it all I was kind of like \"I think I get it...do I?\" Animes have always been ambiguous with the 'why?'.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10.",

            "content": "I never really expected to finish watching this anime or the ova..or the second season. At first I just wanted to watch because (fan girl confession) I thought hei looked hot. ._. \r\nThough as I watched the first two episodes (part 1&2) I was hooked no joke. Hei was seen as  criminal to many peoples eyes was actually a good guy . Even at first I thought he was bad news that he doesn't care about no one, but really he had the biggest heart for a contractor.  After watching and watching I knew that each characters been through horrible times- for exampleHuang , I figured as him as an asshole but really he was a man in pain. He's episode actually made me cry the same goes for Yin. After finishing the ova and season 2 I couldn't seem to live I started reading the manga which only explain what happen after the first season not season 2, so that was a shame. \\n\r\nLong story short: This anime is more than just an action anime. \\n",
