            "content": "Time is the whole series when the process, action, or situation is in place or takes place. In this case, the time scale is the interval between two states / events, or it can be the duration of an event.\r\nwhen we are traveling or sleeping we don't know what happened to the situation out there in other words if we pull out a hair what happens to our head? it doesn't have much effect on us to imagine when a piece of hair gets pulled one by one over a long period of time what happens? of course we will feel the impact of asingle hair.\\n\\n\r\nin the world we live there is nothing that can stop time as our will is like a spinning wheel we live always spinning and experiencing some heavy process and if the wheel loses the chain what happens? the wheel will stop spinning like a world that stops spinning and only shows day and night forever.\\n\\n\r\nand so on and on ...\\n\\n\r\nOriginally a visual novel by 5pb and Nitroplus, Steins; Gate 0 tells the story of Okabe Rintaro (the crazy scientist known as Hououin Kyouma) who fails to save his lover and cannot stop the occurrence of the third world war. Okabe spends the rest of his time lamenting sadness after losing his lover and time spent with his \"friends\". The gadget is the name of the laboratory that Okabe founded to experiment on tools that could be said to be like the tools of the future. After experiencing Okabe's failure to save his lover he no longer visits the laboratory he founded with his colleagues.\\n\\n\r\nafter he gave up he threw out the name of chunnibyou \"Hoounin Kyouma\" and decided to become an ordinary student after three months of studying / as a student he met with the assistant professor at the place where he studied \"Maho Hiyajo\" a woman aged twenty-one years. the woman Okabe attended the brain intelligence seminar created by \"Alexis Lexinen\" in the seminar appeared Okabe's lover who had died a while ago but his lover was in the form of AI (Artifical Intelligence).\\n\\n\r\nSteins; Gate 0 is a good series, but unlike the previous series in this series it seems not too tense. White Fox is the maker of two series of Steins; Gate, this studio gives a good impression in adapting Novel Visuals and Manga (no need to be surprised because the studio this is a studio that produces Akame ga Kill and Re: Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seiketsu which until now has become the best-selling series).\\n\\n\r\naside from the matter above now an anime series will not be good if it is not supported by voice actors, song themes, and song background (BGM) like a car if there are no supporters like wheels then it will not work well. Thanks to the voice this time of course only this matter did not escape Miyano Mamoru's voice talents as \"Okabe Rintarou\", Hanazawa Kana as \"Shiina Mayuri\", Imai Asami as \"Makise Kurisu\" (although she did not play many roles and was AI), and Seki Tomokazu as \"Hashida Itaru \"once again I thank the series voice this time for struggling in carrying out their duties.\\n\\n\r\nfor the opening theme \"Fatima\" sung by \"Itou Kanako\" he has already contributed in the making of the opening theme song in the previous series. For the music background it's pretty good especially when the \"twenty-two\" episode starts from music that makes the audience get excited and sad\\n\\n\r\nThis series gets three new characters, \"Hiyajo Maho\" as the protagonist, \"Shiina Kagari\" (he is a person from the future who came with Suzuha to stop the third world war) as Tritagonist (Middle Protagonist and Antagonist), and the last is \" Leskinen Alexis \"acts as an Antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has the impression of being funny, sad, tense, and so romantic, it's no wonder the viewers are confused by the nets of the story. Although this series focuses more on the daily life of \"Okabe Rintarou\" who fails to save his lover, compared to the fight itself it may this might have an effect on the value or ranking down in this series even though in this series it is also no less stressful than the previous series.\\n\\n\r\neven though Steins; Gate 0 is an anime science fiction it is not denied even though the time we passed from this moment we cannot return or repeat and change it according to our own desires because it is something that is contrary to the universe.\\n\\n\r\nit is strange if the final winding is regret or happiness",

            "content": "What happens when the hero fails to save the day and just gives up? \r\nAccording to Steins;Gate 0, he spirals into a state of complete depression and despair, becoming a shell of his former self.\r\nSteins;Gate 0 is an alternate future where protagonist Okabe Rintarou fails to save Makise Kurisu. It\u2019s sort of a \u201cwhat if\u201d story that shows what would happen if Okabe gave up on trying to reach the sacred Steins;Gate world line in which everyone is happy and there\u2019s no apocalypse in the near future. To put it bluntly, S;G0 blew me away. It\u2019s been quite a long time since I\u2019ve been sothoroughly entertained by an anime. For me, S;G0 was able to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessor, and it tells a truly compelling narrative.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s amazing how the personality change of one person can affect so many. The mad scientist Hououin Kyouma died alongside Kurisu in the beta world line where this story takes place, leaving behind a nihilistic and broken Okabe Rintarou. Viewers can clearly see just how hard the rest of the cast, especially Mayuri, take Okabe\u2019s character transformation. Gone is the humorous banter and close companionship that the characters shared in the original Steins;Gate. It has been replaced with a dark and uncomfortable atmosphere, and as someone who was warmed by Okabe\u2019s positive relationships with his friends, it\u2019s downright depressing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAn even harder loss to swallow is Makise Kurisu. She\u2019s quite frankly an amazing character. Makise is intelligent, attractive, a bit of a tsundere and an otaku, has a lot of great and funny moments in the original anime, and is just admirably supportive of Okabe, acting as his crutch during his times of despair. It wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to call her an ideal girl. She even sacrifices herself so that Okabe can live in an beta world line in which Mayuri lives. Wow, she might just be a bit too perfect\u2026Although she\u2019s dead in S;G0, there\u2019s an amazing episode where Okabe transitions into an alpha world line where Kurisu is alive, yet Mayuri is deceased. The episode is basically there to remind us just how phenomenal Makise is, and that makes it all the more painful when Okabe returns to the beta world line, leaving Kurisu behind. I\u2019m not gonna lie, I was starting to get a little emotional at the end of the episode. \\n\\n\r\nSo with Makise deceased in this world line and Okabe having suppressed his flamboyant mad scientist nature in favor of a more emo persona, you might think that this anime is a lot weaker than its predecessor in the character department. Well, while I can admit the the original Steins;Gate is superior when it comes to characterization, the cast of S;G0 is still quite amazing in its own right. \\n\\n\r\nOkabe really is one of the greatest anime protagonist out there. One of the things that makes him so good is his ability to be unrealistically ridiculous with his bouts of chuunibyouism while being able to transition to a more solemn and vulnerable state when things get serious. The latter is heavily demonstrated in this anime, as the old, care free Okabe is gone, replaced by a serious man who still strives to help his friends, but struggles with his own doubts and insecurities. This portrays him as being truly human, because let\u2019s be real, I don\u2019t think any of us would be able to keep up a cheery image if we went through all of the pain that Okabe has faced. But do not despair, because Okabe\u2019s depression doesn\u2019t last forever. \\n\\n\r\nBecause just like the majestic phoenix, Hououin Kyouma ascends from the ashes and is born anew.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t spoil anything specific, but near the very end of the anime, Okabe finally regains his drive and determination, and once again becomes the mad scientist that we all know and love. For that entire episode, I had a big, stupid grin on my face. It was so refreshing to see the old Okabe again after so long, and literally every chuuni thing he did made me nearly burst out laughing. But he didn\u2019t go back to his old self on his own. No, his awakening can be truly attributed to the admirable support of his friends. \\n\\n\r\nWith Makise gone, the title of female protagonist goes to her scientist loli upperclassmen friend Maho Hiyajou. Now Makise has some pretty big shoes to fill, and being a loli, Maho\u2019s feet might be too small to fit- oh wait, this is an idiom\u2026whoops\u2026Well anyway, Maho ended up being a great addition to the cast. She might seem a bit one dimensional on the surface with her main defining feature being her desire to surpass Kurisu, but I can assure you that there is so much more to her character. Despite her small stature, Maho has a big part to play in the anime. She gives several inspirational speeches that help to push Okabe forward, constructs the time leap machine in Kurisu\u2019s absence, shows vulnerabilities despite her general awesomeness, and has many funny and entertaining moments in the show. Does she reach Kurisu\u2019s level? I don\u2019t think so, but she\u2019s a great character nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nI actually liked Daru a good deal more this time around. Perhaps it was because Okabe became somewhat of a vegetable for awhile, which allowed for Daru\u2019s personality to shine through. He actually has a nice lighthearted arc with his future wife and daughter Suzuha that develops his character. He provides some pretty good comic relief on occasion, and, along with Maho, is easily the most useful lab member to Okabe.  \\n\\n\r\nMayuri\u2019s role is important because through her, viewers can clearly see just how much the cast is negatively affected by Okabe\u2019s give up attitude. Gone are the kawaii tuturus~ and upbeat personality. They\u2019ve been replaced with a sad girl who just wants her prince Okabe to be happy. She feels herself slowly distancing from Okabe throughout the show, and even decides to time travel herself so that she can motivate Okabe to not give up on trying to save Kurisu. I found this to be quite admirable, and really like how the anime handled her character. \\n\\n\r\nThe other familiar faces from Steins;Gate unfortunately don\u2019t play much of a role in S;G0, but they all still contribute to the story in there own way, so it\u2019s only fair to give some of them a shout out.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuha just wants Okabe to reach Steins;Gate. She desperately tries to get him to time travel in order to fulfill the duty bestowed upon her by her father, and it hurts to see her fail. When it comes to Ruka, there\u2019s a touching moment where Ruka expresses a desire to help Okabe out in any way possible. Ruka feels left out of all of the secrets and just wants to be useful. It\u2019s just a small moment, but it shows just how caring Ruka can be, and I really appreciate that\u2026but he\u2019s a dude. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that his future self is pretty badass. And Faris\u2026well, umm, she\u2019s still a cute neko girl, so\u2026yeah.\\n\\n\r\nOut of the new characters aside from Maho, Professor Leskinen is easily the most memorable. He\u2019s an American in Japan, so as you can imagine, he has many comedic misunderstandings, such as his iconic \u201cWHERE ARE THE JAPANESE SHAMAN GIRLS LINTAHLO?\u201d line. He\u2019s a pretty cool dude, and ends up playing an important role in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOne issue that I do have is that for the longest time, I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what the primary conflict was. I assumed that it was to get to the Steins;Gate world line, but there are so many different things going on that it felt to me like the end goal was sort of being overshadowed. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I highly enjoyed these other plot points. You have Okabe trying to deal with his depression, Suzuha trying to get him to time travel, Maho trying to get out of Kurisu\u2019s shadow, the mystery behind Kagari, the whole Amadeus ordeal, the threat from America and Russia\u2026yeah, you get the point. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but for awhile I wasn\u2019t entirely sure where the anime was going. Of course, all of these things do actually correlate well with one another and contribute to what is to me a great story. I just wish it was a bit more focused. \\n\\n\r\nSo something about Steins;Gate 0 that I\u2019m sure most people will overlook is how it provides a model example for how comedy in an anime should be handled. I know, this is probably a weird statement to make considering the genre of the anime, but it\u2019s true, and S;G0\u2019s seamless implementation of comedic elements is honestly quite praiseworthy. Intertwining with the generally dark and psychological atmosphere of the show, the lighthearted moments are really able to shine through without being the least bit detrimental to the story progression. In many cases, they even proved to be a much needed breath of fresh air and fun. There are also a few fan service scenes (if you can even call them that considering how safe they are) primarily focused on Maho-tan, so if you\u2019re not into lolis, you might actually be turned off by these moments. I, of course, being a man of culture, agree with Daru\u2019s wise statement of \u201clegal loli for the win!\u201d Because remember, Maho is 21, so it\u2019s all perfectly legal. Definitely. No sirens, no FBI. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the technical aspects of the show, I have to say, the sound quality is simply fantastic. The opening theme song Fatima quickly rose to my favorite opening of the year, the endings were great as well, and the soundtrack just fits the anime perfectly. Steins;Gate also has my two favorite seiyuu, Mamoru Miyano and Kana Hanazawa, so that\u2019s a big bonus. And the other voice actors do an amazing job as well. So yeah, I really have no complaints at all when it comes to the sound. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest issue with this show would be it\u2019s visuals. So this anime came out seven years after it\u2019s predecessor, yet there are absolutely no improvements with the visual quality whatsoever. Now they didn\u2019t get worse either, and I can understand the need to keep the visuals similar and consistent between the two anime. But I still expected the animation to be at least a little more polished and detailed. Oh, and some of the action scenes near the end to me just looked really cringy, which is unfortunate. But the character designs are still great, and the artistic quality of the show is still pretty good, despite the flaws I mentioned. It\u2019s just that I have to be a bit nitpicky since this wouldn\u2019t be much of a review if I didn\u2019t point out the flaws, right?\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 is an exceptional anime. Even with it\u2019s male lead acting as a shell of his former self for some time and the female lead dead, it was still able to weave an exciting, albeit a bit unfocused at times, tale about the repercussions of time travel, and is filled with an endearing cast of characters. It may just be the telling of an alternate ending to the original anime, but it was simply an enjoyable ride. I was thoroughly entertained by every episode, and can definitely say that Steins;Gate 0 is one of the greatest anime that I\u2019ve seen in a long time.\\n",

            "content": "\"WHERE ARE THE JAPANESE SHAMAN GIRLS LINTAHLO?!!\" - Good Boi Leskinen\r\nBack in 2011, we were stunned by the hit-anime named \"Steins;Gate\" with its unique story-telling of Sci-Fi, which is time-travel in the anime industry. The industry doesn't have many anime that focuses on time-travel conflicts. So far, the only time-travel anime I've watched were Steins;Gate and ERASED, which both made me amused, excited and thrilled on their unique, individual scenes. Now, this Spring 2018, we were hitted by nostalgia with the return of the Steins;Gate franchise although, instead of it having a sequel, we get a \"midquel\" of the original Steins Gate. Thus, we getto watch the phenomenal dark story of the franchise named \"Steins;Gate 0\". Just a brief reminder, before you watch Steins Gate 0, keep in mind this is an alternate story of the original. After Episode 22/23 of the original series, watch \"Steins;Gate: Episode 23 (B), Open the Missing Link\", where this episode leads to the episode 1 of Steins;Gate 0. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWe get to follow the story of a man once named \"Hououin Kyouma\" but then he suddenly changed with a certain incident, changing him back to only \"Okabe, Rintarou.\" Hence, \"Hououin Kyouma\" was no more in this world. We are looking into a broken-man named \"Okabe, Rintarou\". With him not finding the goal which is the Steins;Gate world line, he was stuck to be in the Beta World Line, where Kurisu sacrificed herself for Mayuri. This is a story where Okabe failed to reach a good ending and was now stuck in a world line where WW3 was inevitable. If you want to expect more dark revelations like what the original Steins;Gate did, then you are on the right series because revelations are breathtaking on each episode of Steins Gate 0. We get to follow an Okabe who wears a dark suit, not a lab coat, depicting how his mental state is. Here, we get to see how he, a once delusional man, is now a normal college student. But, when \"Amadeus\" (AI Kurisu) was introduced to him, the peace that Okabe was longing started to get disrupted. Basically, everything up to the last episode, was related to \"Amadeus\" keeping the plot synopsis in tact and the characters as well. What I like about the story is the originality of the plot rather than copy-pasting from the original anime. Scenes that were anime-original that cannot be found in the VN were some instance, were there as well. Another thing was that the story keeps becoming dark and dark and as it goes darker, the characters are developing as well making the thrill of the story fitting to the characters not only Okabe but the others as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWhat makes a great anime is a ton of great and well-developed characters and the Steins;Gate franchise always impresses us, including Steins;Gate 0 with their characters. Take our favorite mad-scientist for example \"Hououin Kyouma\". We were so attached to him on the original Steins;Gate that seeing him being so broken and fragile on Steins;Gate 0 makes me (and I bet the fans as well), hoping the great mad-scientist will return someday. But even tho he was so broken and fragile, due to the story's progression, his character development progressed each episode as well. Then we have Shiina Mayuri, who shockingly have the best character development of all. She did something so courageous that is out of her character and made us fans say \"Great Job Mayuri.\". Of course we will not forget Hashida Daru. The perverted otaku and hacker who for some instance a dad, a caring friend and a scientist. If you finished this anime, you know why Daru really improved alot on this series not only on a romantic way but with Okabe as well. Then we have Makise Kurisu (Amadeus a.k.a AI Kurisu), again like Mayuri, Courage made her a great character in an instance even though she is just a computer version of the actual Kurisu. Or should I say, she is just a fake. Not to mention the \"trap\" Ruka to have some character development even tho her screentime is not that much. Along with Ruka (who is a supporting characters) are of course Mr Braun and Moeka. If you watched the original Steins Gate you would have known they are the villains (SERN's employees or like that) but it is a good fact that this two are allies of Okabe on this Beta World Line, so expect some revelations of villains ahead.\\n\r\nThen we are introduced with some new characters like Professor Leskinen and Hiyajou, Maho. Maho, who is a colleague of Kurisu back in America shows lots of character traits but one of them was jealousy. Then this trait was shattered as episode goes on and on and we see her having more confidence to herself. Then there's Professor Leskinen who just wants her japanese shaman girls Lintahlo!!!.. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThere's nothing to say about to visuals/art design of Steins;Gate 0 as it stays just what it was back in the 2011 adaptation of Steins;Gate, and of course I'm glad it stayed that way. However, if look at it, there are more action scenes on Steins;Gate 0 compared to Steins;Gate. If your an action fan you will be disappointed as the actions are pretty whacky and not so good. But since we all know Steins;Gate is more focus on the Sci-Fi and thriller stuffs, we can let it all slip. The visuals of the opening and endings are phenominal and matches the current state of the characters on the story. Not to mention, the Endings as well. But out of all those, the first ending which is entitled \"LAST GAME\" grabbed my attention both visually and musically. Its inferences and basis of Okabe and Mayuri to the first half of the story are all in that ED. Overall, the visuals are great.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nA good anime comes with good openings, endings and background music and oh boy..... Zero really made my ears feel the nostalgia back when I watched Steins;Gate and play the VNs. Aside from the openings and endings being good, the background music as I hear them some felt like I heard them before. Even tho they are reusing those background music, it doesn't affect the story and scene at all. It actually makes the scene more powerful and eye-catching with your ears hearing those nostalgic beats. \\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are a diehard steins gate fan you wil love this 23 episodes ride of Steins;Gate 0. It actually felt like I watched a whole another anime which should be because if I felt that I just rewatched Steins;Gate, then Zero would have lacked uniqueness with its plot and characters. But thank god I didn't felt that and I enjoyed it at the same level of the original Steins;Gate. Even tho it is more dark, it should be and will always be a good anime to watch if you feel like Steins;Gate was not enough. If you haven't watched Steins;Gate, do it now and then watch this. I assure you. You will not regret it. El..Psy..Congroo..",

In reliving time, I learned one thing\u2026 That certain events converge as if orchestrated by God. Trying to change them\u2026 it\u2019s challenging God. And God does not tolerate human arrogance. '' Okabe Rintaro\r\n''This vague, ominous feeling\u2026 It\u2019s like living in a nightmare where I know all the bad things to come. Where the world enjoys to rub in the guilt of my unspeakeable sin. This inescapable despair... Slowly becomes a downward spiral... '' Okabe Rintaro\r\nSteins;Gate 0 is the bleak reality ofthe Beta World Line. Basically, it's Okabe's story of the tragic future of the beta line, portraying his depression and how he managed to plan Operation Skuld. Steins;Gate 0 arises from the premisse \"what if?\". What if Okabe had made another decision, giving up everything? \\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\r\nIt is highly recommended watch Steins;Gate 0 because it explains exactly the events that leads to the end of the original series, why this tragic future needs desperately to change. The dialogues are dense and shocking (episode 16 is the perfect proof of this), since Okabe tries to live a normal life but, even so he sinks in an absolute sadness. See only if you have that in mind, because it is not easy to recover from a trauma, and his motives to become depressed are entirely plausible. Hououin Kyouma will return, we all know, but surely he must experience total despair before the glorious return and the glorious ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nThe art is very similar to the original, however, here has many more dark tones to leave a more tense atmosphere. I also like the fact that the camera focuses a lot on the traumatized expression of the Okabe, emphasizing all his suffering. The only problem of the art is the animation of the action scenes that occur in episode 17 and 18, but since it\u2019s not an anime focused totally in action, I can overlook this a little bit. But I hope they will improve this at the final edition.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is simply beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nThe characters continue to have a good development, especially Okabe, Daru, Mayuri and Maho. They all have a backstory, philosophical and subjective debates, goals and dramas. I would say that initially Steins;Gate 0 as well as Steins;Gate has a focus on character development, only that in S;G 0 they are developed in a dense environment, which further increases the thrilling atmosphere. It is noteworthy that, PRACTICALLY in the whole anime Okabe is depressed and hopeless, which is not a bad thing, it is totally plausible for the reasons I mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nIf you loved Steins; Gate, you'll love this one. All the dark atmosphere and the deep feelings that are addressed in every episode. If you felt comfortable after the ending of Steins;Gate, be prepared to be punched in the gut with every episode. This is not your feel-good anime. This anime will torment you with feels in a way you wouldn't expect.\\n\\n\r\nS;G 0 is so much underrated. I believe that a large portion did not understand some points of the plot, premise and the interweaving of routes of the VN. The point is that Steins;Gate 0 should not be observed separately, since the main premise is to complement the True Ending, giving a totally new great meaning to it. Basically it's the story of the Operation Skuld but not about the Operation Skuld.\\n\\n\r\nThis way, it can be said that the main issue addressed in Steins;Gate 0 is sacrifice. I can't say much more about the True Ending due to spoilers, but It's implied that 0kabe lives through multiple PR and V&A like scenarios. What I can say is that Steins;Gate 0 is very, very complex... maybe even more complex than the original series, because it has several layers and infinite loops of failures and sacrifices, plus the end is extremely sad. It is a sensational experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, It's a great sequel. Steins;Gate 0 has a genial psychological plot with a very dark atmosphere and incredible soundtrack. Just like Steins;Gate, this series deserves to be watched by all humans of this and other World Lines. \\n\\n\r\nEl Psy Kongroo.",

            "content": "Steins;Gate 0 is a story following \"Open the Missing Link\" - episode 23B of Steins;Gate.\r\nCharacters:\r\nMy biggest gripe with the show is that no character delivers anything worth hearing in 20 episodes of the series. Okabe is a one-dimensional depressed person who's only way of exuding emotion is through shocked expressions. Mayuri is nothing but a plot device who clings to Okabe for reasons unknown since she has no character development at all. Her entire reasoning for existence is to love Okabe and that's it.\r\nKagari is there to exist solely to look like Kurisu and make you feel bad. Nothing else... but she's a cliffhanger for4 episodes only to be overshadowed shortly after. She did not have enough character development prior to showing the sob story for you to even care.\\n\\n\r\nI could break down each character, but this is what each of them are. They're all hollow characters that have no justification for their actions. There's no backstory and if there is it's as basic as it could get, it's just \"This is them, and this is how they will always act.\" and they never deviate from that. \\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\nWorld War 3 is imminent and they need to shift world lines to find \"Steins;Gate\" but Okabe says \"nope\". After too many episodes, he says \"maybe\". After more episodes, he's just thrown into the future and he says \"oh wow, maybe I should have done something\". From there his entire perspective changes because he \"didn't think it'd be like this even though he knew it'd be like this but didn't think about it\". He actually says that. That's it. Every other sub-plot that tried to fit itself in is now over-shadowed by this. Why did they exist? Mommy/daughter scenes? And did I mention this was 21 EPISODES of a 23 EPISODE series? So now he's in a race to get back to the past to revert all the crap we had to painfully sit through.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt one of the worst animations I've seen from an Anime that has done well world-wide. They pick it up in the final 4 episodes, but even than it barely passes. They kept the same art style which was great and a plus, but the proportions were insanely ridiculous in certain scenes. The action scenes were abysmal and sadly they came towards the end of the series. The series suffered a lot of realism with how poorly done every action shot was. Overall, it was pretty lackluster and the amount of close-ups of people's faces started to become uncomfortable. Each episode seemed to have a different \"budget\" - some episodes looked bad, others looked a lot better, etc. Steins;Gate looked better, and that was 7 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThere are no twists or turns along the way. Everything you thought would happen, did happen. And the worst part is, the show made you think you're stupid and left EACH one of these things on a \"cliffhanger\". We knew how this ended before it began, so why did you put cliffhangers of character deaths in it? That's lazy writing. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot moved at a snail pace and the story didn't flow together at all. It felt as if 5 people wrote it without talking with one another. They don't delve into the plot until episode 20. Instead you sat through watching Okabe be sad and people trying to cheer him up with slight plot nuances here and there that you saw coming a mile away. There is no sci-fi/mystery in this, there are no philosophical quotes/ideas. It's just, \"hey get the time machine let's go back in time\". The conclusions are just chopped up to \"convergence\" with no consistency or even showing it since it'd look so idiotic. \\n\\n\r\nThe new characters are all shadows of past characters(Kurisu vs Maho)... or Kagari being a duplicate of Suzuha that looks like Kurisu. We still don't even know why she does. That's the type of originality this show has to offer. It banked on nostalgia of Steins;Gate and it shows - this wouldn't hold its own if it didn't exist. The fan service episodes, the non-existent character development... and most of all, how little everything made sense when you look into it.\\n\\n\r\nAmadeus is reduced to a plot device for people who wanted to see her and they needed to add some melodrama to it that made NO SENSE. The story makes you fixate on one thing, and hopes you forget about everything prior and what's to come countless times. I'll give one example. Why do we need a full episode of Amadeus right before the finale when Okabe knows the AI has to seize existing to have the REAL Kurisu next episode? Why did it exist? It's like they forgot the entire plot for one episode in hopes of recreating what the original had that wasn't forced. Any other cliche made sense there, \"I'm coming to save you Kurisu. I love you.\" - I'd go as far as to say THAT was better than what they did. It fit into the theme of what Okabe was at the time, unlike what they did.\\n\\n\r\n If you're looking for a sci-fi/thriller with a great plot, watch the original again. If you want to see the same ideas rehashed with bad writing, bad characters, and pointless plots with a good amount of fan service... look no further. Steins;Gate 0 awaits you.",

            "content": "This is my second review ever so cut me some slack :p\r\nSteins;gate zero is an alternate ending to the original series we all love steins;gate, in this ending okabe fails to save Kirisu and he gives up all hope of saving her and goes into depression.\r\nStory: As somebody who has played the VN i am happy how the adaptation is turning out, I especially like the psychological scenes. The pacing is also better then the original steins;gate because we don't need to introduce every single character which happened in the original steins;gate (a good 10 episodes or so). \r\nStory: 9\r\nArt: So white fox is atit again, we have all the characters we know and love in some different outfits that look quite nice in my opinion, especially Okabe looks fantastic in that black suit. It really highlights that he is going through a very tough time and that he isn't the cheerful mad scientist anymore. The backgrounds look very nice and have a lot of details. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Oh boy, oh boy the moment I heard Kanako Itou was doing the opening again I knew it was gonna be fantastic and she didn't disappoint. (besting Hacking To The Gate is impossible but she did a really good job) Some tracks from the original show also made a return and of course they added some twists and turns left and right. Adding sad/depressing songs was a must for this show, but they delivered with that as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is where steins;gate truly shines. All of the characters are so lovable it isn't even funny. They feel so real and you truly care about them. Seeing these awful things happen to these characters makes me sad. We are also more attached to them because we have known them for so long. They are also very interesting and are not flat characters without any spine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: What is there not to enjoy? We are talking about steins;gate, each episode up until now has delivered and i am eager to see where this adaptation will lead us.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 10 (9.7)",

            "content": "Steins Gate 0 is a story about Okabe losing Kurisutina and falling into depression because now his harem is incomplete. Not awesome. With the power of epic deus ex machina writing stuff, person close to Kurisutina puls a random personality capturing device out of her butt and a trip towards harem restoration begins. Awesome.\r\nThe writing is a mess. A total clash of random ideas. The amount of different plot elements from asspullery science-save-us-all devices to reading steiner super powers inserted inside slice of life harem settings about.... depression, is absurd. It mainly reminds me of the chaos that Code Geass R2 was. Inb4 who wasriding the time machine? Predicting it. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the build-up, last time White Fox did an impressive job by fooling people into thinking that the show isn't good. Steins Gate generating mean score close to 7.00 during its first episodes. With Steins Gate 0, they did the opposite by fooling people into thinking that this series is good. Advanced trolling. gg I guess.\\n\\n\r\nSurely an anime with generic and weak story can be still good if a) the characters are amazing b) the overall execution as a whole is truly unique and impressive. \\n\\n\r\nOkabe became depressed so he would look the exact same as during Mayushii rescue arc. Tutturuus are starting to feel old. Suzuha is still a whine with fabulous hair. Nyan nyan terrible excuse for a fanservice animal girl. I am still not sure if Rukako has a dick or not, but hey token traps for men of culture, amirite? Maho is just a midget with long hair. At least she doesn't have to claim she is ACHUAYLLY 700 years-old vampire in 7 yo girls body. My morals thank thee. Kurisutina is there only to insert one of each archetype into the harem mix. Daru still speaks like he is mentally handicapped... Some people call this series a masterpiece for its characters, by the way... They are just really dull and boring. Even the girls in 'White Album' had more characteristics. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the overall execution, basically this is just a parody series which doens't recognize itself as one. Even 'Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu' was more self-aware. Okabe's traumas are handled super poorly and in a manner much worse than in 'Mahou Shoujo Site' which is another \"dark\" series from current season. Whenever Moeka appears and the 3 seconds long dramatic tension BGM starts playing while Okabe looks like he will get a panic attack, I bury myself in double facepalm. And whenever our characters speak of building a new machine it mainly reminds me of 'Galilei Donna' where 6 years-old kid \"build\" a huge, advanced airship in a day. Steins Gate is exactly as convincing for that matter. I have yet to meet a person who gets fooled by the thriller side of this show. Super cheap shit-is-getting-real running scenes which end with comedic reliefs... It's almost nauseating. And when they threw that amnesia/memory loss cliche I had no choice but to pause the stream for 5 minutes and think if the writing can even go more ridiculous than this. It's not really even funny, just sad. \\n\\n\r\nThe songs are inferior to the 2011 anime. I must have listened Hacking the Gate for something like 2036 years. This time there is no note-worthy songs outside the OP and ED. Especially the supposedly emotional piano songs used in supposedly emotional scenes are just awful. Practically all the rest is elevator music... if there even is any. There almost never is any music playing or if it plays, it plays super quiet and doesn't typically even sound like music. Mainly remind me of the PS3 menu sounds. The voice acting is identical. Of course there are some awkward engrish and wapanese scenes this time which could as well not be there. The art is the same, nothing to complain about that one. At least one thing which I don't have to get annoyed by...\\n\\n\r\nBased to the first 6 episodes, this has the potential to be the worst anime I have seen since 'Guilty Crown' back in 2011-2012. There is almost nothing the series has done correctly (so far).\\n",

            "content": "\"the flow of time is an illusion, that the past, present and future are equally real, and that time is tenseless\"\r\nHello readers\r\nthere i go presenting the review of probably the best science fiction series world of anime has to offer . They say you can't improve on perfection, yet Steins;Gate 0 does just that. Taking what made the original story so great by awesome characters and a much darker theme makes Steins;Gate 0 the perfect continuation to a story.\r\n\"no one know what the future holds, thats why its potential is infinite\"\r\nstory(probably 10/10)\r\nI love how Steins;Gate 0 embraces the Beta timeline.\r\nAs i mention steins gate 0involves a much darker theme and more thrilling impact than its previous season.As we seen in previous season, the series left off at the end of its 23rd episode, except in this version of events our hero Okabe didn't go through with the heroics that brought Steins;Gate prime to its happy ending. Instead, Okabe has gone full on tortured fallen hero, even going so far as to don a jet black ensemble to reflect the depths of his anguish. he is emotionally exhausted, burnt out on play-acting, and haunted by trauma that flares up whenever he's reminded of that one cruel summer. This episode's idle conversations between very familiar friends did a great job of asserting how badly Okabe had suffered, making his resistance to Suzuha asking for further help feel entirely natural.\\n\r\nIn short with giving much spoiler's ahead i feel story seems much more darker and thrilling than previous season. Its still lacks some originality also i feel it skipping some of its detail's but it has great potential, some starting episodes are bit drafty and will surely able to give chills through its darker theme's.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and art(9/10) \\n\r\nWhite fox absolutely fantastic job here.The episode does a great job of tweaking the series into something much more unsettling than Steins'Gate's early episodes; dramatic closeups and moody camera work ensure that the audience is never unaware of the deep psychological stress that haunts Okabe at all times.\\n\r\nOn other hand it also feel's somewhat limited by its color palette and a little lethargic in its pacing.Its similar to Re:Zero, appears to be applying some of the same elements and themes from Subaru\u2019s hellish existence when bringing Okabe\u2019s visions to life.though its still great and you will get what you expect.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"My one constant, the one truth that never failed me was you\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10/10)\\n\r\nIts not unknown that this series got some awesome character complexity that is mostly one of the major requirement of sci-fi thriller story.However i feel everything you learnt about characters like Mayuri, Daru and Moeka Kiryu in Steins;Gate may now no longer be true. You will still find their characteristics the same \u2013 Mayuri is still a cute, ditsy young girl, Daru still the pervert and Moeka the shy reporter who hides behind her mobile phone.\\n\r\nOkabe however seems depressed and hopeless and seems like a shell of his former self, its make audience more curious about Okabe's future.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10)\\n\r\nSteins gate 0 is absolutely amazing in every way. I really loved original SG and was waiting for really long time for this. It is definitely at least as good as the first.Its unpredictable,more darker, and always have potential to surprise viewer's with unexpected ending's. Its really fun series for Sci-fi Thriller lovers as well as in short its more like anime verson of christopher nolan's movie's got similar addiction, excitment,unpredectiblity and thrills.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nHands down to one of the most amazing sci-fi series ever produced I believe Steins gate zero has absolute potential as going down as a contender of best series of this year. If you are the fan of 1st season like me you surely find yourself in heaven while watching this series.\\n\r\nIts surely on par with its predecessor's high standards. It remains to be seen if the show will be able to make a compelling story out of a scenario that fans already know a happier outcome for, but the quality of this premiere has assuaged my fears. Even if poor Okabe has to suffer for it, it's good to have Steins;Gate back.\\n\\n\r\n\"EL PSI CONGROO\"\\n\\n\r\nStory(10/10)\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nSound(9/10)\\n\r\nCharacter(10/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10)\\n\r\nHype(11/10)\\n\r\noverall-Highly recommended\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cTheories are nothing more than words, accept what you\u2019ve seen.\u201d \u2014 Okabe (Steins;Gate)\r\nReflecting on one\u2019s past experiences can elicit a host of undesirable thoughts/anxieties that permeate to the surface, causing emotional stress and a feeling of helplessness.  The upshot being: the simple act of thinking about said events will not alter the final outcome, making the exercise an unquestionably fruitless one.  But in the case of Okabe (where time-travel and reading \u201csteiner\u201d are quite accessible), the ability to improve upon the past is well within the realm of possibilities, allowing for the veritable \u201chappy ending\u201d to occur.  This inevitability zaps away aconsiderable amount of the intrigue for the viewer, especially when a ham-fisted love story is thrown into the fold, making the events to come, seem exceptionally contrived.  If anything was surprising about the original Steins;Gate, it was the sweeping praise it received by the anime community.  But I suppose an epic theme song combined with a bunch of sexy \u201cLAYDEE\u2019s\u201d (channeling my inner Bill Burr) and \u201cthe most realistic time-traveling series I have ever seen\u201d \u2014 said everyone on MAL; literally, everyone \u2014 will make an anime series quite popular these days, so why not turn back the clock and relive that success one more time.\\n\\n\r\nBut before the anime staff can immerse itself into the meat of the story, we desperately need a sexy Christmas party with a few new characters\u2026\u2026And, and, we need Okabe to communicate with a virtual Kurisu, because virtual girlfriends are a rising trend in Japan, so appealing to that growing sector will certainly increase viewership.  Also, let\u2019s throw in a handful of Ruka being a dude who looks like a girl jokes, because redundancy in comedy always kills.\\n\\n\r\nBut redundancy is only half of the story, because for all the \u201cmisdirection\u201d and \u201cflabbergast-ery\u201d the show is ceaselessly dull, imparting a loud and clear message to the viewer: Steins;Gate 0 has no identity.  Is it a harem?  How about an amnesia story?  Are we still doing that time-traveling thing?  Is Amadeus a social commentary on the proliferation of blue balled young men?  Is it a modern day reinterpretation of the rivalry between Mozart and Salieri?  Is it a slice-of-life retelling of Back to the Future, with Daru starring in the role of George McFly?  How about a Japanese, female-driven John Wick story with Suzuha as the main lead?\\n\\n\r\nNo!  To all of the above.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime staff had one goal in mind, and one goal only: to flaunt Okabe\u2019s chic new black suit.  And I must admit, as a fellow man, it looks stunning!\\n\\n\r\nBut enough tickling your tits for one afternoon, because the criticism about the show\u2019s identity is an entirely valid one.  The deviation from the themes that made the original Steins;Gate mildly interesting, abated the enjoyment of the viewer, giving the show a banal texture that did not bestow anything of actual substance.  Okabe was reduced to an impassive, aggrieved individual who became disturbed at the end of several episodes to feign genuine interest.  Kurisu was relegated to an inactive participant due to her amnesic circumstances, and was used as a means to trigger significant events in the series.  Suzuha preached about the imminence of World War III like she\u2019s one of those homeless domesday clairvoyants.  Maho was the Salieri to Kurisu\u2019s Mozart, in the sense that she was an untalented tsundere, despite her best attempts.  And, well, everyone else was\u2026.um, present?  They certainly were there, but they felt more like cogs in a machine, with little to no freedom to act on their own accord.  \\n\\n\r\nHaving a deficient cast of character\u2019s is one issue, but having a story that felt like it was blended together by multiple writers with no communication with one another, is just inexcusable.  The show felt reminiscent of Mirai Nikki, where \u201cshocking\u201d events would occur, but the cohesion of said events never felt homogeneous.  Also, there were a considerable amount of \u201cfluff\u201d episodes, where nothing of actual importance took place.  The lull between critical events became excruciating at times, and even when a pivotal moment would happen, it felt over-the-top, cliched, and generally out of place.  Furthermore, the staff\u2019s eagerness to exhibit their female characters in erotic situations ad nauseam, highlights how the show was never meant to be taken as a serious intellectual endeavor; but rather, a fun project to elicit some laughter, and intermittent moments of heart-pounding drama.  Sadly, though, it wasn\u2019t particularly entertaining, and it failed to engage the viewer time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nThe final few episodes ratcheted up the intensity to the point of becoming Hollywood-level ridiculous.  There was a protracted exposition by the evil scientist, where he explained his \u201cmaster plan\u201d to the last detail (yet another old scientist who ends up being the bad guy).  Unbelievable action sequences, not in the sense they were breathtaking, but just plain unrealistic.  And the return of the \u201csleeping\u201d protagonist to his status of Hououin Kyouma, because the fans need to be hyped up for that \u201cepic\u201d finale.  Speaking of \u201chype,\u201d that is the optimal word for describing this series, as it built itself up on sheer optimism and excitement from the anime community; yet, for all of its grand ambitions, it was nothing more than a used car salesman convincing you that it was better than it really was.\\n\\n\r\nBut as Okabe said, \u201caccept what you\u2019ve seen,\u201d and if it wan\u2019t overtly obvious, we have seen a bad show.",

Just please don't prosecute me this is my 3 review (2 becauseone of them is a joke). Also a final warning to you all this is gonna have some spoilers (including you anime watchers)! As of 16-05-18 (DD-MM-YY) Though, I will try to keep it down\\n\\n\\n\r\nFirst the setting\\n\r\nThis setting is from the continuing of ep 23b. \\n\r\nMore specific this is a world line where he doesn't get a video by old Okabe to try again.\\n\r\nso,\\n\r\nOkaba tries to save Kurisu, she dies\\n\r\nhe comes back with the time machine\\n\r\ndoesn't have a video message and because of that succumbs to despair\\n\r\ndoesn't want anything that involves Hyouin Kyouma and his past\\n\r\ntries to get over Kurisus dead by going to a psychiatrist\\n\r\nThere you go this is where we are now in the series.\\n\r\nOkabe is in complete utter despair. I will say the VN pointed this out much more, but well that is what happens to the anime when it's trying to compress a VN that doesn't just need to go with the true ending.\\n\r\nThis is because you need to clear a route that sends a D-mail to the past, to even get the true ending. Not only that, but the other routes also give so much perspective to the story. You can see what they have changed with the anime in ep 4. We are in a scene that is WW3, but suddenly everything is changed. This just seems strange, and some don't like it (\ud83d\udc40). I think this is on purpose really. EDIT (13-09-18): I believe this change from the scene of WW3 will be adapted to the OVA, can't say why wholeheartedly but probably because it has too heavy indication to who the \"villain\" is. They could also do it after this episode (21), but don't think it's good timing for that.\\n\\n\r\nWell here we go\\n\\n\r\nStory - N/A\\n\r\nI know what the story is from the VN, and I would give it a 10 alright. I just won't really give it a definite number.\\n\r\nIt really seems cliched, but god damn that is a wrong assumption (\ud83d\udc40) It's really the small indistinguishable things that has an aspect to it and really the future will use these cliche looking things and change it and give it a new perspective. I would also say around ep 16 there will be a real emotional scene alright (I predict this out of my knowledge from the VN( EDIT (23-05-18): nvm then ep 8 it is. they really jump the story on us)) that really will punch you in the gut and after ep 20 our heart will race. It could also be fun if they did little fillers, but really that is a slippery slope I don't want to take. EDIT (13-09-18): Hey, atleast i got my prediction right with our heart racing after ep 20, many thing changed from the VN, but nothing is \"worse\" per say. More up to how you enjoy it, but seems lige i am gonna binge this thing after it ends and rewrite the whole thing\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nHey, what am I gonna say, it's just as normal. Just great.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nAgain, it's great. Nothing much to say there. Normal S;G stuff\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nEveryone is exactly the same, except that Okabe is depressed, Suzuha is pissed off at Okabe and doesn't know much about Hououin Kyouma, Mr Braun is colder, Daru is Daru. Pretty much the main cast is the same. Well except that Kurisu is dead (for now), and is an AI (for now) \ud83d\ude22\\n\r\nThen there is new additions.\\n\r\nMaho, \"Oiii soko no lolico\ufeff\". She is Kurisus Salieri, pretty much tells you everything you need to know about her\\n\r\nKagari, a girl that has lost her memories, well at least for now \ud83d\udc40\\n\r\nLeskinen \"Holy cow! So I said we should come soon\", just a REALLY lovely guy that likes shaman girls, no /s \ud83d\udc40 Is also a meme\\n\r\nReyes, well.

            "content": "Many who watched this series have missed the point of it, it isn't like the original, no it wasn't supposed to surpass it like many suspected here. It is here to complete it, you may have not noticed but the original had many things that we had yet to see. This isn't a what if story either, this is the story of Okabe who failed to find Steins Gate, the same one who fell under depression because of it.\r\nI'll start with story, the STORY WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS:\r\nStory obviously is a 10 for me. At some point during the Steins;Gate 0 I truly doubted if thiswas gonna live up to it's hype or fail like many sequels. Many hate it because they expected the mad scientist earlier, many were expecting too many time traveling and got sad. When the first episode of anime aired, it had a score of 9.16 I think, it was truly the best episode I had yet seen, it captured the mood perfectly, it shows us that Okabe of this world line is very depressed, but more importantly the scene where he sees many bodies of Kurisu shows us his fear. His fear that he will always fail no matter what, the fear that no matter what Okabe does, it will always result in him sacrificing somebody to save somebody else. We can see this during the rest of the show, till the point where he is forced to change the future yet again. At some point I thought too, where is this story going? How will it link to the OG Steins Gate, I really doubted the middle parts of the story honestly. One of the main important points of the story is how Kurisu is the one who even though dead starts a world war. It is always her curiosity that results in something bad to Okabe, in Alpha world line we had Sern which in a way it is both Okabe's fault and hers, in Beta we have WW3 which starts because of Kurisu's thesis. We see this through the Amadeus, we see a lot through Amadeus, why Okabe calls Kurisu Christina, how even dead Kurisu can change the world. \\n\r\nI'm going to skip all this to the episode 16, where we get to see an actual character development in Mayushi, I really never saw her point in O.G steins gate but honestly in Steins;Gate 0 she became one of my favorites. The reason is simple, she always loved Okabe, she always thought of him as the one who can change the future, the one who can bring peace, she always regretted not having Okabe go back to save Kurisu, it really made me break down. After trying to go to time machine and being blown into pieces, Okabe goes back to time leap but ends up in PR, in year 2036. Okabe now has his eyes wide open, he sees what will happen to this world line if he doesn't find steins gate. I forgot to mention that he was in coma and he suffered a lot when waking up, and when he started time travelling again so he can go back to year 2011, it must have fking hurt waking up in that pain. The fact that he spent around 8 years (I'm assuming that is the time it took him, could be way more or less) to go back in time and save everyone must have been painful, he had to explain everything again and again and again. A strong character in my opinion, I would go insane (you all would). BUT THAT WAKES UP THE MAD SCIENTIST! You should watch the rest honestly (too lazy to explain).\\n\\n\r\nArt 8: This is the part which sucks, at times it is very good and at times it sucks. That is all about it honestly, the background though is even better than the original in my opinion, which I really loved.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10: Many of the songs that played were awesome!!!! They set the mood perfectly, the first OP and ED are in my playlist now. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10 : Now this is the point that I wanted to get at. Many say that Okabe is a one dimensional character, honestly fk you all who said it. You just don't know why he is going through all that. To others it was like Okabe just went emo one day, nobody knows why, he can't tell anybody because who knows if Sern might listen. That is honestly very depressing in my opinion, we see during the 23B he looks very sad but at same time tries to look happy in front of Mayushi, that is a very strong character in my opinion. As the show progressed, we saw him slowly bounce back to his old self, the interactions between [Kurisu] and him were awesome, we saw other sides of him that we never saw in OG. And at end the mad scientist was still the same, the idiot who cracks up good jokes and has well out of this world delusions. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10 : Honestly as long as you liked the original, you're fine.\\n\\n\r\nTl;DR: Hello, it's me. They didn't bother with the paragraph and went straight to the tl;dr. Shame there was nothing on it.\\n\\n\r\nEl psy kongroo!",

            "content": "There comes a time when fans of a franchise should ask themselves if an established franchise deserves a sequel or not. Let\u2019s face it. Steins;Gate made an impact back in 2011 when it became one of the critically acclaimed adaptations that year. Visuals novels aren\u2019t easy to adapt and in fact, most recent series really proved themselves to be a catastrophe in that territory. Steins;Gate is one of those properties that didn\u2019t really need a sequel although fans have been asking for years. And it\u2019s a bit painful for me to say\u2026.but Steins;Gate 0 didn\u2019t truly live up to the name it made for itself.\r\nAsa true sequel to Steins;Gate, this series is the canonical anime that once again shows us the world of time travel, hypothetical theories, and scientific creativity. It\u2019s essentially a sci-fi adventure that brings back our lovable character cast while also introducing some new ones who really makes their own impact in the story. Rintarou Okabe returns in the Alpha World line without Makise Kurisu after events of the first season. What we see from Okabe\u2019s point of view is how he deals with living in a world without her. It\u2019s a constant everyday struggle as the man is filled with despair. However, an AI (known as the Amaedus) once again reminds Okabe of the memories he tried to bury.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the season takes place in Japan and in the Alpha World line. Fans who have seen the first season will quickly realize that Kurisu is gone but Mayuri remains along with the rest of her friends. Okabe also meets Maho Hiyajou, a researcher from Viktor Chondria University. As an assistant, she works under Professor Leskinen and is the one who introduces Okabe to the Amaedus. What is the Amaedus? It\u2019s designed and developed by Makise Kurisu herself alongside Leskinen and Maho. The program is built based on her likeness that is able to make use of human memory and converts it into digital data. As such, the AI greatly resembles Kurisu not just in her behavior but also personality and mannerism. Obviously, this reminds Okabe of the real Kurisu who no longer exists in his timeline. Steins;Gate 0 features Okabe dealing with his own personal demons, guilt, and trying to overcome his past in order to save the future. The first season capitalized on its sci-fi elements such as time travel and conspiracies. Unfortunately for this sequel, it felt like the show took a step backwards and really didn\u2019t manage take a step forward.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the show took on the approach that I felt familiar with and really embraced in. There\u2019s a bit of dark drama and comedy that takes a realistic approach at human behavior. It\u2019s what I thought the original season did so well when it managed to make every character distinctive from each other. For Steins;Gate 0, there\u2019s not much change for any of the main cast at all. Okabe\u2019s constant self-loathing gets tiresome after watching it so many times. Ok, he feels guilty about what he had to do to save someone but the season overemphasizes on this direction. To me, it felt like the show constantly needs to remind us why Okabe is like this and it\u2019s repetitive storytelling. In the meantime, we do get some fresh faces such as Maho and Leskinen. Both characters are intelligent although contrast greatly with each other\u2019s personalities. Maho seems similar to Makise Kurisu with her tsundere personality and there\u2019s often a recurring joke about others mistaking her as a child. She develops an important relationship with Okabe although I didn\u2019t feel the impact of it as much as I had hoped for; at least compared to Kurisu anyway. On the other hand, Leskinen introduces himself as a lighthearted guy who often jokes with others while demonstrating a degree of intellect. The show also does a fair job at disguising his true intentions but we don\u2019t find out about it until fairly later on. His relationship with Okabe and others often contrasts the mood of the show especially in early episodes. In later episodes, the series gets darker and darker as startling revelations are discovered that once again deals with time travel. It\u2019s a core idea of the franchise after all.\\n\\n\r\nNow I have not played the visual novel for this sequel so this was more of fresh experience to me. The season feels rather moody even with characters like Mayuri and Faris with their roles. Others such as Suzuha also become much more important as they take their own initiative to protect what\u2019s at stake. Still, coming in this as an anime only viewer, I felt the story is a thriller at best and dry storyteller at worst. To me, this franchise really explored everything it needed to and didn\u2019t even need a new season to prove that. The dialogues and character interactions are interesting to listen to but doesn\u2019t truly make this season worthwhile in the end. As a huge fan of the franchise, Steins;Gate 0 feels like it took way too much of its previous ideas and didn't make an upgrade.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Fox is still in charge of this project and they bought out their talent once again.Thankfully, they earned my trust as the studio proved itself capable of recreating character emotions. That\u2019s important as every character needed to express themselves as credible as they can be. This especially applies to Okabe as we see him drown in despair. Character interactions are captured wisely by the studio\u2019s directive synergy to make them memorable. The design of the characters didn\u2019t evolve much although it\u2019s clear that Okabe has abandoned his lab coat for a more casual wear with his dark shirt to reflect his change in character. Others such as Maho may evoke some lighthearted laughter when certain characters makes jokes about her short height and appearance. The Amaedus is designed in the likeliness of Makise Kurisu so in terms of physical appearance, they look identical.\\n\\n\r\nAs a series with sci-fi themes, it\u2019s only fitting that Steins;Gate 0 gets decorated with some colorful soundtrack. Indeed, the sequel combines thrilling theatrics with some emotional OST and melancholy. The OP song \u201cFatima\u201d by Itou Kanako highlights a bit of character journey for the cast and how they feel in this season. There are several different ED themes too that makes clever usage of its sci-fi elements. On most parts, I think character voices also did a stellar job. Okabe\u2019s personal values are often expressed by his dialogues that are important for his evolving personality. Others such as Maho, Mayuri, and Suzuha made me appreciate their character roles more when they really say what\u2019s on their mind.\\n\\n\r\nAt 23 episodes, Steins;Gate 0 became a 2-cour show that could of done a better job at making itself more distinctive. Instead, it tried to rely far too much on its previous established concepts while forging a story that seems too similar to the previous. However, I will say that this sequel will be a treat for diehard fans of the franchise. The episodes in the first half bought back the mood of the original show like yesterday. Even in some of the later episodes, it still has a bit of taste of sci-fi thrilling style of storytelling. The new characters may also be worthwhile for your time if you accept them for who they are.  So give it a shot if you want. It may not be perfect but it\u2019s still freaking Steins;Gate.",

            "content": "\"That day, if my Hikoboshi came back to life, it might have changed everything.\"\r\nRe-review of Steins;Gate 0 after watching the entire series in chronological order (Steins;Gate episodes 1-22, 23b, 0 episodes 1-23, Steins;Gate episodes 23-25).\r\nThis review is coming from a die-hard fan of the original series that has watched the original anime and 100% completed 0's Visual Novel as well.  I originally gave the series an 8/10, but after rewatching it I'm bumping it up to a 9/10 due to the fact that I was able to better absorb the story and the series has one of the strongest finishes in all of anime.\r\nStory:\r\nIcan draw some interesting parallels between the anime adaptation of Steins;Gate 0 and the original Fullmetal Alchemist adaptation.  Two stories that adapt from an original source material, but have a vastly different second half from the original for different reasons.  In Steins;Gate 0's case, it is because the Visual Novel of 0 is non-linear.  In order for you to get the true end, you have to progress the story through two conflicting routes in a certain order.  The story vastly changes depending on which route you take.  White Fox had to somehow tell a linear cohesive story through that source material, and in some ways, it works really well, and in others, it falls on its face.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the good.  The story is much deeper than the original.  You really get to see the both the best and worst of humanity through this story, and adds so much character development to the main cast.  The anime adaptation managed to adapt all of the endings of 0 into the main story (with the exception of the bad end) and it adds a lot of weight to the story in some aspects.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it's not all good.  Steins;Gate was a very slow burn of a story that didn't really pick up until episode 9, and the plot didn't really fire on all cylinders until episode 12.  But once it got there, oh man, I was hooked.  Steins;Gate 0 has some much worse pacing problems.  The first eight episodes are great, the story kicks into high gear on episode 6, but then peaks around 8, and then crashes and burns by the time episode 10 rolls around.  The plot spins its wheels for five episodes, and then things start picking back up again.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the story hits the gecko ending (Mayuri's route in the VN was vastly different) the story doubles down and the stakes are raised even further.  I can say this is probably the only time ever where knowing the source material will actually curve you even harder than going in blind.   The last third of Steins;Gate 0 is far better than the VN, and is the primary reason why I adjusted my review.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime adaptation also added a significant amount of original content that was not present in the VN.  Episode 8 turned a half hour part of the VN into a full episode, and the feels knob is turned up to 11 as a result, Daru and Yuki's relationship is expanded in a very wholesome OC episode (which pulls double duty for expanding Daru and Yuki's characters, as well as writing out a very very dumb plot twist from the VN), and once Mayuri's route starts going you get a sizeable chunk of the Drama CD Arc-Light of the Point at Infinity, which was equally as impactful as Faris' route in the original in terms of expanding the character of someone who was barely a blip on the radar and turned them into one of the best of the show.  Thank you White Fox for reinforcing why I love Mayushii so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe Teal Deer for the story is that the VN is paced much better, but the overall changes that the anime makes to the story is much more impactful, suspenseful, and has a much more satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, this is a hell of a can of worms.  Steins;Gate had some of the best animation and art in all of anime.  It defies the moeblob art style that the rest of the industry has taken to heart and favors a more realistic approach, focusing more on the character's bodies than their eyes.  I'd say that the art style is the midway point between Log Horizon and Death Note.  Regardless of whether or not you like the art style, you can't argue that it is part of the reason why Steins;Gate stands out in the sea of anime adaptations.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 doubles down on what was good and bad about the original.  There are scenes in 0 that look more visually stunning than in Your Name.  But oh my the action scenes look just ghastly.  Not to mention the various anatomical and linguistic errors (Sarieri, Roading, etc.)  Now, these I'll give a pass because those will be ironed out in the Blu-Ray release, but I have no idea how they're going to fix the tire fire that is the action scenes in episodes 18 and 19.  The answer is probably that they won't, and trust me, it's hard to look at.\\n\\n\r\nTeal Deer, 0 retains the distinct art style of the original and works great in stills and certain scenes, but it's execution in high action scenes are laughably bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate always had an amazing soundtrack, but 0's eclipses it by a long shot, and that's really saying something.  The new tracks and the remixes of the old ones add so much more weight to the scenes.   There were times where I was barely holding on in an emotional scene, Amadeus started playing, and then the dam broke and out came the waterworks.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime exclusive tracks are equally as impressive.  I can't speak on those too much as the OST is just coming out, whereas I've blasted all of the VN's tracks on repeat multiple times, but the soft ambience of them in the background of certain scenes adds so much to the it.  Re-Awake is one of the best tracks in all of anime.\\n\\n\r\nTeal Deer, it's fitting that Mozart and Salieri are brought up in Steins;Gate 0, because the orchestra is a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of overall character growth, it can be summarized thusly;  is the character a main character?  Yes?  They are absolutely phenomenal.  Supporting?  They're going to range from forgettable to cringeworthy.  Everyone brings up Kagari, but I actually like the way that Kagari was handled in the anime (it's a hell of an improvement of the dumpster fire that she was in the VN, with the exception of Promised Rinascimento and Recursive Mother Goose.)  But Ruka and Faris take so much of a backseat that it hurts.  Ruka is salvaged in the end, but Faris was my favorite character in the original after a certain point, and to see her go from such a compelling character to yuri bait just made me want to send a D-Mail to prevent the writer of 0's story from being born.  Fubuki and Kaede weren't huge part in the VN, but they did SOMETHING.  They're completely forgettable in the anime, and they pretty much are forgotten about too.\\n\\n\r\nBut as for the main cast, all of them got significant character growth.  Seeing the rise, fall, and rise again of Okabe Rintaro was amazing, and the interactions with him and Suzuha and seeing them both taken to their lowest points was so heavy and their interactions were fantastic.  I'm torn between Daru and Mayuri as the MVPs of the series because the story of their paternal and maternal relationships with their children was great character growth and all around heartwarming.  And then we've got the two newcomers from America, Hiyajo \"Legal Loli FTW\" Maho, and Alexis \"Where are the Shaman Girls, Lintahlo?\" Leskinen.  There is an all around interesting dynamic between them, and great comedy and insane plot twists regarding the two characters.\\n\\n\r\nTeal Deer, while the supporting cast does not live up to the precedent set by the original, the main characters got just as much, if not more growth in 0.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment, aka the only score that matters:\\n\\n\r\nI am really torn on Steins;Gate 0.  It never was going to live up to the standard that the original made, simply because Steins;Gate is not only one of the best anime and visual novels, but sci-fi story and fiction in general.  So I simultaneously feel that I am nitpicking 0 and giving it way too many free passes at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nThe skinny is that 0 is amazing.  Very few anime of recent years had me anxiously looking at my clock to wait for the next episode.  Even at the low points of the story, 0 always had my engagement.  I haven't cried this much from an anime this year since I finished A Place Further Than the Universe.  \\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 is a paradox.  It is a (inter)sequel to a story that had a definitive and conclusive ending, but it somehow adds to the story in a way that doesn't retread old ground or completely screw up continuity and adds so much to it.  One of the worst things about the original's story was the ending, but 0 turned what was a Deus Ex Machina asspull to keep the OTP alive, and turned it into a long and arduous journey of suffering that made the happy ending of the original truly earned.\\n\\n\r\nTeal Deer, if you even remotely enjoyed the original Steins;Gate, rewatch the series chronologically, that is OG 1-22, 23b, 0 1-23, OG 23-25.  You will not regret it.\\n\\n\r\nEL.  PSY.  KONGROO.",

            "content": "Well, what a train-wreck. 18 episodes in and everything is dull, predictable and badly animated.\r\nThis episode contains big reveals which anyone saw coming from at least 5 episodes before, and some from episode 1 itself. The plot is absolutely predictable, the characters cannot connect 2 dots even if they were drawn in a piece of paper, and there is absolutely no tension.\r\nThe villains are obvious, their actions are obvious, how they get to know what they know is obvious, what they did was obvious. Characters die but come back to life just long enough to be convenient for the plot. How can they expect tocall this a thriller when there is nothing thrilling at all? Solid 3.\\n\\n\r\nArt is passable but the animation, especially during action scenes, is horrendous, to the point of breaking suspension of disbelief. People can dodge bullets shot from 10 soldiers surrounding them, missiles fly sideways, explosions break pass through items, etc. About a 4.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound effects are passable, but there are no memorable songs like in the first season. Honestly I give it a 4 because nothing is terribly bad either.\\n\\n\r\nOh... characters... where to even start... Feiris, Rukako and most of them show absolutely no character growth or even influence in the stort. Maho has a cute design  but aside from that she's just a scientist with an inferiority complex, still shallow. Okabe is stuck in a depression that seems to flare up only when the plot needs it the most, with no tangible consequences after that. Suzuha and Daru get a lot of screen time, with cute father-daughter moments. Suzuha is my favourite character and she keep being my best girl of the series. Some growth and conflict are presented, being the second best character of this season. Daru is the only character I really see as being explored a little more, showing growth. The villains, as I said before, are obvious and chlich\u00e9 in many ways, not even worth a lengthy discussion. All in all, I give it a 4.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is just a mess of shallow characters, weak music, bad animation and appaling, predictable, story. I cannot enjoy this travesty of a thriller.\\n\r\nOverall, 3.",

            "content": "Man, my feelings toward this anime- though mostly positive- are extremely complicated, which isn\u2019t helped by the fact that I played the visual novel first. So get your popcorn, cuz this review\u2019s gonna be a while! Also, there will be spoilers regarding the original Steins;Gate in this review, since you\u2019re supposed to have played/watched it first anyway.\r\nStory- 9/10: So first, I need to establish context for this anime since no official description of it helps in that regard. Remember episode 23 of the original series, when Okarin was about to give up on saving Kurisu? Right then and there, he obtained a video D-Mail fromhimself 15 years in the future who disclosed the instructions to reach the ultimate happy worldline, Steins Gate. Steins;Gate 0 is THAT Okarin\u2019s story- the Okarin who will have sent that video- picking up from a 3-4 month timeskip after the whole incident with him having murdered his loved one. Technically, Steins;Gate 0 is the second half of the full Steins;Gate story that was skipped over in the original, due to Steins;Gate 0\u2019s own plot cancelling itself out (from OG Okarin\u2019s perspective) through the video D-Mail having been sent.\\n\\n\r\nRight away there is the issue of the visual novel\u2019s own structure. The original Steins;Gate was really easy to adapt since it was extremely linear for a traditional VN, and most of the endings were crap. Steins;Gate 0 is more like that type of VN which goes on several diverging and significantly different paths, most of which are integral for the overarching narrative. So, White Fox didn\u2019t JUST have to worry about truncating the walls of text, but ALSO re-ordering the ENTIRE plot structure to work in a linear, cohesive manner.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the most part, they succeeded.\\n\\n\r\nThe events play out extremely well. Heck, they went the extra mile and adapted the various tie-in drama CDs and one of the few instances of genuinely good anime original content as well. They even fixed a good number of issues present in the original. Simulcasting this show was a blast, even as a VN player, because there was still some room for throwing me for a loop. \\n\\n\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t perfect. There were still a COUPLE of scenes that just do not mesh together as one linear arc, no matter how you slice it. It was still probably the best case scenario, so I didn\u2019t mind those incoherent hiccups that much.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing about Steins;Gate 0 in general is that science takes a backseat in this one. By either some dumb miracle, meticulous planning, or plot convenience, there\u2019s nothing new to learn, science-wise in this series. I know the description alludes to some kind of AI program, but that program is made using the same technology that went into the time leap machine from the original series. In fact, it\u2019s even simpler than that contraption was! The real issue is that we never get to learn how they actually got to build a true, physically working time machine, so that one is forever filed under the \u201cspace magic\u201d category.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for how they handled the VN\u2019s notoriously loose and anti-climactic ultimate ending, let me just say\u2026 that they actually freakin\u2019 did it! As in, they did it WELL!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9/10: The characters are where Steins;Gate 0 shines (for the most part). We get to see full closure to Okarin and others\u2019 character arcs, and a couple of newcomers.\\n\\n\r\nOkarin in this series is now a \u201csad scientist\u201d, a dejected Okarin who turns a blind eye to the impending doom of the Beta worldline. We also have a new form of Suzuha, who is much colder due to war, compared to the Alpha worldlines\u2019 Part-Time Warrior. In addition, we see Daru actually taking on a much more serious role than before. The characters are amazing* and it\u2019ll make you realize who the true Best Girl of Steins;Gate is.\\n\\n\r\n*I put this footnote here because the \u201camazing\u201d isn\u2019t ENTIRELY true. First off, we have three of Mayuri\u2019s friends who were only just names in the original, actually appearing. They\u2019re bricks. Even though one of them is Suzuha\u2019s future mom, they don\u2019t really do anything of much importance. Also, due to the nature of the adaptation, a couple of characters who are legitimately likeable in the VN are now either crap, or they end up having no purpose AT ALL. (Poor Judy\u2026)\\n\\n\r\nArt- Budget/10: This is where my issues start to arise with the anime adaptation of Steins;Gate 0. The 2011 anime blew me away with an artstyle that wasn\u2019t quite as detailed as the VN, but still had a Steins;Gate-like film noir style that I loved. There was also a lot of brilliant post-production with the lighting as well as a lot of smooth animation uncharacteristic of most TV anime. Even in 2018, it hasn\u2019t aged a day.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, a follow-up that AIRED in 2018 already shows more age than the original. Look, I\u2019m not blaming the production team. I can tell that they tried. They were likely lacking in funds. It\u2019s jarring how cheap parts of this show look.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s mostly jarring only to VN players. The VN had some jaw-dropping artwork that make most of the anime\u2019s renditions of these scenes look like crap. But again, if you didn\u2019t even SEE that artwork to begin with, it shouldn\u2019t bother you much (at least they executed THAT scene well).\\n\\n\r\nBut even from an anime-only perspective, there are clear hiccups (*cough* episodes 17-18 *cough*). Although the art gets significantly better towards the bitter end, I know that the prospect of having to watch 80% of a crappy anime just to get to the good stuff is not a popular one.\\n\\n\r\nThese hiccups will bother you depending on how much you care about the visual presentation of anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10/10: At least THIS is the same. We all know these seiyuus, and they\u2019re excellent. Their performances (at least, of the ones who were central characters) were absolutely impeccable. It\u2019s kind of sad that this anime is probably going to be their final performances as these characters\u2026 I wonder how they feel about that prospect right now. But if it IS their last time, then they definitely went out in a blaze of glory!\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is- unlike the inconsistency of the first anime- entirely VN soundtracks. That\u2019s good, since the original music is stellar to begin with, and White Fox knew as much.\\n\\n\r\nThe new anisongs composed for this adaptation aren\u2019t bad either. While no \u201cHacking to the Gate\u201d, the new OP \u201cFatima\u201d feels much more urgent due to the usage of a ticking clock throughout the track- a clock that\u2019s ticking down to the inevitable start of World War III (at least I\u2019m assuming that was the intention of it).\\n\\n\r\nZwei\u2019s \u201cLast Game\u201d is gut-wrenching, especially when you see a million Kyoumas shatter into pieces. Kurisu\u2019s seiyuu also performs a techno-rock song called \u201cWorld Line\u201d which is also pretty good. However, these two ED\u2019s should\u2019ve been flip-flopped, given the circumstances of the first and second cours (with the latter being way more emotional). Or, they should\u2019ve kept \u201cLast Game\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10: This anime had so much potential to surpass the source material, and it arguably DOES in those last four episodes. But I\u2019m sorry, the artwork and the lower quality of the first 19 episodes just really jarred me. The two versions of S;G 0 have very different strengths and weaknesses to where I would say that they become equally viable. I didn\u2019t mind that the VN had plot holes without the drama CDs since most (key word: most) of it could be derived from context anyway.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I will insist that you get your Bachelor\u2019s degree in Steins;Gate-ology. There were so many comments and criticisms on the boards when this was airing from people who clearly didn\u2019t get the rudimentary basics of Steins;Gate, and they made me cringe. There are also a lot of subtle call backs that you will need to acknowledge in order to fully enjoy and understand the show.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, this is the second half of the Steins;Gate story, which gives full closure to the characters that the original was not able to provide. Just ask yourself, \u201cHow much do I care about the visual presentation of anime?\u201d If you do care, then maybe you should stray away from the anime version and play the VN instead. And if you ALREADY played it, then watch the anime since it\u2019s still really well executed in its own unique way (although it still looks like crap).",

It shows us, that time and space is a thing that no human should ever touch or change, because if done, it'll have horrific consequences.\r\nIt is also showing us the beautiful,funny and amazing relationship between the protagonist and his friends and his suffering of his lost friend Makise Kurisu, who sacrificed herself for the sake of a 'perfect' world line. \\n\r\nBut Okabe begins to notice, that there's much more wrong with this world line than promised.\\n\r\nSo, he and also some of his friends begin to search for the Steins;Gate, the perfect world line. \\n\r\nThe plot in this anime is amazingly picturfied and ist so intense, every single second until the end of the last episode.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Character\\n\\n\r\nIt is without any doubt my favourite artstyle of all anime out there.

            "content": "READ THIS BEFORE STARTING - Everything here written is my original review of the anime, and I still stand by my points and stance of this series and everything I said doesn't have any lesser meaning and can also be applied to many different contexts throughout the anime. I have a mini evaluation at the end which I have wrote after seeing the series, so if you have already seen my review, then feel free to read that.\r\nAs of right now, I have only seen 6 episodes of steins;gate, and I will most likely update this review either when the series is over, or myopinions in this dramatically change, there WILL BE SPOILERS (For up to episode 6) in this so beware if you are reading and haven't yet watched the anime. Also, bare in mind this is just my opinion (and definitely not a perfect one) while reading, I can understand if other people feel differently and I am just stating my thoughts about this subjectively great anime.\\n\\n\r\nLet me start this off by doing what every other generic reviewer does (because my writing structure is pretty horrific) and begin by rating the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9:\\n\\n\r\nNow, so far we have had a few 'calm' episodes where Okabe basically meets the new cast, which starts off very wholesome and has a pretty positive mood to it. The pacing of the anime in the starting episodes is nice and consistent with interactions of all the characters just so we are able to get to know them and see our major cast for the anime. Amadeus is discovered, Okabe gets mini-flashbacks but nothing too dramatic, which is good because it is easing the viewers into the darker turns I am sure this anime will take. After that, things pick up a bit with the (re)introduction of Moeka which is the first major surprise I would say. It was quite obvious she was going to turn up but the haphazardness of her actually appearing was refreshing because we knew that the story was picking up quicker than previously - which I believe is a good thing as we already know most of the characters. After this Okabe becomes a bit more isolated and is distrusting towards Moeka, which is to be expected. Then the search for Mayuri's daughter begins with what I can only describe as a solid pace, they don't dwindle on this for too long but still make it appear like effort was put in to try and find her and some more interactions between Moeka and Okabe which in turn allows Okabe to be a bit more trusting towards her, probably forgetting his past with her for at least a brief while (something I see as a mistake that I can pick up on). Then we move onto episode 6 where we get to see characters being more interesting and having separate motives by being pretty vague which I enjoy, it makes you think which is what a Psychological anime should make you do, things like Mr Braun on his phone while having his worries for Nae raises a question of whether he is the villain in this situation, and the suspicious professor who eyed up Mayuri's daughter, so now there is lots for a viewer to think about, then at the end of the episode, what can only be remembered as the rounders from steins;gate show up with their guns just after Okabe and Suzaha realise what is going on, then we are left with another cliffhanger, which gives us more to think about as a viewer, and this is great for me and others who love to theorize about what is going on. All in all (so far), this series' story has been systematic and consistent with a nice balance of seemingly happy situations and others where Okabe begins remembering things but desperately tries to block that away and continue with his life - the 'sad' situations.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10:\\n\\n\r\nNow, I don't believe there is much for me to say here. Apart from a few minor issues like the intro having Kurisu with 4 fingers for like 3 frames, which has been fixed as far as I'm aware, and some, lets say interesting facial expressions, it has been very good so far! The animation flows well and the faces are used really appropriately to show how each character is feeling, like when Mayuri is worried, and when Leskinen is simply enjoying himself, or when Suzaha is agitated - it all shows really well, especially if someone like me can pick up on it! The art style is literally the same as steins;gate so there's not much change in my opinions of it being a pleasant art style capable of showing a variety of emotions through body movements and expressions. Well done to White Fox on this one!\\n\\n\r\nSound 10:\\n\\n\r\nI've heard quite a few people say that the sound is nowhere near as good as the original, but I beg to differ. The background music during certain scenes is used really well to create the ideal atmospheric setting, whether it be at the parties that they have or when Okabe is having another flashback, the OST really doesn't fail to deliver on this one with deep, heavy sounds for dramatic moments and cheerful tines for the more lighthearted moments. One thing I did pick up on is the sounds that the character's make, like when it is simply Mayuri going 'Ahhh...' with glee instantly tells me about her current feelings and emotions, and her feelings to other characters on the room with the added facial expressions and where she looks. And also when Okabe howls at the end of episode 3, this gave me goosebumps, not gonna lie. You could really feel all of his emotions through that one bellow and it was a very dramatic one to say the least; well done to the VA there! The other things I have to address would be the intro and outro. Now, the OP is pretty vague but has a very nice beat to it so I don't really have any complaints there, but the ED is where the sound really shines. This ED is really eerie and mysterious which a soothing voice, almost like whispering to a child at the beginning - very ominous. These feelings show very well with the distress of Okabe during the series, and how he never truly knows what's going on, with himself or others around him, he is confused and this ED conveys that near perfectly, it is very nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10:\\n\\n\r\nAs with art, not really too much to say here apart from the rather interesting new ones and certain old ones. Mayuri is her usual happy self, with characters like Nae being the same as well. Suzaha is concerned with Okabe and how he is going about things, and she seems to have lost a bit of trust in him and the definitely aren't on the best of terms so there is a constant theme of awkwardness and agitation when both are on screen. Okabe starts off pretty care-free until meeting Amadeus, and then after he simply acts cautious of him and his surroundings and detaches himself from others out of fear and probably concern; he doesn't want people to experience the pain he is going through and wants to carry the burden himself. This is a very clever way of showing us, the viewers, how Okabe is slowly drifting back to his old stubborn ways and we know nothing good comes of this so already we know that he hasn't really moved on or advanced as a person as a result of this. Now, the new characters which I'll speak about are Amadeus Kurisu, Maho and Leskinen. Amadeus Kurisu obviously resembles steins;gate Kurisu a lot with her being a bit cold at first the quickly growing friendly towards Okabe through the time they speak, she has all her distinguishable features present and is represented well enough for the anime. Maho is Kurisu's university associate and is also fairly cold to Okabe - similar to Kurisu - but then becomes a bit more friendlier. She hasn't had too much in depth development, but she is quite oblivious as to what is going on around her with people like Okabe and Suzaha and the rounders etc. so it'll be interesting to see her develop as a character. Now onto Leskinen. he is definitely one quirky character who has a lot of fun with things like jokes, but seems to keep a lot to himself and never really 'speaks out' like the other characters, so that's already raised a bit of suspicion with me, especially with his involvement with the other mysterious American professor so I'll be keeping my eye on him for now, he seems a bit shady which is good because now I focus a lot on him whenever he is on screen, which gives me more things to think about making my experience a lot more interesting and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10:\\n\\n\r\nSo far, with everything I've said, I have to say I may be enjoying this a little too much. There are a few things I haven't addressed, like Daru's involvement with his wife-to-be and some other things, but if I spoke about everything then I'd be here for quite a while, the topics I have spoken about are the most important to me and my enjoyment of this series, with the addition of interesting characters, very interesting development of old characters, a solid story and a perfectly fitting OST, this is definitely going to be one of my favorite anime's and I just cannot wait for more, especially after that cliffhanger on episode 6, I feel like everything's about to get a lot more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nPS: This is my first ever review, so please be a bit more forgiving if I have made any mistakes! Thank you!\\n\\n\r\nEDIT - OK, I have now finished everything and I must say, I have thoroughly enjoyed this series; regardless of others opinions. That final episode was extremely well put together and was a beautiful way to wrap up this series and leave a smile on my face. There really isn't much for me to say, apart from if you haven't seen it I would highly recommend (after watching the original series), I found this series extremely satisfying and interesting to watch and hope that others have (and will) too. I said at the end of my original review everything was about to get a lot more interesting and let me tell you; it REALLY does. If you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? And if you have, I hope you share the same opinions as me - or at least respect my thoughts!",

            "content": "As someone who played the visual novel, I can say that this is a better version of the game (so far)\r\nI will keep this short. Potential spoiler as of episode 5-6. Do not worry.\r\nThis takes place in the Beta world line where Kurisu is dead and cannot be saved (episode 24 does not exist, theoretically). We get to see Okabe going through depression as he loses the woman he loves to protect his childhood friend who he shares precious memories with.\r\nStory-10\r\nThis is not a random story, it is hinted in the original (and the VN more vividly) about Kurisu's project in the US, we gota more explored version here, and it doesn't need to rely on Okabe building a time machine rather other organizations having access to time machines since it was leaked through Kurisutina's father.\\n\r\nIt is going to be an interesting ride to see how every character grows into something amazing and breaking out of their shells, trust me on this.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nIt kept the same style which makes it Steins;Gate, but there are some inconsistencies which resulted with some cheap animation and still frames but I can deal with it, there are moments with high quality animation, as long as it will be fixed in the blu-ray.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10 \\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 has a stronger and stellar OST compared to the original, it features remixes and unique memorable sounds like the original to make it stand out, at least to me.\\n\r\nIt also fits the theme perfectly well and used correctly for dramatic or sadness emotions etc the director knows what he is doing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9/10\\n\r\nI would say a 9-10 since we didn't see everyone develop yet but the old cast are pretty much the same and Amadeus is basically Kurisu but with less sass at times which is hilarious and nostalgia to the original.\\n\r\nPlus the new characters aren't bad, like Fubuki who is secretly Chie from Persona. You have Judy and Maho and the Finnish Alexis professor who are all fleshed out and we get a general sense.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\r\nObviously since I finished the VN, I know what is going to happen and I am pleased since White Fox managed to fix many many errors and wrong doings from the VN and made the anime much better experience, trust my words, they replaced scenes and shortened it and kept the memorable moments. It turned out perfect with great directing skills so far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10 \\n\r\nSo far, it managed to make me feel pretty depressed and we got to see more Amadeus and she has a personality unlike the VN.\\n\r\nThe anime is doing a much better job and I am pleased.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: I will not be comparing this to the VN whatsoever, just the fact that it is a bit different in how it's layed out. It's to be expected though; trying to cram the enormous VN into a 23 episode anime was going to be impossible. Also I expect you to fully know what happened in the original Steins;Gate\r\n****This is a Spoiler Free Review*****\r\nIt's finally back. The awe inspiring, sometimes dramatic, sometimes light-hearted, sometimes tear inducing rollercoaster of a series is back to take you on an another journey. \r\nWith a continuation of a plot from season 1's \"sad ending\", the depressing conflicts of OkabeRintarou's emotions will once again have you engaged like no other. Can he change the outcome by reaching Steins;Gate? Will he return to the \"mad scientist\" we all know and love? \\n\\n\r\nLike the previous adaptation, the sequel starts off rather slowly, however, we already see the differences, primarily in our main character. Whereas he was an exciting, funny, and overly dramatic character in season 1, he is now former shell of himself.\\n\r\nDepressed and conflicted over how he couldn't change the inevitable, we see that the \"Okarin\" we knew has changed. The change is well done in every aspect, from mannersims to voice acting to even the attire (white lab coat to black attire). To me, this was the focal point of the new adaptation: the inner conflicts of Okarin- whether to attempt to change the outcome once again or live life with the constant guilt of not being able to save Kurisu.\\n\\n\r\nThe story telling is generally well done. For the lovers of the original series- Fear not, for they have all the elements you loved about S;G in the sequel as well. This adaptation will still give you a false sense of hope only to yank it away from you with a twist, so no worries. \\n\r\nAlso, one of the best things about Steins;Gate series is that they know how to incorporate both humour and light hearted moments with the dark and serious. Now, whether you like these mini \"fanservice\" moments or not are up to you. However, they don't really ruin the story. \\n\r\nAs it is known for, the plot twists and the intense drama are all great, although maybe not as good as the original. The action scenes are sometimes pretty nonsensical, but thankfully Steins;Gate is not primarily about action. Like the original however, it gets dark and depressing real quick, with many episodes dedicated to drawing those feels out. As I've said, once it begins, it just keeps going and going.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling, there are couple of plot holes and rushing here and there. It could just be an effect of trying to cram in too much in just a 2 cour, but they could've handled some plot points better for sure, because it can get confusing. \\n\r\nOne thing I did think the White Fox handled well was adding much needed extra material to where the VN didn't. It is a small, but refreshing change.\\n\\n\r\nThe old characters are all lovable like before. Depressed Okarin is amazing and just made us want that comeback even more. Mayuri showed a lot more character and development here than in the original. Her emotions towards the changed Okarin is just simply heart wrenching. What surprised me however was Daru, and how he was a lot more serious and mature-like at some points(particularly from ep.16 and beyond). Suzuha is also as dynamic and serious as before.\\n\\n\r\nThe new characters are good, but not great, maybe a little generic. Maho, the \"legal loli\" as Daru would like to say, is very fun to watch in her interactions with Okarin and others. She is playful, emotional, but still strong willed. She was clearly the best of the new bunch. Amadeus is an AI version of Kurisu's memories before she came to Japan. It retains Kurisu's personalities, from her tsundereness to her playfulness. Dr. Leskinen, one of the developers of Amadeus, is a nice addition from America, with the absolute best pronunciation of \"Rintaloh\". Kagari (no spoilers), can be a little annoying at times, but is still an essential part to the story. Yuki also brought out more variety of emotions from Daru and Suzuha. \\n\r\nHonestly, I can't say too much of some of them without some heavy spoilers. Overall, the new characters aren't outstanding, but most of them do enhance the story and other characters in some way. Some, however, have very little presence unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters, the voice acting is absolutely fantastic. In fact, I thought it was even better than the ones in the game. It was very dynamic, with intense emotions where necessary. Ep.16 will tell you just how good the VA is, but it was constantly amazing throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is ranging from decent to good, not great. The action scenes can get very clunky, and it can get a bit confusing at times. There were direction issues here and there especially with faster scenes. Honestly, it's a good thing that S;G is not primarily an action anime, because if there is one complaint I have with the anime series is that it's action scenes are rather ehh.. Otherwise I thought the rest were fine.\\n\r\nOne thing I do love about the series in general is the dark tone/color it has throughout to accompany the darkness of the story. It just fits so well.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing I have to mention is how good the music is. The opening and two endings are all amazing. Just go listen to the first ending, it to me, is one of the best ending themes ever (no bias). The instrumental osts are all great. Some of them are remixed from the original, while some are new, but they all accompany the scenes very well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, although not as good as the original (it is hard to reach that standard tbf), I thought that Steins;Gate 0 was still excellent. The humour, the raw emotions, the development, and the plot twists makes this a nice sequel. If you are a S;G fan, you will enjoy the sequel as well. \\n\\n\r\nEl Psy Congroo.\\n\\n",

Okabe spends the rest of his time lamenting sadness after losing his lover and time spent with his \"friends\". The gadget is the name of the laboratory that Okabe founded to experiment on tools that could be said to be like the tools of the future. After experiencing Okabe's failure to save his lover he no longer visits the laboratory he founded with his colleagues.\\n\\n\r\nafter he gave up he threw out the name of chunnibyou \"Hoounin Kyouma\" and decided to become an ordinary student after three months of studying / as a student he met with the assistant professor at the place where he studied \"Maho Hiyajo\" a woman aged twenty-one years. the woman Okabe attended the brain intelligence seminar created by \"Alexis Lexinen\" in the seminar appeared Okabe's lover who had died a while ago but his lover was in the form of AI (Artifical Intelligence).\\n\\n\r\nSteins; Gate 0 is a good series, but unlike the previous series in this series it seems not too tense. White Fox is the maker of two series of Steins; Gate, this studio gives a good impression in adapting Novel Visuals and Manga (no need to be surprised because the studio this is a studio that produces Akame ga Kill and Re: Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seiketsu which until now has become the best-selling series).\\n\\n\r\naside from the matter above now an anime series will not be good if it is not supported by voice actors, song themes, and song background (BGM) like a car if there are no supporters like wheels then it will not work well. Thanks to the voice this time of course only this matter did not escape Miyano Mamoru's voice talents as \"Okabe Rintarou\", Hanazawa Kana as \"Shiina Mayuri\", Imai Asami as \"Makise Kurisu\" (although she did not play many roles and was AI), and Seki Tomokazu as \"Hashida Itaru \"once again I thank the series voice this time for struggling in carrying out their duties.\\n\\n\r\nfor the opening theme \"Fatima\" sung by \"Itou Kanako\" he has already contributed in the making of the opening theme song in the previous series. For the music background it's pretty good especially when the \"twenty-two\" episode starts from music that makes the audience get excited and sad\\n\\n\r\nThis series gets three new characters, \"Hiyajo Maho\" as the protagonist, \"Shiina Kagari\" (he is a person from the future who came with Suzuha to stop the third world war) as Tritagonist (Middle Protagonist and Antagonist), and the last is \" Leskinen Alexis \"acts as an Antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has the impression of being funny, sad, tense, and so romantic, it's no wonder the viewers are confused by the nets of the story. Although this series focuses more on the daily life of \"Okabe Rintarou\" who fails to save his lover, compared to the fight itself it may this might have an effect on the value or ranking down in this series even though in this series it is also no less stressful than the previous series.\\n\\n\r\neven though Steins; Gate 0 is an anime science fiction it is not denied even though the time we passed from this moment we cannot return or repeat and change it according to our own desires because it is something that is contrary to the universe.\\n\\n\r\nit is strange if the final winding is regret or happiness",

For me, S;G0 was able to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessor, and it tells a truly compelling narrative.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s amazing how the personality change of one person can affect so many. The mad scientist Hououin Kyouma died alongside Kurisu in the beta world line where this story takes place, leaving behind a nihilistic and broken Okabe Rintarou. Viewers can clearly see just how hard the rest of the cast, especially Mayuri, take Okabe\u2019s character transformation. Gone is the humorous banter and close companionship that the characters shared in the original Steins;Gate. It has been replaced with a dark and uncomfortable atmosphere, and as someone who was warmed by Okabe\u2019s positive relationships with his friends, it\u2019s downright depressing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAn even harder loss to swallow is Makise Kurisu. She\u2019s quite frankly an amazing character. Makise is intelligent, attractive, a bit of a tsundere and an otaku, has a lot of great and funny moments in the original anime, and is just admirably supportive of Okabe, acting as his crutch during his times of despair. It wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to call her an ideal girl. She even sacrifices herself so that Okabe can live in an beta world line in which Mayuri lives. Wow, she might just be a bit too perfect\u2026Although she\u2019s dead in S;G0, there\u2019s an amazing episode where Okabe transitions into an alpha world line where Kurisu is alive, yet Mayuri is deceased. The episode is basically there to remind us just how phenomenal Makise is, and that makes it all the more painful when Okabe returns to the beta world line, leaving Kurisu behind. I\u2019m not gonna lie, I was starting to get a little emotional at the end of the episode. \\n\\n\r\nSo with Makise deceased in this world line and Okabe having suppressed his flamboyant mad scientist nature in favor of a more emo persona, you might think that this anime is a lot weaker than its predecessor in the character department. Well, while I can admit the the original Steins;Gate is superior when it comes to characterization, the cast of S;G0 is still quite amazing in its own right. \\n\\n\r\nOkabe really is one of the greatest anime protagonist out there. One of the things that makes him so good is his ability to be unrealistically ridiculous with his bouts of chuunibyouism while being able to transition to a more solemn and vulnerable state when things get serious. The latter is heavily demonstrated in this anime, as the old, care free Okabe is gone, replaced by a serious man who still strives to help his friends, but struggles with his own doubts and insecurities. This portrays him as being truly human, because let\u2019s be real, I don\u2019t think any of us would be able to keep up a cheery image if we went through all of the pain that Okabe has faced. But do not despair, because Okabe\u2019s depression doesn\u2019t last forever. \\n\\n\r\nBecause just like the majestic phoenix, Hououin Kyouma ascends from the ashes and is born anew.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t spoil anything specific, but near the very end of the anime, Okabe finally regains his drive and determination, and once again becomes the mad scientist that we all know and love. For that entire episode, I had a big, stupid grin on my face. It was so refreshing to see the old Okabe again after so long, and literally every chuuni thing he did made me nearly burst out laughing. But he didn\u2019t go back to his old self on his own. No, his awakening can be truly attributed to the admirable support of his friends. \\n\\n\r\nWith Makise gone, the title of female protagonist goes to her scientist loli upperclassmen friend Maho Hiyajou. Now Makise has some pretty big shoes to fill, and being a loli, Maho\u2019s feet might be too small to fit- oh wait, this is an idiom\u2026whoops\u2026Well anyway, Maho ended up being a great addition to the cast. She might seem a bit one dimensional on the surface with her main defining feature being her desire to surpass Kurisu, but I can assure you that there is so much more to her character. Despite her small stature, Maho has a big part to play in the anime. She gives several inspirational speeches that help to push Okabe forward, constructs the time leap machine in Kurisu\u2019s absence, shows vulnerabilities despite her general awesomeness, and has many funny and entertaining moments in the show. Does she reach Kurisu\u2019s level? I don\u2019t think so, but she\u2019s a great character nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nI actually liked Daru a good deal more this time around. Perhaps it was because Okabe became somewhat of a vegetable for awhile, which allowed for Daru\u2019s personality to shine through. He actually has a nice lighthearted arc with his future wife and daughter Suzuha that develops his character. He provides some pretty good comic relief on occasion, and, along with Maho, is easily the most useful lab member to Okabe.  \\n\\n\r\nMayuri\u2019s role is important because through her, viewers can clearly see just how much the cast is negatively affected by Okabe\u2019s give up attitude. Gone are the kawaii tuturus~ and upbeat personality. They\u2019ve been replaced with a sad girl who just wants her prince Okabe to be happy. She feels herself slowly distancing from Okabe throughout the show, and even decides to time travel herself so that she can motivate Okabe to not give up on trying to save Kurisu. I found this to be quite admirable, and really like how the anime handled her character. \\n\\n\r\nThe other familiar faces from Steins;Gate unfortunately don\u2019t play much of a role in S;G0, but they all still contribute to the story in there own way, so it\u2019s only fair to give some of them a shout out.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuha just wants Okabe to reach Steins;Gate. She desperately tries to get him to time travel in order to fulfill the duty bestowed upon her by her father, and it hurts to see her fail. When it comes to Ruka, there\u2019s a touching moment where Ruka expresses a desire to help Okabe out in any way possible. Ruka feels left out of all of the secrets and just wants to be useful. It\u2019s just a small moment, but it shows just how caring Ruka can be, and I really appreciate that\u2026but he\u2019s a dude. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that his future self is pretty badass. And Faris\u2026well, umm, she\u2019s still a cute neko girl, so\u2026yeah.\\n\\n\r\nOut of the new characters aside from Maho, Professor Leskinen is easily the most memorable. He\u2019s an American in Japan, so as you can imagine, he has many comedic misunderstandings, such as his iconic \u201cWHERE ARE THE JAPANESE SHAMAN GIRLS LINTAHLO?\u201d line. He\u2019s a pretty cool dude, and ends up playing an important role in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOne issue that I do have is that for the longest time, I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what the primary conflict was. I assumed that it was to get to the Steins;Gate world line, but there are so many different things going on that it felt to me like the end goal was sort of being overshadowed. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I highly enjoyed these other plot points. You have Okabe trying to deal with his depression, Suzuha trying to get him to time travel, Maho trying to get out of Kurisu\u2019s shadow, the mystery behind Kagari, the whole Amadeus ordeal, the threat from America and Russia\u2026yeah, you get the point. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but for awhile I wasn\u2019t entirely sure where the anime was going. Of course, all of these things do actually correlate well with one another and contribute to what is to me a great story. I just wish it was a bit more focused. \\n\\n\r\nSo something about Steins;Gate 0 that I\u2019m sure most people will overlook is how it provides a model example for how comedy in an anime should be handled. I know, this is probably a weird statement to make considering the genre of the anime, but it\u2019s true, and S;G0\u2019s seamless implementation of comedic elements is honestly quite praiseworthy. Intertwining with the generally dark and psychological atmosphere of the show, the lighthearted moments are really able to shine through without being the least bit detrimental to the story progression. In many cases, they even proved to be a much needed breath of fresh air and fun. There are also a few fan service scenes (if you can even call them that considering how safe they are) primarily focused on Maho-tan, so if you\u2019re not into lolis, you might actually be turned off by these moments. I, of course, being a man of culture, agree with Daru\u2019s wise statement of \u201clegal loli for the win!\u201d Because remember, Maho is 21, so it\u2019s all perfectly legal. Definitely. No sirens, no FBI. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the technical aspects of the show, I have to say, the sound quality is simply fantastic. The opening theme song Fatima quickly rose to my favorite opening of the year, the endings were great as well, and the soundtrack just fits the anime perfectly. Steins;Gate also has my two favorite seiyuu, Mamoru Miyano and Kana Hanazawa, so that\u2019s a big bonus. And the other voice actors do an amazing job as well. So yeah, I really have no complaints at all when it comes to the sound. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest issue with this show would be it\u2019s visuals. So this anime came out seven years after it\u2019s predecessor, yet there are absolutely no improvements with the visual quality whatsoever. Now they didn\u2019t get worse either, and I can understand the need to keep the visuals similar and consistent between the two anime. But I still expected the animation to be at least a little more polished and detailed. Oh, and some of the action scenes near the end to me just looked really cringy, which is unfortunate. But the character designs are still great, and the artistic quality of the show is still pretty good, despite the flaws I mentioned. It\u2019s just that I have to be a bit nitpicky since this wouldn\u2019t be much of a review if I didn\u2019t point out the flaws, right?\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 is an exceptional anime. Even with it\u2019s male lead acting as a shell of his former self for some time and the female lead dead, it was still able to weave an exciting, albeit a bit unfocused at times, tale about the repercussions of time travel, and is filled with an endearing cast of characters. It may just be the telling of an alternate ending to the original anime, but it was simply an enjoyable ride. I was thoroughly entertained by every episode, and can definitely say that Steins;Gate 0 is one of the greatest anime that I\u2019ve seen in a long time.\\n",

            "content": "\"WHERE ARE THE JAPANESE SHAMAN GIRLS LINTAHLO?!!\" - Good Boi Leskinen\r\nBack in 2011, we were stunned by the hit-anime named \"Steins;Gate\" with its unique story-telling of Sci-Fi, which is time-travel in the anime industry. The industry doesn't have many anime that focuses on time-travel conflicts. So far, the only time-travel anime I've watched were Steins;Gate and ERASED, which both made me amused, excited and thrilled on their unique, individual scenes. Now, this Spring 2018, we were hitted by nostalgia with the return of the Steins;Gate franchise although, instead of it having a sequel, we get a \"midquel\" of the original Steins Gate. Thus, we getto watch the phenomenal dark story of the franchise named \"Steins;Gate 0\". Just a brief reminder, before you watch Steins Gate 0, keep in mind this is an alternate story of the original. After Episode 22/23 of the original series, watch \"Steins;Gate: Episode 23 (B), Open the Missing Link\", where this episode leads to the episode 1 of Steins;Gate 0. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWe get to follow the story of a man once named \"Hououin Kyouma\" but then he suddenly changed with a certain incident, changing him back to only \"Okabe, Rintarou.\" Hence, \"Hououin Kyouma\" was no more in this world. We are looking into a broken-man named \"Okabe, Rintarou\". With him not finding the goal which is the Steins;Gate world line, he was stuck to be in the Beta World Line, where Kurisu sacrificed herself for Mayuri. This is a story where Okabe failed to reach a good ending and was now stuck in a world line where WW3 was inevitable. If you want to expect more dark revelations like what the original Steins;Gate did, then you are on the right series because revelations are breathtaking on each episode of Steins Gate 0. We get to follow an Okabe who wears a dark suit, not a lab coat, depicting how his mental state is. Here, we get to see how he, a once delusional man, is now a normal college student. But, when \"Amadeus\" (AI Kurisu) was introduced to him, the peace that Okabe was longing started to get disrupted. Basically, everything up to the last episode, was related to \"Amadeus\" keeping the plot synopsis in tact and the characters as well. What I like about the story is the originality of the plot rather than copy-pasting from the original anime. Scenes that were anime-original that cannot be found in the VN were some instance, were there as well. Another thing was that the story keeps becoming dark and dark and as it goes darker, the characters are developing as well making the thrill of the story fitting to the characters not only Okabe but the others as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWhat makes a great anime is a ton of great and well-developed characters and the Steins;Gate franchise always impresses us, including Steins;Gate 0 with their characters. Take our favorite mad-scientist for example \"Hououin Kyouma\". We were so attached to him on the original Steins;Gate that seeing him being so broken and fragile on Steins;Gate 0 makes me (and I bet the fans as well), hoping the great mad-scientist will return someday. But even tho he was so broken and fragile, due to the story's progression, his character development progressed each episode as well. Then we have Shiina Mayuri, who shockingly have the best character development of all. She did something so courageous that is out of her character and made us fans say \"Great Job Mayuri.\". Of course we will not forget Hashida Daru. The perverted otaku and hacker who for some instance a dad, a caring friend and a scientist. If you finished this anime, you know why Daru really improved alot on this series not only on a romantic way but with Okabe as well. Then we have Makise Kurisu (Amadeus a.k.a AI Kurisu), again like Mayuri, Courage made her a great character in an instance even though she is just a computer version of the actual Kurisu. Or should I say, she is just a fake. Not to mention the \"trap\" Ruka to have some character development even tho her screentime is not that much. Along with Ruka (who is a supporting characters) are of course Mr Braun and Moeka. If you watched the original Steins Gate you would have known they are the villains (SERN's employees or like that) but it is a good fact that this two are allies of Okabe on this Beta World Line, so expect some revelations of villains ahead.\\n\r\nThen we are introduced with some new characters like Professor Leskinen and Hiyajou, Maho. Maho, who is a colleague of Kurisu back in America shows lots of character traits but one of them was jealousy. Then this trait was shattered as episode goes on and on and we see her having more confidence to herself. Then there's Professor Leskinen who just wants her japanese shaman girls Lintahlo!!!.. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThere's nothing to say about to visuals/art design of Steins;Gate 0 as it stays just what it was back in the 2011 adaptation of Steins;Gate, and of course I'm glad it stayed that way. However, if look at it, there are more action scenes on Steins;Gate 0 compared to Steins;Gate. If your an action fan you will be disappointed as the actions are pretty whacky and not so good. But since we all know Steins;Gate is more focus on the Sci-Fi and thriller stuffs, we can let it all slip. The visuals of the opening and endings are phenominal and matches the current state of the characters on the story. Not to mention, the Endings as well. But out of all those, the first ending which is entitled \"LAST GAME\" grabbed my attention both visually and musically. Its inferences and basis of Okabe and Mayuri to the first half of the story are all in that ED. Overall, the visuals are great.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nA good anime comes with good openings, endings and background music and oh boy..... Zero really made my ears feel the nostalgia back when I watched Steins;Gate and play the VNs. Aside from the openings and endings being good, the background music as I hear them some felt like I heard them before. Even tho they are reusing those background music, it doesn't affect the story and scene at all. It actually makes the scene more powerful and eye-catching with your ears hearing those nostalgic beats. \\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are a diehard steins gate fan you wil love this 23 episodes ride of Steins;Gate 0. It actually felt like I watched a whole another anime which should be because if I felt that I just rewatched Steins;Gate, then Zero would have lacked uniqueness with its plot and characters. But thank god I didn't felt that and I enjoyed it at the same level of the original Steins;Gate. Even tho it is more dark, it should be and will always be a good anime to watch if you feel like Steins;Gate was not enough. If you haven't watched Steins;Gate, do it now and then watch this. I assure you. You will not regret it. El..Psy..Congroo..",

In reliving time, I learned one thing\u2026 That certain events converge as if orchestrated by God. Trying to change them\u2026 it\u2019s challenging God. And God does not tolerate human arrogance. '' Okabe Rintaro\r\n''This vague, ominous feeling\u2026 It\u2019s like living in a nightmare where I know all the bad things to come. Where the world enjoys to rub in the guilt of my unspeakeable sin. This inescapable despair... Slowly becomes a downward spiral... '' Okabe Rintaro\r\nSteins;Gate 0 is the bleak reality ofthe Beta World Line. Basically, it's Okabe's story of the tragic future of the beta line, portraying his depression and how he managed to plan Operation Skuld. Steins;Gate 0 arises from the premisse \"what if?\". What if Okabe had made another decision, giving up everything? \\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\r\nIt is highly recommended watch Steins;Gate 0 because it explains exactly the events that leads to the end of the original series, why this tragic future needs desperately to change. The dialogues are dense and shocking (episode 16 is the perfect proof of this), since Okabe tries to live a normal life but, even so he sinks in an absolute sadness. See only if you have that in mind, because it is not easy to recover from a trauma, and his motives to become depressed are entirely plausible. Hououin Kyouma will return, we all know, but surely he must experience total despair before the glorious return and the glorious ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nThe art is very similar to the original, however, here has many more dark tones to leave a more tense atmosphere. I also like the fact that the camera focuses a lot on the traumatized expression of the Okabe, emphasizing all his suffering. The only problem of the art is the animation of the action scenes that occur in episode 17 and 18, but since it\u2019s not an anime focused totally in action, I can overlook this a little bit. But I hope they will improve this at the final edition.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is simply beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nThe characters continue to have a good development, especially Okabe, Daru, Mayuri and Maho. They all have a backstory, philosophical and subjective debates, goals and dramas. I would say that initially Steins;Gate 0 as well as Steins;Gate has a focus on character development, only that in S;G 0 they are developed in a dense environment, which further increases the thrilling atmosphere. It is noteworthy that, PRACTICALLY in the whole anime Okabe is depressed and hopeless, which is not a bad thing, it is totally plausible for the reasons I mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nIf you loved Steins; Gate, you'll love this one. All the dark atmosphere and the deep feelings that are addressed in every episode. If you felt comfortable after the ending of Steins;Gate, be prepared to be punched in the gut with every episode. This is not your feel-good anime. This anime will torment you with feels in a way you wouldn't expect.\\n\\n\r\nS;G 0 is so much underrated. I believe that a large portion did not understand some points of the plot, premise and the interweaving of routes of the VN. The point is that Steins;Gate 0 should not be observed separately, since the main premise is to complement the True Ending, giving a totally new great meaning to it. Basically it's the story of the Operation Skuld but not about the Operation Skuld.\\n\\n\r\nThis way, it can be said that the main issue addressed in Steins;Gate 0 is sacrifice. I can't say much more about the True Ending due to spoilers, but It's implied that 0kabe lives through multiple PR and V&A like scenarios. What I can say is that Steins;Gate 0 is very, very complex... maybe even more complex than the original series, because it has several layers and infinite loops of failures and sacrifices, plus the end is extremely sad. It is a sensational experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, It's a great sequel. Steins;Gate 0 has a genial psychological plot with a very dark atmosphere and incredible soundtrack. Just like Steins;Gate, this series deserves to be watched by all humans of this and other World Lines. \\n\\n\r\nEl Psy Kongroo.",

            "content": "Steins;Gate 0 is a story following \"Open the Missing Link\" - episode 23B of Steins;Gate.\r\nCharacters:\r\nMy biggest gripe with the show is that no character delivers anything worth hearing in 20 episodes of the series. Okabe is a one-dimensional depressed person who's only way of exuding emotion is through shocked expressions. Mayuri is nothing but a plot device who clings to Okabe for reasons unknown since she has no character development at all. Her entire reasoning for existence is to love Okabe and that's it.\r\nKagari is there to exist solely to look like Kurisu and make you feel bad. Nothing else... but she's a cliffhanger for4 episodes only to be overshadowed shortly after. She did not have enough character development prior to showing the sob story for you to even care.\\n\\n\r\nI could break down each character, but this is what each of them are. They're all hollow characters that have no justification for their actions. There's no backstory and if there is it's as basic as it could get, it's just \"This is them, and this is how they will always act.\" and they never deviate from that. \\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\nWorld War 3 is imminent and they need to shift world lines to find \"Steins;Gate\" but Okabe says \"nope\". After too many episodes, he says \"maybe\". After more episodes, he's just thrown into the future and he says \"oh wow, maybe I should have done something\". From there his entire perspective changes because he \"didn't think it'd be like this even though he knew it'd be like this but didn't think about it\". He actually says that. That's it. Every other sub-plot that tried to fit itself in is now over-shadowed by this. Why did they exist? Mommy/daughter scenes? And did I mention this was 21 EPISODES of a 23 EPISODE series? So now he's in a race to get back to the past to revert all the crap we had to painfully sit through.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt one of the worst animations I've seen from an Anime that has done well world-wide. They pick it up in the final 4 episodes, but even than it barely passes. They kept the same art style which was great and a plus, but the proportions were insanely ridiculous in certain scenes. The action scenes were abysmal and sadly they came towards the end of the series. The series suffered a lot of realism with how poorly done every action shot was. Overall, it was pretty lackluster and the amount of close-ups of people's faces started to become uncomfortable. Each episode seemed to have a different \"budget\" - some episodes looked bad, others looked a lot better, etc. Steins;Gate looked better, and that was 7 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThere are no twists or turns along the way. Everything you thought would happen, did happen. And the worst part is, the show made you think you're stupid and left EACH one of these things on a \"cliffhanger\". We knew how this ended before it began, so why did you put cliffhangers of character deaths in it? That's lazy writing. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot moved at a snail pace and the story didn't flow together at all. It felt as if 5 people wrote it without talking with one another. They don't delve into the plot until episode 20. Instead you sat through watching Okabe be sad and people trying to cheer him up with slight plot nuances here and there that you saw coming a mile away. There is no sci-fi/mystery in this, there are no philosophical quotes/ideas. It's just, \"hey get the time machine let's go back in time\". The conclusions are just chopped up to \"convergence\" with no consistency or even showing it since it'd look so idiotic. \\n\\n\r\nThe new characters are all shadows of past characters(Kurisu vs Maho)... or Kagari being a duplicate of Suzuha that looks like Kurisu. We still don't even know why she does. That's the type of originality this show has to offer. It banked on nostalgia of Steins;Gate and it shows - this wouldn't hold its own if it didn't exist. The fan service episodes, the non-existent character development... and most of all, how little everything made sense when you look into it.\\n\\n\r\nAmadeus is reduced to a plot device for people who wanted to see her and they needed to add some melodrama to it that made NO SENSE. The story makes you fixate on one thing, and hopes you forget about everything prior and what's to come countless times. I'll give one example. Why do we need a full episode of Amadeus right before the finale when Okabe knows the AI has to seize existing to have the REAL Kurisu next episode? Why did it exist? It's like they forgot the entire plot for one episode in hopes of recreating what the original had that wasn't forced. Any other cliche made sense there, \"I'm coming to save you Kurisu. I love you.\" - I'd go as far as to say THAT was better than what they did. It fit into the theme of what Okabe was at the time, unlike what they did.\\n\\n\r\n If you're looking for a sci-fi/thriller with a great plot, watch the original again. If you want to see the same ideas rehashed with bad writing, bad characters, and pointless plots with a good amount of fan service... look no further. Steins;Gate 0 awaits you.",

            "content": "This is my second review ever so cut me some slack :p\r\nSteins;gate zero is an alternate ending to the original series we all love steins;gate, in this ending okabe fails to save Kirisu and he gives up all hope of saving her and goes into depression.\r\nStory: As somebody who has played the VN i am happy how the adaptation is turning out, I especially like the psychological scenes. The pacing is also better then the original steins;gate because we don't need to introduce every single character which happened in the original steins;gate (a good 10 episodes or so). \r\nStory: 9\r\nArt: So white fox is atit again, we have all the characters we know and love in some different outfits that look quite nice in my opinion, especially Okabe looks fantastic in that black suit. It really highlights that he is going through a very tough time and that he isn't the cheerful mad scientist anymore. The backgrounds look very nice and have a lot of details. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Oh boy, oh boy the moment I heard Kanako Itou was doing the opening again I knew it was gonna be fantastic and she didn't disappoint. (besting Hacking To The Gate is impossible but she did a really good job) Some tracks from the original show also made a return and of course they added some twists and turns left and right. Adding sad/depressing songs was a must for this show, but they delivered with that as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is where steins;gate truly shines. All of the characters are so lovable it isn't even funny. They feel so real and you truly care about them. Seeing these awful things happen to these characters makes me sad. We are also more attached to them because we have known them for so long. They are also very interesting and are not flat characters without any spine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: What is there not to enjoy? We are talking about steins;gate, each episode up until now has delivered and i am eager to see where this adaptation will lead us.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 10 (9.7)",

            "content": "Steins Gate 0 is a story about Okabe losing Kurisutina and falling into depression because now his harem is incomplete. Not awesome. With the power of epic deus ex machina writing stuff, person close to Kurisutina puls a random personality capturing device out of her butt and a trip towards harem restoration begins. Awesome.\r\nThe writing is a mess. A total clash of random ideas. The amount of different plot elements from asspullery science-save-us-all devices to reading steiner super powers inserted inside slice of life harem settings about.... depression, is absurd. It mainly reminds me of the chaos that Code Geass R2 was. Inb4 who wasriding the time machine? Predicting it. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the build-up, last time White Fox did an impressive job by fooling people into thinking that the show isn't good. Steins Gate generating mean score close to 7.00 during its first episodes. With Steins Gate 0, they did the opposite by fooling people into thinking that this series is good. Advanced trolling. gg I guess.\\n\\n\r\nSurely an anime with generic and weak story can be still good if a) the characters are amazing b) the overall execution as a whole is truly unique and impressive. \\n\\n\r\nOkabe became depressed so he would look the exact same as during Mayushii rescue arc. Tutturuus are starting to feel old. Suzuha is still a whine with fabulous hair. Nyan nyan terrible excuse for a fanservice animal girl. I am still not sure if Rukako has a dick or not, but hey token traps for men of culture, amirite? Maho is just a midget with long hair. At least she doesn't have to claim she is ACHUAYLLY 700 years-old vampire in 7 yo girls body. My morals thank thee. Kurisutina is there only to insert one of each archetype into the harem mix. Daru still speaks like he is mentally handicapped... Some people call this series a masterpiece for its characters, by the way... They are just really dull and boring. Even the girls in 'White Album' had more characteristics. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the overall execution, basically this is just a parody series which doens't recognize itself as one. Even 'Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu' was more self-aware. Okabe's traumas are handled super poorly and in a manner much worse than in 'Mahou Shoujo Site' which is another \"dark\" series from current season. Whenever Moeka appears and the 3 seconds long dramatic tension BGM starts playing while Okabe looks like he will get a panic attack, I bury myself in double facepalm. And whenever our characters speak of building a new machine it mainly reminds me of 'Galilei Donna' where 6 years-old kid \"build\" a huge, advanced airship in a day. Steins Gate is exactly as convincing for that matter. I have yet to meet a person who gets fooled by the thriller side of this show. Super cheap shit-is-getting-real running scenes which end with comedic reliefs... It's almost nauseating. And when they threw that amnesia/memory loss cliche I had no choice but to pause the stream for 5 minutes and think if the writing can even go more ridiculous than this. It's not really even funny, just sad. \\n\\n\r\nThe songs are inferior to the 2011 anime. I must have listened Hacking the Gate for something like 2036 years. This time there is no note-worthy songs outside the OP and ED. Especially the supposedly emotional piano songs used in supposedly emotional scenes are just awful. Practically all the rest is elevator music... if there even is any. There almost never is any music playing or if it plays, it plays super quiet and doesn't typically even sound like music. Mainly remind me of the PS3 menu sounds. The voice acting is identical. Of course there are some awkward engrish and wapanese scenes this time which could as well not be there. The art is the same, nothing to complain about that one. At least one thing which I don't have to get annoyed by...\\n\\n\r\nBased to the first 6 episodes, this has the potential to be the worst anime I have seen since 'Guilty Crown' back in 2011-2012. There is almost nothing the series has done correctly (so far).\\n",

            "content": "\"the flow of time is an illusion, that the past, present and future are equally real, and that time is tenseless\"\r\nHello readers\r\nthere i go presenting the review of probably the best science fiction series world of anime has to offer . They say you can't improve on perfection, yet Steins;Gate 0 does just that. Taking what made the original story so great by awesome characters and a much darker theme makes Steins;Gate 0 the perfect continuation to a story.\r\n\"no one know what the future holds, thats why its potential is infinite\"\r\nstory(probably 10/10)\r\nI love how Steins;Gate 0 embraces the Beta timeline.\r\nAs i mention steins gate 0involves a much darker theme and more thrilling impact than its previous season.As we seen in previous season, the series left off at the end of its 23rd episode, except in this version of events our hero Okabe didn't go through with the heroics that brought Steins;Gate prime to its happy ending. Instead, Okabe has gone full on tortured fallen hero, even going so far as to don a jet black ensemble to reflect the depths of his anguish. he is emotionally exhausted, burnt out on play-acting, and haunted by trauma that flares up whenever he's reminded of that one cruel summer. This episode's idle conversations between very familiar friends did a great job of asserting how badly Okabe had suffered, making his resistance to Suzuha asking for further help feel entirely natural.\\n\r\nIn short with giving much spoiler's ahead i feel story seems much more darker and thrilling than previous season. Its still lacks some originality also i feel it skipping some of its detail's but it has great potential, some starting episodes are bit drafty and will surely able to give chills through its darker theme's.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and art(9/10) \\n\r\nWhite fox absolutely fantastic job here.The episode does a great job of tweaking the series into something much more unsettling than Steins'Gate's early episodes; dramatic closeups and moody camera work ensure that the audience is never unaware of the deep psychological stress that haunts Okabe at all times.\\n\r\nOn other hand it also feel's somewhat limited by its color palette and a little lethargic in its pacing.Its similar to Re:Zero, appears to be applying some of the same elements and themes from Subaru\u2019s hellish existence when bringing Okabe\u2019s visions to life.though its still great and you will get what you expect.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"My one constant, the one truth that never failed me was you\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10/10)\\n\r\nIts not unknown that this series got some awesome character complexity that is mostly one of the major requirement of sci-fi thriller story.However i feel everything you learnt about characters like Mayuri, Daru and Moeka Kiryu in Steins;Gate may now no longer be true. You will still find their characteristics the same \u2013 Mayuri is still a cute, ditsy young girl, Daru still the pervert and Moeka the shy reporter who hides behind her mobile phone.\\n\r\nOkabe however seems depressed and hopeless and seems like a shell of his former self, its make audience more curious about Okabe's future.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10)\\n\r\nSteins gate 0 is absolutely amazing in every way. I really loved original SG and was waiting for really long time for this. It is definitely at least as good as the first.Its unpredictable,more darker, and always have potential to surprise viewer's with unexpected ending's. Its really fun series for Sci-fi Thriller lovers as well as in short its more like anime verson of christopher nolan's movie's got similar addiction, excitment,unpredectiblity and thrills.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nHands down to one of the most amazing sci-fi series ever produced I believe Steins gate zero has absolute potential as going down as a contender of best series of this year. If you are the fan of 1st season like me you surely find yourself in heaven while watching this series.\\n\r\nIts surely on par with its predecessor's high standards. It remains to be seen if the show will be able to make a compelling story out of a scenario that fans already know a happier outcome for, but the quality of this premiere has assuaged my fears. Even if poor Okabe has to suffer for it, it's good to have Steins;Gate back.\\n\\n\r\n\"EL PSI CONGROO\"\\n\\n\r\nStory(10/10)\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nSound(9/10)\\n\r\nCharacter(10/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10)\\n\r\nHype(11/10)\\n\r\noverall-Highly recommended\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cTheories are nothing more than words, accept what you\u2019ve seen.\u201d \u2014 Okabe (Steins;Gate)\r\nReflecting on one\u2019s past experiences can elicit a host of undesirable thoughts/anxieties that permeate to the surface, causing emotional stress and a feeling of helplessness.  The upshot being: the simple act of thinking about said events will not alter the final outcome, making the exercise an unquestionably fruitless one.  But in the case of Okabe (where time-travel and reading \u201csteiner\u201d are quite accessible), the ability to improve upon the past is well within the realm of possibilities, allowing for the veritable \u201chappy ending\u201d to occur.  This inevitability zaps away aconsiderable amount of the intrigue for the viewer, especially when a ham-fisted love story is thrown into the fold, making the events to come, seem exceptionally contrived.  If anything was surprising about the original Steins;Gate, it was the sweeping praise it received by the anime community.  But I suppose an epic theme song combined with a bunch of sexy \u201cLAYDEE\u2019s\u201d (channeling my inner Bill Burr) and \u201cthe most realistic time-traveling series I have ever seen\u201d \u2014 said everyone on MAL; literally, everyone \u2014 will make an anime series quite popular these days, so why not turn back the clock and relive that success one more time.\\n\\n\r\nBut before the anime staff can immerse itself into the meat of the story, we desperately need a sexy Christmas party with a few new characters\u2026\u2026And, and, we need Okabe to communicate with a virtual Kurisu, because virtual girlfriends are a rising trend in Japan, so appealing to that growing sector will certainly increase viewership.  Also, let\u2019s throw in a handful of Ruka being a dude who looks like a girl jokes, because redundancy in comedy always kills.\\n\\n\r\nBut redundancy is only half of the story, because for all the \u201cmisdirection\u201d and \u201cflabbergast-ery\u201d the show is ceaselessly dull, imparting a loud and clear message to the viewer: Steins;Gate 0 has no identity.  Is it a harem?  How about an amnesia story?  Are we still doing that time-traveling thing?  Is Amadeus a social commentary on the proliferation of blue balled young men?  Is it a modern day reinterpretation of the rivalry between Mozart and Salieri?  Is it a slice-of-life retelling of Back to the Future, with Daru starring in the role of George McFly?  How about a Japanese, female-driven John Wick story with Suzuha as the main lead?\\n\\n\r\nNo!  To all of the above.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime staff had one goal in mind, and one goal only: to flaunt Okabe\u2019s chic new black suit.  And I must admit, as a fellow man, it looks stunning!\\n\\n\r\nBut enough tickling your tits for one afternoon, because the criticism about the show\u2019s identity is an entirely valid one.  The deviation from the themes that made the original Steins;Gate mildly interesting, abated the enjoyment of the viewer, giving the show a banal texture that did not bestow anything of actual substance.  Okabe was reduced to an impassive, aggrieved individual who became disturbed at the end of several episodes to feign genuine interest.  Kurisu was relegated to an inactive participant due to her amnesic circumstances, and was used as a means to trigger significant events in the series.  Suzuha preached about the imminence of World War III like she\u2019s one of those homeless domesday clairvoyants.  Maho was the Salieri to Kurisu\u2019s Mozart, in the sense that she was an untalented tsundere, despite her best attempts.  And, well, everyone else was\u2026.um, present?  They certainly were there, but they felt more like cogs in a machine, with little to no freedom to act on their own accord.  \\n\\n\r\nHaving a deficient cast of character\u2019s is one issue, but having a story that felt like it was blended together by multiple writers with no communication with one another, is just inexcusable.  The show felt reminiscent of Mirai Nikki, where \u201cshocking\u201d events would occur, but the cohesion of said events never felt homogeneous.  Also, there were a considerable amount of \u201cfluff\u201d episodes, where nothing of actual importance took place.  The lull between critical events became excruciating at times, and even when a pivotal moment would happen, it felt over-the-top, cliched, and generally out of place.  Furthermore, the staff\u2019s eagerness to exhibit their female characters in erotic situations ad nauseam, highlights how the show was never meant to be taken as a serious intellectual endeavor; but rather, a fun project to elicit some laughter, and intermittent moments of heart-pounding drama.  Sadly, though, it wasn\u2019t particularly entertaining, and it failed to engage the viewer time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nThe final few episodes ratcheted up the intensity to the point of becoming Hollywood-level ridiculous.  There was a protracted exposition by the evil scientist, where he explained his \u201cmaster plan\u201d to the last detail (yet another old scientist who ends up being the bad guy).  Unbelievable action sequences, not in the sense they were breathtaking, but just plain unrealistic.  And the return of the \u201csleeping\u201d protagonist to his status of Hououin Kyouma, because the fans need to be hyped up for that \u201cepic\u201d finale.  Speaking of \u201chype,\u201d that is the optimal word for describing this series, as it built itself up on sheer optimism and excitement from the anime community; yet, for all of its grand ambitions, it was nothing more than a used car salesman convincing you that it was better than it really was.\\n\\n\r\nBut as Okabe said, \u201caccept what you\u2019ve seen,\u201d and if it wan\u2019t overtly obvious, we have seen a bad show.",

I will say the VN pointed this out much more, but well that is what happens to the anime when it's trying to compress a VN that doesn't just need to go with the true ending.\\n\r\nThis is because you need to clear a route that sends a D-mail to the past, to even get the true ending. Not only that, but the other routes also give so much perspective to the story. You can see what they have changed with the anime in ep 4. We are in a scene that is WW3, but suddenly everything is changed. This just seems strange, and some don't like it (\ud83d\udc40). I think this is on purpose really. EDIT (13-09-18): I believe this change from the scene of WW3 will be adapted to the OVA, can't say why wholeheartedly but probably because it has too heavy indication to who the \"villain\" is. They could also do it after this episode (21), but don't think it's good timing for that.\\n\\n\r\nWell here we go\\n\\n\r\nStory - N/A\\n\r\nI know what the story is from the VN, and I would give it a 10 alright. I just won't really give it a definite number.\\n\r\nIt really seems cliched, but god damn that is a wrong assumption (\ud83d\udc40) It's really the small indistinguishable things that has an aspect to it and really the future will use these cliche looking things and change it and give it a new perspective. I would also say around ep 16 there will be a real emotional scene alright (I predict this out of my knowledge from the VN( EDIT (23-05-18): nvm then ep 8 it is. they really jump the story on us)) that really will punch you in the gut and after ep 20 our heart will race. It could also be fun if they did little fillers, but really that is a slippery slope I don't want to take. EDIT (13-09-18): Hey, atleast i got my prediction right with our heart racing after ep 20, many thing changed from the VN, but nothing is \"worse\" per say. More up to how you enjoy it, but seems lige i am gonna binge this thing after it ends and rewrite the whole thing\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nHey, what am I gonna say, it's just as normal. Just great.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nAgain, it's great. Nothing much to say there. Normal S;G stuff\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nEveryone is exactly the same, except that Okabe is depressed, Suzuha is pissed off at Okabe and doesn't know much about Hououin Kyouma, Mr Braun is colder, Daru is Daru. Pretty much the main cast is the same. Well except that Kurisu is dead (for now), and is an AI (for now) \ud83d\ude22\\n\r\nThen there is new additions.\\n\r\nMaho, \"Oiii soko no lolico\ufeff\". She is Kurisus Salieri, pretty much tells you everything you need to know about her\\n\r\nKagari, a girl that has lost her memories, well at least for now \ud83d\udc40\\n\r\nLeskinen \"Holy cow! So I said we should come soon\", just a REALLY lovely guy that likes shaman girls, no /s \ud83d\udc40 Is also a meme\\n\r\nReyes, well. A LOVELY voluptuous scientist, nothing more though \ud83d\udc40\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nIt's really slow right now and is a mindfuck, but really that also how S;G also was for non-VN readers, but this time even VN readers are mindfucked most of the time. I really like it, while at the same time I don't. I have fun really.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nFack me\\n\r\nThis little quote is everything for this series\\n\r\n\"Steins Gate is just a stupid delusion\"\\n\\n\r\nOh ps while you go through this remember what the video Okabe said at the end of S;G\\n\\n\r\nEDIT (13-09-18): rip this, they changed it :/ No matter, was just as epic and great feeling\\n\r\n\"BRING MY LABCOAT!!\"\\n\r\n\"Yes, this is it! This is my holy white armour! This is the moment of Hououin Kyouma's revival! I've finally been awoken from my long slumber! FUWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"\\n\r\nEl psy KONGROO~~",

            "content": "Many who watched this series have missed the point of it, it isn't like the original, no it wasn't supposed to surpass it like many suspected here. It is here to complete it, you may have not noticed but the original had many things that we had yet to see. This isn't a what if story either, this is the story of Okabe who failed to find Steins Gate, the same one who fell under depression because of it.\r\nI'll start with story, the STORY WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS:\r\nStory obviously is a 10 for me. At some point during the Steins;Gate 0 I truly doubted if thiswas gonna live up to it's hype or fail like many sequels. Many hate it because they expected the mad scientist earlier, many were expecting too many time traveling and got sad. When the first episode of anime aired, it had a score of 9.16 I think, it was truly the best episode I had yet seen, it captured the mood perfectly, it shows us that Okabe of this world line is very depressed, but more importantly the scene where he sees many bodies of Kurisu shows us his fear. His fear that he will always fail no matter what, the fear that no matter what Okabe does, it will always result in him sacrificing somebody to save somebody else. We can see this during the rest of the show, till the point where he is forced to change the future yet again. At some point I thought too, where is this story going? How will it link to the OG Steins Gate, I really doubted the middle parts of the story honestly. One of the main important points of the story is how Kurisu is the one who even though dead starts a world war. It is always her curiosity that results in something bad to Okabe, in Alpha world line we had Sern which in a way it is both Okabe's fault and hers, in Beta we have WW3 which starts because of Kurisu's thesis. We see this through the Amadeus, we see a lot through Amadeus, why Okabe calls Kurisu Christina, how even dead Kurisu can change the world. \\n\r\nI'm going to skip all this to the episode 16, where we get to see an actual character development in Mayushi, I really never saw her point in O.G steins gate but honestly in Steins;Gate 0 she became one of my favorites. The reason is simple, she always loved Okabe, she always thought of him as the one who can change the future, the one who can bring peace, she always regretted not having Okabe go back to save Kurisu, it really made me break down. After trying to go to time machine and being blown into pieces, Okabe goes back to time leap but ends up in PR, in year 2036. Okabe now has his eyes wide open, he sees what will happen to this world line if he doesn't find steins gate. I forgot to mention that he was in coma and he suffered a lot when waking up, and when he started time travelling again so he can go back to year 2011, it must have fking hurt waking up in that pain. The fact that he spent around 8 years (I'm assuming that is the time it took him, could be way more or less) to go back in time and save everyone must have been painful, he had to explain everything again and again and again. A strong character in my opinion, I would go insane (you all would). BUT THAT WAKES UP THE MAD SCIENTIST! You should watch the rest honestly (too lazy to explain).\\n\\n\r\nArt 8: This is the part which sucks, at times it is very good and at times it sucks. That is all about it honestly, the background though is even better than the original in my opinion, which I really loved.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10: Many of the songs that played were awesome!!!! They set the mood perfectly, the first OP and ED are in my playlist now. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10 : Now this is the point that I wanted to get at. Many say that Okabe is a one dimensional character, honestly fk you all who said it. You just don't know why he is going through all that. To others it was like Okabe just went emo one day, nobody knows why, he can't tell anybody because who knows if Sern might listen. That is honestly very depressing in my opinion, we see during the 23B he looks very sad but at same time tries to look happy in front of Mayushi, that is a very strong character in my opinion. As the show progressed, we saw him slowly bounce back to his old self, the interactions between [Kurisu] and him were awesome, we saw other sides of him that we never saw in OG. And at end the mad scientist was still the same, the idiot who cracks up good jokes and has well out of this world delusions. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10 : Honestly as long as you liked the original, you're fine.\\n\\n\r\nTl;DR: Hello, it's me. They didn't bother with the paragraph and went straight to the tl;dr. Shame there was nothing on it.\\n\\n\r\nEl psy kongroo!",

            "content": "There comes a time when fans of a franchise should ask themselves if an established franchise deserves a sequel or not. Let\u2019s face it. Steins;Gate made an impact back in 2011 when it became one of the critically acclaimed adaptations that year. Visuals novels aren\u2019t easy to adapt and in fact, most recent series really proved themselves to be a catastrophe in that territory. Steins;Gate is one of those properties that didn\u2019t really need a sequel although fans have been asking for years. And it\u2019s a bit painful for me to say\u2026.but Steins;Gate 0 didn\u2019t truly live up to the name it made for itself.\r\nAsa true sequel to Steins;Gate, this series is the canonical anime that once again shows us the world of time travel, hypothetical theories, and scientific creativity. It\u2019s essentially a sci-fi adventure that brings back our lovable character cast while also introducing some new ones who really makes their own impact in the story. Rintarou Okabe returns in the Alpha World line without Makise Kurisu after events of the first season. What we see from Okabe\u2019s point of view is how he deals with living in a world without her. It\u2019s a constant everyday struggle as the man is filled with despair. However, an AI (known as the Amaedus) once again reminds Okabe of the memories he tried to bury.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the season takes place in Japan and in the Alpha World line. Fans who have seen the first season will quickly realize that Kurisu is gone but Mayuri remains along with the rest of her friends. Okabe also meets Maho Hiyajou, a researcher from Viktor Chondria University. As an assistant, she works under Professor Leskinen and is the one who introduces Okabe to the Amaedus. What is the Amaedus? It\u2019s designed and developed by Makise Kurisu herself alongside Leskinen and Maho. The program is built based on her likeness that is able to make use of human memory and converts it into digital data. As such, the AI greatly resembles Kurisu not just in her behavior but also personality and mannerism. Obviously, this reminds Okabe of the real Kurisu who no longer exists in his timeline. Steins;Gate 0 features Okabe dealing with his own personal demons, guilt, and trying to overcome his past in order to save the future. The first season capitalized on its sci-fi elements such as time travel and conspiracies. Unfortunately for this sequel, it felt like the show took a step backwards and really didn\u2019t manage take a step forward.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the show took on the approach that I felt familiar with and really embraced in. There\u2019s a bit of dark drama and comedy that takes a realistic approach at human behavior. It\u2019s what I thought the original season did so well when it managed to make every character distinctive from each other. For Steins;Gate 0, there\u2019s not much change for any of the main cast at all. Okabe\u2019s constant self-loathing gets tiresome after watching it so many times. Ok, he feels guilty about what he had to do to save someone but the season overemphasizes on this direction. To me, it felt like the show constantly needs to remind us why Okabe is like this and it\u2019s repetitive storytelling. In the meantime, we do get some fresh faces such as Maho and Leskinen. Both characters are intelligent although contrast greatly with each other\u2019s personalities. Maho seems similar to Makise Kurisu with her tsundere personality and there\u2019s often a recurring joke about others mistaking her as a child. She develops an important relationship with Okabe although I didn\u2019t feel the impact of it as much as I had hoped for; at least compared to Kurisu anyway. On the other hand, Leskinen introduces himself as a lighthearted guy who often jokes with others while demonstrating a degree of intellect. The show also does a fair job at disguising his true intentions but we don\u2019t find out about it until fairly later on. His relationship with Okabe and others often contrasts the mood of the show especially in early episodes. In later episodes, the series gets darker and darker as startling revelations are discovered that once again deals with time travel. It\u2019s a core idea of the franchise after all.\\n\\n\r\nNow I have not played the visual novel for this sequel so this was more of fresh experience to me. The season feels rather moody even with characters like Mayuri and Faris with their roles. Others such as Suzuha also become much more important as they take their own initiative to protect what\u2019s at stake. Still, coming in this as an anime only viewer, I felt the story is a thriller at best and dry storyteller at worst. To me, this franchise really explored everything it needed to and didn\u2019t even need a new season to prove that. The dialogues and character interactions are interesting to listen to but doesn\u2019t truly make this season worthwhile in the end. As a huge fan of the franchise, Steins;Gate 0 feels like it took way too much of its previous ideas and didn't make an upgrade.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Fox is still in charge of this project and they bought out their talent once again.Thankfully, they earned my trust as the studio proved itself capable of recreating character emotions. That\u2019s important as every character needed to express themselves as credible as they can be. This especially applies to Okabe as we see him drown in despair. Character interactions are captured wisely by the studio\u2019s directive synergy to make them memorable. The design of the characters didn\u2019t evolve much although it\u2019s clear that Okabe has abandoned his lab coat for a more casual wear with his dark shirt to reflect his change in character. Others such as Maho may evoke some lighthearted laughter when certain characters makes jokes about her short height and appearance. The Amaedus is designed in the likeliness of Makise Kurisu so in terms of physical appearance, they look identical.\\n\\n\r\nAs a series with sci-fi themes, it\u2019s only fitting that Steins;Gate 0 gets decorated with some colorful soundtrack. Indeed, the sequel combines thrilling theatrics with some emotional OST and melancholy. The OP song \u201cFatima\u201d by Itou Kanako highlights a bit of character journey for the cast and how they feel in this season. There are several different ED themes too that makes clever usage of its sci-fi elements. On most parts, I think character voices also did a stellar job. Okabe\u2019s personal values are often expressed by his dialogues that are important for his evolving personality. Others such as Maho, Mayuri, and Suzuha made me appreciate their character roles more when they really say what\u2019s on their mind.\\n\\n\r\nAt 23 episodes, Steins;Gate 0 became a 2-cour show that could of done a better job at making itself more distinctive. Instead, it tried to rely far too much on its previous established concepts while forging a story that seems too similar to the previous. However, I will say that this sequel will be a treat for diehard fans of the franchise. The episodes in the first half bought back the mood of the original show like yesterday. Even in some of the later episodes, it still has a bit of taste of sci-fi thrilling style of storytelling. The new characters may also be worthwhile for your time if you accept them for who they are.  So give it a shot if you want. It may not be perfect but it\u2019s still freaking Steins;Gate.",

            "content": "\"That day, if my Hikoboshi came back to life, it might have changed everything.\"\r\nRe-review of Steins;Gate 0 after watching the entire series in chronological order (Steins;Gate episodes 1-22, 23b, 0 episodes 1-23, Steins;Gate episodes 23-25).\r\nThis review is coming from a die-hard fan of the original series that has watched the original anime and 100% completed 0's Visual Novel as well.  I originally gave the series an 8/10, but after rewatching it I'm bumping it up to a 9/10 due to the fact that I was able to better absorb the story and the series has one of the strongest finishes in all of anime.\r\nStory:\r\nIcan draw some interesting parallels between the anime adaptation of Steins;Gate 0 and the original Fullmetal Alchemist adaptation.  Two stories that adapt from an original source material, but have a vastly different second half from the original for different reasons.  In Steins;Gate 0's case, it is because the Visual Novel of 0 is non-linear.  In order for you to get the true end, you have to progress the story through two conflicting routes in a certain order.  The story vastly changes depending on which route you take.  White Fox had to somehow tell a linear cohesive story through that source material, and in some ways, it works really well, and in others, it falls on its face.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the good.  The story is much deeper than the original.  You really get to see the both the best and worst of humanity through this story, and adds so much character development to the main cast.  The anime adaptation managed to adapt all of the endings of 0 into the main story (with the exception of the bad end) and it adds a lot of weight to the story in some aspects.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it's not all good.  Steins;Gate was a very slow burn of a story that didn't really pick up until episode 9, and the plot didn't really fire on all cylinders until episode 12.  But once it got there, oh man, I was hooked.  Steins;Gate 0 has some much worse pacing problems.  The first eight episodes are great, the story kicks into high gear on episode 6, but then peaks around 8, and then crashes and burns by the time episode 10 rolls around.  The plot spins its wheels for five episodes, and then things start picking back up again.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the story hits the gecko ending (Mayuri's route in the VN was vastly different) the story doubles down and the stakes are raised even further.  I can say this is probably the only time ever where knowing the source material will actually curve you even harder than going in blind.   The last third of Steins;Gate 0 is far better than the VN, and is the primary reason why I adjusted my review.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime adaptation also added a significant amount of original content that was not present in the VN.  Episode 8 turned a half hour part of the VN into a full episode, and the feels knob is turned up to 11 as a result, Daru and Yuki's relationship is expanded in a very wholesome OC episode (which pulls double duty for expanding Daru and Yuki's characters, as well as writing out a very very dumb plot twist from the VN), and once Mayuri's route starts going you get a sizeable chunk of the Drama CD Arc-Light of the Point at Infinity, which was equally as impactful as Faris' route in the original in terms of expanding the character of someone who was barely a blip on the radar and turned them into one of the best of the show.  Thank you White Fox for reinforcing why I love Mayushii so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe Teal Deer for the story is that the VN is paced much better, but the overall changes that the anime makes to the story is much more impactful, suspenseful, and has a much more satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, this is a hell of a can of worms.  Steins;Gate had some of the best animation and art in all of anime.  It defies the moeblob art style that the rest of the industry has taken to heart and favors a more realistic approach, focusing more on the character's bodies than their eyes.  I'd say that the art style is the midway point between Log Horizon and Death Note.  Regardless of whether or not you like the art style, you can't argue that it is part of the reason why Steins;Gate stands out in the sea of anime adaptations.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 doubles down on what was good and bad about the original.  There are scenes in 0 that look more visually stunning than in Your Name.  But oh my the action scenes look just ghastly.  Not to mention the various anatomical and linguistic errors (Sarieri, Roading, etc.)  Now, these I'll give a pass because those will be ironed out in the Blu-Ray release, but I have no idea how they're going to fix the tire fire that is the action scenes in episodes 18 and 19.  The answer is probably that they won't, and trust me, it's hard to look at.\\n\\n\r\nTeal Deer, 0 retains the distinct art style of the original and works great in stills and certain scenes, but it's execution in high action scenes are laughably bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate always had an amazing soundtrack, but 0's eclipses it by a long shot, and that's really saying something.  The new tracks and the remixes of the old ones add so much more weight to the scenes.   There were times where I was barely holding on in an emotional scene, Amadeus started playing, and then the dam broke and out came the waterworks.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime exclusive tracks are equally as impressive.  I can't speak on those too much as the OST is just coming out, whereas I've blasted all of the VN's tracks on repeat multiple times, but the soft ambience of them in the background of certain scenes adds so much to the it.  Re-Awake is one of the best tracks in all of anime.\\n\\n\r\nTeal Deer, it's fitting that Mozart and Salieri are brought up in Steins;Gate 0, because the orchestra is a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of overall character growth, it can be summarized thusly;  is the character a main character?  Yes?  They are absolutely phenomenal.  Supporting?  They're going to range from forgettable to cringeworthy.  Everyone brings up Kagari, but I actually like the way that Kagari was handled in the anime (it's a hell of an improvement of the dumpster fire that she was in the VN, with the exception of Promised Rinascimento and Recursive Mother Goose.)  But Ruka and Faris take so much of a backseat that it hurts.  Ruka is salvaged in the end, but Faris was my favorite character in the original after a certain point, and to see her go from such a compelling character to yuri bait just made me want to send a D-Mail to prevent the writer of 0's story from being born.  Fubuki and Kaede weren't huge part in the VN, but they did SOMETHING.  They're completely forgettable in the anime, and they pretty much are forgotten about too.\\n\\n\r\nBut as for the main cast, all of them got significant character growth.  Seeing the rise, fall, and rise again of Okabe Rintaro was amazing, and the interactions with him and Suzuha and seeing them both taken to their lowest points was so heavy and their interactions were fantastic.  I'm torn between Daru and Mayuri as the MVPs of the series because the story of their paternal and maternal relationships with their children was great character growth and all around heartwarming.  And then we've got the two newcomers from America, Hiyajo \"Legal Loli FTW\" Maho, and Alexis \"Where are the Shaman Girls, Lintahlo?\" Leskinen.  There is an all around interesting dynamic between them, and great comedy and insane plot twists regarding the two characters.\\n\\n\r\nTeal Deer, while the supporting cast does not live up to the precedent set by the original, the main characters got just as much, if not more growth in 0.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment, aka the only score that matters:\\n\\n\r\nI am really torn on Steins;Gate 0.  It never was going to live up to the standard that the original made, simply because Steins;Gate is not only one of the best anime and visual novels, but sci-fi story and fiction in general.  So I simultaneously feel that I am nitpicking 0 and giving it way too many free passes at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nThe skinny is that 0 is amazing.  Very few anime of recent years had me anxiously looking at my clock to wait for the next episode.  Even at the low points of the story, 0 always had my engagement.  I haven't cried this much from an anime this year since I finished A Place Further Than the Universe.  \\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 is a paradox.  It is a (inter)sequel to a story that had a definitive and conclusive ending, but it somehow adds to the story in a way that doesn't retread old ground or completely screw up continuity and adds so much to it.  One of the worst things about the original's story was the ending, but 0 turned what was a Deus Ex Machina asspull to keep the OTP alive, and turned it into a long and arduous journey of suffering that made the happy ending of the original truly earned.\\n\\n\r\nTeal Deer, if you even remotely enjoyed the original Steins;Gate, rewatch the series chronologically, that is OG 1-22, 23b, 0 1-23, OG 23-25.  You will not regret it.\\n\\n\r\nEL.  PSY.  KONGROO.",

            "content": "Well, what a train-wreck. 18 episodes in and everything is dull, predictable and badly animated.\r\nThis episode contains big reveals which anyone saw coming from at least 5 episodes before, and some from episode 1 itself. The plot is absolutely predictable, the characters cannot connect 2 dots even if they were drawn in a piece of paper, and there is absolutely no tension.\r\nThe villains are obvious, their actions are obvious, how they get to know what they know is obvious, what they did was obvious. Characters die but come back to life just long enough to be convenient for the plot. How can they expect tocall this a thriller when there is nothing thrilling at all? Solid 3.\\n\\n\r\nArt is passable but the animation, especially during action scenes, is horrendous, to the point of breaking suspension of disbelief. People can dodge bullets shot from 10 soldiers surrounding them, missiles fly sideways, explosions break pass through items, etc. About a 4.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound effects are passable, but there are no memorable songs like in the first season. Honestly I give it a 4 because nothing is terribly bad either.\\n\\n\r\nOh... characters... where to even start... Feiris, Rukako and most of them show absolutely no character growth or even influence in the stort. Maho has a cute design  but aside from that she's just a scientist with an inferiority complex, still shallow. Okabe is stuck in a depression that seems to flare up only when the plot needs it the most, with no tangible consequences after that. Suzuha and Daru get a lot of screen time, with cute father-daughter moments. Suzuha is my favourite character and she keep being my best girl of the series. Some growth and conflict are presented, being the second best character of this season. Daru is the only character I really see as being explored a little more, showing growth. The villains, as I said before, are obvious and chlich\u00e9 in many ways, not even worth a lengthy discussion. All in all, I give it a 4.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is just a mess of shallow characters, weak music, bad animation and appaling, predictable, story. I cannot enjoy this travesty of a thriller.\\n\r\nOverall, 3.",

            "content": "Man, my feelings toward this anime- though mostly positive- are extremely complicated, which isn\u2019t helped by the fact that I played the visual novel first. So get your popcorn, cuz this review\u2019s gonna be a while! Also, there will be spoilers regarding the original Steins;Gate in this review, since you\u2019re supposed to have played/watched it first anyway.\r\nStory- 9/10: So first, I need to establish context for this anime since no official description of it helps in that regard. Remember episode 23 of the original series, when Okarin was about to give up on saving Kurisu? Right then and there, he obtained a video D-Mail fromhimself 15 years in the future who disclosed the instructions to reach the ultimate happy worldline, Steins Gate. Steins;Gate 0 is THAT Okarin\u2019s story- the Okarin who will have sent that video- picking up from a 3-4 month timeskip after the whole incident with him having murdered his loved one. Technically, Steins;Gate 0 is the second half of the full Steins;Gate story that was skipped over in the original, due to Steins;Gate 0\u2019s own plot cancelling itself out (from OG Okarin\u2019s perspective) through the video D-Mail having been sent.\\n\\n\r\nRight away there is the issue of the visual novel\u2019s own structure. The original Steins;Gate was really easy to adapt since it was extremely linear for a traditional VN, and most of the endings were crap. Steins;Gate 0 is more like that type of VN which goes on several diverging and significantly different paths, most of which are integral for the overarching narrative. So, White Fox didn\u2019t JUST have to worry about truncating the walls of text, but ALSO re-ordering the ENTIRE plot structure to work in a linear, cohesive manner.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the most part, they succeeded.\\n\\n\r\nThe events play out extremely well. Heck, they went the extra mile and adapted the various tie-in drama CDs and one of the few instances of genuinely good anime original content as well. They even fixed a good number of issues present in the original. Simulcasting this show was a blast, even as a VN player, because there was still some room for throwing me for a loop. \\n\\n\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t perfect. There were still a COUPLE of scenes that just do not mesh together as one linear arc, no matter how you slice it. It was still probably the best case scenario, so I didn\u2019t mind those incoherent hiccups that much.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing about Steins;Gate 0 in general is that science takes a backseat in this one. By either some dumb miracle, meticulous planning, or plot convenience, there\u2019s nothing new to learn, science-wise in this series. I know the description alludes to some kind of AI program, but that program is made using the same technology that went into the time leap machine from the original series. In fact, it\u2019s even simpler than that contraption was! The real issue is that we never get to learn how they actually got to build a true, physically working time machine, so that one is forever filed under the \u201cspace magic\u201d category.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for how they handled the VN\u2019s notoriously loose and anti-climactic ultimate ending, let me just say\u2026 that they actually freakin\u2019 did it! As in, they did it WELL!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9/10: The characters are where Steins;Gate 0 shines (for the most part). We get to see full closure to Okarin and others\u2019 character arcs, and a couple of newcomers.\\n\\n\r\nOkarin in this series is now a \u201csad scientist\u201d, a dejected Okarin who turns a blind eye to the impending doom of the Beta worldline. We also have a new form of Suzuha, who is much colder due to war, compared to the Alpha worldlines\u2019 Part-Time Warrior. In addition, we see Daru actually taking on a much more serious role than before. The characters are amazing* and it\u2019ll make you realize who the true Best Girl of Steins;Gate is.\\n\\n\r\n*I put this footnote here because the \u201camazing\u201d isn\u2019t ENTIRELY true. First off, we have three of Mayuri\u2019s friends who were only just names in the original, actually appearing. They\u2019re bricks. Even though one of them is Suzuha\u2019s future mom, they don\u2019t really do anything of much importance. Also, due to the nature of the adaptation, a couple of characters who are legitimately likeable in the VN are now either crap, or they end up having no purpose AT ALL. (Poor Judy\u2026)\\n\\n\r\nArt- Budget/10: This is where my issues start to arise with the anime adaptation of Steins;Gate 0. The 2011 anime blew me away with an artstyle that wasn\u2019t quite as detailed as the VN, but still had a Steins;Gate-like film noir style that I loved. There was also a lot of brilliant post-production with the lighting as well as a lot of smooth animation uncharacteristic of most TV anime. Even in 2018, it hasn\u2019t aged a day.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, a follow-up that AIRED in 2018 already shows more age than the original. Look, I\u2019m not blaming the production team. I can tell that they tried. They were likely lacking in funds. It\u2019s jarring how cheap parts of this show look.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s mostly jarring only to VN players. The VN had some jaw-dropping artwork that make most of the anime\u2019s renditions of these scenes look like crap. But again, if you didn\u2019t even SEE that artwork to begin with, it shouldn\u2019t bother you much (at least they executed THAT scene well).\\n\\n\r\nBut even from an anime-only perspective, there are clear hiccups (*cough* episodes 17-18 *cough*). Although the art gets significantly better towards the bitter end, I know that the prospect of having to watch 80% of a crappy anime just to get to the good stuff is not a popular one.\\n\\n\r\nThese hiccups will bother you depending on how much you care about the visual presentation of anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10/10: At least THIS is the same. We all know these seiyuus, and they\u2019re excellent. Their performances (at least, of the ones who were central characters) were absolutely impeccable. It\u2019s kind of sad that this anime is probably going to be their final performances as these characters\u2026 I wonder how they feel about that prospect right now. But if it IS their last time, then they definitely went out in a blaze of glory!\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is- unlike the inconsistency of the first anime- entirely VN soundtracks. That\u2019s good, since the original music is stellar to begin with, and White Fox knew as much.\\n\\n\r\nThe new anisongs composed for this adaptation aren\u2019t bad either. While no \u201cHacking to the Gate\u201d, the new OP \u201cFatima\u201d feels much more urgent due to the usage of a ticking clock throughout the track- a clock that\u2019s ticking down to the inevitable start of World War III (at least I\u2019m assuming that was the intention of it).\\n\\n\r\nZwei\u2019s \u201cLast Game\u201d is gut-wrenching, especially when you see a million Kyoumas shatter into pieces. Kurisu\u2019s seiyuu also performs a techno-rock song called \u201cWorld Line\u201d which is also pretty good. However, these two ED\u2019s should\u2019ve been flip-flopped, given the circumstances of the first and second cours (with the latter being way more emotional). Or, they should\u2019ve kept \u201cLast Game\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10: This anime had so much potential to surpass the source material, and it arguably DOES in those last four episodes. But I\u2019m sorry, the artwork and the lower quality of the first 19 episodes just really jarred me. The two versions of S;G 0 have very different strengths and weaknesses to where I would say that they become equally viable. I didn\u2019t mind that the VN had plot holes without the drama CDs since most (key word: most) of it could be derived from context anyway.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I will insist that you get your Bachelor\u2019s degree in Steins;Gate-ology. There were so many comments and criticisms on the boards when this was airing from people who clearly didn\u2019t get the rudimentary basics of Steins;Gate, and they made me cringe. There are also a lot of subtle call backs that you will need to acknowledge in order to fully enjoy and understand the show.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, this is the second half of the Steins;Gate story, which gives full closure to the characters that the original was not able to provide. Just ask yourself, \u201cHow much do I care about the visual presentation of anime?\u201d If you do care, then maybe you should stray away from the anime version and play the VN instead. And if you ALREADY played it, then watch the anime since it\u2019s still really well executed in its own unique way (although it still looks like crap).",

For me, it was the perfect anime. \r\nNever have I gotten shivers so often like I did while watching this.\r\nEven though it's just an adaptation of a game - thus this anime gives us one of the most beautiful and at the same time shocking stories I've ever seen in my life. It shows us, that time and space is a thing that no human should ever touch or change, because if done, it'll have horrific consequences.\r\nIt is also showing us the beautiful,funny and amazing relationship between the protagonist and his friends and his suffering of his lost friend Makise Kurisu, who sacrificed herself for the sake of a 'perfect' world line. \\n\r\nBut Okabe begins to notice, that there's much more wrong with this world line than promised.\\n\r\nSo, he and also some of his friends begin to search for the Steins;Gate, the perfect world line. \\n\r\nThe plot in this anime is amazingly picturfied and ist so intense, every single second until the end of the last episode.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Character\\n\\n\r\nIt is without any doubt my favourite artstyle of all anime out there.

            "content": "READ THIS BEFORE STARTING - Everything here written is my original review of the anime, and I still stand by my points and stance of this series and everything I said doesn't have any lesser meaning and can also be applied to many different contexts throughout the anime. I have a mini evaluation at the end which I have wrote after seeing the series, so if you have already seen my review, then feel free to read that.\r\nAs of right now, I have only seen 6 episodes of steins;gate, and I will most likely update this review either when the series is over, or myopinions in this dramatically change, there WILL BE SPOILERS (For up to episode 6) in this so beware if you are reading and haven't yet watched the anime. Also, bare in mind this is just my opinion (and definitely not a perfect one) while reading, I can understand if other people feel differently and I am just stating my thoughts about this subjectively great anime.\\n\\n\r\nLet me start this off by doing what every other generic reviewer does (because my writing structure is pretty horrific) and begin by rating the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9:\\n\\n\r\nNow, so far we have had a few 'calm' episodes where Okabe basically meets the new cast, which starts off very wholesome and has a pretty positive mood to it. The pacing of the anime in the starting episodes is nice and consistent with interactions of all the characters just so we are able to get to know them and see our major cast for the anime. Amadeus is discovered, Okabe gets mini-flashbacks but nothing too dramatic, which is good because it is easing the viewers into the darker turns I am sure this anime will take. After that, things pick up a bit with the (re)introduction of Moeka which is the first major surprise I would say. It was quite obvious she was going to turn up but the haphazardness of her actually appearing was refreshing because we knew that the story was picking up quicker than previously - which I believe is a good thing as we already know most of the characters. After this Okabe becomes a bit more isolated and is distrusting towards Moeka, which is to be expected. Then the search for Mayuri's daughter begins with what I can only describe as a solid pace, they don't dwindle on this for too long but still make it appear like effort was put in to try and find her and some more interactions between Moeka and Okabe which in turn allows Okabe to be a bit more trusting towards her, probably forgetting his past with her for at least a brief while (something I see as a mistake that I can pick up on). Then we move onto episode 6 where we get to see characters being more interesting and having separate motives by being pretty vague which I enjoy, it makes you think which is what a Psychological anime should make you do, things like Mr Braun on his phone while having his worries for Nae raises a question of whether he is the villain in this situation, and the suspicious professor who eyed up Mayuri's daughter, so now there is lots for a viewer to think about, then at the end of the episode, what can only be remembered as the rounders from steins;gate show up with their guns just after Okabe and Suzaha realise what is going on, then we are left with another cliffhanger, which gives us more to think about as a viewer, and this is great for me and others who love to theorize about what is going on. All in all (so far), this series' story has been systematic and consistent with a nice balance of seemingly happy situations and others where Okabe begins remembering things but desperately tries to block that away and continue with his life - the 'sad' situations.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10:\\n\\n\r\nNow, I don't believe there is much for me to say here. Apart from a few minor issues like the intro having Kurisu with 4 fingers for like 3 frames, which has been fixed as far as I'm aware, and some, lets say interesting facial expressions, it has been very good so far! The animation flows well and the faces are used really appropriately to show how each character is feeling, like when Mayuri is worried, and when Leskinen is simply enjoying himself, or when Suzaha is agitated - it all shows really well, especially if someone like me can pick up on it! The art style is literally the same as steins;gate so there's not much change in my opinions of it being a pleasant art style capable of showing a variety of emotions through body movements and expressions. Well done to White Fox on this one!\\n\\n\r\nSound 10:\\n\\n\r\nI've heard quite a few people say that the sound is nowhere near as good as the original, but I beg to differ. The background music during certain scenes is used really well to create the ideal atmospheric setting, whether it be at the parties that they have or when Okabe is having another flashback, the OST really doesn't fail to deliver on this one with deep, heavy sounds for dramatic moments and cheerful tines for the more lighthearted moments. One thing I did pick up on is the sounds that the character's make, like when it is simply Mayuri going 'Ahhh...' with glee instantly tells me about her current feelings and emotions, and her feelings to other characters on the room with the added facial expressions and where she looks. And also when Okabe howls at the end of episode 3, this gave me goosebumps, not gonna lie. You could really feel all of his emotions through that one bellow and it was a very dramatic one to say the least; well done to the VA there! The other things I have to address would be the intro and outro. Now, the OP is pretty vague but has a very nice beat to it so I don't really have any complaints there, but the ED is where the sound really shines. This ED is really eerie and mysterious which a soothing voice, almost like whispering to a child at the beginning - very ominous. These feelings show very well with the distress of Okabe during the series, and how he never truly knows what's going on, with himself or others around him, he is confused and this ED conveys that near perfectly, it is very nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10:\\n\\n\r\nAs with art, not really too much to say here apart from the rather interesting new ones and certain old ones. Mayuri is her usual happy self, with characters like Nae being the same as well. Suzaha is concerned with Okabe and how he is going about things, and she seems to have lost a bit of trust in him and the definitely aren't on the best of terms so there is a constant theme of awkwardness and agitation when both are on screen. Okabe starts off pretty care-free until meeting Amadeus, and then after he simply acts cautious of him and his surroundings and detaches himself from others out of fear and probably concern; he doesn't want people to experience the pain he is going through and wants to carry the burden himself. This is a very clever way of showing us, the viewers, how Okabe is slowly drifting back to his old stubborn ways and we know nothing good comes of this so already we know that he hasn't really moved on or advanced as a person as a result of this. Now, the new characters which I'll speak about are Amadeus Kurisu, Maho and Leskinen. Amadeus Kurisu obviously resembles steins;gate Kurisu a lot with her being a bit cold at first the quickly growing friendly towards Okabe through the time they speak, she has all her distinguishable features present and is represented well enough for the anime. Maho is Kurisu's university associate and is also fairly cold to Okabe - similar to Kurisu - but then becomes a bit more friendlier. She hasn't had too much in depth development, but she is quite oblivious as to what is going on around her with people like Okabe and Suzaha and the rounders etc. so it'll be interesting to see her develop as a character. Now onto Leskinen. he is definitely one quirky character who has a lot of fun with things like jokes, but seems to keep a lot to himself and never really 'speaks out' like the other characters, so that's already raised a bit of suspicion with me, especially with his involvement with the other mysterious American professor so I'll be keeping my eye on him for now, he seems a bit shady which is good because now I focus a lot on him whenever he is on screen, which gives me more things to think about making my experience a lot more interesting and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10:\\n\\n\r\nSo far, with everything I've said, I have to say I may be enjoying this a little too much. There are a few things I haven't addressed, like Daru's involvement with his wife-to-be and some other things, but if I spoke about everything then I'd be here for quite a while, the topics I have spoken about are the most important to me and my enjoyment of this series, with the addition of interesting characters, very interesting development of old characters, a solid story and a perfectly fitting OST, this is definitely going to be one of my favorite anime's and I just cannot wait for more, especially after that cliffhanger on episode 6, I feel like everything's about to get a lot more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nPS: This is my first ever review, so please be a bit more forgiving if I have made any mistakes! Thank you!\\n\\n\r\nEDIT - OK, I have now finished everything and I must say, I have thoroughly enjoyed this series; regardless of others opinions. That final episode was extremely well put together and was a beautiful way to wrap up this series and leave a smile on my face. There really isn't much for me to say, apart from if you haven't seen it I would highly recommend (after watching the original series), I found this series extremely satisfying and interesting to watch and hope that others have (and will) too. I said at the end of my original review everything was about to get a lot more interesting and let me tell you; it REALLY does. If you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? And if you have, I hope you share the same opinions as me - or at least respect my thoughts!",

            "content": "As someone who played the visual novel, I can say that this is a better version of the game (so far)\r\nI will keep this short. Potential spoiler as of episode 5-6. Do not worry.\r\nThis takes place in the Beta world line where Kurisu is dead and cannot be saved (episode 24 does not exist, theoretically). We get to see Okabe going through depression as he loses the woman he loves to protect his childhood friend who he shares precious memories with.\r\nStory-10\r\nThis is not a random story, it is hinted in the original (and the VN more vividly) about Kurisu's project in the US, we gota more explored version here, and it doesn't need to rely on Okabe building a time machine rather other organizations having access to time machines since it was leaked through Kurisutina's father.\\n\r\nIt is going to be an interesting ride to see how every character grows into something amazing and breaking out of their shells, trust me on this.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nIt kept the same style which makes it Steins;Gate, but there are some inconsistencies which resulted with some cheap animation and still frames but I can deal with it, there are moments with high quality animation, as long as it will be fixed in the blu-ray.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10 \\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 has a stronger and stellar OST compared to the original, it features remixes and unique memorable sounds like the original to make it stand out, at least to me.\\n\r\nIt also fits the theme perfectly well and used correctly for dramatic or sadness emotions etc the director knows what he is doing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9/10\\n\r\nI would say a 9-10 since we didn't see everyone develop yet but the old cast are pretty much the same and Amadeus is basically Kurisu but with less sass at times which is hilarious and nostalgia to the original.\\n\r\nPlus the new characters aren't bad, like Fubuki who is secretly Chie from Persona. You have Judy and Maho and the Finnish Alexis professor who are all fleshed out and we get a general sense.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\r\nObviously since I finished the VN, I know what is going to happen and I am pleased since White Fox managed to fix many many errors and wrong doings from the VN and made the anime much better experience, trust my words, they replaced scenes and shortened it and kept the memorable moments. It turned out perfect with great directing skills so far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10 \\n\r\nSo far, it managed to make me feel pretty depressed and we got to see more Amadeus and she has a personality unlike the VN.\\n\r\nThe anime is doing a much better job and I am pleased.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: I will not be comparing this to the VN whatsoever, just the fact that it is a bit different in how it's layed out. It's to be expected though; trying to cram the enormous VN into a 23 episode anime was going to be impossible. Also I expect you to fully know what happened in the original Steins;Gate\r\n****This is a Spoiler Free Review*****\r\nIt's finally back. The awe inspiring, sometimes dramatic, sometimes light-hearted, sometimes tear inducing rollercoaster of a series is back to take you on an another journey. \r\nWith a continuation of a plot from season 1's \"sad ending\", the depressing conflicts of OkabeRintarou's emotions will once again have you engaged like no other. Can he change the outcome by reaching Steins;Gate? Will he return to the \"mad scientist\" we all know and love? \\n\\n\r\nLike the previous adaptation, the sequel starts off rather slowly, however, we already see the differences, primarily in our main character. Whereas he was an exciting, funny, and overly dramatic character in season 1, he is now former shell of himself.\\n\r\nDepressed and conflicted over how he couldn't change the inevitable, we see that the \"Okarin\" we knew has changed. The change is well done in every aspect, from mannersims to voice acting to even the attire (white lab coat to black attire). To me, this was the focal point of the new adaptation: the inner conflicts of Okarin- whether to attempt to change the outcome once again or live life with the constant guilt of not being able to save Kurisu.\\n\\n\r\nThe story telling is generally well done. For the lovers of the original series- Fear not, for they have all the elements you loved about S;G in the sequel as well. This adaptation will still give you a false sense of hope only to yank it away from you with a twist, so no worries. \\n\r\nAlso, one of the best things about Steins;Gate series is that they know how to incorporate both humour and light hearted moments with the dark and serious. Now, whether you like these mini \"fanservice\" moments or not are up to you. However, they don't really ruin the story. \\n\r\nAs it is known for, the plot twists and the intense drama are all great, although maybe not as good as the original. The action scenes are sometimes pretty nonsensical, but thankfully Steins;Gate is not primarily about action. Like the original however, it gets dark and depressing real quick, with many episodes dedicated to drawing those feels out. As I've said, once it begins, it just keeps going and going.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling, there are couple of plot holes and rushing here and there. It could just be an effect of trying to cram in too much in just a 2 cour, but they could've handled some plot points better for sure, because it can get confusing. \\n\r\nOne thing I did think the White Fox handled well was adding much needed extra material to where the VN didn't. It is a small, but refreshing change.\\n\\n\r\nThe old characters are all lovable like before. Depressed Okarin is amazing and just made us want that comeback even more. Mayuri showed a lot more character and development here than in the original. Her emotions towards the changed Okarin is just simply heart wrenching. What surprised me however was Daru, and how he was a lot more serious and mature-like at some points(particularly from ep.16 and beyond). Suzuha is also as dynamic and serious as before.\\n\\n\r\nThe new characters are good, but not great, maybe a little generic. Maho, the \"legal loli\" as Daru would like to say, is very fun to watch in her interactions with Okarin and others. She is playful, emotional, but still strong willed. She was clearly the best of the new bunch. Amadeus is an AI version of Kurisu's memories before she came to Japan. It retains Kurisu's personalities, from her tsundereness to her playfulness. Dr. Leskinen, one of the developers of Amadeus, is a nice addition from America, with the absolute best pronunciation of \"Rintaloh\". Kagari (no spoilers), can be a little annoying at times, but is still an essential part to the story. Yuki also brought out more variety of emotions from Daru and Suzuha. \\n\r\nHonestly, I can't say too much of some of them without some heavy spoilers. Overall, the new characters aren't outstanding, but most of them do enhance the story and other characters in some way. Some, however, have very little presence unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters, the voice acting is absolutely fantastic. In fact, I thought it was even better than the ones in the game. It was very dynamic, with intense emotions where necessary. Ep.16 will tell you just how good the VA is, but it was constantly amazing throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is ranging from decent to good, not great. The action scenes can get very clunky, and it can get a bit confusing at times. There were direction issues here and there especially with faster scenes. Honestly, it's a good thing that S;G is not primarily an action anime, because if there is one complaint I have with the anime series is that it's action scenes are rather ehh.. Otherwise I thought the rest were fine.\\n\r\nOne thing I do love about the series in general is the dark tone/color it has throughout to accompany the darkness of the story. It just fits so well.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing I have to mention is how good the music is. The opening and two endings are all amazing. Just go listen to the first ending, it to me, is one of the best ending themes ever (no bias). The instrumental osts are all great. Some of them are remixed from the original, while some are new, but they all accompany the scenes very well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, although not as good as the original (it is hard to reach that standard tbf), I thought that Steins;Gate 0 was still excellent. The humour, the raw emotions, the development, and the plot twists makes this a nice sequel. If you are a S;G fan, you will enjoy the sequel as well. \\n\\n\r\nEl Psy Congroo.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I dropped this series at Episode 12 while it was still in the process of being released, however over the past week I have gone back and re-watched it (dubbed, which helps for me), and I've got to say that I was way too critical of my original review, and that it turned out to be a very enjoyable experience for me.\r\nPlease note that this review contains some spoilers, for both Steins;Gate 0 and the original Steins;Gate.\r\nSteins;Gate 0 takes place after an alternate version of Episode 23 of the original, where instead of slapping Okabe, Mayuri begs for Okabe to stop trying because of howmiserable he is after his failed attempt at saving Makise Kurisu. This goes through the events that eventually loop back around to Mayuri and Okabe convincing their past selves to go through with the original plan to save Kurisu.\\n\\n\r\nI found that Zero ended up being very similar to the original Steins;Gate, in that the first half or so was more or less \"good\" and didn't have a lot of particularly impactful scenes, but the latter half ends up being fantastic and completely tugs at every emotional string.\\n\\n\r\nKagari was originally a character I disliked and found annoying and useless, however in the latter half she quickly became, in my mind, a very interesting and complete character that I only wish would have been given a little more backstory. I also originally didn't care that much for Maho, she almost felt like just a random character meant to fill the void of Kurisu and to become the target of \"CUTE LOLI AWWW\" jokes throughout the show, but she actually turned into a very great and well written character in the end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNotes about the individual ratings:\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9: \\n\r\nTurned out to be much better than I originally thought, I thoroughly enjoyed the story on my re-watch, especially the second half, even if I did notice some minor problems and thought a couple of things could have been done better.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7: \\n\r\nSteins;Gate never had that stellar or consistent animation, however it was noticeably better and more consistent in Zero. I especially notice that the tendency for character's heads to be off-model was resolved with Zero.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8: \\n\r\nThey re-use a lot of the same background music and sound effects, but they're memorable and great either way. I've always loved the Steins;Gate soundtrack so I was perfectly happy getting to listen to it again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9: \\n\r\nI ended up absolutely loving every single major character and many character interactions. There were several partnerships and alliances I never thought would happen, and seeing certain characters stay good and not back-stab Okabe or the others was excellent.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10: \\n\r\nIt's more Steins;Gate, my favorite anime of all time, and thus I enjoyed Zero on the second watch through completely and fully.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.0/10\\n\r\nMassively improved upon completion and dubbing of the series.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Depression;Gate 0: An Unserious Review\r\nThe heart wrenching, time looping, mind melting titan of anime has returned, and holy gel-nanas does it deliver. In case it needs saying, this series only makes sense after watching the original season and the \u201cDivide by Zero\u201d alternate episode 23. Do yourself a favour and make sure you\u2019ve seen that suffer-fest before delving into this one.\r\nSteins;Gate 0 feels so very much like the original. The cast are as lovable as ever, the tone can switch from light to dark in an instant, and the world line theory is still just as absorbing. But the real separation between this series andits predecessor is a very noticeable hole in the shape of two personalities: Makise Kurisu and Hououin Kyouma.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the original creates character tension by pitting these two against each other, Zero accomplishes the same by simply highlighting their absence. Shadows of Kurisu\u2019s presence remain in the form of her lab colleague Hiyajo, and Amadeus, the AI based off her pre-Japan memories. As for Kyouma, he remains locked away inside Rintaro\u2019s mind, buried under layers of fear and regret. Zero plays on this absence time and time again. There are so many references to things lost that it\u2019s no wonder Rintaro can\u2019t get a hold of himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe story re-treads much of the same ground. The early episodes feel like the heady days of gel-nanas, Alpacaman and too-too-roo! But it\u2019s a false happiness marred by a painful past and a terrible, inevitable future. And after a few personal crises and interventions by \u201cThe Organisation,\u201d the members of the Future Gadget Laboratory get their lab coats into gear to thwart World War III once again. It\u2019s all very familiar, but with a much darker, less optimistic feel.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pin down the central theme of the show, I would say that many of the characters have trouble facing up to reality. Okabe Rintaro is the obvious example: he\u2019s so far-gone that he\u2019s willing to abandon Hououin Kyouma, his research, his lab, and his past, all while consciously forgetting about the apocalypse to come. But there are others. Super Hax0r Daru and the ever-adorable Mayushii have similar hurdles to overcome. Only when their delusions are banished can these characters grow and achieve their potential.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 doesn\u2019t manage to innovate in the same way as its predecessor, but the way it builds on its past makes it a worthy successor to one of the greatest anime titles of all time.\\n\r\nMission accomplished.

            "content": "Keep in mind this is my first review of any anime.\r\nSo Steins;Gate 0 is the continuation of episode 23b of Steins;Gate. I personally love Steins;Gate for everything, from the animation to the soundtrack. So I wasn't sure if I was happy it got a sequel, or an inquel or whatever you wanna call it.\r\nStory - 10\r\nSteins;Gate 0 continues on a world line where Kurisu dies and Mayuri lives. Due to this choice, Okabe Rintaro is depressed and trying to find a way through the dark. The story progresses quite fast compared to S;G, and introduces characters way faster. What makes the story outstanding and excitingis that the ending is already set. Which is reaching the world line Steins;Gate. What makes it exciting is how they get there, and where will we get our mad scientist back.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe artwork is very similar to S;G, with some slight changes. If it weren't for the action scenes the artwork would be a solid 10. But this is where S;G 0 falls short. Action scenes aren't where S;G 0 shines, the scenes are poorly executed and falls short for the expectations. Other than the action scenes the rest is a solid 10/10, everything from facial expressions to animation is just spot on.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in S;G 0 is almost the same as S;G with some new ones, but it's still great. The emotional music \"Believe me\" is just so great. I could go on for hours just about that one soundtrack but, you know... It really caught up at the end, where they used their music so perfect, it's just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nFollowing the characters from S;G they're still the good old characters we all love. Every single character has a great story, especially our main characters. The character development is just spot on while it keeps the same vibe as our characters from S;G. Nothing more to say about, it's just great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nIf you've watched S;G you'll enjoy S;G 0 a lot. It's one of those animes where once you've watched, you wish that you could forget it and just rewatch it again with the same feeling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n",

            "content": "The original steins;gate is my favourite show of all time so to for me a follow up to that series would have an incredibly difficult task ahead of it. Personally i believe that steins;gate 0 did an incredible job of, in my opinion, matching up with the original. \r\nAll the characters of this show are so lovingly developed and well written that i think there is not a single character I dislike or think is even remotely poorly written. From the main characters to the considerably smaller ones, (such as Ruka and Feyris) every one feels real and has real depth to them to thepoint that minor characters in SG are far better than most main characters in a lot of other popular anime and manga. Where in many other shows, episodes which focus on just chara can seem dull to me, in Steins;gate I always welcome the chance to watch these characters I love interact with one another and develop further, something which 0 does regularly, and brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in terms of story is also, in my opinion, absolutely fantastic. Despite sometimes being able to predict what will happened next, the writing still frequently manages to suprise me and make me want to see more. In a world where time travel stories are not by any means rare and very often clich\u00e9 and poorly put together, steins;gate is a brilliant example of the type of story you can tell with time travel which is emotional and exciting. \\n\\n\r\nNever have I watched anything that had caused me to have to wipe tears from my eyes one minute and later in the episode make me grin with joy. I truly love both steins;gate and steins;gate 0 and that is not something I say lightly. It is my favourite anime and probably science fiction story I have seen and if you haven't watched it please, please do you will not regret it. Its absence will be very noticeable and I will miss it a great deal. \\n\r\nEl Psy Congroo",

            "content": "Spoilers for Steins;Gate anime and Steins;Gate 0 (1-6) ahead....\r\n. \r\n. \r\n. \r\n. \r\n. \r\n. \r\nSome context: Stines;Gate 0 takes place after episode 26 of the original Steins;Gate after Okabe came back from the past for the first time after trying to save Kurisu and failing resulting in her dying. In the first anime Suzuha shows Okabe a video from him in the future, where he tells himself what to do in order to save Kurisu. A great ending btw.\r\nSteins;Gate 0 continues after Okabe failed for the first time (This anime is like the dark stuff that was needed for the perfect ending of Steins;Gate). Hisfail results in him getting depressed and deciding to leave \u201cHououin Kyouma\u201d as part of his past, he doesn\u2019t go to the lab for a while and tries to leave a normal life as he dosnt want to even think about the death of Kurisu.\\n\\n\r\nOkabe meets Maho Hiyajou and Professor Leskinen at conference about AI and also discovers that Kurisu\u2019s memory had been transferred into an experimental AI before she died (very lucky if you ask me). After this Okabe is given the opportunity to talk with the AI of Kurisu on his phone. An important detail is that Kurisus memory was copied into the AI before she had met Okabe so she doesn\u2019t recognize him but Okabe does. (He gets kinda nostalgic after meeting Kurisu)\\n\r\nAfter this Okabe and Hiyajou keep meeting, in a personal and professional manner. (Professor Liskinen keeps mocking Maho about getting with Okabe, noice)\\n\\n\r\nEnough from Okabe. About Suzuha, she is mad with Okabe for not trying to save Kurisu and giving up as a \u201cscientist\u201d, this affects her relationship with him (this is understandable, because honestly Okabe did give up pretty easily). All of the other members seem to be the same as before. Well now we have new characters like Maho and Kagari. \\n\\n\r\nWell we are revealed that Suzuha didn\u2019t travel alone to the past but also with a child, Shiina Suzuha (Why wouldn\u2019t you tell a detail so fukin important earlier).\\n\\n\r\nAs for now Steins;Gate 0 is a 10/10. I think what makes this anime fun to watch is the little jokes and details that are in each episode. The main story is always great and blows your mind in an unexpected way. The only think that is driving me nuts are the fukin cliffhangers, every fukin episode man. But as for the actual anime it continues with the Steins;Gate mood art style and comedy. \\n\\n\r\nSo far the anime is great 10/10",

To start, I knew MAGES had a really good visual novel, Steins;Gate, and it was well-rounded enough that the background story surrounding Steins;Gate 0 was already written before even concluding it. I think they did an excellent job, but they played it a little too safe. Nothing huge happened. Nothing impactful happened. All that I can deduce from Steins;Gate 0 is that it could have been funded for two 25 episode seasons in order to explore its world. More fun things could have happened during that timeand also the backstory could have been enhanced for the audience to understand what was going behind the scenes. Yes, the Steins;Gate 0 anime is just a rushed VN adaptation and we all know that right? Well, that's just my take on what could have been. As I've said, it was good but not as shocking as the first Steins;Gate. In more positive words, I especially liked Steins;Gate 0 because of Maho Hiyajo, the openings and endings, and episode 23. All in all, MAGES had one chance in writing a good prequel to Steins;Gate, as well as WHITE FOX did for the anime.

            "content": "*WARNING! As a massive Steins;Gate fan, I'm going to try to keep it as objective as I can. Keep in mind that Steins;Gate is my personal favorite anime.*\r\nI went into this show with big expectations. I had watched the original Steins;Gate multiple times and couldn't be more excited. Now the question is....Was it worth the wait? And was it any good? I'll tell you exactly how good it is. \r\nStory ~ 9/10\r\nFrom beginning to end I was invested in the story and I was curious what would happen every next episode. Obviously it's based on a Light Novel, so it's not an original story. Imyself haven't seen the LN, so everything I saw was new to me. I may be biased, because the original Steins';Gate is my favorite anime ever. Nonetheless, the 'sequel' to an almost perfect anime was great in its own way (storywise). I have to admit some episodes are better than others (like the original series) and it wasn't easy to keep up with all the world lines and events. Therefore I can't give it any higher than a 9 (which is high enough).\\n\\n\r\nArt ~ 9/10 \\n\r\nIn general the artstyle for Steins;Gate 0 was great, but in some episodes it wasn't as good as in others. For example, the action sequences in episode 17 could've been better (yes I'm aware it's not an action series).\\n\\n\r\nSound ~ 10/10\\n\r\nI rarely give a 10 for an anime soundtrack, but damn it blew me away. From Lyra (episode 8 end theme) to Gate of Steiner (episode 23 end theme). I would say the music for 0 is equally as good as the original Steins;Gate's music. Just mind-blowing!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ~ 9/10\\n\r\nThe only reason I give a 9, is because Makise Kurisu is an amazing character. Don't get me wrong Okabe, Mayuri, Daru, Suzuha, Maho and Kagari are all interesting characters. The problem with S;G 0 is that the chemistry between the main characters is lacking in comparison to the original series. I loved every single episode of the original, because the interaction between Okabe, Kurisu, Daru and Mayuri is so well-done. Yes we did get Amadeus as a replacement, but we all know a computer-program has nothing on the real Makise Kurisu. Episode 8 is the living proof of that. The only episode where we get to see Kurisu for a long period and it was one of the best Steins;Gate episodes (in my opinion). I still enjoyed seeing Okabe slowly turning back into his old self, but it isn't nearly as good as the chemistry between Okabe and Kurisu. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ~ 10/10\\n\r\nThere's no other anime that I can enjoy as much as I enjoy Steins;Gate. Every episode grabs my atention and reminds me of why I love Steins;Gate as much I do. \\n\r\nIf you haven't watched the original, don't even bother watching 0. If you do decide to watch the original after 0, then keep in mind that you will most probably won't understand anything about the story. To anyone who has watched Steins;Gate or is currently watching it, I highly suggest you watch Steins;Gate 0.\\n\\n\r\nOverall ~ 9/10 \\n\r\nI tried to be as objective as possible, but you can probably tell I'm really biased since I gave the original a 10/10. Still I enjoyed the shit out of Steins;Gate 0 and I hope the OVA will be as good as the original OVA. Now I'm off to save my grades in the future before my parents unleash world war III on me!\\n\\n\r\nEl Psy Kongroo!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The development team behind the original Steins;Gate aimed for a rate of 99% science and 1% fantasy. \r\nI\u2019m not sure what the anime staff for Steins;Gate 0 were going for, but if I were to guess, it would be 84% rule of cool, 15% fantasy and 2% science. \r\nIf you paid attention, you probably noticed that those numbers do not add up. That\u2019s on purpose, because Steins;Gate 0 doesn\u2019t really care about making sense or not, and whether you notice those things and let them bug you is entirely up to you. \r\nThe amateurish team behind the series had to adapt a non-linear Visual Novelthat had many routes, each with its own plot points and own character development. As a result, the history was divided into arcs, while still having the main story going on, but not focusing entirely in any of them. If it sounds a bit messy, it\u2019s because it is.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show has many plot points that may or may not begin a story arc, and the viewer is never too sure to what he should be focusing on. For once, you might think Amadeus and AI is the main theme of the series, only for it to be forgotten for a while to focus on conspiracies and information warfare, which is then put aside so they can tell a story about amnesia. Then everything comes together near the end in a very messy way. \\n\r\nAlong with the awkward pacing and dubious writing, it becomes just too confusing for the viewer to keep track of everything that is going on.\\n\r\nMy biggest issue with it are the many dropped plot points, but there's so much going on that most people will just forget about them. \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the soundtrack for this series is basically just the game tracks that play whenever the sound director felt like. By itself, the soundtrack is amazing, but its usage here is boring and uncreative. As a matter of comparison, the original series hardly had a game song come up, and most of the episode\u2019s duration were dead silent, with only background noise going on. This created an amazing atmosphere for the series. \\n\r\nIt is the complete opposite here though. In almost every scene there is a track playing in the background. It\u2019s not trying to create an atmosphere or anything like that. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the directing, it is mediocre and very amateurish, as expected of the staff for this show. By itself, that wouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem, but when it tries to do something \u201cdifferent\u201d it comes out jerky and very distracting, along with the poor animation that really becomes an issue on action scenes. It\u2019s hard to enjoy and take them serious when everything moves like a malfunctioning robot. They even try to do some clever tricks to hide the bad animation, like zooming in a shot to simulate movement, or do shaky camera, but the result is straight up laughable. \\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, the show does have some good moments. The first half is watchable, actually improving some stuff from the source material, and episode 8 was amazing for me. The character interactions are great and heart-warming, but can get a little too fan service-ish. \\n\r\nAs the story progresses, more is introduced and it becomes hard to follow. Maybe even the staff was having a hard time following it, since the show straight up forget some plot points or never really go anywhere with them. It gets exceptionally hard to watch towards the end, as it has some of the wackiest and inconsistent directing I\u2019ve seen in a anime, with visuals that make no sense and are only trying to be cool. It also have some plot holes, which is ambiguous given the nature of the series, but I still believe that there are some plot holes here and there even considering that. \\n\\n\r\nAs for how the plot progresses, its conveniences goes as far as changing a character personality or making them act in a way that they never would just so that the story can flow, almost as if the staff couldn\u2019t think of a better way to do it. Sometimes I felt like there were no \u201crules\u201d and anything could happen. \\n\\n\r\nIt also tries to do drama, and I think it did a good job the first time, with a good build up and an excellent setting, but maybe it got too confident because of it, and the other times are not as good. However, it gets to a point where it desperately attempts to make you cry. It\u2019s so blatantly obvious and pathetic that you can\u2019t get sad. In fact, you might even laugh. The poor animation and awkward directing just make it worst.\\n\\n\r\nFor most people, this show will be disappointing. That\u2019s expected, as the original set the bar so high. Steins;Gate 0 tries to reach that bar, but the lack of a competent staff like the original and all its flaws makes it impossible to do so. This end up being just a 23-episode long fan service series. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end, if you\u2019re able to ignore, excuse, or simply don\u2019t notice those things, you might enjoy Steins;Gate 0. \\n\\n\r\n(And with that said (and If you read until here), excuse my grammar errors and poor writing. This is my first (and possibly last) review.\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever wanted to see a main protagonist who\u2019s constantly tried to save the world, experienced years upon grief and despair only for him to realise how meaningless it is, reside to his fate and eventually give up? Well your in luck because that\u2019s what Steins; Gate 0 is about!  \r\nBy saying that, How does one write another compelling, complex story about time travel to a beloved & acclaimed franchise without making it feel like another rehash of the Fate series? You strip away everything the fans loved about the original:\r\nOkabe\u2019s self proclaimed, eccentric mad scientist persona \u2018Houoin Kyouma\u2019- Gone\r\nMakise Kurisu- Gone\r\nTons oflighthearted, fun moments and character interactions between the lab members- Gone (don\u2019t worry there\u2019s still a lot, I\u2019d just argue not as many)\\n\\n\r\nThen watch how the characters deal with this situation and slowly try regain all the past experiences & characters you loved as the story progresses. The quality in storytelling, characters, comedy, drama, time travel and overall writing is still the same, but it\u2019s a lot more mature, tragic and melancholy than the original. \\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10):\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 takes place after the events of Episode 23 of Steins;Gate, where instead of Okabe succeeding in rescuing Makise Kurisu, he fails to do so and thus doesn't reach \"Steins Gate\". It\u2019s the spiritual \u201calternative future sequel\u201d route that connects the story in a intricate way.\u2028\u2028 What makes Steins;Gate 0 great is the time travelling, mystey, the character interactions/relationships, plot twists, the amazing character moments and the emotions it evokes, and the character\u2019s personal growth over the course of the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\\n\r\nThe characters are still the same and we get a lot of character development for our lab members, especially Okabe & Mayushi. Unfortunately, Moeka and Farris do seem to have taken a back seat in this route, but honestly it\u2019s not a problem because I love Okabe\u2019s development even moreso. By stripping away everything that Okabe cares about and turning him into a shell of his former self, humanised him. We\u2019re no longer seeing the mad scientist Houoin Kyouma, but the man, Okabe. \\n\\n\r\nDue to the traumatic experiences of time travel, years of grief and despair, Okabe has accepted his consequences and abides by his decision to never time travel again because it\u2019s impossible to change Makise/Mayushi\u2019s fate. \\n\r\nThis shift in Okabe\u2019s personality is the inevitable outcome of his predicament, forcing him to forsaken his Houoin Kyouma persona and become a respectable, mature member of society. While Okabe comes across as a \u2018normal\u2019 person that\u2019s moved on from Kurisu\u2019s death, we\u2019re slowly shown his layers and find out that he\u2019s become a shell of his former self, unable to fully move on. \\n\\n\r\nIn a sense, you\u2019re supposed to empathise with Okabe\u2019s inner struggle, his desperation in wanting to save a loved one that he still carries memories for, but knowing it could end another\u2019s life.\u2028\u2028 As the story progresses and Okabe is pulled back into the world of time travel and secret organizations, he gradually regains his childish, chuunibyou fire that he thought went out years ago. Through the influence of Okabe\u2019s friends, he develops a new drive to stop World War III from happening, save those he cares about and find Steins Gate- a world line where both Kurisu and Mayushi live, and we are celebrated in a big blazing glory with Okabe\u2019s rebirth!\\n\\n\r\nMayushi\u2019s development and growth is done exceptionally well. No more spoiling, but I\u2019m really impressed in how she comes into her own as a important lab member.  \\n\\n\r\nWe get some new more additions to the cast, such as: Kagari, Amadeus, the Professor and Maho who are fleshed out well and receive a lot of character development. \\n\\n\r\nAmadeus is a A.I. programme based off Kurisu\u2019s memories. It serves as a device to help our lab members, moves the plot forward and gives the viewer the Kurisu fan service we desperately need, without fully replacing her character. \\n\\n\r\nMaho Hiyajo\u2019s role serves as a \u201creplacement,\u201d as the new genius girl / potential love interest loli (who\u2019s slight tsundere), who once supervised Kurisu. \\n\\n\r\nI absolutely love Maho. Her interactions with Okabe, the Professor and the lab members are fun, but what really appeals to me about her character is how well crafted she is and the nuanced, complex relationship she had with Kurisu. The problem with Maho is: she\u2019s not as captivating, beautiful or smart as Kurisu. Maho has messy hair and has no real sense of fashion. Okabe is concerned about her, but his world doesn\u2019t revolve around Maho in the same way it did with Kurisu. She can\u2019t fill the place of Kurisu because she\u2019s not good enough and Maho understands this herself, as it\u2019s emphasized throughout the series.\\n\r\nMaho\u2019s inferiority complex (and somewhat jealousy) stems from feelings of \u201cmediocrity\u201d compared to her intelligent, talented kohai scientist Kurisu, which is magnificently compared to the historic composers- Antonio Salieri and Mozart. \\n\\n\r\nThe analogies are done purposefully, for example Maho\u2019s introduced visiting Japan with the Professor to work on Mozart. Amadeus is ironically the middle name of Mozart and the name of an Oscar-winning film that focused on their rivalry.\\n\\n\r\nKagari plays a significant role in this route due to the mystery surrounding her identity, the brainwashing and her relationship with Mayushi. Her design is similar to Kurisu, which adds to the mastery xD\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10):\\n\r\nI love Steins; Gate 0 almost as much as the original. It\u2019s another masterpiece in time travel, excellent comedy and drama, that is woven into a cohesive intricate  story. It pulls so well on your emotions that you can\u2019t help but feeling swept away at times, like during Okabe\u2019s rebirth. It baffles me how there\u2019s so many reviews with low ratings. I feel those people don\u2019t understand the purpose of this story is basically Okabe \u201cregaining everything he once lost\u201d so when they watched S;G 0 they expected it to be just like Steins Gate.",

            "content": "Review in brief: Steins;Gate 0 is a rough showing in a much beloved series that goes from cringey to alright to bad at the drop of a hat for its entire duration with few exceptions.  It\u2019s not without its moments, but they\u2019re so few and far between that it bears a serious question: \u201cIs this story worth being told?\u201d  Unless depression, memes, and a handful of clich\u00e9s can hold your interest over the vast majority of the anime an honest \u201cyes\u201d will be hard to give.\r\n**This review assumes that you\u2019ve watched the original Steins;Gate.  Inevitable comparisons will be made, but the focuswill only be on Steins;Gate 0 and what is necessary to explain it.**\\n\\n\r\nReview in full: Welcome to the beta attractor field, where resident sad scientist Okabe Rintaro makes a half-hearted go at preventing inevitable calamity by talking to an AI, helping an amnesiac, and generally being depressed in his all-black clothes.  The viewer is expected to already know how this story begins and ends; it\u2019s the story of how Okabe gets over his failures, refuses to let the world become a dystopia/perpetual warzone, and forges the plan to save Kurisu and reach Steins Gate.  That said, as far as Steins;Gate 0 is concerned, the story itself is almost completely the first of those three parts, i.e. the story of how Okabe gets PTSD from remembering Moeka\u2019s existence for a while and rarely breaks out of his defeatism & submission to fate.  As such, Okabe\u2019s depression is not well-handled and isn\u2019t an entertaining story either unless depression is your guilty pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nOf course the Steins;Gate series is no stranger to initially slow plots, but there are key differences here.  The original\u2019s slow start was acceptable and even enjoyable for many because it was a slowly-unfolding tale about some weirdos messing around with alternate timelines using a machine built with a cell phone, a microwave that turned bananas into green jelly, mental instability, and the landlord\u2019s 42\u201d CRT TV (without permission).  It was a plot that invited silliness while working with many mysterious & genuinely-intriguing facets until things got serious in a sudden twist that was subtly hinted at, but surely wouldn\u2019t happen in such a silly slice-of-life.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 doesn\u2019t have this start (or middle) at all.  The audience already knows there\u2019s time travel involved, so we get an AI that merely serves as a plot device and side character instead of working as the dynamic element time travel was and is in the series.  Instead of building odd gadgets, Okabe and his friends reflect on how useless they feel while not finishing odd gadgets. Okabe is so depressed that it rubs off on Mayuri in certain ways, leaving a heavily flanderized Faris, barely-existent Nae, Prof. Alexis \u201cMeme-Machine\u201d Leskinen, and sometimes Daru to \u201cspice things up\u201d with randomness, memes, references to Steins;Gate, old Steins;Gate memes, Daru\u2019s gentleman pervert antics, a K-On! reference, and sometimes even an actual joke.  Some may find said humor decent enough for what it is, but those who expect more than references and \u201cle random\u201d tier memery could easily find it unable to balance the anime\u2019s overarching aura of depression.\\n\\n\r\nThe slow part of the anime drags on until roughly episode 18, leaving much less room for the thriller aspect Steins;Gate 0 clearly wants to replicate.  Even so the \u201cheavy\u201d parts of the story miss their mark more often than they hit.  A blatantly-flagged carbon copy of one of the original Steins;Gate\u2019s events serves as a total mockery, soldiers often have such bad accuracy and combat awareness that they make storm troopers look like SEAL Team 6, the villain reveal can be seen from a mile away and plays out like a bad fan faction, and plenty more that is too spoilery to bring up.  It\u2019s not helped by the regular use of \u201caction scenes\u201d, effectively slide-shows with slightly-moving images in most cases interspersed with awkward breaks for dramatic dialogue mid-fight.\\n\\n\r\nThese are interlaced with numerous plot contrivances & inconsistencies, enough to make the attentive viewer start to consider if this is actually a side story in an alternate universe with different rules.  Time travel itself bends its consistency, with events that ought to result in paradox yet don\u2019t, plus the explanation as to why the Time Leap Machine was limited to two days (because beyond that point the user\u2019s mental state would be too different, resulting in likely damage) is ignored at times.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not all bad news though, as there are still a handful of standout serious moments to be had.  One unexpected twist brings developments that add to the overall story and blunts the anime\u2019s initial angst to a degree.  Getting to see just how other characters cope (or struggle to cope) with Kurisu\u2019s death, Okabe\u2019s resulting depression, and other similar & related events shows us sides of characters like Daru & Mayuri that hadn\u2019t been touched upon much prior.  Finally, there is a point where the show somewhat refreshes itself, and though it may be too little too late for those truly expecting a thriller, it results in some memorable moments that hold some small amount of merit, all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nSuch moments of merit are likely enough to remind a viewer who was otherwise put-off by other parts of the anime why they decided to watch it in the first place, or perhaps even the Steins;Gate series as a whole.  More forgiving (or ignorant) fans could very well remember the anime based on these moments, which will likely be mentioned many times over to defend the anime and show that there are indeed clear & valid reasons to rate it highly.  Unfortunately, someone watching with their brain turned on runs a high risk of having their rose-tinted glasses broken early on (if they had them to begin with).  Steins;Gate 0 relies heavily on nostalgia to deliver its impact and stick a fair portion of its humor, leading to a glaring issue for many ~ that it does little to stand on its own two feet.  Large portions of it effectively work as fanservice, and someone expecting an anime that is good on its own won\u2019t have much to point to in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSuch is the conclusion I have come to in regards to Steins;Gate 0, though there are other aspects of the anime to mention for the sake of completeness.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned there are issues involving the visual quality.  White Fox clearly didn\u2019t put as much budget into this as they did with Steins;Gate 7 years ago.  The amount of animation is minimized to a point where even someone such as myself who doesn\u2019t view animation as a highly important quality in an anime (if it helps tell the story it\u2019s usually good enough for me) was left wanting more of it.  The picture quality itself is simply average, save the occasional derp face (which leaks of the Blu-Ray release indicate as the main aspect being touched up post-airing).\\n\\n\r\nThe stylistic flare the original Steins;Gate had is not present here, and most frames are merely standard for the purpose of animating dialogue accompanied with basic motion ~90% of the time.  Character (re)designs come with two \"quirks\".  First, you have Okabe's all-black attire, because clearly we aren't smart enough to tell that he's depressed.  Second, it turns out that the B in beta attractor field stands for \u201cbreast expansion\u201d as the returning female cast grew by one or two cup sizes.  Less focus on plot, more focus on \u201cplot\u201d, sounds like a normal day in anime land.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio quality fares better, partially thanks to returning elements such as certain talented seiyuu and some of Steins;Gate\u2019s noteworthy soundtrack.  The new songs are distinguishable from each other, fitting for their usage, fit the reused compositions, and make use of a passable leitmotif.  The OP & standard EDs don\u2019t hold up as well, though the special EDs are a nice touch.  Voicework is a mixed bag, with some voices done very well despite the circumstances within the show (including the voices for Mayuri, Daru, & Maho considering the varied emotions they experience).  At the same time Amadeus (Kurisu) always sounds like she\u2019s been awake for two days straight and Okabe\u2019s actor was clearly enthused to be voicing him again, so much so that it\u2019s noticeable at times and in ways where \u201centhused\u201d isn\u2019t how Okabe is portrayed (and can be overbearing in scenes where he is).\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of portrayals, Steins;Gate 0 has some highlights and some issues with how it handles characterization.  It features a sizable cast, sizable enough to where it can\u2019t put enough attention into all of the cast to give everyone a clear purpose.  Faris is there because why not, Ruka is there so that Okabe feels more stressed in two scenes and for the obligatory \u201cbut he\u2019s a guy\u201d joke, Mayuri\u2019s cosplaying friends only exist because one develops a plot hook that is mentioned twice and left unused & forgotten, and another is Daru\u2019s future wife.  There\u2019s also the unfortunate case of Kagari, whose subplot is split into three chunks, always coming in just when something else seems to actually be starting up, and never wraps up all of its loose ends, rendering her as little more than an annoyingly used plot device that totally looks just like Kurisu if you ignore her ridiculous bust.\\n\\n\r\nSome characters turn out quite well though.  Mayuri & Daru are given plenty of serious moments to develop and/or flesh out, which better establishes why they are crucial to Okabe and his journeys.  They end up taking responsibilities Okabe shrugs off in his depression, filling larger roles as lab members than simply \u201csuper hacker\u201d and \u201cperceptive tuturuu-chan\u201d.  As for new characters, Maho could easily be accused of being a fill-in Kurisu, but she has her own character and while she could have used more attention the developments involving her tend to be better rather than worse, and Prof. Leskinen makes an effective foil for her when he\u2019s not busy being Meme Man.\\n\\n\r\nThat leaves Okabe himself.  For all of his depressive moping in the story, he does slowly develop his way through in chunks, and the Okabe that formed the plan to deceive the world is made known.  However, this development simply mirrors the last stage of his development in the original Steins;Gate across 23 episodes instead of the 2-3 it originally took.  It\u2019s nice to see where he ends up, but mostly only because the anime dragged its feet every step of the way there.  It\u2019s not entirely bad by the end, but a rewatch of Steins;Gate will do the same thing in a much better way.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Steins;Gate 0 is an unfortunate case of producers going for the cheap method of low cost & appealing to nostalgia to make a profit, as evidenced by the stunted production values, repeated use of old memes, and dry plot that overstays its welcome.  It\u2019s only on brief occasions that this anime partially digs itself out of that quagmire, much like Okabe with his depression.  It does have moments of merit deep down, but it's buried under so much junk that I can't quite say it's enough to make the experience worthwhile.  It takes a certain kind of person to forgive the multitude of flaws in Steins;Gate 0, someone I couldn't reasonably expect anyone to be.",

The last episode showed us how things could have gone if they'd followed the script. Unfortunately they pretty much failed to justify mashing all of the routes together (there was enough space to animate everything in the proper order, so why?) and added some extra ridiculousness (a certain scene that I don't want to spoil was REALLY AMAZING in the VN but just alright here) on top of that that disappointed me to no end, so I'm just left here feeling empty.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose it could have been worse - non VN readers will still prolly see it as pretty decent, and the underlying idea is still damn amazing.

            "content": "Steins;Gate 0 was awesome. Although, the feeling was quite different than when I saw Steins;Gate. This anime had some emotional scenes and it really moved me, but there was also some thrilling action and suspense which I liked.\r\nStory: The story was great. The idea of storing human memories and using it as an AI, was an incredible concept. The development of the story was good - the moment when everything gets heated up was perfect. The shift of time and the change of plot was abrupt, and sometimes a bit confusing, but that's what make this anime full of suspense and I liked it. Ialso liked the ending when Okabe goes to rescue Mayuri and Suzuha.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The anime art was marvelous. Everything - towns, buildings, vehicles, characters - were appropriately designed. I also liked the art during the opening.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound was perfect - character voices, gun firing, vehicles running - was most appropriate. I liked the opening theme too - it was rocking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There were some new characters introduced like Maho Hiyajo, Prof. Leskinen, Yuki and most surprising was Kagari's character - for one instant I thought it was Kurisu (or her daughter?).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story was good and I enjoyed it. However, I still have one doubt - who is Kagari and why she looks like Kurisu?",

We haven't seen the dark side on Steins;Gate, but if we were to see the effects of Okarin quitting, then you're in for a dark treat.\r\nStory: \r\nI gave the story a 9. It was close to being one of those shows which had a better prequel(or was it a sequel?) than the OG, although, the only complaint I have is the ending. I feel like there is something missing. Don't get me wrong, the finale is good, but then, like, what are thepurpose of Reyes' sketchy cameos? Is it all for like, nothing? I know she did something in the other routes, but not in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n7...

No doubt in my mind that this follow up of the original made me laugh, smile, emotional, almost got me crying (I never cry), and most importantly HAPPY. The story captured me, the art is like the original, do not get me going with the SOUNDTRACK it's a must.The character development from our sad scientist and his comrades our amazing, influential, and heartbreaking to see them go :(. I ENJOYED THIS ANIME SO MUCH AND ITS SO SAD TO WATCH ANOTHER GREAT ANIME leave. This anime is unique, creative, and very very psychological. PLEASE WATCH THIS!!!!",

            "content": "his review contains spoilers for Steins; Gate\r\nI only very recently completed the original Steins;Gate -. Steins;Gate 0 had already begun airing by the time I finished my binge-watch of the first series. Watching the two shows back-to-back, I can say that Steins;Gate 0 is a worthy successor (kind of) to the 2011 masterpiece.\r\nI was excited just by the very premise of the show. Serving as a midquel (though you could argue that it's both a sequel and prequel (it's confusing, as time travel stories are)), the show follows an alternate outcome of episode 23 known as 23B, denoting it as the beta worldline. If yourecall, in the original episode 23 Okabe becomes depressed after his failure to save Kurisu. He refuses to try again, but finds his resolve once Mayuri slaps sense into him. He then views a video sent to him from the future. 23B sets up the alternate timeline where Mayuri doesn\u2019t convince Okabe to try again. This timeline is the one in which Okabe records the video for his past self to view.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s not vital, I recommend viewing 23B before watching 0. Furthermore, I do not recommend watching this show before Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Steins; Gate, OVA, 23B, then Steins; Gate 0, a possible watch order is Steins; Gate episode 1-22, 23B, Steins; Gate 0,episode 23, episode 24, then the OVA. Steins; Gate opens up a new level of depth to Steins;Gate saga that fans are sure to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nLike the original show, Steins; Gate follows Okabe Rintaro. In his depression,he\u2019s retired the persona of Hououin Kyouma. It\u2019s harrowing to see the difference. In 0, we see the depression he suffered in the original series taken to its logical extreme, and while it gives the show an air of dismalness, it\u2019s quite interesting. You can even see the difference in clothing - with Kyouma of course sporting his white lab coat and Okabe donning a pitch black outfit.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters you love all return for 0 with their personalities intact. Given that their personalities are the same, it\u2019s always interesting to see how they interact with a completely different Okabe. While some characters (such as Faris) have slightly reduced roles, others (such as Moeka) enjoy more screen time. There are also some new characters thrown into the mix to keep the story fresh. Among these are the amnesiac Kagari and Hiyajo Maho, a former colleague of Kurisu\u2019s who\u2019s still reeling from her death. A character that many won\u2019t expect even makes an appearance down the line.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art direction is beautiful as ever. While there are some hiccups in action scenes, these don\u2019t really detract from the experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is still top-notch Their placement helped make certain scenes that much more poignant. The new opening and ending themes are up there with the original. Tracks such as Gate of Steiner make a return, further tying together the shows while providing emotional gut punches.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of gut-punches, let\u2019s talk about the story. It\u2019s great, but it\u2019s important to note that 0 doesn\u2019t really have the same \u201cpunch\u201d that Steins;Gate did. The first half is often stated to be slow, then episode twelve throws viewers for a loop with the sudden slaying of Mayuri. I want to emphasis that viewers shouldn\u2019t go into 0 expecting this same type of \u201cdrop.\u201d If they do, they\u2019ll just have the feeling of holding their breath for water that may not ever come. The big twists have already came, with Steins;Gate 0 dealing with their aftershocks. While this may make the show less \u201cshocking\u201d than its predecessor, it ensures that the feeling of dread and anxiety is always present.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Steins;Gate 0, does have some swerves, they\u2019re just arguably not as impressive as the original\u2019s. Part of this is due to the plot, but part of this is simply due to already experiencing the emotional roller coaster that is Steins; Gate.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as things I don\u2019t like...they\u2019re aren\u2019t many. In fact, I can\u2019t really think of any. While the plot-twists arguably weren\u2019t as big as the original, the show is still quite tense. Despite the somber mood, the show still somehow manages to have its lighthearted moments. While this would normally detract from a story such as this, the creators know how to use it well, serving as a breath of fresh air, but never feeling intrusive. Given that viewers are expecting a foregone conclusion, it\u2019s quite telling that 0 still manages to be suspenseful.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I was inclined to state 0 as being slightly inferior to the original, there were parts towards that were even more awesome than the original series.",

The sequence is like no other of any anime out there, and adds time travel to allow the audience to make speculations about certain outcomes and world lines. \r\nOkabe Rintaro initially is a character who has given up on saving Makise Kurisu and goes on living as the average Joe along with Megumi, Ruka, and the others. He deals with his depression by manipulating himself into thinking that this is the best world line and he can't save Kurisu or the people affected by WW3\r\nThe ending ofthis anime goes beyond all of my expectations and blew me out of the water. In my opinion, this anime should take the overall place as #2 or even #1 as the best anime of all time.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The first thing I have to say about this midquel is that I believe it shouldn't be treated as a complete separate entity from the original series. I mean, this of course applies to most sequels or prequels, but in this particular case the series relies a lot on it's predecessor's work.\r\nSimilarly to Fate/Zero, this is a show that gains a lot from the previous knowledge about how things will actually end. We already knew about this timeline because of the ending of Steins;Gate, so there is no reason to watch this series if you are expecting it to be unpredictable: the point of watchingit is actually seeing how we will get there and, most importantly, how Okabe will grow in order to reach the conclusion already \"foreshadowed\" in the original series. \\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 focuses about the emotional journey of the characters, mostly the main protagonist, and the plot, however intricate, weird and full of confusing sci-fi science and alternate timelines, it's actually quite generic. There is nothing really groundbreaking about it, and it's not even as surprising and consistent as the plot of the original series. \\n\\n\r\nIt is, however, very well executed and fully serves it's purpose: setting an optimal ground for the characters to grow and develop. Even the closest character to being some sort of final villain is actually just some stereotype, and hardly any focus is given to him - which I don't consider a real negative, as he was never intended to be a really important character. He is pretty similar to Dr.Nakabachi from the original in this regard: some very generic antagonist figure inserted to progress the plot in order for the actual protagonists to fully develop.\\n\\n\r\nWith this I'm not saying that the series has some terrible, badly conceived and meaningless story: it is still pretty consistent and well thought out, as I didn't really notice any important plot hole despite how many things happened in these 23 episodes. It's just that if you are looking for an engaging, original and unpredictable story, I don't think this is the anime for you, as the plot itself is more secondary.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime fully relies on comunication and emotions. We see Okabe, pretty much depressed at this point, and how he is trying to go on with his life. He doesn't seem to be able to forget Kurisu, though, as proved by his interactions with Amadeus.\\n\r\nNow, here we go back to my previous point about how one should always have the original series in mind when watching Steins;Gate 0. Without the foundation of his \"previous persona\", this Okabe wouldn't really have left much of an impression on me: I've seen thousands of sad or depressed characters in fiction, thousands of characters who didn't know how to go on, thousands of characters who lost someone they loved or had a very hard life. \\n\r\nWhat makes this series really special is the contrast with its predecessor: it's exactly because I remember how funny, lively and crazy Okabe was as the \"mad scientist\" that his new behaviour ended up being very depressing for me. Everytime he struggled, everytime he suffered, everytime he acted in such a lifeless way and put up walls between him and his friends, every time he gave up and said that they shouldn't go against \"destiny\" : every single one of those times, I remembered how he used to act as Hououin Kyouma. And, personally, I think that this makes for a very powerful tragedy. Steins;Gate 0 is extremely heavy, and albeit some may say that the first part was way too slow, or that it could have been compressed in fewer episode, or that Okabe acted like a \"loser\" for way too long, I think that this is the best way in which his development could have been rapresented. \\n\r\nThe slower pace, the episodes seemingly devoid of events, the apparently useless scenes of interactions between the characters: all of that was essential for building up the tension, to make you really feel the misery, to give it more weight and make it more real - and it's precisely for this reason that the ending is all the more satysfing. Had the first part of the show really been shorter, had all the useless scenes been removed, the climax would have lost most of its weight. \\n\\n\r\nApart from Okabe, I found myself surprisingly attached to most of the cast, and I think that the secondary characters were developed way better compared to Steins;Gate. \\n\r\nIn the original series, most of the focus was just on Okabe and Kurisu, and the rest of the cast ended up being pretty one-dimensional in most cases, even if they still felt human because of the awesome narrative of the original series and the challenges they faced. \\n\r\nBut in Steins;Gate 0 they acquire a personality on their own, with a few exceptions. They don't want to be the support characters in the background anymore, but they actually act in the story - and this happens for a very simple reasons: because Okabe isn't acting anymore.\\n\r\nThe situation is inversed compared to the original series, and without Okabe and Kurisu leading the group, they have way more space to develop. Or, to say it better, they are forced to grow in order to make up for Okabe's absence.\\n\r\nThey become more real and humans, the most notable case being Mayuri, which finally abandons her previous role of \"victim\" and becomes way more relatable in her anguish and guilt, but also becomes an admirable person for how she faces them.\\n\r\nAnd while the basis of the characters remains very simple, as they are far from being complex and outstanding characters, they feel like humans. Not because they are 100% realistic, which they are not, but from an emotive standpoint. I'd also argue that what contributes the most to this aspect of the characters is how \"irrealistic\" they are: they are strong in mind and spirit, they overcome challenges that would drive crazy most people, and they sacrifice everything aiming for a vague \"utopia\" they wouldn't even experience themselves because the timeline would be rewritten. \\n\r\nThis strength, combined with the overall tone of the series, is what really makes this series so powerful and emotional. They are humans not because they always act in an human way, but because they often act like humans should try to act. They conveys human emotions in a real way, and that's what really make this series a masterpiece in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nI specified \"in my eyes\" because I doubt this could really be considered a masterpiece, as it has too many weak points to be called as such. \\n\r\nFor example, the actions scenes, which I thought were way \"too anime\" and contrasted with the overall feel of the series; or the whole plot around Kagari's character, which seemed kinda off and unnecessary. Not excusing the anime, but I'm pretty sure this problem is because it was somewhat too hard do adapt properly from the visual novel - but I won't really know until I'll play it myself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm not really an expert when it comes to tecnical aspects like animations or sound, so I won't talk too much about them, but I really liked the art style (it's pretty much like the art style of the original series, just kind of darker) and absolutely loved the osts, which really elevated most of the best scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, while I think that this series is quite far from being perfect and not as well thought out as Steins;Gate, from an emotional standpoint it's certainly one of the best anime I've ever watched, and I found it deeply passionate and cathartic. \\n\r\nIf you liked the first series, want some good feels and are interested in watching a very on point and poetic story about a deeply wounded character rising up from ashes, this is the anime for you.",

            "content": "(spoilers to Steins;Gate season 1)\r\nThis is my first review, any criticism would be great!\r\nSteins;Gate 0 a follow up of Steins;Gate is just as well crafted and genious as the first instalment. But it coveres multiple other themes that weren't really discused in the first one, like Artificial Intelegence, World Wars and including many new characters. \r\nThe Story is executed really well, with a red line that's easy to follow. One of the greater things i noticed in season 1 \"https://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins_Gate?q=steins%20gate\" was how you could watch through the whole series how you would normaly and really enjoy it, but then re-watch the whole series and seea whole new perspective, the first episode in season 1 is most noticable where just before 'Makise Kurisu' dies first you hear Okabe screaming from the same room, this only makes sense if you watch the whole first season and see Okabe going back in time to try to save Makise Kurisu. Similar things are found in 'Steins;Gate 0'\\n\\n\r\n\u2604\ufe0f10/10 Story\\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork for this anime is also very well done, but this series isn't specifically known for having the greatest art. It's good and not distracting and still has many sequences that show great graphic design.\\n\\n\r\n\u2604\ufe0f8/10 Art\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice overs are in my opinion better with an English Dub, which is rarely the case, but you can easily hear them having fun voicing their characters and really becoming a part of them. \\n\\n\r\n\u2604\ufe0f8/10 Sound\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Character development is one of the biggest part of the series, Makise Kurisu the brain behind the 'Time Machine', Okabe Rintarou the crazy scientist, Hashida Itaru the Pervy hacker and so on. Each character has their own flair. No single character is made out to be unnecessary. Everyone has a reason for being in the series.\\n\\n\r\n\u2604\ufe0f10/10 Character\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment watching this series was sky high all the time. Each episode goes further with the series, meaning no unnecessary fillers that don't mean anything at the end. Each episode you watch you learn something new you weren't aware of before, even if it's very subtle. \u00a8\\n\\n\r\n\u2604\ufe0f10/10 Enjoyment\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe overall rating for this series is 9.2/10.\\n\r\nI believe the series has one of the best stories in animes history with great characters and enjoyment watching it. Art and sound are also spectacular but aren't super outstanding. they are above avarage for sure and you can hear the People behind the voices really living themselves into the character. Like you could say. you don't rate a Fish by it's ability to climb a tree, this series doesn't need the greatest graphic design and smooth animation and sound for it to be super enjoyable to watch. The series consists of a lot of talking and progressing through a story.\\n\\n\r\n\u2604\ufe0f9.2/10 Overall\\n\\n",

            "content": "They've done it again!! From a series you wouldn't expect to succeed, because it comes from a VN and very few anime adaptations of VN's rarely go well, the original Steins;Gate blew my mind with how well put its story and dialogue is. And now comes its sequel, which I wasn't expecting much as well, considering how fleshed out the story was already but Studio White Fox somehow managed to pull it off! \r\nIf you've watched the original Steins;Gate and thoroughly enjoyed the series, I personally recommend you to watch this anime. This is an amazing feat of story-telling, to be able to expound somuch on a story which we know how it ends before-hand. Steins;Gate 0 manages to captivate its viewers once more with more insane time travel plots and shenanigans which drew you in when you watched the original. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to talk about the animation and art, it definitely had its flaws, some scenes were obviously rushed and there was even a delay in releasing one of the episodes. But the main draw of the show is obviously not the art, it's the story. No one actually watches Steins;Gate for the art (LOL), it's the concept of time travel and a tale of tragedy. \\n\\n\r\nIt's an amazing story which shows how the protagonist, Okabe Rinatorou rocked to the core with feelings of despair, depression, and sadness, was able to overcome these feelings, combined with a science-fiction setting of time travel which is crucial to the plot. With new key characters introduced, Steins;Gate 0 tells the untold story of the perils and tribulations Okabe Rintarou faced which story-wise takes place before the final episode of the original series, and time-wise most of the story occurs months after the original series. \\n\\n\r\nA mistake we often see in other stories of time-travel is that the premise of the setting exists however the theory of time-travel and the plot are rarely in connection, with the characters doing things for more personal reasons, such as in Back to the Future, the concept of time-travel is undermined, and the plot could have been resolved without time-travel at all, if Marty McFly simply had more self-control, the story would conclude and time-travel is nothing more than a tool they used to demonstrate the character's flaws and show his future if he continued with them, rather than being a key point in the story.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 successfully manages to successfully incorporate the science-fiction setting with its plot, just as it did with its prequel. As a sequel, it's very well written, not simply regurgitating the original series, but complementing it with new characters, and new subplots, accompanied with a great soundtrack which goes well with the mood of the scenes. A story which any true science-fiction fan will regret not watching.\\n\\n\r\nEl Psy Congroo",

Although the original Steins Gate was also really slow to start but this spin-off is just plain boring. Only time we are mildly interested is when it is referencing the previous show. \r\nThe biggest flaw of this spin-off is the character of Okabe Rintaru. He was a boisterous, obnoxious mad scientist in the original. But nowhe is just an empty shell. YES we get he is sad and all. But all his responses to others are\\n\r\n\"Well....\"\\n\r\n\"Aaagh....\"\\n\r\n\"No....\"\\n\r\n\"Its nothing\"\\n\\n\r\nHE IS LIKE AN MC OF A BADLY WRITTEN HENTAI WHO GETS CUCKED REPEATEDLY\\n\\n\r\nIt would have been fine for 1-2 episodes but it really gets on your nerves overtime.\\n\\n\r\nAll the great things of the original have been stripped off from this.

            "content": "Reminder: Watch Steins;Gate, then episode 23b, then start Steins;Gate 0.\r\nWhen I started 0, I was afraid it wasn't going to keep up the expectations. The original is probably the best anime ever and considered to be in the top 3 for several people... thankfully, it is as enjoyable as the original.\r\nStory: 9. Steins; Gate 0 takes place in an alternative timeline, called \"beta\", the one where Mayuri lives and Kurisu dies. So instead of approaching the Steins;Gate from \"alpha\" like the original did, the characters try to get there from the other path, chosen by Okabe in 23b. This is all perfect and genius, butsome parts are poorly explained or doesn't make 100% sense, and that's why it gets a 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.Excellent. The kind of animation used suits perfectly this anime. It's nothing stunning tho'. I wouldn't ask for more, but it could have done more.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8. You won't remember this anime for its music or sound effects, but there are some particular moments where the music is used brillantly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development: 10. You will discover a lot about almost every character, you will suffer with them, get happy with them and the ones with less emotional involvement, they already shone in Steins;Gate and now are still doing what they have to. Some characters will show an unexpected and very welcome side while others will express their emotions in ways you'd never imagine. The new characters are key to the plot and their personality is as good as the main original cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9. It's an extremely enjoyable sequel, with no bad dialogues and with tons of revelations, sadly, some of the most important ones are very predictable or are waaay too convenient, but they are still very pleasing to watch. It abuses some of the elements that were surprising in Steins;Gate and it's less original to its predecessor but those things don't ruin much the experience and once again, they show why this is the best series about time travel in any media.",

            "content": "Hello everyone, I have watch this far and am planning to give my first review. How could I say that there\u2019s anything wrong with this anime, this is one of my most favorite and it tells me why anime is great. \r\nSo the summary of the story: It is set in 2010 in Akihabara, Tokyo, and follows Rintaro Okabe, a self-proclaimed \"mad scientist\", who runs the \"Future Gadget Laboratory\" in an apartment together with his friends Mayuri Shiina and Itaru \"Daru\" Hashida. While attending a conference about time travel, Okabe finds the dead body of Kurisu Makise, a neuroscience researcher. They then experimented with thed-mails which could bring messages to the past within 48 hours.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I would say that this is one of the most interesting story found in anime that existed. A series that talks about time travel and sending messages from the past; who could dislike that idea. The story also includes so much research and human inspiration such as- John Titor, IBN 500, world war 3, CERN and many more. In the year 2000 there was a time traveler who came from the year 2036 and was said to warn people about the world war 3 that will kill 5.7 billion people around the world, and he is said to be the one to fix the y2k. CERN is a nuclear research organization created by the Europe; this is where Steins; Gate got inspired. With all of these said, I would say that the author is very resourceful and innovative.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is just amazing and it\u2019s not like the vn, it improve a lot. I\u2019m happy that it\u2019s not one of those anime with horrible character design and backgrounds (I\u2019m not gonna state those).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: An anime with several multi-characteristics characters. A tsundere- Makise Kurisu; a mad scientist- Okabe Rintarao; super Hacker and otaku- Daru. All of these characters combination creates a great anime with the perfect blend of their different roles and characteristics.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I have known Steins; Gate for a really long time but I always just ignore it. But I heard so much good ratings and comments and I decided to watch. And I said to myself, \u201cI am truly a baka, how could I never watch something this great, I have regretted until now.\u201d When I watch it, I finish the whole series in 2 days and when I was in episode 18, I was depressed because there were no more episodes. I want more, more. So I truly enjoyed this masterpiece and have nothing bad to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime in an instance became one of my top 5 favorite anime of all time. I had a good early impression and Steins; Gate never made me disappointed. I am just hoping for there to be another season. So that I could live in peace. \\n\\n\r\n~El Psy Congroo",

            "content": "Dark. Bitter sweet. Tragic. Brilliant. These are the words that leap out in trying to describe this show.\r\nStein;Gate 0 is (kind of) an alternate ending to original the Steins;Gate. If you are one of the very few who haven't seen the original Steins;Gate, do it. Now. Then watch this series. This review is spoiler free and aimed at those contemplating whether to watch this series.\r\nSeeing the Kyouma persona knocked out of Okabe, and therefore this series - removes much of the lighter feeling that the original had. This doesn't make this show any less engaging. Rather it trades comedy and light hearted moments for atragic wistfulness that I personally adore. This also isn't to say their aren't lighter moments, because there are - but overall there is a much greater overarching sense of loss, the shadow of a missing person. This makes Zero feel not like a repeat of the first season, but a depature - albeit one I'm sure we will see tie in to the first season nicely by its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThere are particularly beautiful allusions in the first episode, for instance we see Mayuri reach for the sky. Only now this is movingly appropriated to become a tragic symbol. This sets the tone for the series as a whole. If you don't like the sound of that, you may be inclined to enjoy this series less than the first. I however, love it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very much on par with season one, very well done. I personally have found the music to be unfortunately not quite as heart grabbing as the themes of season one. They have used variation on the musical themes of the original soundtrack - which I think is brilliant, only the execution so far hasn't grabbed me. There is still plenty of time left though for it to grow on me and for new themes to be introduced. The Opening and Closing are very good.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy an air of dark pathos in the context of a broader more epic story, then this show will speak your language. If you need lighter and comedic moments to get you through, then Steins;Gate 0 will not be your thing. I still however recommend this strongly to all anime fans.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Without having read the visual novel, it is evident they tried to fit too much stuff from the many routes in a 23 episode anime, leading to a mess and many things left unexplained, especially towards the end where they realised they didn't have many episodes left and that they had to wrap it up quickly. I assume this is also the reason that it has so many blatant plot holes.\r\n  The action scenes were stupid (looking at you Kagari...), the cliffhangers were unnecessary and insulting to the viewer, what little comedy there was didn't even manage to get a grin outof me most of the time, as it was either in the midst of serious scenes or had very little effort put into it.\\n\\n\r\n  The drama scenes ranged from ok to OMG LOOK HOW SAD/DRAMATIC THIS IS!!! OH NO THE MUSIC IS SO SAD/DRAMATIC YOU SHOULD BE CLENCHING YOUR BUTTOCKS/CRYING WATERFALLS!!1!!!!. Also, most monologues/philosophical ramblings were pretentious at best. Overall not very mature and insulting to my intelligence.\\n\\n\r\n  Most of the new characters had a little if not zero impact to the story and very little screen time. The one who received the most attention was Maho who remained pretty static throughout the show and I found myself not liking her for various reasons (trying not to spoil too much).Okabe later in the show had a turning moment that i felt was illogical/ happened way to quickly for plot's sake and for saving time. Because they tried to adapt too much from the novel, the characters suffered greatly in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n  More importantly, all the events we saw in this season could have been entirely ignored, since they don't amount to much as far as getting us to the point where HOUOUIN KYOUMA sends the message to his past self in the original Steins;gate. It was more like a side story than what I actually expected out of this anime, leading to further disappointment regarding the absolutely horrible ending.\\n\\n\r\n  The original Steins;gate had a few plot related things you could nitpick but the overall execution was excellent. Comedy was funny and drama was drama.It also wisely chose to omit various routes and details, instead of failling to fit them in 23 episodes like Steins;gate 0. Time travel is near impossible to write a good story with, but Steins;gate treaded carefully, whereas Steins;gate 0 was a mess and definitely not worth your time.   \\n\r\n  Maybe the visual novel is better \\_(\u30c4)_/.\\n\\n\\n\r\n  TL;DR \\n\r\n  Entire subplots left hanging, zero explanations, numerous plot holes, mediocre character and the ending makes zero sense. Rewatch Steins;gate and ignore this one.",

            "content": "Let me preempt this by saying two things: 1) This is my first review and 2) Steins;Gate (dub) is my favorite anime of all time.\r\nAt 14 episodes into the Steins;Gate 0 dub, I have to say, I am disheartened.  So disheartened that I felt compelled to write a review so that strangers on the internet could empathize and console me.\r\nThe original Steins;Gate stands out to me for several reasons.  For one, the dub is exceptional, as it is not a literal word-for-word translation but a localized and natural sounding one.  The voice actors have great chemistry and the dialogue flows in abelievable way.  Additionally, the main premise of the show (time travel) is compelling, well thought out, and believable within confines of the show's universe.  There are no Deus Ex Machina moments, just about everything that happens seems like a logical next step.  Lastly, and most importantly, the characters are unique and interesting.  And, for the most part, they behave as you would expect real people to when thrust into the extreme circumstances that they deal with.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0, as of episode 14, has failed where the original succeeded.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the dub, it feels stiff and forced.  Much of the dialogue is far too wordy (especially Daru), and even with John Michael Tatum reprising the role of Okabe, the chemistry just seems to have evaporated.  Even worse, the story can't seem to find a direction to take.  Are they trying to stop World War 3?  Or wait, no they are looking for Kagari.  Just kidding, they are developing an AI that acts like Kurisu.  Nope, they're just trying to time travel again.  Ahh no, that's it, Okabe is going to college in America!  Oh, and we can throw in some Moeka/Ferris fan service while we're at it!\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the most important point:  There are far, farrrr, to many characters that feel completely irrelevant, who seem to have their roles tacked in just because they were in season 1 or something similar.  Moeka, the private detective but everything else about her is exactly the same as the original show?  Or Ferris but now her outfit is even more ridiculous and she says more cat-related lines?  Mayuri, but she decided to stop being cute and instead turn the annoying factor up to 11.  And how about Amane, Kurushima, and Nakase?  3 additional characters that serve literally no purpose whatsoever except to get a couple blushes out of Daru.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the main characters (new and old) feel watered down and one dimensional.  Suzuha does karate and is worried about Kagari.  Okabe hates time travel and is always sad.  Hiyajou has some creepy obsession with Kurisu and Mozart...\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't caught on yet, so far I have found the show to be underwhelming.  While it started off great and has several good points (art, character design, animation), my excitement for more Steins;Gate has steadily dwindled since the first few episodes.  I'm sure that there will be some incredible twist to tie all of the disjointed pieces together in the end, but currently I am struggling to find a reason why I should care.  I find the idea of a world line where Okabe failed to save Kurisu extremely compelling, but in the words of Bilbo Baggins, the story to me \"feel[s] thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.\"  There are so many competing things going on, that I can't seem to find which is supposed to be the most important.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Time for one of my newer favorites! Steins;Gate is a show that explores technological breakthroughs and their consequences on a scale that (at least in my opinion) hasn't been explored. From the originality of the characters to the depth of the plot, this show has grown on me incredibly. It's safe to say I'm a firm believer in Steins Gate.\r\nThe show is brought to us originally from the visual novel game released in 2009. A manga was adapted by Yomi Sarachi the same year, which we didn't see in America until 2015. White Fox premiered an anime adaptation in 2011, and Funimation licensed it inNorth America that same year. \\n\\n\r\nToday we are talking about Steins;Gate 0 which started in April of this year. This is a preliminary review, as I have only seen half the season, I'm excited to give a final review in a YouTube video when my channel starts up, TUNE IN.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, enough self promotion. Here are some initial thoughts on the show!\\n\r\n- I feel like the art is better than the first season.\\n\r\n- Why is Okabe being an egg? I mean I get it.. but I don't\\n\r\n- Everyone is sus, there are no exceptions\\n\\n\r\nRemember: IF YOU DON'T CARE WHY I DO/ DON'T LIKE THIS SHOW, THEN SKIP TO THE END FOR MY FINAL RECOMMENDATION!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\n- Alright, some might think I'm giving this too high of praise, but lets be real, the concept is pretty damn awesome. I think it would be incredibly empty ended to not explore different world lines in a show about time traveling and world lines. Just me?\\n\r\nWe all had questions as to what would have happened had Okabe not made the decisions he did at the end of the first season. There's a new and important twist in each episode, and it keeps you hooked.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\n- I really like this show's art style. There's something about it that makes me think of early 2000 shows that are still some of our favorites. Like this show has been around longer than 2011. Kurisu's character is also almost like a beacon of the story because of the art, and I can appreciate the symbolism, even if no one else sees it that way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\n- I honestly don't have much to say about this aside from how good I think the voice acting for the characters is. I think the voice actors are perfectly suited for their characters. (I watch sub not dub).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\n- I feel like there's so much missing in the new season without Okabe's wacky alter ego. I understand that there is a valid reason for his character to have reached this wall, but I also feel like his disassociation with himself is a little too out of character. That's my only complaint about the characters, though. I like that we get to meet characters that were hinted at in the previous season, and that we get to see a different side of the previous story antagonists.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\n- The story is fantastic, and I love that the story explores outside of the main time line, while remaining connected seamlessly to the story. It's not hard to get back into the second season after watching the first. It's slower than the first season, but the story is just as enticing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10          FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Watch it/ Buy it\\n\r\n- The White Fox team and the directors, Hiroshi Hamasaki and Takuya Sat\u014d, should really pat themselves on the back. The show is available for legal streaming on many international platforms, but if you can't stream it legally, I highly suggest you buy it! It's completely worth it, and at least I will be finding my way back to this show for a second watch!\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for today, folks! I hope that I'm delivering the content you want! If I'm not, don't hesitate to let me know! I want to reach as large of an audience as possible with my reviews and hopefully expand out of writing! Let me know what you want to see if you aren't seeing it!\\n\\n\r\nHave a beautiful Friday, friends! As always, it's been a pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time,\\n\r\nCiao =^-^=\\n\\n\r\nAma_",

            "content": "As someone who did not think much of the original Steins;Gate series, I would call Steins;Gate 0 not only an improvement when compared to the original series, but a whole different show altogether.  \r\nIn comparison to the previous series, Steins;Gate 0 offers a deeper look into every aspect of the original show, including story, character, and appeal to the audience.  Steins;Gate 0 still does have some of the obvious hints that the original show had to plot development such as with the immediate suspicion of Professor Victor Chondria, but that is the only issue that remains at large.  Steins;Gate 0 fixes thelong and slow progress that the first show took, an issue that ruined the original series for me on some level.  The beginning of Steins;Gate 0 was efficient in presenting characters, conflict, and a story that is not overly complicated for someone who cannot recall everything that happened in the original series.  Steins;Gate 0 does still contain slight filler, but the filler typically helps in assisting the story or easing from the drama when appropriate - not to mention that the filler is spread out over the series in very time efficient manner.\\n\\n\r\nOkabe becomes a much more understandable and relatable character as he struggles with the fight between world lines and the unfortunate outcomes he has seen.  It was a nice change to hear Okabe's actual voice and thoughts.  Mayuri also gains a level of depth, something that I had been waiting for since the original series - I knew it was there, but a lot of people overlooked it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is an upgrade from the original series, with one of the most notable changes being the eyes of the characters.  Steins;Gate is known for its unique eyes, that always feel like they have a \"blankness\" to them (a contrast from other shows that I like to attribute to the blankness we have as people who can be manipulated through world lines).  The eyes in Steins;Gate Zero do not feel as empty however, which I find very appropriate considering the focusing on one timeline.  The lively eyes of Okabe pull the viewer into the story constantly and express his emotions very well.  Amadeus Kurisu's eyes are shown off with beautiful rainbow spectrum at times, but they also are more lively in general and work with the autonomous personality of the character.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is still shabby too for the fact that it is limited.  The theme of the show is played most of the time throughout the series, and works well, but it would be nice to hear some more recognizable and original music.  There has definitely been an improvement from last series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show was great.  The story progressed well, with several different conflicts presented, while none of them lasted too long.  The show pulled me in very well with the emotional appeal and continuous interest of what would happen next in the story.  My satisfaction in Steins;Gate 0 has convinced me to give the original series another try.  I highly recommend to give the second series a try, even if the first series was not your cup of tea!",

            "content": "I loved the original Stiens gate, a friend recommended it to me and after watching one episode, I put aside all other plans I had at the moment and finished the series in one sitting. \r\n Stiens Gate 0 is set in an alternate future where Okabe does not save Kurisu and becomes incredibly depressed. It's meant to patch one of the plot points near the end of the original series and does that exceptionally well for the most part. That said it is kind of a sequel so watching the original series is required viewing before watching this.\r\nThe story, for the most part, coversOkabe getting over his depression to so he can set in motion the steps to reach the real ending (i.e., the one in the original series). It full of twists and turns and I rather enjoyed the journey. Mind you I will say I was not as captivated with it as I was with the original series, but it was still enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to say my one problem with the series it how it handles the Mayuri; in the original series, Okabe and Mayuri seemed to have a familial love for each other, and I thought that was nice because what usually happens with the \"childhood friend \" trope is that it devolves into romantic love. Which in the original series their relationship stayed pretty much platonic and I thought that was a nice change of pace.  In Zero, unfortunately,  the show reverts her to that trope with her just being an unrequited love. I get that some people say the hints were there in the original series, but for me, I think that overall detracts from her character.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the dub; it was terrific as it was in the original with most if not all of the original Voice actors returning. I would recommend it as the primary way to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said Stiens Gate 0 was still an enjoyable experience I would recommend watching.",

            "content": "So here is the alternate version of my favorite anime, steins;gate 0\r\nI must first say right off the bat that steins;gate 0 isn't as great as the OG steins;gate. But it does not mean that it is bad. In fact, steins;gate 0 was one of the best thing a steins;gate 0 fan  could ask for. Let me get in detail .\r\nAlso, I have not played the visual novel so i am purely speaking on about how i felt the anime was,by itself and not comparing it with the VN..\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe story was something very fresh. Okabe, the MC, suffering from the past of thetime machine incident where he killed Makise and could'nt bring himself to try again, joined a college and tried to live a normal life. With the mad scientist, Houoin Kyouma gone, I must say i realized how much I liked the Cringy af character and how it impacted the story for me. I was literally waiting every episode for the maddo scientisto to come back. Also, to compensate the presence of Makise Kurisu, an AI called Amadeus who is a key character is introduced. The interactions between an AI of a loved one and the person will most likely be the same as for Okabe and Amadeus. It was depicted very realistically. Full points on that. Though there were kind of fillers in the middle episodes,, it was fun to watch. The story was still 10/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHere is the drawback. The art was not always consistent. It was good at times but mediocre at other for a God Tier anime like Steins; Gate. I wish they could have improved it though but it was ok.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSoundtracks of the anime obviously is the best part after the story. The choice of tracks played at certain key moments felt perfect. Like, it was the best one could ask for. Seriously. I have almost all soundtracks of S;G 0 in my phone and I love listening to them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first reached episode 12 of the original Steins;gate, I fell in love with it. watching S;G 0 felt very refreshing with new plot points and characters . And some of the episodes Cliffhangers left my mouth open for more like a dog. Seriously, these 25 weeks of steins;gate 0 were definitely worth it and I enjoyed everything. Loved it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThough not as great as the OG anime, it still was very great and shouldn't be missed by any steins;gate fan. A few episodes might bore you but towards the end the story progression was thrilling and the oh so perfect ending is also there :) \\n\\n\r\nFinal words: If you are still thinking whether to watch it or not, DO IT! This anime definitely is the best on of this year and I am sure you will like it. If you don't, feel free to let out your anger on me in personal message :)\\n\\n\r\nThank you\\n",

Just to see the anti-mainstream storyline concept. I think it's time to wiped out the series on the last episode in next thursday. \r\nBtw, i like amadeus song instead of fatima. (It appears on ending episodes 1 and 22).\r\nFor the spoilers in episode 22, now you can see Kurisu's Lips (Don't ever try to kiss her. \r\nYour screen  will be melted by this tsundere) \"Just Kidding nah :):) \"\r\nThat's all.

            "content": "I'm a huge fan of the original Steins;Gate series. Loved the plot, loved the characters, its a masterpiece for me.\r\nSteins;Gate 0 is a great anime in its own right. That being said, I didn't quite enjoy it as much as the original. I know I know, I should judge this anime by its own merits but it's hard for me not to compare the two since they're so closely entwined. It is what it is.\r\nI understand that we have to exchange Hououin Kyouma for sad, depressed Okabe. And I understand that Makise herself won't be in this anime much.\r\nDoesn't make their absences any less noticeable.\r\nTheinclusion of new characters like Maho, Kagari, Dr. Leskinen, along with a few others did much to flesh out the show and contribute to the plot. The added screentime and backstory given to established characters such as Suzuha (who is one of my favorite characters) makes Steins;Gate 0 worth the watch alone. Still, the cast for this season just didn't have the chemistry of the original Steins;Gate for me. And while I understand that is probably unavoidable, my love for this show still suffered because of it.\\n\\n\r\nNow the plot of Steins;Gate 0 is solid. Don't wanna give away too much because even a little might spoil the show, so I'll just say it takes a different approach than the original. Things pick up much faster in this series, however, the momentum is more like a roller coaster than anything else. Instead of a slow build up followed by a crazy plunge that continues to the end of the season, we get dramatic highs followed by periods of, well, normalcy. That isn't to say the final stretch of this show isn't hard-hitting, but I would say it doesn't match the intensity and cohesiveness of the original. Especially the ending, which I have no shame in saying left me absolutely confused until Google cleared things up for me. Somewhat.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 is a much watch for fans of the series. If you haven't yet, you slackin. But if you weren't a fan of Steins;Gate before, I'm pretty sure this series isn't gonna change your mind. I myself enjoyed it alot...but it's not a 10 for me.",

            "content": "Steins gate is my second favorite anime of all time and 1st in the thriller genre. I recommend it to everyone as it has one of the best well-written storylines in terms of logic, best character development, emotional elements, everything was good in the original series.\r\nAnd then here comes Steins gate 0 and it throws everything into a garbage, all my expectations were shattered. Here is why steins gate 0 went wrong:\r\nTo be honest Steins gate 0 is nothing but a patchwork of the original series, that is this series is meant to cover up all the loopholes left behind in the main series whichare actually 2 things:\\n\r\n1) Kurisu comes back from Airport and tries to tell Okabe something but it gets cut off as Okabe already presses the time leap button.\\n\r\n2) The Gap between the 2 time travels in episode 23 in the original series.\\n\\n\r\nSo the driving plot is very minor for steins gate 0. But even then we can expect a good story out of it, but the writer tried to focus on many unwanted kinds of stuff and ended up messing everything.\\n\\n\\n\r\n1) From the beginning of the series we see Okabe depressed and it lasts until episode 20, so there goes our main character down the hill.\\n\\n\r\n2) Next, there are so many new characters that it was hard for the writer to try to convey the feeling of everyone properly in this less amount of time. As the result, we find for most of the series the feelings of characters being unreal. To be honest only episode 16 ending felt more realistic and emotional.\\n\\n\r\n3) This story whose main motive was to cover up the loose ends ended up creating a major paradox, for Eg The story behind Mayuri's song 'Hoshi no Kanaderu Uta' is actually Mayuri learning from Mayuri which doesn't make any sense.\\n\\n\r\n4) The main focus of this series was cosplaying, partying, being depressed and throw an element of surprise at end of every episode which turns out to be nothing in next episode, you would be so much teased that you won't be feeling excited about the new episode anymore.\\n\\n\r\n5) There is one motherly sentiment story in the middle just to make people cry thrown randomly so that people would not get pissed off with Okabe's depression. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd suddenly after passing the time uselessly till episode 19, the writer comes to senses that with only 5 episodes left, it again turns back to the thriller mode which the steins gate is famous for and somehow manages to inspire the Okabe who wouldn't even want to use time machine until then and conclude the series with some stupid explanation without any proper driving motive.\\n\\n\r\nWith all this bullshit this show turns out to be an utter failure, to be honest, its better to go watch the last 3 episodes of steins gate 0 and know what really happened throughout the whole series. The last episode is the only episode which brings back the nostalgic memories of the original series, so don't miss that one...\\n\\n\r\nNow coming to the soundtracks, it turned out to be another disappointment, the opening and ending songs were ok and listenable, but the Ost's are dumb.\\n\\n\r\nArt is good, there are some really stupid fight scenes which makes you laugh.\\n\\n\r\nSo there by the famous steins gate goes down the hill.\\n\\n\r\nI always had the feeling, why the other game adapted anime series weren't as popular as Steins gate, but after watching steins gate 0, I completely understood the reason. i.e. they beat around the bush and move the plot forward!!!!\\n\\n\r\nWith this, I'll end my review, El Psy Kangarooo :P\\n\\n\r\nP.S: I didn't mention about Amadeus, Maho etc because they are all such a drag and aren't worth it.",

The 0 route is the alternative ending where Kurisu is the one that ended up being the \u2018sacrifice\u2019 it is what I\u2019d call the sequel to SG but the prequel to SGD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\\n\\n\r\nI honestly really love this, not as much as D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu but 0 allows me to realise even more how much Okabe actually loves Kurisu, I mean it\u2019s pretty obvious he doesn\u2019t want her to disappear but can\u2019t admit it. Instead he tries to forget her. Impossible and stupid!\\n\\n\r\nIn 0 Okabe was all that! He was a complete b**** BUT 0 allowed Okabe to develop his love for Kurisu and realise how much he really wanted her. The AI Amadeus definitely made it difficult to forget her too but it certainly helped him realise his feelings. Not to mention it introduced Loli girl Maho Tan to us where she had a complete character development allowing us to know how she began to trust Okabe and how the other characters supported him all the way even in the future.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part was in 0 I began to like Mayumi, sure you guys might say it\u2019s her fault!!! But she didn\u2019t want this to happen, neither did any of them. It was none of their fault, at least she wanted to go back and help Kurisu!\\n\r\nSure, the reason might not be to save Kurisu but to help Okabe but the reason doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s the thought of actually saving Kurisu that matters. And the action of actually doing so.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the prequel of D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu and shows why Mayumi slapped him and got him to save Kurisu. This is where Okabe finally reaped the rewards of what felt like an eternity of suffering. How Hououin Kyouma saved everyone\u2019s future by reaching Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say for this review, story wise.\\n\\n\r\nPretty sad I didn\u2019t get to see Kurisu in ending scenes but she wasn\u2019t the MC this time, if you\u2019re looking for Kurisu to reminisce their relationship or see her kawaii face then probably watch the shorts or D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu \\n\\n\r\nThe art style was pretty much the same as SG, I\u2019ve begun to like it very much too since it fits the atmosphere. Also the setting and the art style of the surrounding had a noticeable change for the perfect timeline in D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu therefore why D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu is my favourite Steins;Gate route.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, all of them were pretty developed through this route, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu and SG first route.\\n\r\nNot really much to say since most of the development of the sub main chars were developed in SG first route or SG prequel < what I like to call it.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve grown to love every one of these characters for their personality characteristics and everything about them. Once you do, the impact from watching 0 will be one hell of an emotional rollercoaster but don\u2019t worry because nothing is meaningless even if it seems that way.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was great as always, acting as Okabe might be pretty tough considering all the screaming and voice changes, much talent required here\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nMany plot twists and deep thoughts involced\\n\r\nMany teary eyes (about 40% of the entire anime, more than season 1 prolly since I'm more familiar and grew with the characters)\\n\r\nCried once\\n\r\nBest anime of 2018 in my opinion for the Sci Fi genre.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, really love Steins Gate very much - and Kurisu too\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the final scene was so cool that tears welled up in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nEl Psy Kongroo",

EVEN THOUGH IT IS A TOTALLY DIFFERET WORLDLINE!!\\n\r\nin the show people like Hiyajou often are refering to her as god which didn\u2019t make any fucking sense at all.\\n\\n\r\nDaru and Maho Hiyajou:\\n\r\nthey are totally irrational in this anime, in the last couple of episodes Okabe constantly is warning them that what they are doing is wrong and it would be catastrophic and every time Daru punched him in the face for being a rationalist! and in the end their plan failed and they hit Okabe again! Suzuha was an irrational and annoying character as well, that fucking psycho shot at Okabe! multiple times, it was really stupid, i am unable to describe how dumb that moment was! both because she shot and because we knew she wouldn\u2019t actually harm him and the whole thing is a desperate attempt to create tension.\\n\\n\r\nand of course the Most absurd character in history of any anime ever! \\n\r\nKagari:\\n\r\nMommy, Mommy,i Love my Mommy also i\u2019m brainwashed!\\n\r\nyeah that\u2019s about it, that\u2019s the deepest you\u2019ll get! i really couldn\u2019t care about her in fact i would appreciate it if she would suffer a little more.\\n\r\nshe also has a superspeed ability somehow, which makes her able to take down 20 trained soldiers at the same time! which is totally bullshit\\n\\n\r\nanother bad writing was in the episode where they tried to give Daru some sort of creepy meditation technique to get more confident around Yuki and he then, on the top of the roof, in the lamest way possible, purpose to her and she runs away because obviously it is too much creepy shit going on there and the next couple of hours he gets another date with her! over the phone!\\n\\n\r\noverall this is an insult to the first anime, i\u2019m not a huge fan of the first anime but i did like it but this one is a total crap, people are giving it 10 and 9 just because they love the main character, this anime doesn NOT worth 8.9 please bring down",

            "content": "Before I start, let me say that I loved the original anime, even rating it as a 10. Stein's Gate 0 manages to recapture my attention and interest almost as well as it's predecessor. \r\nFrom Okobe's relationship with Kirisu through Amadeus and the revival of a certain former character that i won't spoil here, this anime managed to give me the same feelings as the original at multiple points. However, it also lost me for a while. There is a period of time that the show seems to lose its way and becomes unfocused. \r\nOne storyline in particular, the Kagari plot, just didn't engage mein the slightest. Maybe because I found her insufferably annoying, I constantly wished for the show to get on with it whenever it chose to focus on her. \\n\\n\r\nI think if this show was around 5-7 episodes shorter, and cut the right things out, it could have been a perfect show. I know the original stays a bit slow for a while, but that serves the purpose of introducing us to the world and characters. Other than that, it also enables us to appreciate how different the world is when it changes. This show doesn't need either of those elements, so a bit of trimming could be effective.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some lulls, Stein's Gate 0 is a fantastic series and serves the original well. It excels in providing the same type of moments and interesting, likable characters as the Stein's Gate. If you liked Steins Gate, then definitely watch the sequel. It is well worth your time.",

            "content": "As with the visual novel game released about 3 years ago this official Anime sequel also takes place just before the prequel's ending about midway through episode 23 so, you could kind of call it an extended version of the original Steins;Gate too.\r\nAfter many attempts Okabe has given up hope trying to reach Steins Gate and save his beloved Kurisu. He has now returned to the Beta World Line and undergoing treatment to help cope with his traumatic experiences. One day he meets Kurisu's senior colleague Maho Hiyajo as one of the guests giving a seminar on the revolution of AI in Akihabara. They hadboth worked together at the same university in the Neuroscience Institute, researching whether it was possible to backup and restore the human memory as you would with data. Building on the foundations of Kurisu's research, the team had now begun project \"Amadeus\", a system that allowed these memories to be transferred to an AI avatar so that they maintain the person's personality and more importantly emotions. Their ultimate goal was to reach the stage where they could restore memories to the human brain but before that, they must test whether memories are fully functioning properly.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Okabe reveals he was a friend of Kurisu, Professor Leskinen leader of the Amadeus project decides he would be the best candidate to help test drive another set of data which Kurisu herself had volunteered her own memories for before she had met Okabe. Just as the Amadeus version of Kurisu becomes a part of Okabe's daily life and also his salvation, \"Reading Steiner\" suddenly starts triggering again - an ability that allowed to him to sense when someone has tampered with time while retaining his memories before history changed. As he finds his friends endangered once again, Okabe is forced to relive his nightmares and must find a way to stop whoever's responsible for the series of strange events they are caught up in.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not that much of a visual novel fan but I enjoyed the prequel show so much I ended up playing it so this time, I already played the game before watching. What made the prequel great was the impressive amount of detail that backed the sci-fi part of the show and, it was intense watching the drama unfold as Okabe desperately tries to prevent his friends' deaths despite all the odds that were against him. It had a great cast of characters too that isn't just your cliche Anime personalities so it's great seeing them back again, supporting the now depressed Okabe who is a shell of his former self. The show does a good job of making you sympathise with him when you see AI Kurisu and the flashbacks of all the tragedies he has repeatedly experienced.\\n\\n\r\nOkabe's no longer the fun \"chuunibyo\" he once was i.e. someone with the delusion they are the hero that'll save the world from a consipracy only they are aware of. He's now just your regular uni student working hard to graduate but despite the grim start showing Okabe and his troubles, the show shows it can still be amusing as it can be brutal. It starts off quite dark as it shows more insight into a future full of doom and gloom but, it's definitely toned down a lot compared to the visual novel game with certain scenes left out or cut short. The show knows when to break up the tension with a bit of humour or a breather episode.\\n\\n\r\nNew characters are developed well such as the \"qualified loli\" Maho who constantly gets teased by both the AI Kurisu and her professors or, the mysterious Kagari who has lost her memories but physically resembles the late Kurisu. As it's a different timeline from the prequel, old characters also play a different key role in the show but still their lively selves. As with the prequel, the sci-fi, mystery and drama will keep you watching as Okabe has to faces new challenges that threaten both his old and new friends alike. The romance in this sequel is heavier too. Despite having different directors and scenario writers, the story build-up is still really well-done. It's just a shame it cut out the layman's look at how AI works whereas the prequel spent a lot of time on time travel hypothesises.\\n\\n\r\nIt's good to see they hired the same singer for the opening theme, Kanako Itou but I don't think it can beat the prequel's OP theme although the lyrics suit the show well. As far as art is concerned, it's the same studio as the prequel but again, Huke's unique style from the game is better in my opinion which you see a hint of in the OP. Anime's style is a lot simpler but the quality's consistent so that's good. The team also paid a lot of attention to detail too because if you if you fall back to previous episodes after a big reveal you can see the same art was used before, possibly as a hint. I also think it was a good decision to use a 3D model for AI Kurisu so that she looks like the \"live portrait\" tech used in a lot of visual novel games these days. It also has its fan service scenes from the ladies just like the prequel but they're also just as rare so it's not enough to ruin the show. Soundtrack is a mix of the prequel and new tracks but they're all good to listen to. It was hard to recognise Kana Hanazawa's voice as Mayuri who also plays Naho from Orange. On the other hand, it's hard not to think of Okabe as Ryuuji from Persona 5 or Dazai from Bungo Stray Dogs since they're all played by Mamoru Miyano and sound alike.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no Dr. Pepper sponsor this time but if you enjoyed the prequel, you'll enjoy this. Even if you've played through every branch in the visual novel, it'll be a good watch too. It's that good and extends on the true ending a bit too so that it's ties up well with the prequel. There are the odd scenes after the credits too so don't miss out.",

            "content": "Ah yes, Steins;Gate. This series has a special place in so many people's hearts because of they many things it does right with an easy to mess up genre: good ol' time travel. A lot of us were blown away by the brilliant writing and likable characters, especially during those last 12 episodes. When Steins;Gate 0 was announced, the hype was in the air. For me, however, I was somewhat afraid. What could this new show add to a story that doesn't really need a sequel? The answer to that, is answers. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nBased off a rather big visual novel, 0 tries to blend themany routes it has into 23 episodes (and one OVA of course) and does a rather impressive job with it. One thing to note before going into it is that 0 is MUCH more tragic than the original, offering legitimately painful moments that don't feel pointless or unneeded (hi Re:Zero). The story may come across as \"all over the place\" to some, but this just signifies the insanity of this doomed world line, it covers so much ground, more than the original if I'm being honest. As I look back at the story, I was amazed where the show started and how it's ending, solely due to the fact that we were transported into subjects and possibilities that were only mentioned in the original. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThis is it, the biggest flaw of the show. Even in the original Steins;Gate, the art wasn't exactly noteworthy. It did, however, get the job done, and never proved to be noticeably lacking. 0's art/animation, however, becomes more than a distraction, it become mystifyingly bad at times. The main moments in question are some of the fight scenes. While they aren't the worst I've seen in my time of watching anime, they are still poorly executed and done rather sloppily. Some characters from a distance are awkward to look at, making some moments feel rather choppy. Despite this, there are still moments that offer rather good animation (i.e. some later fight scenes and the beginning of episode 12 come to mind), which makes up for what was seen earlier in the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe. Soundtrack. Is. Godly. Using some of the best songs from the original as well as new eargasmic tunes, the music elevates the melancholy nature of the anime's story, and can sometimes be honestly motivational. Order the OST, it's fantastic. The voice acting is also very powerful. You can tell the VA's poured their hearts out for the vast majority of this show, offering conversations and confrontations that made me laugh, cry, or both. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nSteins;Gate succeeds because of it's well written characters, and the character writing is still as potent as ever. Okabe Rintarou (notice how I didn't say Hououin Kyouma) is a broken man, and this is important to take note of. Some complaints I see of 0 revolve around a lack of everyone's favorite mad scientist, and while I agree it's depressing, it fits the show. We are supposed to miss Kyouma's signature laugh, poses, and mannerisms because at the end of the day, all the suffering pays off. Some characters get a much needed spotlight shined onto them, especially Daru and Mayuri. While best girl Makise Kurisu isn't alive in this story, the artificial intelligence with her memories in it even proves to be a good character in it's own right. We even get some new characters, such as loli girl Maho Hiyajo and the walking meme himself, Professor Leskinen. The only flaw to point out is that some characters don't get enough development and are shoved to the side due to the constantly moving plot. This isn't a completely bad thing, but it would've been cool to see more development for the colorful cast the show has. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nWe finally got more Steins;Gate after about seven years. Despite the long wait, I enjoyed this show just as much as I did when the original started airing. The twists and turns the show has at it's disposal never really faded. I always wanted to know what was going to happen next due, and I was often shocked by some of the development that took place. The show did what it could when it comes to adapting the core of the visual novel, and it is honestly impressive how they handled it. While having some bumps in the road, 0 will make you laugh, bawl your eyes out, ask questions, and make you feel satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 is an excellent sequel to an equally excellent anime, and may very well be one of the best offerings of the year. Although it doesn't quite match the quality of the original, what we have here is another chapter to a book we thought was finished. It shows different outcomes and stakes for Okabe and his friends, offering a heaping dose of suffering from beginning to end. The real question is: what are you waiting for? Go watch it! El. Psy.

But Zero (The Anime) got a problem with Logic which isworse than that.\\n\r\nNow i'll say what really makes Zero less good than the OG:\\n\\n\r\n1- The main Problem: Which is the fights in the latest 2 episodes were so bad\\n\r\nnot because of suzuha not even because of the animation which is the anime isn't about fighting at all. the Problem is with kagari being fucking overpowered and not even dying and killing with her bare hands and moving an inhuman moves. and also the soldiers themselves. \\n\r\nThey absolutely were chosen for this mission because of their skills and being ready of it and being practiced and taught well for years (well its logically all of us concluded this) and then we saw them having troubles with hurting suzuha and killing mayuri and kagari and dying from 1 vs 15 simply. being skilled as 2 people doesn't mean having a whole 15 people a trouble because of their skills and limits. this is neither realistic nor logical.\\n\r\nand those 2 bullets on mayuri's head which made these soldiers more pathetic than they are\\n\\n\r\n2- The story (vn exactly) meant an amount of enjoyment in the first episodes that must make us enjoyed with the slice of life even tho not having that much of action. that amount wasn't successfully adapted to the anime\\n\r\nwhich caused a less enjoyment and how that happened? it happened because the director in those episodes focused on making an anime adaptation instead of making an anime which caused the director to focus on how to make the story go well without plot holes nor issues in adaptation and simply forgot to increase the amount of enjoyment in the events of slice of life and the mystery of kagari.\\n\\n\\n\r\n3- If you thought that the story alongside with the enjoyment are near the perfection. unfortunately you're wrong.\\n\r\nthe story has the issue of not completing the scene of ww3 and the main problem of it is SPOILING on us the most 2 important current events which they're leskinen being the True Antagonist and Mayuri time traveling despite the fact she died trying to time travel with suzuha. Leskinen's twist was spoiled in episode 13 exactly showing us his face.\\n\r\nMayuri's twist was spoiled in the new opening as a quick scene showing us mayuri setting on a chair in the time machine with some time traveling effects\\n\r\nThis is Steins;Gate not Boku no Hero academia! Spoiling an anime about twists and a greatness of a story is literally a throwing of the enjoyment of the viewer\\n\\n\r\nIn the best case with having a perfect ending and so, it'll be mostly a 9.4/10",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: Some parts of this review may not make sense since I have updated this review pretty frequently from episode 15 of the anime and I have changed my mind about some aspects of the anime, so forgive me if there are. \r\nSteins Gate 0 is a very good and enjoyable alternate story of the original Steins Gate story in which we see Okabe Rintarou, our main protagonist, transform into a more sinister and depressed persona of the mad scientist we all grew to love in the original series.\r\nBasically the story of Okabe Rintarou with severe PTSD and trust issues, let's get into the factorsof what made this such a good anime...\\n\\n\r\nMINOR SPOILERS ahead but they aren't major. If you're super serious about spoilers, don't read this.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9) - \\n\r\nAlthough fairly enjoyable and emotional, really repeats what happens in the original series where Okabe yet again travels in a time machine to save his friends from death. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough this story really builds on characters that we haven't heard the full backstory of yet such as Daru and builds on new characters we haven't seen before to make the story a slight bit interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThis repetition of story really doesn't hurt the story too much as it was necessary for the plot (to reach Steins Gate) but it just made the story a bit plain when using the same concept with the original series. There are many plot twists that were made in the anime which helped not make the anime too repetitive so don't worry OG Steins Gate fans.\\n\\n\r\nSo don't expect this to be a comedic series like what we kind of saw from the original series. This alternate story is very emotional and depressing especially when the main character is throughout the entire anime unlike in OG Steins Gate. There are a few comedic scenes here and there but aren't as funny as the previous Steins Gate which is, personally, why I prefer the original Steins Gate more than this alternate one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (8) -\\n\r\n8 for art? Yes 8 for art. The anime had a strong start with very good art especially the many haunting faces Okabe does, the really nice touches in the first intro and how the animators portrayed suffering and emotion throughout the anime but towards the middle of the series where it went downhill.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes in the middle part of the story weren't great and you'll see a lot of soldiers acting like storm troopers and the fight scenes between them and Suzuha looked like Powerpoint slides but then again, this anime is not supposed to be action packed but the art for these fights didn't look great so that's why I'm not giving art a 2.\\n\\n\r\n1 to 1 combat is well done by White Fox though, don't get me wrong, not all action scenes are trash in comparison to the one I have just mentioned. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9) - \\n\r\nThe first intro was not as great as the original series of Steins Gate but it had really meaningful lyrics and it was very catchy and I got to say that to the second intro too. Overall, great intros! Sound related to the anime in general, there's not much to say. Explosions sound like explosions and guns sound like guns. Can't really complain.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Steins Gate 0 is pretty good and my personal favourites are Believe Me and episode 23's ending song however they do sound pretty similar to OG Steins Gate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8.5) - \\n\r\nWhite Fox really knows how to perfect its characters. This is due to how they develop and build a backstory to almost all of the characters. Except for Maho...\\n\\n\r\nLike the majority, I'm not a big fan of Maho. It's as if she is fan service for the OG Steins Gate fans to enjoy as a replacement to Kurisu but I don't see any enjoyment in witnessing her character. For instance, she gives some advice to Okabe after Okabe time travels to the past just like Kurisu. They both have awkward and 'funny' (apostrophes for a reason) moments just like Kurisu. A scientist just like Kurisu. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime does show the differences between her and Kurisu but it doesn't make up for it. I saw potential in the character at first but she's pretty much no different to Kurisu. She's like a down graded version of her. \\n\\n\r\nThough on a positive note, some of the characters now have a full fledged backstory and don't feel like they're just THERE which I really really like and what Steins Gate 1 didn't really accomplish (probably to save it for this sequel), for example, characters like Ruka, more of Mayuri and her deeper thoughts, 'that annoying cat girl' and others. \\n\\n\r\nAlso Mayuri always makes the best quotes and speeches in this anime and puts her, easily, as one of my favourite characters in anime. Don't get me wrong, original Steins Gate really made me like her but Steins Gate 0 really puts a god damn GOOD spotlight on her. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8) -\\n\r\nIn summary, while I don't think this anime is better than the first, it's still a really enjoyable and emotional anime where we see the transformation of Okabe and more backstory (and future story) and development of other characters we didn't see much of in the first series. \\n\\n\r\nOn the negative side of things, I think the main issue I have with the anime is simply how repetitive the story is but some of the plot holes make up for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nI feel this anime is a must watch after you've completed the first series and that you have watched the episode 23 beta alternative ending or else you wouldn't understand SG0's story.\\n",

            "content": "Stein's Gate has been in my top 5 anime list solidly ever since I watched it years ago.\r\nThe emotions,  suspense, and excitement I got after watching the original series was uncomparable and I'm pretty sure for a large population as it is the third highest ranked anime of all time on this site.\r\nSo the bar was set really high for the second season - \"Stein's Gate 0\". However, watching this series did not give me the ecstatic feelings like I used to feel from Stein's Gate. So what was different? \r\nIt truly woke me up how important the characters were in the original series.This second season felt dry without Kurisu and felt like something was missing. Also Mayuri being distressed and sad made me feel depressed too, in comparison to the original where she was so bubbly with (TooTooRoo). Okabe being weak,down only made it worse. I get that , the fact that he and others being depressed is like one of the premises of the second season. But couldn't they summon Hououin Kyouma earlier like mid way and pump this series up? Only giving him one episode at the very end really wasn't valuable in my opinion. It's crazy how I felt like I was watching the old Stein's gate and super pumped in that single episode alone. El Psy Congroo~ \\n\\n\r\nThe new characters did not give me satisfaction too, Maho , Leskinen, Kagari,and Amadeus were the main ones. Maho,Kagari,and Leskinen simply just annoyed me 80% of the time they were shown. They were boring,irritating characters that were hard to bond with and feel affection for. Also, I feel they were there just for the sake of being there.\\n\\n\r\nAmadeus was okay but I feel they could have developed her a lot more considering how important she is to this series. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the music and pacing of the series though as the first season is infamous for being super slow at the start. In this series,  almost every episode has something going on. Don't get me wrong, this series was really good too but just different from what I wanted/visualized it to be. I just feel it could have been better.",

            "content": "At this time, the 22nd episode just released.\r\nSo. The story of Steins Gate 0 is basically Okabe never receives the D-mail telling himself to deceive the world and himself in the past to save Kurisu. He goes down the path where WW3 will start. He meets Amadeus Kurisu, an AI version of Kurisu, and her senpai, Hiyajo Maho. The story gets better and I'm not going to spoil it but its truly amazing. At some points, it gets really confusing but it often gets cleared up pretty quickly and although some of the episodes did want to make me cry, it might just be mecutting too many onions.\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks beautiful as ever and Winter Japan looks just as good as Summer Japan (if you watched Steins;Gate, you know it takes place in the summer). The music is also perfect. They place the right song at the right time, especially emotional parts that include Kurisu. The characters are the same as ever and I really enjoy it. New characters like Maho is very enjoyable too.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I really enjoyed this. I would say that this review looks really really bad but I really need to eat my food before it gets cold. Anyways, I give this anime a 9! ^u^",

Grim dark.\r\nIf Steins;Gate is the timeline where everything suits just fine, here is where everything has gone wrong: Rintaro Okabe is on the verge of mental failure, Kurisu is dead and where \"resistance is futile\".\r\nRintaro knows this world is gonna be devoured by the flames of war, he knows billions are gonna die, he knows all those he cares of are gonna die. Die like of a bad, bad death, like slaughtered or exploded,death like bloodbath death.\\n\r\nBut he's gonna fight. He will fight. Anyway, to find love, to save his world, to save the people he loves.\\n\\n\r\nOk, the fact there are two guys, and a load of cute/kawaii/busty female charas, is a little annoying, looks too fake for the purpose of this anime, but story is intriguing and, as of the 5th episode (as it was with the first series) I'm pretty sure the story won't collapse into a colossal and beautiful mindfuck for at least another 5 episodes.\\n\r\nWell, if you've watched Steins;Gate you know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nWhat to know before watching Steins;Gate 0:\\n\r\nyou must watch Steins;Gate, first.

I was looking forward to it, but also quite afraid 'Will be the quality of Steins;Gate 0 at least bit good as Steins;Gate?\" This anime is my favorite, so of course I was worried that new, alternative version, spoils it.\r\nBut true is.. I was so wrong! The quality is so perfect! I love all episodes so far. I don't recommend to watch it before Steins;Gate, but if you've seen it already, it's worth to watch this one too!\r\nStory 10/10\r\nSo, since this great woman, Makise Kurisu, is no longer alive in this anime,there was fear that I won't be able to enjoy story without her. I miss her, but the plot is amazing. Similar to Steins;Gate - Every thing that happened was important to story, nothing unnecessary. Also it's very interesting and I love when you need to think about it for longer time - And yeah, Steins;Gate 0 is anime, where you need to keep it in brain for a while, otherwise you understand nothing.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHaven't seen nothing wrong about art yet. Contrariwise, I very like it, the art of places, characters.. Everything is great.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOST and ops/ends, these things were always so good with Steins;Gate. I immediately fell in love with opening, it's really enjoyable - and sad. The sound in anime is amazing too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWho can do so many characters with such potential? Don't know any character who is good for nothing here. After Steins;Gate, I loved Kurisu and Okabe. After Steins;Gate 0, I realized, that I love almost all characters so much. Everyone is so original and interesting. That's one of things I love the most about Steins;Gate!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDon't have any problems with it. I enjoy all episodes and I am sure, the rest 17 episodes will be amazing too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nJust what I should say after all this? The quality of Steins;Gate never changed, still it's the most perfect anime I've seen so far. I enjoy all of it!\\n\r\nI don't usually give 10/10,.. And give 10/10 to all rating (sound, story..) about it? Not at all. But Steins;Gate 0 is exception and I believe it will remain like this.",

            "content": "I really wanted to like you Steins;Gate 0, but I just can't.\r\nMY BIASES: I have seen the original series twice, and I enjoyed it both times.  The original show, though marred by unnecessary characters and weird plot contrivances, is excellent overall  (I'd rate it 8/10).\r\n***There are some minor spoilers ahead (such as love interests)\r\nSTORY (6/10): The main story is fine -- time traveling is real, messing with the past can lead to messy results, causation can be a real pain in the butt, failing to save someone dozens of times can lead to trauma, and wallowing in guilt can lead to crushing isolation.\r\nThepacing and focus of this show have been horrendous.  We are treated to a bunch of slice-of-life episodes where nothing really happens for vast stretches of time, and then 3 minutes of something \"shocking\" happens toward the end; I felt like I was watching poorly done episodes of Card Captor Sakura.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, that kind of structure could work if handled competently (like the original series).  I'm of the minority who believes that the first half of Steins;Gate 1 is superior to the second half; in that series, deceptively mundane things were happening, but they were used to flesh out the characters of the story, and they were punctuated with subtle hints of something sinister lurking in the background that would gradually culminate in a terrible reckoning.  With Steins;Gate 0, for those of us who have seen the original series, we are already familiar with the majority of the characters, so it's very tiresome to listen to Daru's perverse utterances and Faris's speech tic (for whatever reason, she says it a lot more now. Why?!).\\n\\n\r\nI understand that the majority of the mundane events serve to show how isolated Okabe is and how his anxieties and guilt are eating him up, but this series's incessant hammering of this point for 18 episodes is too much.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the series does pick up, we get essentially recycled plot from the original series.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (4/10):\\n\\n\r\nOkabe (8/10): I have no complaints about Okabe's character; it's logical, consistent, and sympathetic.  I understand his anxieties and struggles because of how much the show has hammered the point.  I miss his mad-doh scientist shtick, but people do grow out of things.\\n\\n\r\nMaho Hiyajo (7/10): Short girl scientist chan is fine.  I'm not sure why she likes Okabe, but her dynamics with him range from amusing to charming.  I was initially worried that the show would fall into the Full Metal Alchemist type of humor with Maho (criminal repetition of a bad joke), but it fortunately doesn't (not too much, anyway).  Yes, she's short, but she's a bit more complicated than that because she has actual desires, fears, and feelings.  And her character actually progresses (unlike the majority of other characters).\\n\\n\r\nvillains (2/10): Wow, are they underwhelming.  One particular villain finally gets revealed, and what does he do? Classic villain monologue, except it's grating on the ears; I recalled the hilarious epiphany had by the villain in The Incredibles.  Way too convenient for Okabe and the audience; it's poorly-delivered info dump.\\n\\n\r\nold characters (Daru, Suzuha, Faris, etc.) (3/10): They are the same as they were in the first series.  Unfortunately, they simply act out their old tired roles.  Daru still makes perverted utterances, Faris still says \"nya,\" etc.  I wish the series would have cut down on the number of characters.  The series has tried to compensate for its static old characters by having them fill up different roles to explain plot contrivances (eg Shining Finger becomes a private investigator, Daru breaks into laptops as a side job)\\n\\n\r\nnew characters (2/10): Oh brother.  I already thought the original series had too many characters, but this one, oh brother.  Bleach syndrome?  The problem with these new characters is that they are so forgettable, pointless, and unnecessary.  Kagari Shiina is the only one whose existence is justifiable (because of plot).  Even so, she has been bland and is merely a vehicle for the plot, so far.\\n\\n\r\nART and SOUND (7/10): The animation and art are fine. The opening track is nostalgic.  It's a little bit too energetic for the overall tone of the series, but it's fine; listen to it once, and skip it for all other episodes.  The ending track is a real killer; it creates a somber and slightly sinister tone that better matches the series than does the opening; listen to it after each episode to recalibrate what the series's message and tone. The Engrish is a tad grating, though.  The other sounds are unobtrusive but appropriate; no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nFANSERVICE (3/10):\\n\\n\r\nThrowbacks (9/10): If you haven't seen the original series in a while, you will likely appreciate all the throw-backs to the original; they are subtle, even clever at times.  If you haven't seen the original series, the throwbacks fit in without making you feel left out.\\n\\n\r\nFanservice (2/10): There are slumber parties, boob fondling, disproportionate amount of stacked girls, and boob enhancements.  Why Steins;Gate 0, why?!\\n\\n\r\nHYPOTHESIS: The makers of this show decided to try to branch out by appealing to old fans, fans of moe/slice of life, and fans of drama.  This attempt has backfired because the show attempts to do each of the three separately.  As such, the show's a mess.\\n\\n\r\nMY ENJOYMENT(5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing and focus and tired/boring characters of this show have obliterated the little enjoyment I've had so far.  I suspect that my nostalgia is the main saving grace of this show. \\n\\n\r\nAt around episode 17, things pick up and get serious, and all the slice-of-life elements are gone!  However, the seriousness ain't all that great.  Like the the original series, bullets mysteriously miss important characters and escaping from trained, professional killers is remarkably easy for Okabe.\\n\\n\r\nLater, we get this strange time-travelling to the future event, just so Okabe can see how bad things are, and then we time-travel back to the past.  And then one of the villains gets foiled: all within two episodes.  Wow, that's some terrific pacing.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I don't think this show can recover.",

            "content": "Warning: This might contain a bit of a spoiler on the plot (just the plot but not specifically)\r\nYou know how the feeling of completing one side of a rubik's cube? that is how you would feel after watching S;G. But how about completing all sides of the rubik's cube? that is what you feel after you watch S;G0.\r\nBefore I go in deeper I question people in the review section. Why would you say this is a \"what if\" arc? this is definitely not. Everything is connected from S;G and S;G0 making this just a completion of S;G or what you would call a \"True ending\".Without this, the ending of S;G wouldn't even exist in the first place. Get your facts right please.\\n\\n\r\nWhile S;G0 might be a sequel to S;G, it is actually not. S;G0 is just a detailed explanation of how the story evolved into the final episode of S;G. Remember how at the ending of S;G, Okabe got a video of his future self? I'm pretty sure we all are curious on the story of that future self Okabe and S;G0 is the answer. So for people expecting a sequel to the original S;G, sorry to break your heart but this is not. (I mean we already have the movie sequel and ova, what else is there to do a sequel with? A sequel after that would only break the perfect ending of this masterpiece)\\n\\n\r\nSo how about S;G0 itself? S;G0 paced really slow at the beginning. For someone who re-watched S;G and binge'd S;G0, it was really irritating. There were character that suddenly popped out and we were (kinda) forced to accept their existence. The story itself as a standalone is mediocre. However, if you see the big picture, this 2nd season was meant to support the original S;G and when you see the whole story, it was really satisfying especially the 3 last episodes, which although was a bit rushed, was really worth it after all the agony of waiting.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the most important part of S;G0 was to get to the last 3 episodes. However, I still think that they could've done better on the beginning and the end, as the beginning is slowly paced and the ending was rushed, they could've balanced it by compromising on each. I also find that the art and the sound itself really lacking, which probably is a letdown to some of us. Another thing that would be wrong about this is how Kurisu's voice in S;G0 differs a bit with the original S;G albeit being the same voice actor. Feels like she forgot Kurisu's personality or something.\\n\\n\r\nTo end this, the true timeline of the whole S;G would be:\\n\r\n-Season 1 from ep 1 to midway ep 23\\n\r\n-Ep 23 beta OVA\\n\r\n-All of S;G0\\n\r\n-Second half of S1 ep 23, then 24+25\\n\r\n-Cognitive Computing OVA\\n\r\n-Deja Vu movie\\n\r\nHowever I wouldn't really recommend watching it like this as it would ruin the whole fun of this series. Also, to watch S;G0 I would recommend watching from the beginning of S;G (The first season) for a better experience. After finish watching S;G0 you might wonder how some facts in the end contradict with the rules of the S;G itself. For that you might want to check the last ep discussion (there's someone who explained about it) because as I said before, the ending itself is a bit rushed and you might have to think with your own about how it can conclude to that.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR if your brain can't handle processing the original S;G \"puzzle\", then you wouldn't have fun deciphering this whole S;G0 because the theme of both S;G and S;G0 is connecting the dots.",

And I was expecting that for SG 0. Because the anime version and VN is different, and it dissapoint me. I really really recommend people to buy SG 0 or at least watch a YT playthrough because my god... IT'S AMAZING. Sure it's a lot more complicated than the first one, even I need to play it 5 times until I completely understand what's going on. But when you finally understand and that*pang* hits you and your mind just went blank. That feeling of understand how good the story is, when you connect all the dots from the SG and SG 0, when you realise just how hard Okabe needs to went through to get to Steins Gate, when you realise how many sacrfice he needs to endure, not matter what happen, he needs to keep on moving forward, how he needs to sacrifice himself to save other Okabe. That kind of feeling is what I love.",

            "content": "Time travel is a very mysterious and confusing subject we can all wonder. It is definitely not an easy concept to write a story on, for usually, there would be more than a few flaws that would have cause for eyebrows raised. This is what we call, a bootstrap paradox, where something or someone seems to exist only because of something from the future.. An easier way of describing it would be pulling yourself out of a pit with your own bootstrap, hence the name. If that is the case, where is this something or someone's origins and how did it come to be? Severalblockbusters that comes to mind with the unintentional bootstrap paradox would be the Terminator film series or perhaps even Doctor Who in a sense. Now Steins;Gate presented the concept of multiple world-lines or \"mirror universes\" if you will, or a \"Star Trek\" analogy. Although this is not the first anime series to use the concept of multiple world-lines, it nevertheless, reduces its chances of encountering a paradox, which is great relief on my part, who questions the events occurrences chronologically.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Steins;Gate 0 was very interesting, I find it quite entertaining to see another path Okabe could have taken if he had not save Kurisu in the original series, so that's a positive aspect of this series. I find it quite refreshing to try and remember the events of the original series so as to connect any small details of the alternate story and I have to say, it is definitely quite a thriller, as the story, like the first series, leaves the audience questioning the ultimate antagonist till the very end. However, unlike the first Steins;Gate series, which minimised the flaws by leaving a few aspects of the story ambiguous, the new series did place a few new revelations in the story that had my eyebrows raised and thinking: \"Oh no.. It's a bootstrap paradox!\" For one, while trying not to do too many spoilers, it's the time machine.. Suzuha loses her old one due to out of fuel and attempts to persuade Daru to create a new one by studying hers, which was designed by Daru in the future.. Ok.. So where did the time machine come originally? Without future Daru to design it, then the time machine couldn't have been introduced to the past Daru.. Thus my conclusion that time travel is such a mysterious and confusing subject to discuss about.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the story's inevitable encounter with such a paradox, I very much enjoyed the characters' relationships with one another. The various archetypes they represent were intriguing and touching where the drama aspect of the story kicks in. I very much like Okabe's characteristics, where he once was a self-proclaimed mad-scientist, but due to unfortunate circumstances during his time travelling adventure, he gave up on that fantasy and spends his days grieving, knowing that he is alone with such experiences. It really drew me in and at times, I really could feel his frustrations!\\n\r\nHowever, as the story escalated to its height, I felt several aspects of it rather made it a little confusing. To refrain from spoiling, I can think of a character who appeared that I felt unnecessary or at least her involvement within Okabe and his friends' circle was not covered enough to make her worthy to have such a role as she did in the last several episodes.\\n\\n\r\nTo add to this, White Fox's art-style of this series and its close resemblance to the Visual Novel is great as usual, simple as that. That then concludes for now, with a rating overall of 8/10. The only factor that brings that down to 8 instead of 9 is perhaps the fact they allowed more flawed aspects into the story then they did in the original Steins;Gate, but otherwise, I still found it very enjoyable to watch.",

            "content": "As with many sequels (or prequels... I don't know if there's a word to describe a setting like S;G 0...) , I think is more than clear this anime expects you to know the setting or the plot of the original series. Also, or so i believe, it expects you to have \"played\" the Visual Novel it adapts, as it isn't as self explanatory as the original series was when it comes to certain plot elements and events, which due to time constraints (of course) have little screen time. I'm a VN \"player\", I know what the story is about, I know the story iscomplex and intricate and more importantly, I know the story is GOOD.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as an anime, does this series translates the S;G 0 story in a proper manner? \\n\\n\r\nyes... and no.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThis series definetely gives you an insight of most of the routes, so is definetly not like you haven't grasped the whole deal. But the fact that it does becomes a problem in itself (extremely irregular pacing, few but noticeable loose ends, events not climaxing properly) and plus some sloppy directorial choices, make the end result quite a mess. \\n\\n\r\nFunnily enough, the original S;G series was criticized for constantly cutting and adding lots of plot elements that weren't previously there. At the end of the day, that decision allowed the series to work as a cohesive, streamlined and balanced anime. Many of the best episodes of S;G 0 did exactly that, while the ones who tried the most to be faithful to the source material, were also the ones who suffered the most.\\n\\n\r\nArt/ Animation:\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. The character redesigns are welcomed (maybe the bust size upgrade not so much), the settings can be really, damn beautiful (Mayuri and Kagari singing by the railroad in the future or the constellation in episode 17). Nothing to worry about there. BUT...\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is the fact that this anime still looks like it was made in 2011 and kept in a vault for 7 years. You'd expect a slightly improved graphics since, but nope. I guess everything is more clear & HD now, and the bluish tint of the original series is gone. But again, getting rid of something can highlight underlying issues. In S;G 0 case, TONS instances of poorly drawn frames (Okabe calling Amadeus at the Airport), not-so-good, maybe rushed, animation (the god-awful Suzuha fight scene at the rooftop) and just plain inconsistencies (Amadeus constantly alternating between a CGI and a drawing).\\n\\n\r\nThe original S;G apparently had many animation/art issues as well, so the only thing that comes to my mind is that WhiteFox is waiting for the BluRay version to come out so they can fix this... thing. \\n\\n\r\nDefinetely the weakest part of the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music:\\n\r\nThe music sadly did not meet the incredible highs of the original Steins;Gate but I think that has more to do with the song choice by the directors and screenwriters, rather than the talented musicians who worked in the soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nThe song by sung by Megumi (Kagari) and Kana (Mayuri) at the end of episode 12 (which I believe is called \"A Song Played By The Stars\") is a notable exception as it's perhaps one of the most soothing and emotional pieces I've heard all year. Other song that clicked, maybe not so much with me, but with the sentiment of the action is \"Lyra\", played at the end of episode 8, as well as the original series intro \"Hacking Through The Gate\", back again in episode 23.\\n\\n\r\nThe piano melodies that played throught the episodes fall on the same ground as most of the music, although they did serve their purpose to create a mood and a sentiment on given scenes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters in Steins;Gate are the reason you keep on watching. They were a 10/10 before and while in S;G 0 we see them grow and mature, their personalities are so well crafted from the beginning that even if they venture to take more outlandish decisions, they are still not only believable but lovable. \\n\\n\r\nOf all characters, Daru is the one who appears to grow the most, his witty remarks and hentai personality, although not completely gone, move aside just enough so he can become a \"Daru the Man\", the resistance leader who in 2036 will create a Time Machine and most importantly, a father for Suzuha, who is haunted by the war and the loss of her mother, she's more agressive, strong-willed and cold, unlike the seemingly care-free Suzu from the previous show. It is only halfway through the show that she opens up to the point we realize the \"old\" Suzuha does exists within her. \\n\\n\r\nMayuri, being a major plot point as always, replaces her happy attitude with a worried look. Her goal, as it was in the previous S;G is for everyone to be happy, however we see a Mayuri that's saddened and full of regret, she will always be able to force a smile though. We slowly get to see how she experiences a major growth in her personality as she starts figuring out what's happening around her, culminating in her, for once, taking action... unlike Okabe, who struggles terribly to keep going, he's exhausted, battered and depressed. He repressed his happy go-lucky persona and he ought to realize the importance of it to actually turn things around. \\n\\n\r\nOn a similar note we have Maho, who considers herself inferior to Kurisu, but at the same time is terribly saddened by her passing, she being obviously more mature than the rest of the cast happens to be the most realistic character of them all. Like most of us humans do, she needs to realize her worth and that's precisely her individual journey.\\n\\n\r\nSome of these characters shine more than others, but there's not really much of a problem as we already saw their backstories (Faris, Moeka, Ruka, Tennouji). \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I recognize the importance of Leskinen to the plot, It's a shame to see characters like Judy Reyes  (who plays a major role in quite a few routes) to be so underveloped. Other character who suffered the same fate is Katsumi, who also had an important role in other routes.\\n\\n\r\nFinally I must recognize that most of this characters shine, not only because of a script and story, but their voice actors. S;G 0 features top of the food chain voice acting. Passionate, emotional and most importantly, (yes, even for a show about time machines) believable. From Mamoru's (Okabe) grunts and screams to Yukari's (Suzuha & Yuki) performance as both mother and daughter, to Kana's performance as a sorrowful Mayuri to Tomokazu's (Daru) going from 0 to 100 in episode 17. \\n\\n\r\nSimply amazing voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nBottomline:\\n\r\n(implying you read this far)\\n\\n\r\nS;G 0 still is a great series that any one who is a fan of S;G should watch and surely will enjoy. That being said, Im the kind of person who simply cannot overlook when there are many issues going on in a series at once, even less if it's a series I love such as Steins;Gate. But i gotta be mindful in this specific case, as S;G 0 is way more complex than the original, therefore many of the problems that the series had when it came to pace and story, could be expected. What i wasn't expecting was animation and art issues (that hopefully will be sorted out) which is something that did took me away from the immersion.\\n\\n\r\nIn short: S;G 0 is a commendable attempt to boil down a very difficult plot, with many stories into a somewhat streamlined experience, that nevertheless failed to recreate the highs of the more streamlined, more focused, previous series. Still though, the story is engaging just enough, with enough replay value, summed up with an incredible voice acting, so it can become a nice and welcomed addition to the S;G universe.",

            "content": "So, I want to start it off by saying this is better than any sequel/prequel has any right to be in all honesty. The whole tone, characters, and animation, tried to be faithful to the original. This, in itself, is exceptionally hard. However, I'll say what really sold this for me, but it has to be supplemented with the original as if you're just watching it as a standalone it doesn't work.\r\nArt: Beautiful. The tone of desperation and despair are really set by the post apocalyptic tones, and it really brings out what the characters are experiencing. Whether through flashbacks or time travel, they reallyknow \"shit is fucked\" in the moment when they have to experience it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Music is great and on point, even at the end they really know what the original is going for. I think they wanted to make an homage more than a continuation, which really works for the series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: If you didn't cry or feel sad from a non-chunni Okabe (excuse me, Houin Kyoma!) then you are sorely misguided in sympathy. The whole show kept the same characters without resorting to making them memes or standards.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a great, emotional addition to Steins;Gate, and I hope those that enjoyed the first watch the second. If I had to list a failing, it was that the show tried to go for the \"ball drop\" the first series had about mid season, but they tried to do it like 3 or 4 times at the end. In reality, one would have sufficed for the seriousness of the show. Still, if you want more S;G and want some drama to your everyday harem show (with crippling depression) look no further than this.",

The characters, the story, the emotions, all of it feels the same (in a good way) yet, much more mature/grounded... much like the audience who has followed the anime series since the first episode aired on April 6, 2011.\r\nOkabe Rintaro, has accepted his decisions and the consequences which has led him to become a respectable member of society with an almost bland personality with tones of melancholy commonly found in burnt out individuals. Compared to his previous persona, Mad Scientist: Houoin Kyouma, he is a normal college student with a troubledpast: a relatable shift for those who have been following the series for the last 7 years... minus the traumatic experiences of time travel.\\n\\n\r\nHis shift in personality coincides with fans who, like him, were energetic and carefree before their decisions and the inevitability of their situation forced them to become a normal individual who gives in to societal pressures. In a way, you are supposed to empathize with his plight as you have made a similar decision to pursue real goals in life and do away with childish acts for the sake of moving on.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses and he is pulled back into the world of time machines and secret organizations, you regain your childish flare from 7 years ago bit by bit as he too gradually regains the drive to stop World War III and save those he cares about. Despite knowing how this story ends, you can't help but be pulled into the drama, emotions, and rebirth of Okabe's old self as he strives to attain what he had once given up on.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Steins;Gate 0 a great show is not just the time-traveling, secret organizations, or moments of well-written drama, but the connection it creates and the emotions it evokes from the viewer and their personal growth from the last 7 years.\\n\\n\r\nOr you could just say it is a well-written with great cinematography and characters who despite their seemingly one-dimensional cookie-cutter visual novel personalities have a certain realistic subtlety in their interactions. I would give this show a \"Tuturu~~\"/10 if I could.",

            "content": "Preface:  It is very important to watch the original Steins;Gate first.  There are spoilers here that would ruin the original.\r\nThe amazing characters, music, and theming from the original are still there in Zero.  The new characters I felt were strong overall, and definitely bring out new sides of the old characters.  The story is still very intriguing overall, even though it was rough in some of the plot devices used to deliver it, especially in the rising action.\r\nI found it to be a worthy successor, but not as satisfying.  Zero's darker tone makes it not exactly enjoyable to watch, witha well-crafted air of anxiety that is a little too contagious for my taste.  Overall, fans of the original should find it to be a worthwhile journey, but if you weren't sold on the original then I think it unlikely that you will like this adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nHow to Watch:  This is very story driven.  I can't say it's a terrible idea to skip to the end if you feel you want to, but expect a lot of \"Who's this\" and \"What's going on?\" if you do.  One notable exception is Episode 15, which is mostly detached from the main plot and worth a watch IMO.",

            "content": "They say time is the true ruler, so simple yet very complex and unforgiving. Able to cause paradoxes and even get cat humor? At least, that's what I used to think Schrodinger cat was all about. As of yet, everything about time manipulation and travel is out of our reach and advancement that the majority of out depiction comes from fiction, many works in different shapes and forms had their unique takes on the topic, but very few managed to maintain a strict and stay as faithful and concise as it started by the time they were concluded, and rolling an anime tongue about this,Steins;Gate always slips from the mouth, and for a good reason.\\n\r\nThe literal alternative to the 2011 series hit, Steins;Gate that retains to this day a pretty high place on every top x best anime shows for what it had of spicey cliffhangers, jaw-dropping revelations, unpredictable plot twists, and original intercourse, a series that already had the ultimate conclusion, to begin with, and nothing in its case begged for a sequel (technically, that's not what this is). In the world of programming, there is a saying that goes; \u201cIf it works, don't touch it\u201d, but as many world-line, as there may be, a story can have all sort of roller-coaster twists and turns that it might eventually render a previous installement entirely on its feet. Enter; Steins;Gate 0.\\n\\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\\n\r\nThe conclusion of Steins;Gate is ancient news by now, back in the first season we learned that they finally achieve world like Steins;Gate, a world line where neither Kurisu nor Mayuri dies, a world line that world war III is avoided, the world line of true peace that Okabe was desperate to reach, and for that, many people might be wondering what Steins;Gate 0 is for?\\n\r\nExactly at episode 23 of the original series, there was an alternative version called \u201cSteins;Gate: Kyoukaimenjou no Missing Link - Divide By Zero\u201d, also known as \u201cSteins Gate: Episode 23 (\u03b2), Open the Missing Link\u201d where Mayuri agrees with Okabe not wanting to go back in time and save Kurisu after the devastating truth of him being the one who kills her. Steins;Gate 0 is the direct sequel to that episode that follows what it was like to live for Okabe in a world he chose where Mayuri gets to live but Kurisu dies, this is the Okabe that sent the message from the future to Steins;Gate episode 23 Okabe so that he doesn't give up on saving Kurisu and thus avoiding the entirety of world line Beta. All of that mess sounds complicated on first words, but trust me the twists that shifted the story of Steins;Gate 0 were that of a greater scale.\\n\r\nFor the most part, the classic cliffhanger episodes remained just as prominent, however, most of the episodes were just boring and filled with unnecessary dialogue that it makes you waiting for the punch line at the end of the episode because you know it's the running theme here, and for most people, the only thing that keeps this desperate follow up to the first season going.\\n\r\nJust like the first season, Steins;Gate 0 borrows the concept of D-mails and memory transferring to delivery time travel action, but also relies more on physical time traveling and even expanded on new exciting concepts like AI and memory preserving, SEREN is no longer the only predator but few other adversaries seemed to have joined the lobby.\\n\r\nIs a sense, Steins;Gate 0 feels more mature than its predecessor, Okabe, and folks are surrounded from every corner this time around, and Okabe, let's just say, he learned how to restrain himself in a sad way.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\\n\r\nThe handling of animation and art style was never a problem in Steins;Gate, and let's be real here, we're talking about White Fox (Akame ga Kill is not what'd you'd call a fantastic show, but it had some stunning animation).\\n\r\nAll you need in this show is a consistent animation that retains its quality throughout, we're not talking about flashy battle scenes or fluid bullet dodging moments, this is a series heavy on dialogue and philosophy, all you need is a mature enough art style to portray the characters and settings so that the viewer might take things seriously.\\n\r\nAll the characters are exact replicas of their old selves, after all, there was no major time skip or anything, which is always welcoming to the fans to see familiar loved faces, however, I feel like one thing that has become apparently a must in modern shows, it seems that every female in the cast has had an increase in her cup size. I get it, it's become a marketing tactic to add some degree of sexuality to certain characters in today's anime, but some diehard fans can never stand that, seeing old innocent Mayuri walking around with a heavy chest is never a pleasant experience you know.\\n\r\nOne other note to make is on the gloomy and cold color palette used, it's obvious that this season is darker than the previous one, a running theme with it is depression out of all things, I mean, our beloved mad scientist is living his days in a black outfit, go figure it's going to feel like a nightmare in a GTA IV liberty city, you know that game had its problems in the cold blue filter on.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\\n\r\nI would go for days praising the voice acting quality in this franchise as a whole. I mean Okabe, his desperate calling voice is very believable and on performance standards, I get shivers every time he's spitting some emotional black magic, you can feel the hardness in his throat, that weak tone of voice to get from a sick falling person. That isn't exclusive to Okabe, all other characters have their area of expertise as well, you have Daru excelling at mimicking stereotypical otaku nonsense, and there is Mayuri with her delicate innocent voice, the \u201cTu-tu-roo\u201d can never be so powerful in the mouth of somebody else.\\n\r\nThe opening theme songs were fascinating, \u201cFatima\u201d, nothing new for Steins;Gate and the amazing passionate \u201cEri Sasaki\u201d here, I mean, seriously, the first season's opening was spectacular, and this one continues on the perfection even further. The series covered a single opening theme song but one of two verses spanning equally on both parts of the series, the ending theme songs were also amazing, they sort of have that unique vibe in them that makes you beg for more, I talked about how common cliffhangers are here, these endings on teasing you more to create a time machine of your own and travel to a time in the future where you can watch the whole thing on a marathon.\\n\r\nAnd let's also not forget the soundtracks. sung by the same singer that did the opening theme songs from the first and this season, and they don't fall short on delivering the same emotionally heavy and exciting experience, I would almost argue that Steins;Gate wouldn't feel the same without these tracks playing from the shadows, they have a strong presence that it's hard to not notice them from the moment they start kicking in.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\\n\r\nSteins;Gate's character cast was always so lively, filled with unique characters, you get the innocent, the nerd, the Otaku, the feminine... and the mad scientist. However, it seems Steins;Gate 0 has denied the existence of the last one, and simply replaced the \u201cM\u201d with \u201cS\u201d, and thus, the sad scientist known as Okabe was born.\\n\r\nOkabe is thrown into severe depression, at last, he had managed to save Mayuri, but still at a dear cost of losing Kurisu. Okabe doesn't have the same charming feel to him after that, we've come too fond of the original clumsy self-proclaimed mad scientist that spreads joy unintentionally with his majestic laugh and made up conversations with his phone, nope, we got none of that here but a grieving miserable man in black clothing. However, all of that served for a final character development that was necessary to render the circle complete.\\n\r\nIt seems that even us, the fans of the original (that didn't play the visual novel, a crime I know) are greeted by many unfamiliar faces that it almost makes us not feel at home, I mean, there is the old beloved characters, but also in the mix a lot of new ones, mainly consisting of Kurisu and Mayuri's friends, a lot of them were to some degree unnecessary, and served little to no value in favor of the story, whether they were planning on doing something with them but never got the time, that will remain a mystery, but as for the way it played out, they were just there, like that piece of paper on your desk you though you're going to make use of but end up forgetting about it and is just there until somebody disposes of it or the wind plays it off somewhere.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\\n\r\nTo some extent, I feel betrayed, mildly disappointed and annoyed from the fact that I have to admit to myself that there were indeed some boring parts I didn't like during my watch, I remember the first season to be this amazing experience, but not so much from this as a general look. Maybe that's because I binge-watched the old series, but as I got on the train hype very early on with this one, I had to suffer the weekly pain known as waiting because some shows are meant to be binged as over-doses of a pleasant unharming drug.\\n\r\nThe first season will always be my favorite, Steins;Gate 0 will probably be one of my favorite conclusions of an anime ever, I'd ever dare place this next to the fantastic ending of Code Geass, it's just too perfect and makes a lot of sense, one of those endings that makes the show stuck to your head for days if not weeks. I totally loved the kind of cliffhangers we got, the sudden revelations and mindblowing realization were top notch.\\n\r\nI've already made the decision of adding the opening and ending themes songs along with some of the soundtracks to my sacred collection for what amazing relaxing material they can serve the purpose for.\\n\r\nWalking out of the whole experience of having watched this is truly a feeling like no other, I feel like finishing the trilogy of the Lord of The Rings all over again will so much lore and questions bumping into my internal skull.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (8.6/10):\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 is almost its own experience, however, watching it with no knowledge over the last installment puts it out of context, I'd highly recommend checking this out if you already watched the first season and got to enjoy it. But first, not in mind that before that you have to watch the prequel \u201cSteins;Gate: Kyoukaimenjou no Missing Link - Divide By Zero\u201d to get into the mindset of diving in.\\n\r\nOne thing to keep in mind, don't unleash all of your hopes on this one, not everybody is proud of what it turned out to be, I've also been told that this is not the complete remake of the visual novel, and even has its own unique ending, so a newer experience guaranteed, win, win I guess.\\n\r\nIf it's been a while over 2 years or something after you last saw the original, I'd highly suggest you got and give it a rewatch because somethings won't add up to you that well, the most ideal option I can come up with is to rewatch the original, and then binge watch Steins;Gate 0 with no delays, because the wat is surely to leave its deep marks on your enjoyment, it's a huge factor here.\\n\r\nIn an ideal world, we all love our share of Steins;Gate, right? in that case, have some popcorn ready, but be careful with your microwave okay?\\n\r\nHave some friends join you because you will never somebody to share the intense moments with, a lot happens, the world is lively, and the decisions are more unforgiving.\\n\\n\r\n-El Psy Kongroo.",

            "content": "Hello fellow senpai! This is my first review ever so cut me some slack! I\u2019m just a guy who loves Steins;Gate and wants to tell you my opinion on the sequel everyone hyped about. (At first...) SPOILERS AHEAD!\r\nBased on the rating I gave, I\u2019m sure you think I loved the new installment. And I did. But I did not think it compared to its prequel. Don\u2019t get me wrong it was a good story, with most of the engaging elements from the first season, like the mystery and dark themes, and the sprinkled in humor and fan service. Time traveling stories really entertain me becauseeveryone has a different theory on how it works. It\u2019s one of the most complicated things of nature, that\u2019s obviously to much to comprehend by humans. But getting back to the point no matter how similar the sequel is to it\u2019s successor, it is supposed to feel different. This is a special case because S;G 0 takes place in an alternate future.\\n\\n\r\nAlternate futures is another thing that interests me. The argument that the choices you make affect the future, and that there are different futures based on each choice is mind boggling. I mean seriously the surefire way to get a headache is learning about time travel...So if you\u2019ve seen Steins;Gate (spoiler alert), you know that Okabe saves Kurisu and Mayuri in the end, having found a way to jump onto the Steins;Gate world line (and tbh I don\u2019t fully understand world lines). Now Steins;Gate 0 is in a world where Okabe gives up on trying to save Kurisu and decides to move on, swearing to never time travel again. This story is of course kind of hard to watch because we see a depressed Okabe just go about his life. He\u2019s not Houin Kyoma anymore, just a normal college dude.\\n\\n\r\nI mean I really like Maho and am glad we got to meet her. I liked how they gave a Moeka more screen time and improvement. Daru had his moments to shine with him handling being a dad and trying to impress his girlfriend so I did like him more after this season. And Mayuri was definitely best girl this time. I think that\u2019s what I liked most from this season; the emotions from Mayuri and how much she loves Okabe touched my heart <3\\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn\u2019t like was the slow pacing and slice of lifey feel. Steins;Gate is supposed to be a thriller and I only felt that during the beginning and at the end. And idk I didn\u2019t really like Suzuha this season. I mean I know she wants to stop world war three and stuff but I don\u2019t remember her being so uptight. Also what was with that friend of Maho that was a spy at the end? They didn\u2019t really explain much about her and pretty much only showed her in that one episode in the beginning. And my biggest nitpick is FREAKIN BORING OKABE. I think that is what made this sequel less enjoyable because Okabe\u2019s crazy and paranoid personality with him always taking into his cellphone to the organization and yelling \u201cThis is the choice of Steins;Gate!\u201d Is what got me hooked on the original series. Seeing him just an average joe with a scarring past just didn\u2019t cut it for me. Of course wayyy at the end he did come back which was awesome. But tbh that took too long.\\n\\n\r\nS;G 0 was definitely an entertaining series and did answer some itching questions we had. It had me on the edge of my seat every Wednesday. Amazing music, seeing the good ol lab members and new additions, appealing art, and a great different take on the story. But you know that why they call it an alternate future. It\u2019s different from what we\u2019re used to but not necessarily better.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Well, here we are. Steins;Gate 0 has now ended. I have to say, it's been a long time since I've been so caught up by an anime. Although SG0 is far from perfect, it lives up to its reputation as a prequel/sequel of Steins;Gate.\r\nSTORY\r\nSteins;Gate 0 is a prequel set in the future. I really don't need to say more to show how ingenious this is!\r\nSteins;Gate 0 takes place after the first season (minus the last episodes), in the Beta Timeline where Shiina Mayuri is safe but Makise Kurisu is dead. Okabe Rintarou is broken due to his numerous time travels where he kept seeing hisfriends die in front of him, and this season focuses on his trying to live his life, knowing fully well that World War III is approaching.\\n\r\nThis is basically the story of the Okabe that sent the video mail in the end of season 1.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the pitch is really interesting. It dives a bit more into the apocalyptic future they kept talking about during SG. Besides, SG0 includes various new storylines, entering the themes of brainwashing and AI.\\n\r\nThe problem is, these storylines don't really tie up well. Before being an anime, SG0 was a VN, so they merged together all the storylines of the game into a single one. Sadly, this mix up isn't homogeneous, at all.\\n\\n\r\nOn the contrary, the rythme of each episode vary a lot. Some of them are really fast paced, while nothing barely happens in some others.\\n\r\nNow, this season makes up for this problem with a lot of awesome ideas. I'm not spoiling anything here, so I'll just say that many moments are exceptional.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nWhile the first season was quite disgusting to watch, this one is very clean. The animation could be better but hey, we don't watch Steins;Gate for good fights.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are excellent, and the OST is... kind of the same as in the first season. There are some variations, but we get back the themes of the first season, which are great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nOkabe is a broken man and tries to live a quiet life, while Suzuha and the other Lab Members try to change the future. New characters appear, like the American Professors and a student, Mah\u00f4, who used to be the \"rival\" of Makise Kurisu. Mah\u00f4 is tormented by Kurisu's death, and she learns to deal with her grief by meeting Okabe (who's also grieving for Kurisu).\\n\r\nAnyway, there's a lot of different characters, and what I really enjoyed is the fact that most of them do find themselves useful at some point.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nWhile I am disappointed that we don't get that much deeper into World War III, I really loved the characters and the overall story. Although the many storylines make this season quite confused, this season totally makes up for it with brillant ideas. It also ties up very well with the first season.\\n",

On the other hand, most of these moments were surrounded in so much crap that none of them felt earned or worth the effort.\r\nProgression of Plot:\r\nMany people describe the beginning of the original Steins;Gate as \u201cBoring but necessary.\u201d I would describe the beginning of Steins;Gate 0 as \u201cBoring AND unnecessary.\u201d In the early episodes of Steins;Gate 0, we barely have any interesting characterdevelopment, a complete lack of any progression to make up for that, and we have to slowly watch as Okabe mopes for what feels like forever. Every time it feels like he is about to make some progress or get better, he falls back into the rut again as if nothing ever happened. Some of the best episodes at the time were the ones that shook everything up randomly, namely the Kurisu world-line episode thing. However, these episodes were only good for the fact that they shook things up, but when looking back on them, these episodes were completely unnecessary, made little to no sense, and contributed close to nothing to the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nAfter we have half the show dedicated to Okabe being depressed, Kaguri existing, and Amadeus\u2026 also existing, we suddenly have everything dropped into a blender and spat back out again as a pale mush. Suddenly events start to happen for some reason, and the obvious bad guy suddenly is revealed to be the bad guy. We have episodes that end in a certain way, just for the next episode to go off the rails in a completely other direction. We end up having episodes where Okabe is in the future for some reason, Okabe has suddenly fixed everything, and random time jumps. The show explains WHY these events happen, but the way in which it occurs is so erratic and short-lived, that I find myself not caring when Rukkako dies or it is revealed that Okabe has been in a coma for 20+ years. A lot of these ideas are cool and interesting, but the show is so unable to focus on any of them, that all the ideas crumble into dust and mean nothing to me. \\n\\n\r\nNo matter how bizarre Steins;Gate original got, I could almost always follow it. When events happened, they made sense to me, and the show did nothing that struck me as odd or questionable. But watching Steins:Gate 0, I constantly find myself thinking things like; Why does Kaguri\u2019s arm cut off heads with little to no effort? What reason did half the cast have in still being around when they contributed nothing? Why is Faris\u2019s hair still styled and coloured the same way after the apocalypse has gone down? Why does Rukkako use a sword during the apocalypse? Why has no organization developed a time machine yet in the future?\\n\\n\r\nMany of my questions come out as nitpicks, but the fact that I am willing to nitpick this show while watching it, just shows how little I was engaged. The show didn\u2019t convince me to ignore its flaws, it ran with them flopping out, acting like they were good things.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters contributed nothing to the plot and didn\u2019t need to be here. Kaguri is the worst example of this, and the series would have been better off without her muddying up the waters even more. Okabe bounced up and down from depressed to not so many times I got dizzy. All the other new characters were ok, except also boring. No one really developed except for Okabe, but most of his development was so awkward that I didn\u2019t honestly care.\\n\\n\r\nVisauls and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe show looked so gray its funny. Because of this, every time a scene had any colour in it, it felt awkward and strange. Then again, this could have been weird because of the awkward bits of fanservice that happened randomly for no reason. In reference to sound, Steins;Gate had an amazing score that really helped support the events that were happening. It even had great sound design to compliment the harsh visuals (Think cicadas and Bright white light). Steins;Gate 0 on the other hand had a drab colour scheme with music that was barely of any note. A few outstanding tracks were scattered here and there, but these were usually remnants of pieces from the original show. Most of 0\u2019s original pieces of music were unnoteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThis show could have been so much better if it compressed some of the early material down and focused more on the development of Okabe into the future.  Back when I first watched Steins:Gate original, the video Okabe received at the end of the series was so fascinating to me. I wondered so much about the story behind this other Okabe. But when I finally watched the tape being made in the last episode of 0, I found myself feeling empty and severely underwhelmed. \\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 suffered from too much ambition, and a horrible spacing of time. So much of the series could have been improved with more focus put on Okabe\u2019s development as a person into the future. Instead we got a boring start leading up to a second half that had too many ideas. I came into this show expecting so much but found myself being disappointed at every turn.\\n",

            "content": "Originally, I\u2019d written a review upwards of 2000 words. A rant basically. I have tried to get my feelings on this \u20180\u2019 in as little a word count as possible and it still is long. Heavy spoilers in the review. And a suggestion: Don\u2019t watch. Erase SG0\u2019s existence from your memory.\r\nSo if you were like me when you first heard of this, or maybe you read the synopsis somewhere, and thought that they\u2019d cover the dystopic setting of SG\u2019s future and got all excited, well, the staff of this anime basically slapped you in your face and said \u2018F*** you\u2019. With a grin. If youhaven\u2019t figured it out yet, I\u2019m absolutely pissed that they ruined the sequel of Steins; Gate in the way they did. The dystopia does makes a cameo around episode 20, 21, and that\u2019s it. Those two were some of the two better eps of this absolutely horrendous abomination.\\n\\n\r\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not angry they didn\u2019t show the Dystopia as much. I couldn\u2019t care less. No, I\u2019m taking issue with how they ruined nearly all the characters, had no sense of storytelling with whiplash-inducing narrative shifts and a poorly written plot. See, the LN plot might have been great, idgaf. The anime didn\u2019t manage to convey the plot in any way that can even be considered average. \\n\r\nNear the start, around episode 12 or 13, the show basically completely throws away all the plot points it developed before. Now see, until this point, the show was good. I had hopes. The original was fine till that point. Then shit happened and as we all know that shit hit the roof. I thought same could be the case here. But no. At that time, one generous person enlightened me that they were basically adapting all the routes from the game. They had just gone from the Suzuha route to the Kagari route. Or whatever. Point is there was \u20180\u2019 continuity. I should have realized at that point to hold no hopes in the capability of the show\u2019s creative team.\\n\\n\r\nA minor aside: on the point of Kagari. I call her Kagabitc*. Remember Orihime from Bleach? Replace \u2018Kurosaki-kun\u2019 with \u2018Mama\u2019. That\u2019s all she is. And true to my Orihime comparison, she served more to boil my blood than to contribute anything meaningful. And the show spends, what, 6, 7 episodes on her. Threw the entire pacing off. Then there wasn\u2019t even any form of proper payoff and eps 16-19 happened. Uh, I\u2019ve never seen worse action and worse character deaths in anime and just generally, that entire part was shit. Story and animation. At one point, the show tries to become matrix all of a sudden with cringe worthy results (and stilted animation to boot). \u20180\u2019 was convinced Kagari is important. I considered her trash. That\u2019s about as much valuable word count I\u2019d like to waste on her.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I could go on and on about all the things that infuriate me about this shitshow. But I\u2019ll save you the rant. I\u2019ll focus on two instances of my disappointment towards the end of the show.\\n\r\nIn episode 20, there is a powerful scene when Rukako dies in the Dystopia, and Daru says it\u2019s a relief. Okabe looks at him (thank god he just looks and not scream his lungs off) but the expressions they all have, their cold acceptance of reality just causes him to tear up and scream not at them but at seemingly their fate. Or the sky. Who knows. Point is this was a really strong scene. It conveyed emotions more vividly than words ever could. It gave me hope, anticipation that at least the rest of the last arc of the anime would be just as well written, that there wouldn\u2019t be pointless dialogue about feelings that could have been better enunciated through expressions and actions. You get where I\u2019m going right? In the fucking next scene itself, it throws away all it has built up in terms of emotion by spelling basically everything out that the earlier scene managed to convey. And just for good measure, it has even more monologues. Hey, I\u2019m not saying monologues are bad. The first series had a lot of them. But most of them were wrapped under Norse mythos (remember those fun lines? There\u2019s almost \u20180\u2019 such cool stuff in this season), Kyouma\u2019s antics or something else so they didn\u2019t exactly feel like an exposition dump. You had to think, for a vastly better part than is required here, what the characters meant and feel. \u20180\u2019 assumes you are an idiot. Basically. \\n\\n\r\nEp 21 saw Kyouma finally return (yeah, ep 21. That\u2019s how long it takes Okabe to be awesome again. Till then he\u2019s just an angsty crybaby). And that episode was great. Still I distinctly remember even with Kyouma\u2019s return the show managed to nonetheless trip over itself. Then the abomination of episode 22 happened. \\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, he cries over killing an AI (remember the AI Kurisu I mentioned?). Like really? A program. And brah you\u2019re crying over that? What? And to make it worse, the only way the show seemed to think to make us believe this shit possible was to compare this episode with a similar one back in the OG, ep 23 I believe, when real Kurisu dies. Seriously? Back then, Okabe didn\u2019t know that \u2018Steins;Gate\u2019 existed. The reality before him was either Kurisu or Mayushi. That\u2019s what made it powerful. But now at the time of this ep he does know. By attempting to draw parallels in hopes of evoking similar feelings of strong emotion, a pretty underhanded move, they quite conveniently ignored the existence of SG world line where Kurisu is alive. They have to reach that place, that is what the entire narrative before that point had been leading up to. Mayushi has to go to the past, convince past Okabe to save Kurisu. So to enable Mayushi to do that, Amadeus has to die (I say \u2018die\u2019, but really it shouldn\u2019t be considered anything that dramatic). To spell it out, what would have happened if Amadeus was erased? Kurisu would live. An AI based on a human for the actual human\u2026 Is choosing one or the other really such a hard choice. Was SG0 trying to tell me that Okabe had fallen in love with the fucking AI as well? Huh? To further compound the issue, there is a second at the end of the parallelism when AI Amadeus\u2019 lips are focused upon, with fucking lipstick on. If you try to tell me that they weren\u2019t trying to remind you of the kiss, the single best kiss probably in all of romance anime, from the OG, then I\u2019d call you a fool. And oh, do they let the horse die then? No, even when sending a d mail (called d-rine for plot convenience\u2026 its explained, but it still kinda is ok?) they have to play this stupid issue up that somehow erasing Amadeus should hold any sort of emotional impact. It\u2019s an AI for fucks sake. And the poor direction, the overblown melodrama, definitely didn\u2019t help.\\n\\n\r\nI hope I managed to get across my feelings of intense disappointment with this season. If you\u2019re a fan of OG Steins Gate, then I can only tell you not to watch this. Let the cat die, it\u2019s not worth saving. I will say this though, the last half of the last episode is something really special, reminiscent of the epicness of the original. Gave me chills throughout. The first half was still bad though lol. Thanks for reading this really long and rant-y \u2018review\u2019.",

The episodes are very repetitive, and not much happens other than Kurisu bossing her boyfriend around and being an absolute @channeler. At least the art is tight, but a turd is still a turd no matter how much glitter you throw on it.\r\nI hate this show so much.

            "content": "Okay so this is my first time writing a review on MAL but i just felt the need to share my thoughts about this with the rest of y'all. I can't even put into words how disappointed I am with this season of Steins Gate. As a huge fan i had high expectations for this alternative story, and although at first i was like ''why but it ended with a good closure'' i was still curious and decided to check it out because i believed they would make it fun and interesting no matter what the story is about. I had fun watching the first8 episodes, the 8th episode was the best in my opinion because they made it look like it's a final closure with Makise and Okabe being the tragic hopeless character, they made it look like Okabe could finally move on and he'll surely progress to coming back to his old self and continue searching for Steins Gate or idk just do something with his life, focus on doing what has to be done. Instead, the story continues in the same way, Okabe being the main lead of a melodrama with his tragic character, everyone suddenly being in love with him, basically the anime turned into a harem with a huge dose of pathetic outbursts. There were so many unnecessary characters and stories. First, it was Hiyajo with her inferiority complex, Makise wannabe, a girl who appeared out of nowhere, tried hard to be made into an interesting character but failed and eventually turned into an Okabe's harem part, her overly annoying American professor with that cringe style of talking and just overall unnecessary and predictable, then Amadeus that looked like something that will become very important for the plot but instead served as a Makise replacement but in a shape of a virtual girlfriend, then Kagari who appeared out of nowhere looking the same as Makise, another unnecessary replacement for Makise, ''friends'' who are suddenly lab partners without any deep, real connection between the characters, feeling awkward when you see them mixed together in those forced scenes. They made all those random parties for them to grow on us, but they failed. Parties were random and unnecessary and were just an oppurtunity for them to sexualize young girls and make those random disgusting scenes. Another thing that fascinates me is the character of Kagari who was a character that had no purpose in the anime, like i already said basically a character made to look like Makise so we wouldn't feel like she's missing in the series. Her tragic story wasn't that heartbreaking since they included her randomly and basically we never knew anything about her in the first place for us to connect to her and feel sorry enough. Also, the thing that was so disappointing was the ''plot twist'' because it was everything but a plot twist since i believe most of us figured it out immediately in the beginning. Honestly this whole season turned out to be pointless in so many ways. What was it actually about?? What is the point of him going back and using that damn microwave for the last 5 episodes when the whole season was built on his ''NO I'LL KILL YOU IF YOU EVEN SAY THE WORDS TIME LEAP''. Basically he let Makise die and gave up on her and finding the Steins Gate but now he suddenly cares so much about a random Kagari, overly annoying Mayuri whose character turned into a harem material, and everyone else who was completely useless and he decides to time leap just to find Steins Gate and save them... um what even???? I mean i don't even know where to start and how to properly connect all parts of this anime into a solid review because it was so messy itself and all parts of it were chaotic tbvh. I'm just utterly disappointed and i honestly can't believe i endured through this mess for 23 episodes. I guess i did it because i'm a fan and i would feel bad if i just dropped it.. I wouldn't recommend it, especially to fans like me because this will probably just disappoint you. On the other hand, it will make you appreciate the first season and the movie even more because those were just masterpieces. To conclude, i'm giving this a 3 and even though i feel kinda bad for doing it i just have to because it doesn't deserve any better. I gave a 10 to original Steins Gate and the movie Deja Vu so.. i guess that speaks for itself.",

            "content": "Very quick review! Minor Spoilers ( although the majority of this show is dictated by season 1 episode 23).\r\n7/10 Story: this really annoyed me. it felt like for 20 episodes Okabe did nothing and then suddenly he realizes, that 'oh no the fate of the world is in my hands'. This show definitely would've been so much better if it was capped at 12 episodes, rather than being unnecessarily dragged on.\r\n The story itself was over complicated for no reason with random twists that really weren't needed. However the fact that it is a midquel to steins:gate saved it - as it explains the eventsof Okabe changing his past self with the d-mail during the first season entering steins:gate.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 Art: Art was nice and fluid, no complaints there.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 Sound: The op/ed was very unique and sounded really amazing. My favorite would be the first half's ED.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 Character: The character development and screen time was really well balanced out among all the lab members. However it did get tedious with Okabe ( referring back to the story point) how he kept ignoring mayushi. LIKE YOU JUST SACRIFICED KURISU FOR HER, AND YOU GO BACK TO IGNORING HER FOR 20 EPISODES.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 Overall: It was enjoyable to watch though. and definitely gets extremely good near the end after grinding out the slug fest start.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching it all, i'm so shocked this is rated as highly as it is. it really wasn't anything special, i'd say high 7 low 8, but 8.5+? nah. it's definitely not that good sadly.",

            "content": "\"Listen, Okabe... This world can only go to one place: Hell\"\r\n-Amane Suzuha\r\nThis Review contains Spoilers for the original Steins;Gate. I'm going to give my best for my first Review on this site, but please be aware that English is not my mother tongue and therefore I might make some dumb mistakes.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nLike once Arkada from Glass Reflection said, Steins;Gate 0 is the Sequel to what is called a \"perfect\" ending. \r\nIn the original Steins;Gate Okabe attempts to save Makise Kurisu from her inevitable death. After failing once he gets a message from his future self, telling him how he should proceed. On his second tryhe saves Kurisu, enters the Steins Gate and the story ends. Steins;Gate 0 revolves around the story of that future Okabe: The one that failed to save Kurisu. Right now the take on this genre is simply amazing. I've always wanted to see this side of the story, where things just don't seem to go right. I haven'T played the VN for Steins;Gate 0, and I'm very looking forward to see how this almost impeccable story comes to a conclusion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nJust like the original, Steins;Gate 0 is also done by Studio White Fox. I mean, the art is good, but I wouldn't consider it outstanding. I first played the Steins;Gate VN before watching the anime, and I have to say that the art style in the anime version fell kinda flat. But by all means the art isn't bad at all, it just feels a little bland at some times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part the soundtrack has a nice light hearded touch to it. But the best track by far is \"Messenger\". For me this song gives a great deep fitting vibe to it. And I also have to add that the Ending theme \"Last Game\" is totally AMAZING.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAlright. Even though we're talking about Steins Gate here, I'm not really satisfied with the characters. I mean, sure, you get your usual loveable cast of characters: The otaku Daru, the ditzy Mayuri, your average anime cat girl Faris etc. ( and not to mention the incredible development of Okabe, by going from an energetic mad scientist with a case of chuunibyou to a sad man with pretty bad cases of PTSD and depression). But to be honest for me most of the characters are surpisingly bland. I'm not really getting the class and the emotions that you need from those kind of casts. And mybe it's just me, but I would've appreciated a few more males. I mean sure, you are getting introduced to new masculine characters but the females are still a little overwhelming. I mean for someone that hasn't watched the anime it might seem like a harem anime for them, and we definately don't want to get in that territory.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, was I hyped for this show. With the airing of the first episode it seemed like that Steins;Gate never was away. Even though the first few episodes weren't that eventful, you still had that urge to come back and get more of your favorite characters. No problems here!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nWith the plot that Steins;Gate 0 is going for, I can promise you that this season will blow away every expectations a hardcore Steins;Gate fan can have. Even though after seeing 7 out of 23 episodes the pacing seems a little off, but I am really looking forward to see how this masterpeice of a  story will conclude.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWould recommend for anime watchers\\n\r\nWould highly recommend for every Steins;Gate fan\\n\\n\\n\r\n-DkF\\n\\n",

            "content": "Steins Gate 0 is a sequel to one of the best anime of all time. The original Steins Gate was a masterpiece in the art of storytelling. Unfortunately, many will undoubtedly be disappointed in this sequel, despite being decent as a whole.\r\nStory- 6/10\r\nThe sequel's primary problem is the story's direction. Steins Gate 0 takes place right before the finale of the original Steins Gate. \r\nWe follow Okabe around who is suffering greatly from PTSD as a result of the traumatic experiences he went through in the Alpha Worldline, followed by him killing Kurisu. He is a broken man and completely gives up trying to saveKurisu and the rest of the world from WWIII. This is where SG0 shines; Okabe is a great protagonist because of how sympathetic he is, despite his quirks. His pain is easy to understand.\\n\\n\r\nA couple of the episodes hit particularly hard- just as hard as the original. There are at least two episodes in particular that will leave you feeling gut-punched. Again, this is where SG0 is at it's strongest. It ties into the original series, gives you sympathetic, easy to root for characters and puts them into tough circumstances. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem is, these punches are too few. The original had these coming nonstop after the halfway point in the series; this one has two or three moments tops throughout the series. Then, you have just awful action scenes. Characters dodge gunfire- because as we all know, if you train hard enough you can do that. On another occasion, one character brutally cuts through and kills multiple trained soldiers whilst running around in the open...and the trained military just stand there and watch. The original Steins Gate did not have non-sensical action scenes, and thank god for that. It didn't have nearly the amount of bullcrap that the ones in this series had. It also didn't have the fan service this one had; some characters have larger chests, two \"you saw me nude\" scenes, and there is a cringe-worthy breast mashing scene. Ugh.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing I'll mention which works to it's detriment are needless characters. The added characters were not necessary to the story. If anything, they made the plot feel looser and all over the place at times. I'll go into more detail on this in the character section.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the story should have been about was Okabe goes through a depressive period in his life following Kurisu's death. Eventually, WWIII starts as a result of Nakabachi/Kurisu's time travel thesis. Okabe witnesses the carnage of WWIII first hand and the death of his friends, which motivates him to send a d-mail to the past once more and build a time machine. The end. It would have made for a much tighter plot and (hopefully) cut down on the poorly executed action scenes. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is usually quite good. Even the rare CGI used on Amadeus isn't bad at all. Characters are designed nicely, and they particularly did a good job designing a broken Okabe. Not many complaints here, other than a few wonky scenes (such as first few OPs with Kurisu) and a lazy action scene (but that's more to the detriment of the story than the art). \\n\\n\r\nSound- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is good. They use some from the original series as well as from the Visual Novel. It doesn't have nearly the same impact as the original series did, and there were a couple times when it even felt somewhat out of place. But the OP, ending, and most of the OST are very good. The dub is also good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI gave the original series a 10/10 here. Every character in the original served a purpose to the story without feeling contrived. They all had sympathetic circumstances and were easy to root for as well. The biggest problem with SG0 is the new characters were simply not necessary.\\n\\n\r\nKagari is just pointless. She has memory problems at the start of the series and is involved in many of the terribly executed action scenes later on. But why? Why have this character in the story? She adds nothing to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAmadeus is another. Why do we need an AI version of Kurisu? Nakabachi/Kurisu's thesis should have been enough to create time machines. Why erase that plot point from the original series? \"Memories\" shouldn't have been necessary.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally Maho. She is sympathetic in her own right, having to deal with her envy of Kurisu and a bit of a rivalry with her, despite also being good friends. But why did we need another young, genius female scientist? To create a time machine? Daru and Okabe can already do that. Hell, they did it without scientist help the Alpha worldline (although it wasn't great). She simply wasn't necessary for the plot. \\n\\n\r\nI'll tell you why these characters were added: Kurisu. Kurisu is dead in this sequel. So they wanted to find a bunch of ways to put her throughout the entire series while *trying* to make sense. Kagari looks exactly like Kurisu, but has Mayuri's breasts and personality; Amadeus is literally kurisu's memories and appearance, but has no physical body; Maho is a loli version of Kurisu.\\n\\n\r\nAdding Yuki (Suzuha's mom) is fine. I think getting to see the pressure Daru has of becoming lovers with her adds to his sympathetic character traits. Suzuha as well, who was still broken up about her mom being killed in her timeline. They could have just as easily added Suzuha's mom to the original series, but they didn't (though she has a cameo in the special episode). Know why? Because she wouldn't have added anything to the plot. So she wasn't put in. That is good storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nAs for some of the other original cast, Ruka is alright. Faris gets a bit sillier unfortunately and isn't as sympathetic as she was in the original. Daru is a bit mixed; as mentioned earlier, I sympathize with his love and daughter struggles, but his perverted jokes were also more cringey this time. In the original, he never went over the top with that; he had just enough to feel like one of your friends from college.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this might seem like a harsh critique on the characters. I like Maho and Amadeus at least, they're just used to the detriment of the story. Okabe is a fantastic protagonist, one of the best in anime you'll ever find. Mayuri's struggle with her own form of regret makes her a stronger character this time around. And although Kurisu's appearance in this sequel was short, she is still an amazing woman that leaves a strong impression. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I liked Steins Gate 0. It throws significantly fewer punches than the original series but they hit just as hard. Okabe's journey is quite a memorable one. Unfortunately, I was also left quite disappointed in the loose plot, sloppy action scenes and needless character additions. Many will consider this title inferior to it's predecessor, and rightfully so. Yet, Steins Gate 0 is still decent enough in it's own right, and deserves a watch from any fan of the original.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 7/10\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Gut-punching scenes involving sympathetic characters\\n\r\n+ Solid OST and animation\\n\r\n+ Fantastic protagonist\\n\r\n+ Good dub\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Awful action scenes\\n\r\n- Needless character additions\\n\r\n- Loose plot\\n",

            "content": "I'm coming back into the S;G 0 with only having watched the anime. I wasn't planning on watching this series - Makise Kurisu brought out the fun in the show, and not having her there seemed pointless, especially seeing how well the first season, OVA and movie rounded everything up.\r\nSo I came to the review section and found nothing that truly explained why I should watch the show, why it wouldn't be just a wallowing pit of depression. My only choice was to watch it myself (seeing how well it was rated helped, of course)\r\nCharacters: 6\r\nUnfortunately, this was what I expected. Without Kurisu, Kyouma haddissapeared, leaving a shell of the man he once was. And this is the point of the show, and is a perfectly realistic depiction of how he would be with events happening as they do. \\n\r\nHowever, seeing my favorite character, who caries the enjoyment rating from a 7 to a solid 10 all on his own, is just a plain, downright bummer. It's depressing and knowing that all this is avoidable just makes it all the more painful, in a non-enjoyable way.\\n\r\nAnd then not having Kurisu in the mix? Everyone else is a painful stereotype, and you just can't get attached to their personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe saving grace for this rating, though, has been Suzuha. Without giving too much away, she's stayed focused, and the voice of reason, and just frankly, is a total badass.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story is actually what shines in S;G 0, surprisingly. Starting around episode 6/7, every episode has some sort of twist of new development that forces you to watch on.\\n\r\nWhere this show suffers in character development, it brings up by throwing the multitude of characters through an array of happenings that hooks you, not to the actual character, but more \"Wait, this character was this?\" or \"Hah, I knew it! Kind of... now what happens?\" or \"Next episode, next episode\".\\n\\n\r\nBasically, using an already strong plot, it throws the characters in the mix as well, and makes for one heck of a rollercoaster ride story telling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nMostly what one would expect from steins gate. The CGI was disappointing and wildly unnecessary, and there are a few physical scenes which lacked a certain oomph (I'm looking at you, Braun punch), but other than that, it's pretty much what you'd expect coming from previous S;G entries.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe opening/ending themes are wonderful, perfectly reaching the bar season 1 had set. My nitpick is with the OST; it has a very distracting, amateurish track that plays whenever the characters do something 'silly', and it is very distracting and makes me headdesk each time. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nTo be frank, I have not enjoyed Okabe this season. Him depressed is just not the charismatic crazy scientist we all know and love. The saving grace is that losing best girl would do that to anyone. But yeah, not having the 2 strongest characters at their finest is a huge blow already.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment stems from the twists of the show, the new turns it takes us on, and the pacing at which it unravels the plot. I'm halfway through, and am thoroughly curious as to where in the world this can possibly go.\\n\r\nAnd honestly, that's what a successful show does, is it not? Grab your curiosity?\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I've now completed the show, and although my score still stands - since the majority of the series followed as such, the series did take a fantastic turn. \\n\\n\r\nAs one would expect from true Steins;Gate work, the last few episodes were simply superb. Feelings pulled at my heartstrings, character reached and all time high with development and the ending itself was more satisfying than any ASMR video, any soap video, any ice video.\\n\r\nSteins;Gate went through loop upon loop to finally converge on a path nothing short of epic justice.\\n\\n\r\nI applaud you, S;G. Standing ovation all the way.",

They all have their individual quirks and personalities, but they still feel like real people. Since the original characters don't need to be established, they really get the chance to shine here. They all have interesting arcs and contribute to the story. Daru in particular is a major character here, muchmore than in the original anime. The new characters are really interesting too. Maho was a well-developed counterpart to Kurisu, Leskinen was hilarious, and Shiina had a tragic and engaging arc. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was very good as well.It relates to the original anime very nicely, all leading up to a convergence that really enhances both series. There was a melancholy tone for a good part of the series, which made sense in context.

I honestly wonder how much can something we enjoyed make us turn a blind eye to every fault it produces afterwards, and why should it, since this is a different series from the first! \r\nSo what did we enjoy in the first series? Hououin Kyoma's persona, the romance with Kurisu, the d-mails to the past, and the perplexed, nuanced and dexterous story-telling. Now forget EVERYTHING, because this series has absolutely none of the things we loved inthe first, and not any redeeming qualities by itself whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nKyouma is dead because Okabe is depressed (which would have been a nice idea if handled correctly - and it was most certainly not), the romance is being ridiculed by adding Mahou and trying to persuade us that she has feelings for Okabe by shoving it down our throats, and the Kurisu AI is the main one at fault for that, the time-travelling is saved for the end and it's absolutely ridiculous, and the story-tellling is just horrendous. Almost all of the previous faults could have been forgiven if each and every episode (aside from the episode Okabe and real Kurisu meet again briefly) wasn't such a chore to watch! It was boring, the storyline with Kagari made absolutely no sense, the bad guy was cartoonish and too obvious from the get go, all the episodes were really badly structured, so none of the angst the series repetitively screamed that you should feel, managed to elicit any kind of emotional reaction from the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nLike all of the above shouldn't be considered enough, this thing is barely moving. This gets even worse when they tried to add in action scenes. It was pretty sad seeing Suzuha trying to move and do things while the budget wouldn't let her. The sound, well, it was there I guess. OP was ok. \\n\\n\r\nIf this didn't have the name \"Stein's Gate\" on it and its fame to carry it, it would have been lost in the depths of our conscience the next day it finished airing. Seeing it rank so high, I can't help but feel of how unfair this is to much better series that don't get the recognition they deserve. The first Stein's Gate is worthy of being one of the most beloved anime series to recent date. This thing here, has absolutely nothing to do with it. \\n\\n\r\nBottom line: Don't watch. Especially if you liked the first series, it will leave a really bad aftertaste. It was never needed in the first place, but it didn't manage to add a single good thing in the franchise. Just rewatch and enjoy the first series if you need a reconnection.",

That being said, it's not perfect and can still go downhill\\n\r\n from now on, therefor I'll rate it a 9 for now instead of a 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\n Not much to say here, looks pretty and fits the narrative. Nothing boring,\\n\r\n nothing out of the ordinary, solid craft.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\n Here you really notice the nature of the show as a visual novel, it's \\n\r\n thankfully toned down, not distracting and mostly fits the mood of the\\n\r\n scenes. The opening and especially the ending are awesome once again.\\n\r\n Overall still average with room for improvements during the more \\n\r\n dramatic moments that await us. What really bothers me though is the\\n\r\n terrible english voice acting. Granted, it's understandable but still breaks\\n\r\n every sense of immersion in an instant and could've been handled much\\n\r\n better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\n Every character is still likeable, some more than others though. The cast\\n\r\n feels very much unique and consistent with some new additions that are \\n\r\n overall average at best as of now. This score might increase or decrease\\n\r\n depending on how the newcomers develop. As a sidenote: Faris-nyan is \\n\r\n still the best character in my opinion and I'm glad that we get to see her\\n\r\n so much!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\n What can I say? It simply works. Even though it comes short on some\\n\r\n areas that won't keep me from enjoying every second of it. It still feels\\n\r\n like Steins;Gate and manages to bear the weight of it's success.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\n Zero does many things just right, most things in fact, still there are \\n\r\n shortcomings and the fact that at the time of this review there are only\\n\r\n 7 episodes available. If the big moments will be handled correctly then \\n\r\n Steins;Gate Zero has the potential to become a 10/10 on my list.\\n\r\n Since I can't travel back in time, my future me can't tell me if this show\\n\r\n will go down in flames or not, so I decide to rate it a careful 8/10 for now.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first ever review and please excuse any mistakes when it comes to language. I can only recommend you to watch it yourselves and hope that this review was any help for you to decide whether to dedicate your time to it or not.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When you kill the acclaimed 4 star general and then start a war with a private first class at the reigns hoping to win like the first time, this happens. Where did Hamasaki and Sato go? You've let the horses be reigned by some kids with 0 experience in directing a philosophical/scientific anime.\r\nWarning: contains slight spoilers, not that there really is anything to spoil considering it's spoilt already by horrible direction and screenwriting. \r\nThis is the worst form of deception in that the anime seems fine for the first 2-3 episodes, in fact, even feeling that it would be a half decent sequel to SteinsGate despite the replaced directors. While Hamasaki and Sato were having field days directing Orange and some other time travel anime, the series started to really go downhill from there. \\n\\n\r\n1. Okabe's PTSD was exceptionally done in the scene where he saw a manifestation of it as Kurisu exploding into a pool of blood. And then after that all he does is act sad and say sad things. Not great considering the potential shown here. In fact it starts getting on my nerve when he says the same predictable line or does the same action as he did countless times already. \\n\\n\r\n2. Foreshadowing and tension were terribly used to mislead people into thinking that something notable would happen within the first 6 episodes. Nothing did. In fact, it worked against itself to extract a feeling of protracted agony whilst waiting for anything notable to happen within. Instead, the actual curve of buildup to action or climax feels like a god damned sine wave. Throughout.\\n\\n\r\n3. Fanservice and filler episodes, which take up basically 20 episodes, I'm sure many would agree, are absolutely horrendous in content. Nothing scientific. Nothing really witty. Everything predictable with all the old and new characters thrown in to have some semblance of 'entertainment'. It might fool some casual watchers, but it will not amuse the likes of me. Not to someone who watches anime for the moral and philosophical values it teaches. It starts to become nauseatingly stale when for the eighth time within 3 episodes the camera pans to a pointless shot of someone's enhanced breast size (I have no idea why they did this, and I could only think I was imagining it until I actually went back and rewatched the first series), or a standard angle that makes you feel like you're watching some 4/10 slice of life romcom. Remember, Steins Gate 1 was realistic enough to not include \"abstract moe\" expressions, and yet, despite the second season supposing to be serious, it throws them in because why not. And then all the other characters play out completely pointless-to-show side plots. \\n\\n\r\n4. Art and direction have taken an absolute nosedive. From a noticeable dip in FPS and discrepancies in it speeding up and slowing down in frame rate when switching to background to character, everything suddenly feels jarring in comparison to SG:1. Where in SG:1 EP2 there is a brilliant slow motion of the elevator doors opening, of Okabe running madly in a black and white abstract sequence, or just any scene in general, everything feels much more fluid and smooth. And no, growing a few cup sizes does not make up for this deficit. The camera does not innovate with strange angles as was signature with Hamasaki's direction. No dutching, extreme close ups, abstract angles, CRT viewpoints, or anything that really ever seems to fit the scene. Then again, the scene doesn't even really fit the story 9/10 times. The only thing that seems to have a lower framerate than the anime is the mind of the director here.\\n\\n\r\n4. Complete lack of exposition lends to the fact that most of the exciting, foreshadowing scenes from the manga (read it, it's great and the character designs are far superior to this show's) are taken away. Then after that, the show decides to remove half the explanations for the strange happenings and past experiences of new characters enough such that no one really cares what happens to them. The parking lot shootout is not there. Kagari is hard to sympathize with because none of her actual backstory is shown in explicit detail. The USSR alternate arc is completely left out despite the seed being planted for it and an entire episode diverted to support it as a foundation. Okabe's trip to the future and back is just ONE EPISODE of leaping a \"few thousand times\", after which he seems perfectly fine. I'm sure alpha Nae would disagree. It's WW3 god damn it. Where are the nukes? Surely any nation would be like \"Oh it's fine that we nuked like 10 billion people, after all, when we get time travel tech we can just go back and stop the war from ever happening.\" Where is the development of Ruka from a shrine 'maiden' to a supposed samurai guerilla? Daru's working out? Construction of the time machine? Exactly who is fighting who? The anime leaves all these important details out. It feels like a husk of a story carried by characters with little motivations apart from being plot devices. Instead of an epic battle royale between several superpowers with dubious motivations to remake the timeline we get some Stratfor and other PMC operating in full immunity under the nose of the JSDF and being 1v10'ed by a single girl in a jumpsuit. \\n\\n\r\n5. The professor. The world's most predictable villain with a smile just too wide to be legit. His face by itself just screams \"I AM A SPY BUT YOU SEE NOTHING.\" He is far too sinister to be unexpected. In comparison to the manga, which shows him as a dorky looking harmless lecturer with light-hearted intentions, the reveal would've been far more sinister and satisfying. Huke falls hard on his part of character designing for both the visual novel and the anime on this one. Anyone could see the plot twist coming light years away. Don't get me started on his counterpart. Femme Fatale mk3 much?\\n\\n\r\nThe entire show in the end just feels like bait. Don't watch SG:0. It's a waste of time and space. It makes you think something amazing is going to unravel but then pulls the exact opposite to pull a plot twist such that excitement instead turns into a bland and stone cold disappointment without fail. Every time. If you really want something of substance go play SG:0 as a visual novel when it comes out in English. But be warned: the writing is only a bit better there. I would've recommended the manga if they finished it, but it was canceled halfway.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga I rate 8/10, at least, up to where it ended. I've never felt so betrayed in my life. If you take my 10/10 of SG:1 and divide the denominator by zero you get the score I rate SG:0 as.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, just take a look at the key animator numbers. 23 Key animators in SG:1 compared to LITERALLY TWO. YES. TWO key animators in SG:0\\n\\n\r\nSomeone has been budget cutting hard. \\n",

            "content": "I don't really care.\r\nHi guys welcome to my completely and 100% unbiased review\r\nCONTAINS SPOILERS, if you're interested in watching this sh*t show\r\nThis show spent most of the story having them f**k around, and Okabe having be depressed. They spend three quarters of it waiting for something to happen, and what we got is something so predictable and so obvious, that I swear, you must be really young to not see it coming a million miles away\r\nIt was so obvious; the American professor is going to be the bad guy. Kagari existed just to serve as cry porn, and of course Okabe had to f**k aroundfor 75% of the series until he got up and did something.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of times during the story they just rehashed things, I haven't finished this series, but I can predict that what most likely happened was the same plot point from the original Steins;gate where his friends die, and Okabe must travel back in time repeatedly to save them, so there is absolutely nothing new there.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of time spent in the series was allotted to Okabe's harem just f**king around. The new characters are all boring and bland; do I really even care about Kagari? No, I don\u2019t. Maho is just there, as far as her personality, she can be summed in two words: inferiority complex, and Mayurii suddenly became romantically interested in Okabe, because all those Steins;gate fans wanted to have it the other way as well, (while writing this, I was having trouble remembering Rukako. He didn\u2019t do anything during the entire series, and then he died, which I could not care less about because I knew Okabe\u2019s harem was going to be reassembled anyway).\\n\\n\r\nDevelopment: Okabe is lo-fi hip hop live stream anime gif level depressed, and then he learns to not be depressed and not give up (and gets schizophrenia again, because we know all the fans get off on seeing Hououin Kyouma). Mayurii decided she wants to f**k Okabe because team Mayurii was shipping them hard during the airing of the original Steins;gate.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire plot can be summed up like this:\\n\\n\r\n-This entire section that I put in the last version of this review before it was taken down, was probably the reason it got took down so I'm not putting in this time, it\u2019s too bad because I thought it was funny and it was very fun for me to write in this overall s**tpost of a review. If you are interested in what this section said, message me.\\n\\n\r\nI think it's time that people just actually look at Steins;gate 0 for what is, it\u2019s a f**king cash grab, It's poorly animated, a lot of the characters aren't explored and are just there for the sake of cry porn and making fans aroused(aroused is a substitute for a word with five letters, that starts with an e and ends with a t) as they do the same stuff they did last time except s**ttier, and waste 18 of the 23 episodes. That is exactly seventy five percent of the show. This is a f***ing disappointment, and a waste of time, it probably could have been passable if it was only twelve episodes long, because they wouldn't have had as much time to have the characters do absolutely nothing, but that still doesn't fix the fact that most of the time was allotted to Harem;gate, with the characters doing absolutely nothing but sitting around in the lab, with occasional fanservice so that the audience isn\u2019t bored, even though that doesn\u2019t work.\\n\\n\r\n I can't believe they did this to one my favorite anime, curse you White Fox. It is times like these ,when we should ask ourselves, was Steins;gate 0 necessary to the overall story of Steins;gate? It wasn't. Steins;gate was a nice, complete show, wrapped up in a little bow, but someone at White F**ckers decided that since this show did so nicely last time and got popular, how about we do it again, but this time put in half as much effort and money, that way we can make even more money. That is what I believe effort;made 0(TKB928, came up with this one, I think) really is.\\n\\n\r\n I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the original, but I at least expected something decent, 6-7 worthy, maybe even 8, what I got was horrendous garbage, with bland characters, who's personality has been boiled down to the most basic components, nothing interesting happening for eighteen episodes, and when they do happen, there usually is no logical reason why. Why did the lab get invaded in the beginning? If they were working with the professor they would have known that Maho had control of Amadeus and Kurisu\u2019s laptop, if that is what they were there for. They could have been there because they were trying to kill them, but what is the point, they don't even have a time machine, and Maho wasn't there with them, so what was the reasoning here, they can't do anything without Maho(There is no way Daru would have been able to put it together on his own), and the professor should have known that. Contrary to the original, where they were clearly invaded because of the fact they were building time machine, cause and effect is demonstrated clearly here. \\n\r\nWhy did Kagari come back by herself, without a gun? I know the lab members aren't exactly the strongest bunch, but they still would have been able to call Suzuha, or Suzuha would have already been there, like she was in that scene.\\n\r\nWhich brings us to the biggest problem I have, which would completely disassemble this show\u2019s reason for existence. In what world is it ok, to know that you are the only one who can save the world and save your gf, but you say no, literally only after trying twice, that isn't logical thought here, you have no right to be depressed if you haven't even exhausted all your visible options. There is literally a way to fix your problems right in front of you and you give up. \\n\r\nSteins;gate 0 has no reason to exist. If you like Steins;gate as much as I do, do not watch this, it is not worth it. Steins;gate 0 is the equivalent of an annoying little brother/sister trying to imitate you, but in the end, it isn\u2019t cute anymore, and just looks so dumb, that you punch them in the face. I'm done, honestly, I don't think we should give these sequels of previously successful anime a chance anymore, nine times out of ten they are just sh***y cash grabs: FLCL progressive, Eureka Seven AO and now Steins;gate 0, please stop it anime studios. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, why is Faris still wearing cat ears and hasn't aged at all in 2036, you expect me to believe a now, forty-three-year-old woman, is going to look like that. that's all, I hope you enjoyed my rant, where I repeat everything 3 times.\\n",

            "content": "Instead of discussing each and every episode of the anime, we should focus on the lessons being taught to us by the series. Following extracts from Steins Gate 0 beautifully convey the message to the ones trying to acquire divine powers (such as time travelling) and warns them how that would backfire at them and eventually lead to their demise.\r\nThe universe has a beginning, but no end \u2014 Infinite.\r\nStars have beginnings too, but meet an end of their own making \u2014 Finite.\r\nHistory has shown that those with wisdom are the greatest fools of all.\r\nThe fish of the sea know not the world of the land.Were they to possess wisdom, they too would experience decline.\\n\r\nFor humans to exceed the speed of light is more foolish than for fish to start living on land.\\n\r\nThese words are meant for those who dare to defy Natures final warning \u2014 An epigraph for their stubbornness!\\n\\n\r\n\"The universe has a beginning, but no end \u2014 Infinite\"\\n\\n\r\nTime does not end. Progression never halts. Time has a start yet can never evidently end. The limitlessness alludes to the way that time isn't just an volatile stream of occasions but in addition also contains an \"infinite\" measure of potential outcomes. It is obviously likewise an immediate association with how space is a purposeful metaphor for time. Both have a beginning however no end. \\n\\n\r\n\"Stars have beginnings too, but meet an end of their own making \u2014 Finite\"\\n\\n\r\nWe as humans contain certain \"powers\" or wills. These forces at last lead to our destruction. The possession of powers is a tragic poison. It is likewise an immediate association with how a star is like that of a human. Both have their very own powers, and that both lead to their own destruction.\\n\\n\r\n\"History has shown that those with wisdom are the greatest fools of all\"\\n\\n\r\nHistory has demonstrated to us that the wisest, the smartest that tend to make big changes by separating themselves from society are the silliest. Being \"insightful\" is the attribute only fit for the sole observer. The shrewd individual may trust he is insightful in light of the fact that he strongly believes in his standards, while another person might say that he is the inverse of that. This is the reason why those wise people, the people to use their ideals to change a portion of the world, are the most foolish. Wisdom is one of the powers referred in line \"meet an end of their own making\"\\n\\n\r\n\"The fish of the sea know not the world of the land. Were they to possess wisdom, they too would experience decline\"\\n\\n\r\nThe fish in the ocean are ignorant, and ignorance is a bliss. They don't have a clue about the world aside the ocean and due to this they don't have that intelligence that people or humankind have. They don't contain the \"power\" to destroy themselves. If they were to gain this wisdom, it will lead to their destruction.\\n\\n\r\n\"For humans to exceed the speed of light is more foolish than for fish to start living on land\"\\n\\n\r\nIt is more ridiculous that man could transcend the divine powers than for a fish to a start living on the ground. The probability that man will accomplish such powers is as stretched as the possibility of a fish picking up the insight to live out of the water. In the above line, \"humans to exceed the speed of light\" equates as a metaphor for a divine power.\\n\\n\r\n\"These words are meant for those who dare to defy Natures final warning \u2014 An epigraph for their stubbornness\"\\n\\n\r\nThis can be considered a warning to all mankind that if you overstep the boundary into the world of infinite power, it will ultimately lead to your demise. You will perish, as will all those who have attained that power.\\n",

            "content": "The genius of the original is seen not through the grandiose, but in the beautiful symmetry of its story and the subtle manner in which story elements continuously work together to such an extent that it is possible for moments to exist where only a modicum of effort is needed to convey the same grandiosity in a good show otherwise only achievable through grueling, meticulous work. As it borrows extensively from the legacy of the original, this anime certainly will not live up to its predecessor. It lacks the gripping story and strong characters from the first, and its overarching theme of mind control ismore superficially presented. But between its uneven pacing, inconsistent animation quality, and the partially successful attempt to merge two stories into one, an inevitable consequence of the difficult-to-ignore scheduling and production issues, great moments still shine through, tying loose ends from the source and occasionally reminding us why we adore this franchise.",

            "content": "A decent ride that ultimately falls well short of its esteemed predecessor.\r\nStory: 5\r\nAs you may already know, Steins;Gate Zero takes place in a world where Okabe ultimately fails to rescue Kurisu. By no means a horrible foundation for a sequel. The problem is the way in which the story unfolds, or oftentimes, does not. For a relatively short series, there are times where the story goes nowhere and meanders down pointless routes. The bulk of the main story does not get going until the last ~5 episodes and leaves you wondering about the point of the first ~18 episodes were, as large chunks had littleto no impact on the way the final ~5 episodes played out. The story just seemed to be all over the place and the pacing was very inconsistent. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe character models are all fine to above average and fairly expressive. It's basically what you'd expect if you have seen the original. Outside of that, I was rarely wowed by the animation. In fact, some fairly pivotal scenes were pretty underwhelming for such a big-budget production. Overall, I'd rate the art pretty good, but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nDefinitely the strength of the show. I absolutely love the OPs and EDs and the voice acting is still fantastic, even if it took a little getting used to the new, less colorful Okabe. Certain piano OST tracks, specifically the one you'll hear at the very end of the series, I found hauntingly beautiful. They nailed it in the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters are mostly all back from the original, with the obvious exception of Kurisu, and I honestly don't have a ton to say about most of them. Although it was nice to seeing Mayuri step up and play a bigger role in the story. The largest addition is probably Maho, the loli scientist and senpai of one Makise Kurisu. I found her an interesting character, in that while she was Kurisu's senpai, she always felt overshadowed by Kurisu's brilliance. The show often drew the parallel to Mozart and Salieri, with Kurisu playing the role of the prodigal Mozart and Maho as Salieri, the one constantly running, but ultimately failing, to get out of Mozart's shadow. In a way, she had to step in and take Mozart's, I mean Makise's, place as the person in the group as the \"actual\" scientist. She was a good addition, despite the fact there were stretches she disappeared from the show. Kagari, another newcomer, was frustratingly underdeveloped and too often came off as a human plot-device.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the main character. While I did say most of the main cast besides Kurisu came back, I think you could also say the titular \"Hououin Kyouma\" is long gone as well. He is replaced with a more somber, serious Okabe Rintarou. The events of this particular timeline have clearly left him a broken man. His delusions of grandeur have made way for a more pragmatic and stilted outlook on the world around him. So we know the main character has changed, but is it change for the better or for the worse? I don't know if there's a right answer to that. One might be more drawn to the entertainment the old Okabe provided, and another might be able to empathize better with the more grounded, realistic version. Personally, I fall into the former. While I appreciate why Okabe is why he is, I can't help but wonder what makes the current Okabe stand out anymore. He came off as very vanilla most of the series, with only a few hints of his old self popping back up near the end. Overall, I liked the cast, but did not love them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nSteins;Gate Zero had neither the fun moments of levity nor the tension and despair that the original had. The action sequences were not as well-executed as they could have been to boot. Throw in an uneven story, and it can be a bit rocky. Honestly, a large portion of my enjoyment came from seeing characters that I fell in love with onscreen again. There were brief moments of brilliance, but they didn't come often enough. Overall, I had a good time watching, but certainly not a great time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI'm assuming you'll see some reviewers give this is a comically low score out of frustration or an attempt to make some sort of statement, but this is NOT a bad anime. It's just not a GREAT anime either. And nowhere close to the original. \\n",

            "content": "Seven Years.\r\nSeven years is the time period between the release of the original Steins;Gate Visual Novel and the release of Steins;Gate 0. This gap made me extremely nervous for the quality of Steins;Gate 0. Often a long period between releases is a bad sign. The more subtle or intricate details of a story are often forgotten or remembered slightly wrong. Sometimes it's an indicator the new media is a corporate cash-grab lacking the heart and soul of the original, successful entry.\r\nPlease be warned this review will contain spoilers for Steins;Gate, however it will avoid spoilers for Steins;Gate 0 as much as possible.\r\nI'm beyond overjoyed tosay neither of those concerns were an issue for this wonderful anime. Steins;Gate 0 picks up the mantle of Steins;Gate perfectly. The story takes place right after the protagonist, Okabe Rintaro's original failed attempt to reach Stein's Gate in the final episode of the original Stein's Gate anime/the end of the VN's True Ending. It explores a worldline where Okabe Rintaro was unable to save Makise Kurisu and is too mentally scarred to try the second time, leaving him stuck in the Beta Worldline, that is the Worldline that hosts the World War III future.\\n\\n\r\nThe story picks up from this point featuring a morose Okabe. He's not the character we are used to. A man without hope. A man damaged by countless failures and countless instances of seeing his friends die or robbing them of their happiness in order to try and secure a better overall future. Hououin Kyouma is all but dead. Many events unfold in the Beta Worldline that will not be discussed here in order to avoid spoilers, however the events are simultaneously entirely new, whilst avoiding any and all contradictions against the original series. The storytelling is of equal, if not outright superior, quality to the previous entry. Every character acts consistently with the personality laid out for them, never acting in a way they shouldn't for plot convenience.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is superb, featuring consistent quality every damn frame and a host of stunning visual effects, including but not limited to gorgeous night skies. The soundtrack is nothing short of a masterpiece. I would be hard pressed to call it the greatest soundtrack of all time, however every single moment the sound design of this anime is utterly enthralling. Every mood, every moment, every event is fully captured and conveyed in a way the visuals and dialogue alone never could.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Steins;Gate 0 adds up to a worthy seq... midquel? to Steins;Gate. It's a one of a kind piece of media and hands-down the best anime I've ever watched.",

            "content": "After re-watching Steins;Gate 0 I was able to fully grasp the show, and quite so I enjoyed every moment of it. As much as the show portrays a lot of sadness and regrets, We all got what we wanted in the last few episodes , It was no doubt a very exciting , spine-tingling and tense ride especially in the last few scenes got me shouting in my room like a madman. \r\nAfter seeing the last episode of the show it makes me want to re-watch the original series for the third time. That's how good it is. Everything is connected, I want to sharesomething I think very valuable I learned from the show, and that is the concept of \"Never Giving Up\". We see it in all kinds of shows and materials but seeing it in a show in which I love makes it even more effective.\\n\\n\r\nBut what struck a chord in me is when it was portrayed in a show like Steins;Gate not only does it have exceptionally great characters, exceptionally great story telling and mystery, a somewhat acceptable, reasonable view of how time travel can possibly be true and romance in which the blend of it with sci-fi is perfect , It as well can motivate someone to do something big with their lives. It's around those final few episodes where we can feel and see the full effect of the entire show's build up and release. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance in the show I believe is one of the biggest things about it that makes it great. The relationship between Okabe Rintarou and Makise Kurisu as well as Itaru Hashida \"Daru\" and Yuki Amane more portrayed here in zero than it's original counterpart whilst Okabe's and Makise's more defined relationship in the original series. The theory of relativity is so romantic isn't it? \\n\\n\\n\r\nWith our main protagonist Okabe Rintarou giving out lessons the viewer can take out and use personally in real life. Not only is it limited to our main protagonist but also has solid , well built , very enjoyable and unique characters to which all in their own rights has their purpose, they play a big role to the enjoyment of the show without them it would be melancholic and lackluster. \\n\\n\r\nI would also like to point out the opening and ending songs of the show. Some people skip the opening and ending songs of an anime for reasons such as \"spoilers\" or \"waste of time\" but for Steins;Gate in this case I believe that this was a great addition both are incredibly well done. It connects with the viewer when understood reading the lyrics and helps in building up it's atmosphere and mood.\\n\\n\r\nWith the right mix of romance , drama , mystery , sci-fi , comedy , intensity, thriller and straight out madness Steins;Gate is definitely a must watch for all anime fans who loves such genre's science fiction , romance and such.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Steins;Gate 0 is a masterpiece. It's very fulfilling from the first episode to the last episode, I hope to see a continuation though it seems that's not going to happen. \\n\\n\r\nCome and begin to love and appreciate the show that is Steins;Gate. And for-see how he overcame with his not so normal problems through trial and error, and his adventure to world domination and destruction. Through time and space through thick and thin he proves himself to be, In the end victorious. See for yourself the greatness that is of the mad scientist Hououin Kyouma.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll be in for quite a ride. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI end it off with a quite so used catch phrase. \\n\r\n~ El Psy Congroo. \\n\\n",

Steins;Gate 0 is more of a Sci-Fi Drama than a Sci-Fi Thriller, if you are looking for suspense in par of the original, look elsewhere.\r\nThis anime is best viewed in tandem with the S;G 0 Visual Novel, as some crucial scenes are in the Visual Novel and some scenes are unique to the Anime. There are some side stories that the anime picks up only for it to drop a few episodes after and never get fully explored, but then again S;G 0 Visual Novel is harder to adaptinto an Anime as it follows a more non-linear path than the original S;G.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, if you are not bothered about the direction the anime is taking in the middle episodes and is okay seeing the Future Gadget Lab doing Slice of Life then i'm pretty sure you'll enjoy S;G 0.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, i think Steins;Gate 0 is a story worth telling, and the journey that Okabe and the Lab Members take adds depth to their characters, and it's ending is one of the best story tie-ins i have ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nAnime Only - 9/10\\n\r\nVN & Anime - 10/10",

            "content": "After watching the original Steins;Gate and falling in love with the character that is Hououin Kyouma AKA Okabe Rintarou, I just had to write a review about its follow-up series Steins;Gate 0. This review contains spoilers, so be aware.\r\nThis show tried so hard to be like its predecessor and live up to its success, but in the end, it fell extremely flat. Every charm the original series had was forced into Steins;Gate 0 with a half-baked story that went nowhere. In the end, what you're left with is a lovable cast of characters with no development or much progression whatsoever. It's like time-leaping over andover again without trying to change anything; it's tiresome, useless and very disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the story first, shall we, or better yet, the lack there-off. You've got twenty-three episodes in total and when the story starts to kick-off at episode sixteen, you know you've messed up somewhere. Unnecessary sub-plots, filler-episodes with no progression of the story whatsoever and just straight-up fan-service all wastes your precious time watching this show while you think: ''where does this series want to take me?''\\n\\n\r\nI think the pacing is really what kills Steins;Gate 0. The original was slow in its first half too, but it was filled with interesting characters, funny moments, a lot of experimenting with D-mail and the science behind it and just overall development of the characters. Almost none of this is present in the first fifteen episodes of Steins;Gate 0. \\n\\n\r\nThe show redeems itself after that, though. The change in pace is so enormous that it threw me off in the beginning. You go from slow and dull to fast and enjoyable. The only reason why the story did score a 6 for me were these last episodes. Granted, the story is still convoluted, predictable and not very original, but there was purpose and progression, and the ending left me smiling despite me having to force myself to watch the first fifteen episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the art. Honestly, I very much enjoy this art-style and especially how the eyes are drawn. It gives the characters a very lively expression and it conveys their emotions pretty well. The different backgrounds you get to see occasionally were pretty awesome too. The animation, however, was far from superb. The characters move so slowly that you're surprised when you see them running from time to time. This has to do with the slow and dull pacing of the first fifteen episodes of the show; the animation just puts emphasis on it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter episode fifteen, you get a few quick action scenes which are decent and fun to watch, but still nothing over the top that will leave your mouth open. It's watchable, but I've seen much better, and since this is an anime from 2018, I expected a bit more fluid and smoother animation.\\n\\n\r\nNow the sound hits home to the original series. When a character is doing something silly, you get the appropriate background music with it. When you're watching an emotional scene, you get the sad music alongside it. It gets the message across most of the times how we should feel when watching a certain scene, though for full effectiveness, you actually need to care about a character, and oh boy, did we get a lot of useless characters.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, Steins;Gate 0 tried to force all of the charms of its predecessor in this series, but I think it failed big time in two regards:\\n\\n\r\nOkabe Rintarou. Really, they turned this beloved character into a former shell of himself. What made the original so enjoyable was his over-the-top delusional characteristics when he slips into ''Mad scientist Hououin Kyouma!'' It was the driving backbone of the series and why the first half worked with no problems even though it was slow. Now though, he's sad scientist Okabe Rintarou who has given up entirely. This character has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. He's dull, boring, one-dimensional and has no development at all. Just watching him sulk for so long was so aggravating. You won't believe how much I laughed when he finally turned into Hououin Kyouma again, but honestly, it was a little too late for me... way too late. They should've turned him into Kyouma again way sooner, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nMakise Kurisu: the other character that should've played a much bigger role in this series, even though she's reduced to an AI called Amadeus. Christina is Kyouma's anchor, his lighthouse on the shore. You could make a 100 episode shounen with the two just spending time together and doing silly stuff and it would work, because they have that much synergy together. I was fine with the decision to turn her into an AI, but why give her so little screen-time and character? It's like they forgot it's because of these two characters that the original Steins;Gate was such a success, and you basically throw both of them down the drain for the follow-up series? I really can't believe such a foolish decision.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the rest of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuha Amane actually plays a bit more of an important role than in the original series, which I kinda like. She got more screen-time, and some cute and much needed development with her dad, but sadly, that's all she gets. The rest of the time, she's there because she needs to be there, and her character in itself isn't very exciting. \\n\\n\r\nItaru Hashida, or Daru, was the main comedic relief, and I'm glad they didn't really change his character. In fact, I think they did a better job with his character than in the original. Good father/daughter development and some development with his love interest really made this character shine. Other than that, he's still the same Super Hacker with the inappropriate comments that make you laugh every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nMaho Hiyajou is the first new character we're introduced to, and frankly, she falls short, both literally and figuratively. She was made to be a substitute character for Christina, but she's so focused on Makise and how she is better in every sense than her that she really never feels like an enjoyable character. Making her a loli tsundere with a spicy attitude doesn't really help in that regard. Her character went nowhere and in the end, she really was like Salieri: Christina is just way better.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about Katsumi and Kaede. Why are they here? I understand why they added Yuki. She doesn't get a lot of development and only exists for Daru's and Suzuha's character development, but she works fine. The other girls are total cardboard cutouts with no personality. They don't add anything.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about characters who don't add anything: Rumiho Akiha and Ruka Urishibara AKA Faris and Rukako. One is literally fan-service while the other is literally fan-service. In the original, they both had dreams and played their part by altering timelines respectively, so you get to know more about their characters and their motivations. This follow-up does nothing for both characters. They are there for no reason other than fan-service; very unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nMayuri Shiina, one of the girls who played a bigger part in the later episodes, but really didn't do much in the beginning episodes. It's sad that her character is basically: ''I love Okarin'' and that's it. \\n\\n\r\nMoeka Kiryuu and Yuugo Tennouji, AKA Ferdinand Braun. I wish both played a bigger part in this series. I wanted to see both of these characters work together with Okabe more to unravel the truth about the organisations who were after Amadeus and the time machine. Sadly, we don't see too much of them.\\n\\n\r\nNae is just there because: ''Look, a cute girl!'' and Kagari... she was just the biggest disappointment. What a boring useless character to add. No character, no reason to be there other than for a cheap ploy used by the bad-guy. Speaking of the bad guy.\\n\\n\r\nAlexis Leskinen and Judy Reyes. The former is a hilarious character that did his job well, other than how his plan was executed, because that was a total disaster. We all saw it coming from miles away. And then Judy Reyes... Again, no development, she's just there and gets killed. What a waste.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, you have a cast with way too many characters, poor decisions to waste a lot of screen-time on characters that don't need it, and also waste a lot of screen-time on doing absolutely nothing to progress the story.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Steins;Gate 0 is enjoyable and very disappointing at the same time. It's a double-edged sword that captures Steins;Gate very well starting from episode sixteen. The question is: do you have the willpower to watch fifteen episodes of nothing before experiencing that same high Steins;Gate gave you?\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, they should've done a few things differently. First, cut the nonsensical filler episodes so you get a tight, well paced sixteen episode follow-up instead of this awkwardly paced twenty-three episode follow-up. Second, integrate Christina way more into the story, and give her as much screen-time alongside Okabe as you possibly can to develop their characters. Third and most important: spend only four episodes or so on Okabe being depressed, the other twelve should be filled with delicious 'Mad Scientist Hououin Kyouma moments' to really make this follow-up shine.\\n\\n\r\nAs it stands, I would recommend this series to the die-hard fans. For people who just enjoyed the original, I'd skip this follow-up entirely.",

            "content": "[STRONG SPOILERS]\r\n\"Hiyajo Safina\" - Okabe Rintaro\r\nWhen Steins;Gate 0 was announced to start in April 2018 I was extremely excited, mainly because I absolutely loved the original Steins;Gate and would give it a 10/10 rating any day of the week. Simply put, I was extremely disappointed mainly because of the slow story progression and obsolete character design. Since this anime aimed to be a successor to the original Steins;Gate and to expand in the same universe, it's only fitting that we rate this anime based on WHAT IT TRIED TO BE, and how much it failed.\r\nStory - 5/10\r\nFirst of all, the concept of having a storythat leads to the ending of the original anime is pretty interesting, and comes with its own expectations. Starting off with Steins;Gate 0, I was mainly curious on 3 pivotal things that we saw in the original's ending: 1. How did Okabe manage to send that video message to himself, and how did he figure out that makise kurisu was saveable? 2. Why did mayurii change her mind and slap okabe the second time he came out? and 3. When will Hououin Kyouma come back? All of these questions were answered, in very underwhelming ways. For question 1, we actually see absolutely no explanation as to how Okabe even managed to figure out that Kurisu was saveable. All throughout the anime and even with the original failure of saving kurisu, it was clear to him in his mind that she was absolutely unsaveable and that it was a convergence. After seeing Dr Nakabachi with his paper on television, and on the absolute final moments of the anime, for SOME REASON Okabe sends this video back to himself without even knowing whether or not kurisu is even saveable. He didn't do any work, he didn't do any investigating, and we as the audience were left to just take it for what it is. For question 2, the answer to that was simply mayurii going back in time for a moment to call herself and tell her past self to save her hikoboshi. Simple. The manner in which they handle time travel in this anime isn't nearly on the same level of impact and intrigue as it was in the original anime. Question 3 leads us to the best (and only good) scene in the entire anime, where we finally see Okabe return to his roots. However, this scene was bittersweet as the entire buildup of the whole anime just didn't make any sense. This guy just time leapt over a thousand times, and we have seen how time travel can affect this guy. NOW he becomes hououin kyouma? Not after Suzuha blatantly warned him about WW3 multiple, multiple times???\\n\\n\r\nLooking back at the anime's plot and overall progression, we can see that it DESPERATELY tried to be on the same level of suspense and interest as the original anime, but completely felt like more of a parody than actual steins;gate. Not only is 'time travel' replaced with 'petty drama', but the moment the plot starts progressing anywhere, we are given a clich\u00e9 fanservice scene, since Steins;Gate 0 has a whole lot of new waifus to choose from. Multiple cliffhanger scenes in the anime were sad attempts at creating a \"goosebumps-inducing\" moment, where they specifically use the same suspenseful music/sound effects from the original steins;gate. A strong example of this is the scene where Kagari sees Mayurii and collapses, notifying the audience that Kagari is Mayurii's adopted daughter, finally found. Although... we've literally seen flashbacks of kagari millions of times before that scene, so we LITERALLY knew who she was no matter what. This anime seems to take itself a bit too seriously.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, too many plot holes exist in this anime, and i'll just list out a bunch of my own here;\\n\r\n- When the timeline shifted on the rooftop with Maho, what changed in the worldline? We know that events changed because kurisu said he called her, but THEY DID NOTHING WITH THE TIMELINE CHANGE?\\n\r\n- When okabe swapped into the Alpha worldline with Kurisu for a brief moment, what caused that? What was the plot change?\\n\r\n- Why did the timeline not change when Okabe sent the video to himself in the past? Is that not what d-mails or emails do?\\n\r\n- What was the significance of the video that Daru sent to Suzuha on the rooftop? Why did we NEVER see the full video?!?!?!??!?!?! OR WHERE IT CAME FROM???\\n\r\n- There is another cast member with reading steiner, if all of you remember from the hospital. Why did we never see any more of her, or any significance? Reading steiner is no joke in the universe of steins;gate.\\n\r\n- We saw glimpses of Okabe in the future, even when he was in the past. What was the reason of this? Why do we never get insight on what actually happened to him when he was captured in the future?\\n\r\n- After time leaping over a thousand times to get back to the present day, WHY is he not affected by this? No nausea? No depression? No anxiety? He just BECOMES hououin kyouma?????????\\n\r\n- So... does okabe love mayurii after this ending? Or kurisu? Lmao.\\n\\n\r\nToo many flaws can be seen if you nitpick too much, but you all get the idea. To me, this anime was too flimsy to even take seriously. Still giving it a 5/10 because it does work out and makes sense from beginning to end, but I seriously don't understand their choice of progression.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle does not stray too far from the original Steins;Gate, and has a few extra special effects and blooming here and there. They capture the world of Steins;Gate properly and effectively without making any drastic changes, and I see no problem with giving them a perfect score for art. However... I'm going to take 2 points off for the absolutely horrendous action scenes that we saw with Kagari and Suzuha near the end of the anime. Not only does Kagari live with dozens of bullets inside of her, but she chops off two guys' heads with her wrists? Are you literally kidding me, steins;gate? Is this some kind of sick joke?\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nKanako Itou, an absolutely great artist, singing a lovely OP and really capturing the essence of the anime, and gives nostalgia from the original anime. Nothing bad to say about her. In addition, Steins;Gate 0 offers a totally new soundtrack that sounds amazing and fits the theme of the anime perfectly well. I'm glad I was able to listen to some nice tunes while crying on the inside of how disappointed I was with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to introduce you all to what I believe is the worst flaw of this anime. The plot itself actually works out fine, don't get me wrong. However, every single character in this anime is portrayed as a weaker shadow of how they were portrayed in the original anime, and the new characters feel meaningless in certain ways. I'm not stopping here. I'm going to explain what I think of every single character.\\n\\n\r\nOkabe - We were introduced to a heartbroken Okabe from the start and it made sense for his character. His sulking about kurisu made sense and his mental destruction was apparent in his hallucinations and hysteria and fear of time travel. All of this made sense from a personal perspective, but this charade went on for a bit too long. There already were rounders striking at their party before Mr Braun ex machina showed up, and even when he found evidence of Kagari being brainwashed, he still stood adamant on not time travelling. Only after he witnesed mayurii dying, would he change his mind. But this honestly feels like a forced way to change okabe's mind, and makes me dislike the show more than i already did. \\n\\n\r\nMayurii - Mayurii is the best character in this show no matter what, and just plays her role extremely well. Nothing bad with her, its just that all of the other characters revolving around her were pretty weak. Mayurii number 1.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuha - Same old Suzuha, but she should have done a better job at convincing Okabe to time travel IMO. This is the only character that actually stayed exactly the same between Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0.\\n\\n\r\nKurisu/Amadeus - Not sure if this counts as an actual character, but the fact that we don't see kurisu revived at the very least in some worldline at the end, seems a bit weird. Regardless, they managed to keep Kurisu's character intact, so I'm very grateful for that. Since she was reduced to a side character, hopefully the new main characters that replaced her are better... right?\\n\\n\r\nDaru - We can keep daru's cliche otaku rants and jokes, but the inclusion of Maho made this cliche skyrocket out of EXISTENCE. Not only that, but all of a sudden he became a super hacker with a secret base and everything, that we've never seen in the original? You don't just change a character like this. Romantic daru and future daru, on the other hand, were both cool additions.\\n\\n\r\nFaris/Rukako - Useless in comparison to their original portrayal in Steins;Gate. These two accomplished absolutely nothing in this anime, and Rukako just died in the future for a goosebumps scene, only to be brought back ANYWAYS because okabe time leapt. What?!\\n\\n\r\nMoeka - So she isn't pseudo-evil anymore, and just becomes a well-endowed girl who follows orders and gets groped by faris in one scene. They completely ruined moeka, and just made her find a brainwashing place out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nMayurii's Friends - I don't remember all of their names, but more waifus are more waifus. Although, one of them had READING STEINER... Did they actually just leave this out of the plot entirely? You've got to be kidding me.\\n\\n\r\nAmane Yuki - Even though she's my personal waifu choice of this anime, we have to be objective here. It was a running gag that she was the woman behind the mask, up until it was revealed to be Kagari. Then she fell in love with daru and appeared in a Suzuha flashback where she just died. Anything more than that? Nope.\\n\\n\r\nMaho - The strongest new character, she makes sense as a partner to Kurisu that feels inferior. I accept maho as a character, although the design of a woman being literally half the size of okabe to appeal to lolis and create millions of cliche fanservice scenes? That, i don't accept. Regardless, maho is one of the only good characters in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nLeskinen - Not sure if everybody was like me, but I knew this guy was evil from the beginning. However, the only exposure we have of Leskinen being evil is just in one recurring scene on the rooftop when mayurii and suzuha try to enter the time machine. He runs the cliche where he explains his ENTIRE plan. Then, okabe just decides to time travel back and eventually taze him. Seriously disappointed with this character TREMENDOUSLY. He was pretty funny regardless with his accent, so that gave some enjoyment in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nKagari - So she was a vessel across time travel to transfer information, and had a strong attachment to Mayurii. All of this makes sense, but the order in which they introduced Kagari and multiple parts of her past just seemed really scattered and nonsensical. I believe this character could have been utilized in a better way, since she has a lot of potential. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, you all need to see where I'm coming from. The original Steins;Gate had a purpose for every single one of its characters, and all of them tied into the plot tremendously, creating new levels of emotion and experiences. However, Steins;Gate 0 attempts to keep the old characters while introducing new main characters into the fray. This entire jumble of characters in Steins;Gate 0 leads to the original characters being overall weaker (which is a very bad idea, considering the original characters of Steins;Gate are the ones we care about the most), ontop of the newer characters just having questionable designs. I just didn't feel nearly as attached to any of these characters as I did for any character in the original Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nNear the start of the anime, I started with 100% juice. I was extremely excited and wanted to witness the brilliance and magnificence of Steins;Gate once again. However, a slight leakage of my juice started after the first few episodes because nothing interesting was happening. About 80% of juice was there up until the first worldline change, but every single fanservice scene that the anime threw at me made me lose approximately 20% juice. At the halfway point of the anime, I actually was at 0% juice and had absolutely no hope for this show to actually entice me anymore. I watched this show to laugh at the plot, actually. Leskinen's lackluster villain design ontop of his accent that made the show even less serious in the critical plot points made me just laugh. The entire fight scene between kagari and leskinen's goons just made me stare in disbelief. I was actually scratching my head in confusion when mayurii and suzuha got hit with the missile, instead of actually having an emotional affect. I instead watched this show as a joke near the end, so I'll give it some enjoyment points.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime felt more like a fan parody of Steins;Gate than an actual successor or sequel-esque show. This anime was literally a depressing rom-com with a steins;gate expansion pack that included all of the characters. The director of the anime then thought to themself \"Hmm, I know how to make money off of 2018's anime community\" and decided to include various fanservice scenes in an anime that solely relied on emotion and drama and personal conflict to survive. This anime did not reflect on anything that made the original Steins;Gate amazing, and took steps back in the lessons of character development and steady plot progression that it taught. I feel more content with the overall Steins;Gate storyline if I pretend that Steins;Gate 0 actually never happened.",

            "content": "Time is a dangerous quantity.\r\nOne realizes that when sequel anime is released 7 years after the first series.\r\nSPOILERS (from SG and SG 0, duh)\r\nI'll start by claiming that SG 0 is mediocre version of original SG, while it even feels like parody sometimes. But that in no way means, that it is mediocre anime. If I say it's mediocre version of one of the best anime I've seen, it means it's still above average among every other anime.\r\nStory follows Okabe and rest of the original characters after events that happened in 23rd episode of the original series on alternative path. Okabe is depressed, show hasmuch darker atmosphere and that is to be expected. But unfortunatelly it doesn't handle this very well. I'll go through list of things that made me experience not such a good ride.\\n\r\nAmadeus, a system which is center of action in this anime, is explained rather poorly. AI designed with such technology rises many question, but only few of them are answered. It's the same thing with time travel and such things are mostly theoretical and extremely complex to a point of creating thousands of paradoxes so for the sake of the show, it's perhaps better as it is, because it would take atleast 50 episodes to give a solid explanations and possibilities to viewers.\\n\r\nNow for the real problems that can be avoided in any anime.... Pacing of the show, characters, music, etc.:\\n\r\nOriginal SG had the same problem with pacing, but surrounding circumstances made it easier to suck it up and ignore that. This one, though, had much more flaws, hence it made story progression a huge pain. Show starts off slowly and it gains its wind by 15th or 16th episode which come after majority of the show is already out.\\n\r\nIt shifts from drama to comedy and vice versa extremely inappropriately. As far as I remember, SG contains first 12 episodes as world-building base and rest is a wild ride of dramatic and intense moments. SG 0 forces ever changing mood from happy slice-of-lif-ish atmosphere to very heavy one and the happy moments just don't feel right most of the time.\\n\r\nSome of the scenes are just low effort, in my opinion. I had the biggest laugh of day when certain girl destroyed whole chopper by spraying her SMG from bellow after not being hit once by helicopter's shots.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are easily another mess. Steins;Gate's main cast was made up by Okabe, Daru, Makise, Mayushii with side characters like Rukako, Ferris, Suzuha, Moeka and Braun. Steins;Gate 0 adds Maho, Bad Professor, adopted daughter of Mayushi, future wife of Daru and bunch of more girls making it so much harder to focus story on any of them. When there's anime with 23 episodes, you can't get enough quality backstory on that many characters and especially when world lines change and lives of original cast do too.\\n\\n\r\nI guess they could use more dramatic music - or whatever happened to it - during dramatic or epic scenes. Iconinc OST from SG was remade or used only occasionaly and new tracks were average at best. Opening is also bit of a step down from the original one. Japanglish levels rised in this one, but that could be overlooked for the voice acting was just phenomenal. Despite me not enjoying Okabe brooding through depression in majority of episodes, VA captured it perfectly. Everyone else acted fine and this element of the show was probably mostly well done.\\n\\n\r\nI can't really hate on the animation. For a show with little action, it looked okay. Nothing amazing but they didn't ruin anything and characters looked like they were moving and their hair was waving in the wind sometimes, so a standard. Not too bad, I must say.\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, I wasn't expecting this. I knew it would be hard for this anime to overcome its predecessor, but I wanted more than a dark fan service cake. It didn't taste good. I believe they could've handled it much better. Still a worthy piece to watch, I guess. Rating it by anime standards, this deserves atleast a 7/10.",

The Steins;Gate 0 VN had a few plot holes, sure, but nothing that really ruined the experience. I was hoping the the anime would fix those plot holes of even find ways to avoid them all together somehow. But they instead created even more by following the source material only half the time and doing whatever the #@$% they felt like the other half of the time. By doing this they have numerousinstances of starting a subplot that ties in with the main story but just dropping it without any resolution. The original anime and VN gets a 10/10 from me and the S;G 0 VN gets a 9/10 from me, but the S;G 0 anime is kind of awful and get a very generous 6/10.

            "content": "A sequel by it's definition, is a piece of media which it continues the story, can expand the world, it's characters from it's predecessor and yes by definition Steins;Gate 0 is an interesting look back into the Steins;Gate franchise, this sequel for LA is a special case of a meandering sequel that was rather disappointing but had it's slight glimpses of greatness.\r\nLook, LA loved Steins;Gate and thought it was masterpiece of a time travel anime back in the day and still do and Steins;Gate 0 WON'T tarnish this fact all due to how Steins;Gate 0 fits into the timeline and has only like one smallaffect to the original series, but as much as LA wanted to see more of the Steins;Gate franchise, this wasn't how LA would see it as.\\n\\n\r\nMild Spoilers ahead...\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 focuses on Houon- *ahem* Okabe Rintaro in the timeline where Okabe stopped time traveling after his botched attempt in saving Kurisu and essentially choose Mayuri over Kurisu, Okabe became sad non-scientist but it's not until he meets Maho Hiyajo voiced by Sayuri Yahagi an interpreter for the forum presentation of Amadeus, an AI able to store a person's memories, Steins;Gate 0 is how this all leads up to that video text message from the original series.\\n\\n\r\nLA might as well get those \"glimpses of brilliance\" out of the way first. So what Steins;Gate 0 does to expand it's world is through it's character development, new and old, some of the best character development comes in the form of Daru as he tries to both connect with Suzuha BUT also Yuki Amane, if there was someone who got his lion-share of character development then it's Daru and he mostly deserved it considering the original series where he was usually the butt of most jokes or was mostly system control. Because of Daru getting the limelight it also gave more to Suzuha and her dilemma's with the time travel machine as well her own gripes about Daru and Yuki as a result but more importantly what she is gonna do once the time machine is fixed. New characters like the aforementioned Maho gets development, mainly due to her being a colleague of Kurisu gave herself something of an inferiority complex to the liking of Salieri to contrast with Kurisu as Mozart and looking into Mayuri's view of the entire situation and the events that occurred within Steins;Gate 0 that better than her original series counterpart due to her larger involvement in the plot and her breaking out of her *ahem* hostage persona. Now LA did leave out Okabe in all this, as his disdain of even using or mentioning the time machine having dire consequences comes up thus his disengagement to the bigger scope of the plot, but in all seriousness all this is leading the plot to Okabe finally re-emerging as Houonin Kyoma and seeing that transition was done extremely well. As for what Steins;Gate 0 did for the time travel aspect, LA did find some of it's uses unique or at least subverting expectations in how it was used and at least not interrupting or largely affecting other timelines all that much to make it a stable timeline as much as the time travel wasn't used all that much until the latter half but still it still stands.\\n\\n\r\nSo what made Steins;Gate 0 the \"meandering sequel\" that LA felt after watching it, well as much as LA saw the character development of several new and old characters greatly expanded on, it did at times feel like filler to pad out the anime, but good filler nonetheless, the other more annoying element of Steins;Gate 0 is that of the tired cliffhanger, that of which REPEATS itself for lesser and lesser shock value, look LA felt the major cliffhanger during the near final arc of Steins;Gate 0 was done to death and fine \"repeating\" makes sense because time travel sequel but it wears out it's welcome as soon as the second iteration, the other cliffhangers however doesn't get mileage as it's either dealt with rather quickly or the build up isn't worth it as we ALREADY KNOW IT ALREADY due to all the obvious hints given to us during the build up. Kagari...Kagari voiced by Megumi Han was just a major plot obstacle and fillery character to meet a quota for LA as well. LA really didn't see much reasoning as to why she was even in Steins;Gate 0, yes we find out later but even then, she for LA was something of a double agent, both in-universe and meta-wise in terms of what she was doing here, look, she WAS suppose to fill in for the Kurisu stand in appearance and all but in terms of the larger plot, she had links with Mayuri and Suzuha but it's when she finally KNOWS what she means to Mayuri is when she becomes the major obstacle for BOTH villain and Okabe that she was just the unpredictable factor that NO ONE WANTED. Yes we get backstory on her and she has major involvement in the plot, but all in all, LA saw Kagari as such a wasted potential with little or confusing turning table of heel-face turns that LA just didn't care about her and even remembered her all that much as a result. On speaking of the villains...well let's get that out of the way, in the original series, the \"villain\" was FATE ITSELF, but in Steins;Gate 0, it's one cackling megalomaniac scientist-like villain who takes centre stage and really we knew he/she was the villain with how much Steins;Gate 0 built itself up with the inclusion of this new character as well all the hints leading up to him/her and guess what, he/she just wants world domination using the time machine to kick of World War III that of Suzuha's dark timeline, if anything fine he.she is suppose to contrast to Houonin Kyoma in this respect but how this major villain is portrayed is NOTHING compared to fate itself and what this even meant in the grand scheme of Steins;Gate universe, the major villain outright is a small blimp and an almost embarrassment to Steins;Gate 0. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Voice work were all to be expected really. the animation done once again by White Fox still had it's original counterpart aesthetics down pat with it's intrinsically distinct character designs and the such, the fair few \"fights\" shown in Steins;Gate 0 was actually somewhat gorier than it's original counterpart to what some of the characters are capable of..well it's not the darkest timeline for nothing but still LA was surprised by it to say the least how edgier Steins;Gate gotten. Voice acting wise, Mamoru Miyano gets the bench due to him being Sad Okabe but him getting back to Houonin Kyoma briefly was great on his part, Yukari Tamura, Tomokazu Seki (Daru's VA) and Kana Hanazawa gotten mileage due to their inflated screentime and LA didn't really mind it. Megumi Han as Kagari was fine as the amnesiac girl but like LA felt about Kagari as a character, Megumi Han was underutilized even in Kagari's majorly involved plotlines and Sayuri Yahagi as Maho was decent enough and she had similarly good chemistry with most of the cast, especially Tomokazu Seki and Mamoru Miyano. Overall, production wise, Steins;Gate 0 was pretty strong on this front at the very least...LA just couldn't say the same for it's plot and characters -sigh-\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 was an extremely hard sequel for LA to judge, with LA being nostalgia blinded at first seeing all the characters back in whatever form or different timelines etc. but taking off those blinding glasses as LA kept seeing Steins;Gate 0 aping the original series, for both good and bad reasonings as LA listed above and really as much as Steins;Gate 0 doesn't affect the original series, expanded the Steins;Gate universe and it's characters for better but with fillery execution, and for the most part, keeps it's time travel aspects within it's own rules with new time travel elements to keep that stable timeline, LA just can't help but seeing Steins;Gate 0 as \"meandering\". Sure you can see the original series as meandering during the first half as well but during all those \"meandering fillery\" moments, had itself hidden plot elements that latter on had a flow on effect and a larger scope to the plot at hand that made both it's meandering moments and it's time travel aspects be more cohesive as a result, Steins;Gate 0 on the other hand was a meandering mess as it tried to develop it's new and old characters, tried to bring in hints but hints we could easily predict and it wasn't until the latter half when anything truly happened that had some connective tissue to it's  previously mentioned plot lines and true this might be because of Okabe's reluctance to shun time traveling  in any means possible but that plot point doesn't excuse what it resulted in...a tired and worn out cliffhanger that was aped from the original, different scenario, same \"defying fate\"...this time longer and more drawn out AND an embarrassment of a \"major\" villain in human form that made Houonin Kyoma look professional.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate 0 wasn't the Darkest Timeline for no reason BUT LA will say as much mud LA flung at this sequel and LA's multitudes of problems LA had for this sequel it overall as much of a meandering mess it was, LA just found it...just \"ok\" and that is probably the worst thing to say about a sequel trying to expand it's universe and all that results in is an \"ok\".",

            "content": "[100% spoiler-free]\r\nFirst of all, this show was great, there is no way I wouldn't recommend you to watch it, as long as you have seen the original Steins;Gate of course. But as great as it might be, it doesn't come close to the masterpiece that Steins;Gate is.\r\nAlthough it's well written, it feels as if the writers forcefully tried to follow up that masterpiece, which Steins;Gate undoubtedly is, with another one, no matter what. Even then, they did manage to write a great story, a story that *should* be very surprising and unpredictable.\r\nI'm saying *should,* because although it was really unpredictable by logic alone, I managedto call basically most of the major plot twists, some of them at the very start. Not by analyzing and thinking a lot about it, but just simply by thinking \"What would happen next if the writer was forcefully trying to be absurdly mind-boggling?\" Then I just said the first thing that popped into my mind out loud each time, and probably 90% of times, if not more, I was correct, even though there was no hint or reason for me to know what would happen.\\n\r\nIt's still very well written, managing to write a story like this without any major plot holes is impressive, to say the least, and requires a story-writing genius. But they shouldn't have forced this story this way, Steins;Gate was a masterpiece as it was, this doesn't necessarily improve it in any way.\\n\r\nIf this hadn't been forced into the Steins;Gate storyline like this because of the show's popularity, but instead made into a standalone story with spontaneous and natural ideas, it would have ended in a masterpiece, 10/10, straight A's. But like this, I can't give it full marks, therefore I'm giving it a 9/10.",

I will not tell any events which will happen. \r\nIf you liked the Steins;Gate Movie you should watch this season as well. \r\n\"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\"\r\nSteins;Gate 0 literally is Much ado about nothing.\r\nWith some new introduced characters, the series continues at the part where season one ended. It wants to show a colorful atmosphere with much life in it. This part is done pretty good and I would have suggested the original writers of thenovel to leave it here and just make a comedy series of it. Unfortunately Steins;Gate 0 wants to be taken seriously and that's where the slaughter begins. \\n\\n\r\nFirst I want to say that the story is pretty interesting and has gotten one or another complex event.\\n\\n\r\nIt tries to revive the epic parts of the first season with only weak results. My most beloved topic the mysterious exploration of time mechanics isn't shown anywhere here. So instead of a mystery show this becomes a Thriller.\\n\\n\r\nThe dark and brutal happenings to Okabe Rintarou with a huge ton of tension is completely erased here. We will see an Okabe who is not willing to do anything in regards of story progression.\\n\\n\r\nFurther more there will be a lot of emotions. Maybe you will find yourself crying like an infant like I did during season one. For myself I wasn't emotionally touched here so much. These moments are quiet authentic but after you realize that this stylistic mean will repeat itself in almost each episode I can guarantee you that you will find yourself in a spot where you will feel pretty much bored.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Steins;Gate 0 has an pretty interesting story which wasn't presented in a good way at all.\\n",

            "content": "Mehhh is the feeling it leaves me with, \r\nI enjoyed the show, but I felt it lacking, it seems like it could of been much more. \r\n(Minor spoilers ahead, and vague outlines of the show) (I try not to mention any specific names or details)\r\nWatched for the sake of steins;gate, Episodes 1-3 meh 4-6 ok, 7-10 pretty good, 10-13 back to meh 14-15 pretty good again, 16-17 climax, actually great. 18-20 horrible action, 21-22 revival & good action, 23 unfulfilling but decent ending. Waiting on the OVA to make it all better.\r\nCharacters - 7\r\nWell done characters,, ferris is annoying, I despise her costume and theytook the cat thing to far,, Also not enough development of suzuha and karguri or of the main villain, the rest are passable, I mentioned okabe and myuri below, but hashida was well for being the dad to suzuha all but that line he yells stopping her from hurting a man. Dumb choice,, and well maho I liked the short girl she was well done and I had zero complaints about anything with her, she felt like the original steins gate characters more then any other steins gate character which really realllllyy says something about the bad choices made if nothing else here does. The cross dressing guy and the texting girl moeka had almost no development, besides her texting and that kid having a sword in the future, they were useless characters.\\n\\n\r\nOkabe good besides depression, Hashida still fun besides excessive pervyness, Suzuha ok but a bit strange on character, Kaguris past was the better part of her but we got almost nothing for her and not so much of her actual character either besides her doing whatever she does,, & Maho and a lot of the side characters are all enjoyable characters but some were still left without anything to say, Amadeus is decent enough as a program to accept, and kurisu gets almost no screen time besides her memory's as the app.\\n\\n\r\nokabe being sad he gets over it but not until the last quarter of the show, they added a lot of fluff, the character developments and funny moments are good but the other half is just them talking about nothing, they do that in the first season but not as much as they do here, the first 16 episodes could of been the first 10 or 12 still a bit long but it would of gave you the feeling of okabe being depressed which they did that well with his depression and his revival, but it wouldn't of dragged on out until you hated him, \\n\r\nThey tried though the only issues is his constant collapsing and yelling myuri or ahhhhhh ahhhhh a lot, or not being able to walk on his own because depression.... yeah...., it should not have been that dramatic and they should of put a bit more detail into his other world lines and how depressed he was in those because they seem far worse then he is in this one, to some lines it sounds suicidal almost, that would have really sunk in how low he could go past rock bottom, compared to us seeing him half sad and half alive for 16 episodes, felt to meh he should of been fully depressed or been at least climbing out of it, and he does but it just didn't feel like it was done very well......\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nIt is a good idea, I wont stay long on this, but everything they did was right I liked the story, it just needed summed and the ending needed to be dragged out instead of being so fast paced, they should of fast paced the beginning of the show instead. What really failed the story was defiantly the directing and a decent amount of writing, but the directing to for sure.\\n\\n\r\nI understand that a lot of slice of life is steins gate but most of the fluff wasn't fun or interesting, usually it explained something or had a purpose, this time it doesn't serve any purpose, thats why I found half of the drama wasted potential and why I feel 6-8 episodes could of been cut to spend more time on the future and on the war, it didn't have to be in the future during the war, but I did feel that they could of did more time leaps in the present day and had at least a few deaths or something actually impactful, and yeah its not an action anime, but your main storyline is about sparking world war three, there should of been more development more risk, more plot or something,\\n\\n\r\nand finally yes this isn't the original steins;gate but holly hell man, the original had multiple storys and a lot of thought put into the different worlds and possibility's, only a few leaps and you fixed things this season though? Yeah he had to do a lot to go back in time,,,, but as far as changing the present he did about 4-5 leaps to fix things this season compared to the 50 leaps and probably 30 to 40 something worldlines we had seen before, again this is on okabe being depressed but it should of have spent at least some time explaining the war and some of the background details to the war, they barely say anything about it, and yeah it did a little but really it was 30 seconds here and 30 seconds there and they repeated a lot of info over and over like we would forget. It was bad writing.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the episodes towards the end brings up that russia and america are fighting for a time machine but we know that from the start soooo..... whatever to that....\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5\\n\r\nBad directing, the action was horrible, Although a few shots to people was dramatic and felt pretty intense, but alas, it holds nothing to the edge of your seat feeling you got in the old steins gate. And for a show coming out literally 7 entire years later... Is there really an excuse to why the action should be this shit???? No... No there is not, it should of been better and if they would of removed half of the guys I mean I know your going for bigger and better here but you don't have an army of hero's to work with so why bring an army of bad guys that are impossible to defeat,\\n\r\nAnd then defeat them with shitty animation and it still being impossible, you just made it possible because you can and who gives a shit about good directing//writing am I right? Wrong, action isn't the key point of steins gate, but if they would of stepped back, slowed down and thought it out, they could of turned it into a smaller and more impacting edge of your seat experience, and it could of been enjoyable instead of mehhh, because it was meh and it makes you feel meh when watching it. \\n\r\nMy expectations aren't high, but its 2018 and 2004 anime that had lower budgets then you still shit on you in every sense of the word.\\n\\n\r\nOh wait wait, I remember the action made it a 7-8 = 7.5 Wanna know what made it a 5??? The fact that every single girl even the younger ones, within six months time go from flat chested and slightly curvy and respectful lovely woman, to still lovely and respectful women that somehow grew tits three times their size. From double AAs and Bs to Ds And possibles Es Or Fs??? Why because thats mature and thats how you develop a show, and thats what everyone who watches steins gate wants to fucking see... Wrong!!!!\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nGreat, the opening song is the same, until the end although the animation changes and the ending animation changes but so does the song, however I really liked the first ending song for the first 12 episodes it sounded really nice and I liked the choice of words to some degree. That orbit of photon and universe line isn't that great but the voice pitches are well done.\\n\r\nThe sounds in the show is always good, everything has a sound mostly and even the background music is well done, there are a lot of songs in the show however none are English and as such I usually don't comment on those as I don't know what they're saying.\\n\\n\r\nWriting // Directing - 7\\n\r\nGood writing --- They use a metaphor of the Japanese and the story of tanabata, you can find that on wikipedia the story doesn't spoil steins gate it makes you realize why myuri calls okabe her hikoboshi \\n\r\nAlso for the show they did well with the scene where she confronts okabe about her choices. And some of the ideas with mozart and other things.\\n\r\nMyuri was mostly written well I enjoyed her character and she helps okabe so that was really well done with her story.\\n\\n\r\nBut when maho yells at okabe to try to find steins and half of the dialogue by okabe sounds good but all maho can do is give metaphors, and some are good but most are shit.\\n\r\nbad writing again would be --- That they also failed at the villain as mentioned below and at the don't shoot him line mentioned above, and half the characters looking and acting the same 10 years later aside from hashida.\\n\\n\r\nalso a shitty villain reveal, I accepted this though, what grinds my gears was the girl wasn't allowed to kill him before they were going to switch timelines and after she killed like 20 other people, it was a dumb line, she should of slit his throat or kept beating him to death. The villain was obvious but there could of been some foreshadowing and there wasn't a need for that dramatic, lame and cliche speech of his plans.... He literally comes out of no where and is like hey I'm the villain, but at least it wasn't the shitty shitty titan reveal of AOT that was total trash compared to this reveal.\\n\\n\r\n& ferris Her maid outfit looks better and should of been her outfit like it was in the first. She is honestly just so annoying now, it was a character I enjoyed but I now despise on a new found level... She was enjoyable from episodes 15 onwards, the cat jokes stopped mostly and she dressed more normal, which was an improvement to say the least.\\n\r\nMost of you can deal with her, but I just had a personal hate this season for her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nI did actually enjoy this show, it was fun, its just like my intro said though, the episodes start out slow and then get better then go back to slow then better to almost great then slow a third time to not meh but somewhat decently good & then finally its the end and you feel unfulfilled with the end because it seems we will need an OVA to get the rest of the story, although its an ending it isn't the very very end ya know.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7 (Minor Spoilers)\\n\r\nI watched this in like 2-3 days so I like this show a lot like I said.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing okabe in the failure state he is in, was pretty interesting, it was cool to see it from another view and to see the new characters I liked maho and if kaguri could of had some story to her she could of been cool, they wasted her time on fluff instead of her past.\\n\r\nSeeing okabe become his old self was funny and fun and enjoyable the show is self aware to its actions and its bad choices as well when they acknowledge how much of an ass okabe is being and the bad choices he makes and even when he trys to give up a second time they come right out and say wtf? You just traveled back and your gonna go right back to giving up, like nah dude you seen that shit didn't work. So at least it acknowledges things like that, that people find to be annoying, and it makes it a bit less annoying that they come out and talk about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnding was forced though, or whatever you wanna call the feeling the ending gives.\\n\r\n----Final thoughts, defiantly worth a watch, its not a 9-10 like the original, but its a 7-8 I'd say, I gave it an 7 just because it did get better and I didn't hate it when I finished it, unfulfilled yes, but I did not hate it no and I did not regret watching it, there are a lot of complains but at the end of the day. I'd rather have seen this story of steins gate then to have never known it to begin with.... And if the OVA fixes it, it might get an 8!\\n\\n\r\n---I guess what really pisses me off, I'm sorry I repeated myself in this review, look at me complaining about fluff and adding my own here... But what really pisses me off, and what made me write this, is that this show is steins;gate, the purpose of it is to find steins gate, and they spend almost no time doing this, I liked the chess game and the different worldlines and the endless possibilitys and I know okabe isn't the man he was, but myuri bringing him out of depression meant it could of been done sooner and we could of spent more time having something a bit more impactful and interesting,\\n\\n\r\nYa know?\\n\r\nThanks for reading... Later dudes &..Later, my loves, - GodOfWolves.",

It was that episode where Okabe travels forward in time, when the world is in ruins and destroyed by WWIII. But also they ruined that episode by killing Rukako in the most unimaginative way. Also it didin't have any dramatic effect at all so your reaction to it is just EH. \r\nThere was one character that had become more progressively worse than any othercharacter and that was Mayuri.

            "content": "To cut to the chase, I will just state my score: 6/10. I normally don't give 6/10 to anime unless I drop it mid-way, but I couldn't drop this one because it was Steins;Gate(OMG). Even though throughout the whole length of 24 episodes I was put into a cliffhanger only once (as far I can remember), my curiosity got the better of me.\r\nSo why is it so low? The sound production and animation is so poorly done compared to season 1 and some other animes. Did they change their producer? (yes, the staff is different this time around) In this anime, they need to learnfrom Shaft with their Bakemonogatari series. More instantaneous cutscenes of the sky, a long shot of Mayuri standing by the rails. Something has to feel more magical. It's not just the art. the music needs better and more magical OSTs. That bassy electro sound with a slight horror feel with a catchy tune is missing. The OST has to make things more intense. Overall, the animation and background sound effects were not top-tier.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation feels like it was poorly prepared, and was created as if it was meeting a deadline, lacking inspiration.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, it feels like this anime was low on budget.\\n\\n\r\nNow the plot. No twist midway in the anime. It's just one stagnant plot curve that slowly (very slowly!) goes up and ends there. The whole anime is like a filler to explain what happened between episode 23 and 24 of season 1. The problem is it shouldn't be like a filler. It should be its own stand-alone product that doesn't require season 1's sentiments and feelings - you know what I mean? It's 24 episodes of explaining. It's as if the anime is explaining to me, not entertaining me.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the plot was mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to bash on Steins; Gate too much so some compliments:\\n\r\nIt seems that this season did well in trying to incorporate all the routes from the game into the anime. This season has a happy ending and complements well for episode 23 and 24. Finally, I guess I finished the season with more love for the characters than I had before.\\n\\n",

            "content": "For 22 out of the 23 episodes I watched, I thought I was watching a completely different series.\r\nWhile some may say the first half of the og SG was boring, dull, and too SOL, I loved it more than the gripping narrative of the second half, the characters were so lovable that I could just watch them mess around forever. The lab members and their daily conversations and sometimes sneak peeks at their inventions made them such endearing characters that I was sure that I will forever love these characters.\r\nWell, I was proven wrong, SG0 single handily destroyed that impression. Okarin became a wojak, anempty shell of just showing one emotion in his existence. Mayushii was just there to love Okarin. Daru went from an otaku creep that sometimes does amazing shit to a dad, at least he's a dad that won't turn his daughter into a dog. Despite all this, I liked Christina role, her being an empty AI is a huge difference from the old tsundere girl that goes on 4chan all day, makes Okarin miss her, and makes me miss her. Other LabMems were not only uninteresting and unappealing, they just didn't feel like they were there when they were in a scene. And Mr.Braun, being one of my favorite things about the second half of the original, was just kinda there to move the plot when he was needed in SG0.\\n\\n\r\nAll the previous were just character comparisons, I'm not going to compare the story of the original to this one since I honestly couldn't find a plot for the majority of SG0 despite it seemed to be pretty plot driven, and I'm not a good writer. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the new characters, Maho, Kagari and the professor (others can be excluded though I did kinda like that one episode where Daru go on a date). Maho is pretty cute but inferior to Christina in every way and the show is fine with her just having that status quo, the professor is a plot tool, and so was Kagari, this is kinda it to the new characters. \\n\\n\r\nScores\\n\\n\r\nArt 3, sometimes it looks good, but majority of the time it's pretty ugly to look at, there weren't really any interesting shots to cover the poor art, and the animation is downright awful at times, but steins gate was never about le epic sakuga fights.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7, music was good as always, but were repeated a lot, I clearly remember one episode where the same track was played back to back within a couple minutes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2, 1 extra point cuz of my nostalgia \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is same as my overall, 5\\n",

I have seen the original and the show itself was really amazing. I would not call it a Masterpiece cause I don't call many Anime Masterpieces. Now lets talk about this show.\r\nStory 7/10 \r\n  First off lets talk about the story which is pretty good but nothing special The story takes place in an alternate timeline to the ending of the original Steins;Gate series. In this timeline Kurisu Makiseis dead it is pretty much Makise dies or Mayuri Shiina dies. These 2 girls named Suzuha Amane & Kagari Shiina\tcame from the future to stop WW3 in this timeline which involves around the time machine which Makise built. Just watch the show and you will see.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\n  The art is like any other Anime nothing special but it can be good at times. The background characters don't move much and that is what I look at to see if the animation is good. The Art is just that anime art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\n  The sound is probably the best part of this show. It tries to bring everything to life and I like that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\n  The characters aren't as good as the original Steins;Gate imo they still have some shining moments but for the most part nothing to special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\n  As much as I would like to give this a 9 or 10 like the original Steins;Gate I just can't it seems like it brings nothing new to the table and at times it is really boring to watch. That does not mean I hate the show that isn't the case at all it is just that It is not as good as the Original Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nThe overall score I will give it a 7 because it was a good show nothing great or amazing just good. \\n",

            "content": "Taken from my instagram:\r\nSteins;Gate 0 is interesting as it has no reason to exist but manages to be surprisingly brilliant at times and equally bad at others. It is more or less a step down from the original Steins;Gate in every way but this isn\u2019t as bad as it sounds since the original is a 10/10 masterpiece. So what is Steins;Gate 0? It\u2019s an alternative timeline in which Okabe failed to save Kurisu. This is where the first problem comes into play, Kurisu isn\u2019t in this season. Arguably the best and most interesting character is absent and all that is left is a cast ofcharacters that pale in comparison to their former selves. Watching Okabe wander around depressed for the best part of 24 episodes was not interesting in the slightest and only served to ruin what had previously been established about his character. Even the addition of his black suit meaning to represent his dark state of mind came off as heavy handed. That\u2019s my biggest problem with 0, everything is heavy handed and lacks the subtlety that the original had. It may sound like I\u2019m complaining a lot but the problems with 0 are a lot more obvious than the positives. Overall, the best thing about 0 is that it still has the same characters and a lot of the same plot points and in turn is still fairly enjoyable. I am fully aware that I have a bit of a bias for this one since I am such a massive fan of the original, hence the 7.1 score. However, I felt it was important to show that I am fully aware of 0\u2019s positives and negatives. (7.1/10)",

            "content": "The original Steins;gate series was my gateway drug to the world of anime, and what a drug that was. When I first watched the original show all those years ago when I was still in high school, it brought me to tears at 3 am on a school night because I had to know what happened. Steins;gate 0 is a return to the characters I loved, and as I matured they also have matured. The sequel, or I guess a \"midquel\" because it really fits in between series, is a loving, mature, depressing story of growing up. (Also, mild spoilers throughout). \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nOur story beginsmelancholic; Okabe, in black? Gone was his white coat, gone was his demeanor. He has become almost normal, in a sense, if not completely depressed. Steins;gate 0 teases you like the first season, but in a different way; no mystery, just sadness. But as the story progresses, characters introduced, major events happen, everything starts to shift towards the tense moments Steins;gate is known for. The story arcs and curves and splats on the wall a few times, right when you think it all makes sense they throw another \"time conundrum\" into the mix and we're back to pausing the episode, thinking what exactly do the implications of such an event mean? I haven't rewatched the original Steins;gate since its release 6 years ago, but I still had a solid grasp of the story, and I think you will too. To be fair I've never been a huge fan of time traveling because of how convoluted it gets, but Steins;gate always explains it in an eloquent way despite its sometimes messy storyline. They easily could have simply copied the first season but they didn't, opting for a fresh take on events that have already happened, all while a mature cast struggles against the inevitability of failure. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nJust like how the characters mature, the art matures too. It's smoother, more intense, well drawn, and up to date. The animation flows and weaves, with amazing facial expressions and wonderful shots of Akihabara in all its techno glory. Not to mention the \"Lab\" is still the same lab we fell in love with 6 years ago. I really don't have much to say here other than its a joy to watch the art, especially with its very dull color palate, but every now and then bright colors splatter the screen and you can't hope but feel hopeful for the beleaguered lab members. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, while not as epic as the first season, keeps the mood in check. The ED also is very sad and slow, indicative of the new change of pace this season has tried so hard to portray. This is a very lovingly crafted bunch of songs, and it shows. The background music, especially towards the end, changes subtly until its reaching a crescendo, a climax as the show reaches its peak. And the music, if anything, lets the mood really punch your gut. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI think, what compels me to find Steins;gate my most loved anime of all time, are the characters. Some of the minor characters really are one dimensional, but the solid few the story focuses on have some of the most tragic, romantic, hilarious character arcs I've ever come across. Okabe Rintarou, nay, HOUIN KYOMA is the pinnacle of the seven stages of grief. He constantly cycles through them in this show, alternating between abject despair and...well more depression. But there is a redeeming quality about him that needs to be unlocked, and glimpses of it show through the cracks of his armored psyche. He drives the show simply by being so, so human, so relatable. Sometimes, we as a society expect our heroes to be flawless, without feelings of despair or depression. But if we were thrown into such impossible situations, we would most likely clam up and lay down, hoping for someone far braver than us to fix the problems. Okabe is ourselves in a mirror, how we would react to such situations. And what we hope to strive to be, in our wildest fantasies. Okabe is me, Okabe is you, Okabe becomes the hero we all see in ourselves at the lowest point of despair. \\n\\n\r\nMayuri, rightfully so, becomes far more important than a simple cute side character from the original season. Besides a wardrobe change, she flowers into an adult, far earlier than she should have. Despite not quite knowing what's going on, she has an innate ability to pull together the disparate lab members and deeply cares for Okarin. She becomes a perfect foil to Okabe, not in terms of an enemy, but an embodiment of all that he knows and loves. This timeline wouldn't be the same without her. \\n\\n\r\nSuzuha, Rukaka, the newcomer Hiyajou, Daru, and others - if allowed, I could talk about them for hours on end. But I want to cut the review short - these characters all mature and grow like the series did over the years, and it's nice to see them all interact again in this world. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSteins;gate 0 is perhaps my favorite anime of 2018, a pure labor of love that shows in the brightest of ways. I didn't know I wanted a sequel to my beloved first season, but I'm so glad I got this. Seeing how I essentially grew up with this show, and it had matured in ways like I did, made the whole experience that much more poignant. Honestly, you should watch the first season before diving in this, and it does start off slow and deliberate like the first season. But it ratchets up the tense moments and becomes a truly magical thriller ride through time. Thank you, Steins;gate 0, for allowing me to relive my high school days while simultaneously maturing in such a deep way. This is truly the choice of Steins;gate.",

I love the series to bit, it brings me to tears each and every time I watch it.  And so, I find Steins;Gate 0 to be a disappointment of monumental terms.  Truly, to take something so great that it transcends an entire genre and becomes something else, and it to turn it into another mish-mash lousy sequel is soul crushing.  That's not to say that Steins;Gate 0 is a bad anime - far to the contrary, it is excellent attimes, but to be quite frank it should never have happened.  It leaves me with a bitter taste.  If they  had written the middle few episodes better, or if it had just straight up ended on episode 13 it would perhaps fit better but in the current form, I unfortunately find the sequel/prequel/side story that is \"0\" to be a disgrace to the series.  Watch it at your own risk.",

            "content": "Okay so, warning: \r\n1- English is not my first language so forgive my errors!\r\n2- This review is spoiler-free and it's mainly for those who've already seen the prequel to this anime because I won't be too detailed on facts you should already know about the main series.\r\nAlso,  I'm an hardcore S;0 fan and I was hyped as heck for this serie, it's my third favorite anime and I gave it a 10 but still... well, what I think about this sequel is on this review so let's move on...\r\nStory 5/10\r\nOh oh oh a 5! Yeah there's a lot to be said about this. Iam really, really disappointed about this sequel's story. Let's go straight to the points that I don't like: the plot was just a big mess, there are many facts that hadn't been explained too well and were hard to follow, there are countless plotholes (that mainly focus on characters but that's for the next section), the, let's say, \"mastermind\" behind all of this was really predicatable and I can say that the only episodes which I actually enjoyed were episodes 1-2-3-4-21-22. Honestly, the episodes in the middle are full of pointless details and feel like fillers. Some twists about the characters were good but other ones didn't make sense, the pacing was awful and again, it really was hard for me to accept this because I LOVED the plot for the first serie but this one... a disappointment. I liked the overall atmosphere and the twists that happened at the end but the experience of the whole season was difficult to digest and overall boring.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWEEEEEEEEELL well well, this section of the review is going to be interesting to write down. So, I'll structure it like this: firstly, I'll give a rating of the characters in the previous season and then those of this one. \\n\r\nOkabe 10/10- S;G0 10/10\\n\r\nDaru 7/10 - S;G0 8/10\\n\r\nMayuri 7/10 - S;G0 4/10\\n\r\nKurisu 9/10\\n\r\nSuzuha 8/10 - S;G0 7/10\\n\r\nMaho 8/10\\n\r\nSupporting Ch. 8/10 - S;G0 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI will talk just about the main characters and the supporting characters in general.\\n\\n\r\nOkabe. Okabe is my favorite character of Steins; Gate and there's nothing to say about him if not: he's one of the best written character I've ever met in an anime. In both seasons Okabe shines in his development, his personality and charme even if in this one he radically changes. He's constantly moving, he's pure emotion and he's always fighting between giving up and keep fightning, life and death, changing the past or staying in the present... he's one engaging character that is the main reason why I could still watch S;G0. Seeing his development throughout the Steins;Gate serie is probably the best experience you can get from S;G0.\\n\\n\r\nDaru. Daru is our fellow friendly otaku friend that is also a super hacker and Okarin's best friend. Their relationship feels full of support and understanding each and every time you watch them interact. Daru as a character is essential in S;G and he gets a little more spotlight in S;G0. A very good spotlight. \\n\\n\r\nMayuri. Let's be blunt. If I didn't like this season as much as the first one it's because of her. I liked her in the first season. She had this friendly,wholesome relationship with Okabe and was such a sweetheart. Her screentime was enough for her character and she was overall likeable, not counting the too-too-roos. IN THIS SEASON instead... there are... things about her character that I didn't appreciate. She got way too much screentime and she became sickingly recurrent. Also, the decision she makes are dumb, she changes completely and becomes whiny and selfish. I like her caring and sweet side but in S;G0 it was overshadowed by her other side of personality that I didn't find appealing at all. She ruined some scenes for me.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters. S;G0 liked to add minor characters and give ZERO sense to most of them. The previous supporting characters were well developed and with likeable personalities. Some of them stayed but some others were added but didn't make sense, their backstories, their interruptions to the main story, their personality and role had NO REASON TO EXIST at all.\\n\\n\r\nArtsyle, Vas and Animation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI've always liked the art style, vas and animation but S;G0 had some awkward scenes where the animation didn't do its best and was quite lacking, especially in fight scenes, it ruined the mood. The VAs though did an AMAZING job and the expressions really matched it, so thumbs up for this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm pricky about anime soundtrack and the S;G OST has always been great for me but this one OST is basically a copy of that. There are some remixes and original songs, also the OPs and EDs are very good, but they didn't bother adding more original tracks in S;G style. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSee above for details.\\n\r\nOverall, I was disappointed but it was still S;G to me and I liked watching the representation of this idea of \"the world line in which he failed\" but... yeah, the way they put up the story was... see above lol\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10 but it's 6 \\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of Steins Gate I wanted to share my thoughts on this serie to see if some others agreed with me on saying that the original is way better and that this season was surprisingly not as good as it looked like. Also, I really cared about this sequel and I decided basically 6 months ago that I would review it so... yeah, here it is. My long ass review. \\n\r\nNow then, I'm gonna go prepare on my corner for the unpopular opinions to crush me lol jk if you wanna discuss, here to talk! \\n\\n\r\nFavorite character: Okabe Rintaro\\n\r\nFavorite episode: 21/23\\n\r\nFavorite song: Fatima - Kanako Itou\\n",

Works of this style are not very demanding in animation.\r\nSome episodes have more lively cuts in the part of expressions and gesticulations of the protagonist, but in contrast, has a few crooked episodes with design of the characters diforme, and proportions of the body a little strange.\r\nThe design is more detailed than the first season, at least.\r\nNote 6/10\r\nDirection:\r\nGood. Was the director of the first season better? Yes for sure. But this one is not bad, he gets the emotions of the scenes well (especially in the final stretch), uses soundtrack well, etc.\r\nHe does the basics well.\r\nNote 7/10.\r\nScript:\r\nI did not play VN, so I'm notgoing to discuss the changes that the anime made (even because I do not even know what they were).\\n\r\nBut considering the script of the anime, I would say it's good.\\n\r\nThe quieter parts that look like a Slice Of Life anime are sure to be uncomfortable for anyone expecting something, tension, at least at the level of the first season (type I), but in matters of script, there is nothing wrong. It is consistent, and it has some nice balconies (like the final stretch connecting to a certain scene at the end of the first season, the episode of music that nobody knew where it came from was cool too).\\n\r\nNote 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\r\nVery Good. It is very similar to that of the first season (even because it has the same composer involved), which is a very good soundtrack, striking, functional, with some legal literary tracks.\\n\r\nNote 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment:\\n\r\nMedium. The script's quietest footprint, which does not have many striking and tense events compared to the first season, causes a certain sense of disappointment.\\n\r\nAnd it also affects the Cliffhangers of the anime, since it did not have many situations where it could generate a Cliffhanger.\\n\r\n(Compared to the first season, he did it straight, and did very well).\\n\r\nThe more \"slice of life\" episodes were also not very good at entertaining.\\n\r\nOnly in the final stretch even of a higher elevation in entertainment (most of this merit is of history)\\n\r\nNote 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nMany must think that the first season was better, especially in the tension (I even).\\n\r\nBut the anime itself was not bad, the direction although basic, did its job well, the script, although it is not so busy, is consistent and has some nice balconies and the soundtrack keeps very good.\\n\r\nI recommend this season to anyone who liked Steins Gate, but it's good to make it clear that he does not have the tension and moviementation of the first season.\\n\r\nFinal Note 7/10.",

For a fair portion of Zero, it seemed to have gotten the same flair. It even integrated more cliche-y anime scenes with relatively good effect, particularly developing emotional scenes through characters crying or confessing their love. \r\nBut in reality, there were too many issues and inconsistencies that I overlooked for most of the season because it was the SEQUEL TO STEINS GATE. Some of the seemingly important characters ended up being fillers whose backstories meant almost nothing. It might have justbeen me, but Hououin Kyouma's return was so... anticlimactic. I almost didn't want him to return if it was like that. \\n\\n\r\nIf Steins Gate 0 were the first season to a new anime, I think it would have done pretty well. I mean... the reviews are still generally positive, but for those who placed enormous expectations on the second season because of Steins Gate the original, the second season may be a bit more disappointing.",
