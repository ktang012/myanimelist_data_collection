            "content": "Under the dimly-lit canvas of a rustic theatre, surrounded by the sounds of slowly-plucked shamisen, waits an audience for a performance of great tradition. Gradually, a  man wrapped in an dignified air approaches the center of the stage, sits elegantly on his knees, takes a slight bow to welcome his gazers, and proceeds. Thus begins a performance commonly known as Rakugo or the Japanese art of oral story-telling. Rakugo involves the storyteller to orate a comical account designated between two or more characters, generally playing all roles, distinguished only by slight nuances in behavior, tone, and gestures. \r\nRakugo has been a classical trait ofJapanese art and culture since the Genroku period (of the Edo era), but has dwindled in popularity and appreciation in more contemporary times. Though, grief can be spared because with this winter\u2019s wind came a show that revitalized this once-felt obscure art-form and turned it into the driving point of undoubtedly the season\u2019s best show, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu \u2013 a charming character-driven series with tightly-knit interactions and exploration, a marvelous setting, and a bond between subject and its characters that\u2019s entirely commendable. \\n\\n\r\nSet some time after WWII - during the rapidly changing social landscape of Japan - the series follows a freshly-released prisoner who desires to learn the ways of Rakugo and gets taken under the wing of a national master named Yuurakutei Yakumo. The story changes focus from the present tale of the apprentice to a narrative of the past, concerning the master and his deceased friend Sukeroku, along with the slowly-withering art of Rakugo. Now while the premise may seem a little daunting and even a bit boring; nothing is farther from the truth. Of course, the series is an entirely character-focused, unhurried drama, so this does imply a lack of flashy fights, gratuitous panty-shots, and overpowered heroes championing the world, but in its stead what it does offer is a compelling, evocative experience that really has a handle on its ambitions.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting, subject matter, and characters are integrated so atomically well that the entire ride is just consistently smooth. The pacing is well-balanced due to everything being finely focused and progressed with clear direction that it leaves no room for wasted effort or filler messes. The combination of these elements along with the tact and grace with which they are implemented, makes this show a worthy title. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, there\u2019s the setting. The show creates its foundation through a comparative/contrasting lens; a great structural move that tells the story, through story-telling \u2013 literally. It is absolutely marvelous to see just how well it is able to integrate its backdrop/setting into its forefront, just like a good theatrical performance would; giving it the feel of a truly refined work with each frame adding something to its overall quality. The setting is heightened by the show\u2019s ability to capture the atmosphere and sentiments of Japanese society at the time, especially in relation to both the character situations and their Rakugo. Even though very subtly depicted, the show bases its portrayal of Rakugo from the perspective of slow decay. After the wave of post-war reality hits, it causes a serious sense of disenfranchisement amongst the culture and people. This allows western senses and modernism to penetrate with a force much greater than it did in the past which augments the gradual but steady disintegration of various cultural arts; Rakugo being one of them. This backdrop plays to almost every nuance crafted whether it is the evolution of characters merely depicted by their change in attire (from traditional Japanese yukatas to fashionable western suits) or the erosion of public attendance in Rakugo houses relative to other more western venues. These subtleties may go unnoticed individually, but are definitely materialized when evaluated holistically and especially when examining characterization.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the impeccable setting, comes the strongest point of the series: characters. The character dynamics, exploration, and evolution are sublime. The entire series revolves around self-actualization in a way, through one\u2019s art, and everything else revolving around it. The two protagonists, the now-master-Yakumo-then-Bon-chan or \u201cKiku\u201d and his boisterous friend Sukeroku are a delight to watch, as they tumble through various struggles and events, trying to perfect their Rakugo while trying to find their reasons for doing so. Both characters are perfect complements of each other and really play off one another to add dimension to overall characterization, and each other. The artist\u2019s journey and the character\u2019s journey intertwine like a destined love affair, growing together through both pain and pleasure. \\n\\n\r\nThis is why characterization in this show can be looked at on two-fold: from the art, and the individual dynamics. The former really lays the foundation because it not only introduces the world of rakugo in context, but integrates in a manner which complements the \u201cact\u201d. The performances are not just intricate illustrations of the art form, but also essential in tracing the metamorphosis of the characters involved, specifically Kiku. Therefore, the way Rakugo is treated isn\u2019t necessarily just a detached device, but embedded in the heart and motivations of the characters, while also delivering with full force and depth the nature of Japanese story-telling, and the skill that it requires.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there\u2019s the stellar dynamics between the characters themselves. Even though Kiku is the star of the stage, almost every other character feels multi-dimensional, with their flaws, motivations, and importance properly conveyed and explored, individually, and in relation to the bigger picture. Almost every \u201cstruggle\u201d is important and is referenced in some form of development, whether it is for Kiku or the others, giving these characters a sense of realness, complexity, and palpability that isn\u2019t easy to accomplish. For example, alongside the two main characters is another side character named Miyokichi (Yurie) \u2013a geisha initially carrying the romantic tide of the series - who acts as sort of the fodder for the emotional evolution of both characters, while also adorning her own individuality as an important element of the show. Her role on paper is solely of a foil but she (and others) end up becoming actualized entities of their own; proving how well done the palette of characters are. \\n\\n\r\nThe strength of the characters produces a resounding effect for the overall series that helps give it a strong sense of focus, result, and even thematic resonance. The sheer admiration and dedication that is reflected from the characters exudes the essence of \u201cliving for the dream\u201d. Sacrifice, brotherhood, kinship, relationships, family, and most importantly, love, is so wonderfully crafted through the fibers of Rakugo and those in this story that weave it, ultimately into a beautiful tapestry. And love here doesn\u2019t necessarily denote romance, but the kind of love that drives one\u2019s passions forwards and gives meaning to lives. It is a love that transcends beyond description and can only be felt through creation, art, or in this case, Rakugo. And this work does an excellent job embodying and expressing that love.\\n\\n\r\nTo bring the series its final touches of splendor is the animation and sound. The animation flows smoothly, with soft, bright colors that play to the vibrant tone of the show. Backgrounds are very nicely done as they bring out the juxtapositioned nature of the setting. The old but stifling feel of fading tradition is  contrasted with lively modernized elements that consistently coalesce and enhance the narrative. Furthermore, the music is oddly fitting as it combines instances of jazz or blues against the classic tunes of Japanese strings and compositions. Surprisingly, never once does any of this clash inappropriately, rather works in tandem to heighten the atmosphere, mood, and give full depth to the setting that contains it all. \\n\\n\r\nReally, there is no detractor in this show that innately brings it value down. Of course, this series won\u2019t appeal to everyone as it is very focused on the internal dynamics of its characters and the external passions that define them. Many of the episodes have 10-12 minutes of just Rakugo performances which could be burdensome to few, but as mentioned before, the performances are essential for they aren\u2019t just superfluous additions but character-defining points. Lastly, since it isn\u2019t a complete adaptation, there are loose ends to be had, and deliberately, but none of those take away from the narrative that is actually presented.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, this story is one worth telling, and even more so, worth listening to.\\n\\n\r\nNow, art forms come and go, evolve and dissolve, and keep humanity breathing with their own life force. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu shows the intricacies of that process through the lives of two men who through their art, change themselves and each other. They are a reminder of the eternality of art (even if the world changes) and those who create it (regardless of history that burns and rises). So even when the shamisen stops playing, and the dimly-lit theatre stands alone, we can still hear the stories of Sukeroku and Kiku, and Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is proud to do us that favor. \\n",

            "content": "Shouwa Rakugo is a story about life. It is a story about the art of Rakugo, of Japan's history during the Shouwa era, of friendship and family, and of sacrificing everything to reach one's potential, but particularly it is a story about life\u2014 the lives of two talented, troubled and yet ordinary men. \r\nShouwa Rakugo may only be thirteen episodes long, but it covers a period of years and decades, a turbulent series of ups and downs, much as life is itself. It depicts the rise, fall and redemption of Yakumo and Sukeroku, and many of those around them. The tearful reunion as Sukeroku returnsfrom the war in Manchuria is powerful\u2014 powerful enough that I also felt myself choking up a bit\u2014 and yet it occurs just a few short episodes into the story. \\n\\n\r\nThis is due in part to the excellent characterisation of the two and their (oftentimes strained) friendship, but it is also a result of the story's nimble pacing. One might expect an anime covering such a large span of time in so few episodes to end up feeling rushed, but this is not the case. Shouwa Rakugo makes a careful balance between the smaller and the more important events in the characters' lives. It will transition from a hospital scene to a funeral within seconds, and yet it will feel entirely natural, as if no time has actually passed. Many times I found these transitions to hold more punch than the scenes themselves. If stories like Touch and Sakura no Uta have taught me anything, it is that a quick jump to the future can carry far more emotional weight than the events preceding it. \\n\\n\r\nIt can be hard to put into words what makes Shouwa Rakugo so special, as so much of its appeal is in what it leaves unsaid. It finds greater comfort in showing its story rather than telling it. The feelings of the characters\u2014 their frustrations, their struggles\u2014 are often left implied and seldom stated outright. A character will walk along at dusk, mumbling to themselves a rakugo scene depicting the difficulties of departing from one's lover, and it will be very clear what is going on in their mind. It takes a very special anime to pull something like that off, to develop the characters such that the audience can empathize with them without dialogue or gestures. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is primarily set during the post-war period in Japan, but it thankfully does not waste time lecturing the audience about the war's effects on Japan, how Japan fought the good fight and lost, and everything we have already heard countless times before in other anime. What Shouwa Rakugo does convey about the war, it conveys through the absence of dialogue: nobody ever says \"I'm sorry\" when they listen to another person's story, because they've all been there before. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the first two episodes, it becomes very clear which direction the story is headed in and how it will end. Every major event is foreshadowed in some way, from the dialogue (\"The next time I meet you it will be in hell\") all the way to the very title of the series (\u5fc3\u4e2d). This effectively eliminates any sense of shock that the viewer might experience, but knowing what is ahead does not make the moments and the journey any less heart-wrenching. It actually makes it hurt more. \\n\\n\r\nShouwa Rakugo deserves special mention for depicting sexual, adult relationships. The heroine is not a cute, bubbly high school girl, but a geisha who makes her living by flirting with men. She is in many ways a despicable human being, and that is just fine. People often do not pick the most respectable or desirable person to be with; they come together and couple for a myriad of reasons, even if it may in the end be to their own harm. \\n\\n\r\nEven if you have no knowledge of what rakugo is\u2014 and I suspect this is the case for most people, as it was for myself\u2014 Shouwa Rakugo makes it very easy to follow by animating a wide variety of rakugo performances, rather than bombard the viewer with explanations and unfamiliar terminology. While rakugo might not be especially entertaining to the world of 2016, through watching the many performances within Shouwa Rakugo it is easy to gain an appreciation for the talent and effort that is often poured into the art. The styles of Yakumi's and Sukeroku's rakugo are so different from one another that it almost feels as though they are performing completely different forms of art, despite rakugo very much being an art defined by tradition.\\n\\n\r\nThe lengthy, 10-minute Rakugo performance in the first episode\u2014 one of many amazing moments in the show\u2014 reminded me of the ending sequence in Whiplash (one of the best films I have seen), it feeling itself like a musical performance, starting slow and clumsy and gradually building into a thunderous crescendo by the end, Yotarou's sweat visibly running down his face all the while. While he may not be beating his instrument to the point of blood flying across the stage, rakugo is an inherently quieter, more subtle form of performance than concert, requiring nothing more than a person sitting and telling a story in front of a small audience, and so bloody theatrics are not necessary. Its performances are already plenty exciting. \\n\\n\r\nAt times joyful, and ever more so devastating, Shouwa Rakugo is a truly sincere and human story. It speaks a simple, raw tale of flawed existence. It does not fluff itself with philosophy, symbolism and other obscure subject matter. It speaks to the individual: it wants you to listen, and it wants you to consider the moments in life where you truly felt beating, breathing and alive. It is in that short moment that it has meaning.",

            "content": "When I sat down to write this review I had a hard time condensing my feelings towards it into written format. This wasn't to say the story was complex; on the contrary, it was rather straightforward on paper. But when I tried to articulate my thoughts to virtual ink, nothing came to fruition. Then after I sat back and let everything that had transpired sink in, it just hit me, a simple word, yet one that was able to properly express the feelings that I had wadded up inside for this title. Simply put, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was poetic. \r\nFrom the way it delicatelycrafted its narrative, to the organic transition in which its characters found their placement in it, everything Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu did flowed like a poetic stream of unfiltered consciousness. This anime exuded an aura of refinement and class that you don't come across often. It's a caliber quite deserving of the praise directed at it. In place of the spastic eccentricity and bubblegum characters commonly found in the world of anime, we're given a tranquil environment and genuine human emotion. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is a title that unveils a compelling story about flawed characters and their pursuit for true acceptance. If I could get just one other person to experience and spread the word of this gem, then my writing this was more than worth it.\\n\\n\r\nDelving into the world of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, or Shouwa, as I'll refer to it going forward, we're introduced to Yotarou, a dimwitted bushy-tailed man who's fresh out of prison. Having a deep yearning to practice and perform Rakugo, a Japanese form of verbal entertainment that's essentially stage storytelling, he seeks out an apprenticeship under the guidance of Yakumo Yuurakutei, a man well renowned for his performing prowess in the field of Rakugo.\\n\r\nDespite what this initial premise would have you believe, the story isn't about Yotarou's journey under apprenticeship; in actuality, it chronicles his master Yotarou's life, along with his friend Sukeroku, as it showed how they dealt with the demanding requirements of the Rakugo industry, as well as the growing pressures that come with adulthood. \\n\\n\r\nTaking us back to his childhood, Yakumo \"Kikuhiko\" Yuurakutei places us at a time just before the boys met. And from then on the story blossoms on its own before coming to an inevitable stop due to an incident that's discussed during the initial episodes. While both boys found themselves in the world of Rakugo under similar circumstances, their relationship with the performing art itself differed vastly. Their relationship dynamic has been seen before: the polar opposites who don't see eye to eye. Yakumo's ying to Sukeroku's yang. The fundamentals of the story itself aren't what are impressive, but rather the manner in which it goes about executing it.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of simply following the standardized method established for this kind of narrative, we're instead thrust into a more introspective realm, with Yakumo's reminiscing in the form of a Rakugo itself. It's essentially a story within a story, which, on paper, sounds like a muddled mess, but oddly enough felt like the most organic method of absorbing the characters and viewer into the head-space of the tale. The Rakugo art form isn't only exemplified, but it's also utilized on a grand scale to encompass everything surrounding it. It's a form of immersion rarely experienced, basically the Inception of anime storytelling (And here we are, a review about a story, about a story, that contains stories... let's just leave that mindfuck alone). \\n\\n\r\nEverything that shapes the life of the zen-like Yakumo that we met in the first episode, to the reserved boy we meet in the past, all revolves around the influence of Rakugo, both on and off stage. We're given a detailed insight as to how this traditional Japanese storytelling works, as well as the lasting impact it left on the two boys that grew up to master it. \\n\\n\r\nWhat made this anime so engaging was in the way it went about layering these characters. Nothing is ever explicitly stated outright. Everything from the small mannerisms they display, to the introspective moments that draw no attention to themselves, as well as the way in which they interacted with each other, all helps to add layers to the characters on screen. It's \"show don't tell\" at its finest. And as their upbringing and personality shape the type of Rakugo they performed, it also shaped what kind of person they ultimately became. In a way, it could be said that an individual's style of Rakugo indirectly reveals the kind of person they secretly are. It's a window into their soul; as saccharine as that statement may sound, there's no better way to describe it. \\n\r\nWith Sukeroku, what was outwardly presented in his performances was the common tongue of the people. With a brash and often schmaltzy performance, he didn't care for the social constructs that the world of Rakugo wanted to build. He did it to make the people happy. And just like his style would outwardly portray, his Rakugo revealed what was truly lying dormant within him. \\n\r\nThe same also applied to Yakumo, a man who always tried upholding himself to a high standard, following the guideline of Rakugo to the letter. He too was exposed by his style of Rakugo. Rakugo provided the duality that neither would dare reveal out in the open. Like I said, it's simply poetry, a dance between what is shown and what is truly meant to be seen, or rather what is meant to be uncovered. \\n\r\nThese characters are deeply flawed but made all the more realistic because of that. They're selfish, pigheaded, condescending, but also broken, affectionate and just looking for a place they belong. There's no antagonist here, just entangled personalities trying to find their way. \\n\\n\r\nOutside of the two male characters, another character worth mentioning was Yurie, who is without question the biggest catalyst who drives the actions taken by the two male leads involved during the show's more personal moments. She's a character whose environment and past experiences did far more than mold her; they broke her. Like the others involved in the story, she masquerades herself as someone who's in control. And it's her need for co-dependence that creates a rift that ripples throughout all crucial events in the story.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing that her involvement is integral to many of the major events throughout the narrative, I won't say anything more about her involvement. Just know that without her, many of Shouwa's more poignant moments wouldn't have exfoliated into the scenes that we were gifted with. \\n\\n\r\nLike the art of performing Rakugo itself, the story also manages to perform and balance a vast array of tonal shifts throughout the narrative without feeling forcefully steered in directions. This, as a result, allowed for comedic scenes to transition seamlessly into sobering reveals without causing any tonal whiplashes. And in a story that revolves around the delicate balance between stage performances and real life drama, that balance was greatly needed. \\n\\n\r\nThe project was handled by studio Deen, which by anyone's account, is a scary thing, given their track record, but with Shouwa they actually stepped their game up. The movements and gestures of the characters showed great range and fluidity, which is a vital thing for a show that's revolved around the mannerisms of stage performers. No noticeable shortcuts were taken, and the finished product looked quite pleasing. The opening and ending themes were excellent, with the intro song \"Usurai Shinjuu \" by Megumi Hayashibara, carrying a sort of sultry/smoky jazz appeal to it. The ending theme also held up on its side with a soothing soft trumpet piece that gently set things off on a tranquil note. \\n\\n\r\nIn many ways Shouwa acts out like a Shakespearean play, in that regardless of time period or societal upbringing, the messages it explores are primal and very much a part of what it means to be human, may that be the yearning for love and acceptance, malice born from envious desires, choosing to follow gut instinct instead of rationality or just forming bonds with others for mutual benefit. Shouwa unveil these layers of human pathos in a way that invokes authentic sentiments. This anime sets a benchmark that many would have a hard time following.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show was easily the most engrossing seasonal title I've watched from the 2015/16 lineup so far. It left an impression that so few have and had some of the most realistic anime characters I've seen in recent memory. This easily became a new favorite of mine. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIf there were ever a dark horse for the 2016 Winter season, this title is it. Sadly overlooked by many, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is a show that quickly ushered you out of the cold and into the warm embrace of its heartfelt narrative. The more time you spend with these characters, the harder it became to say farewell. This might not be for everyone, given the slower pacing and absence of anime tropes associated with the medium, but for those who want something more than the usual offerings expected, I cannot suggest this enough. It's truly a work of art.",

            "content": "It is truly fascinating of what people are capable of doing to survive in society, especially when you are basically abandoned by your relatives. A young boy who once aspired to be a dancer has no choice but to learn the art of Rakugo, a form of Japanese verbal entertainment in which the storyteller sits on stage while performing a complicated comedical story. Audiences may have had the impression that it solely focuses on the profession, yet this is not the case. At first it seems that it simply served as means of survival, but it becomes apparent that the journey throughout his life wasmore than just Rakugo: it is a tale of a flourishing and wonderful friendship, conflict and realization of oneself.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, or \"Showa and Genroku Era Lover's Suicide Through Rakugo\" in its english title, is focused around Rakugo and with that, the characters and their interactions. Instead of consisting of a simple story about the ascension of two performers, which it is to a degree, it is a character driven story that ties the lives of the various individuals implicated: Yakumo, Sukeroku and Yurie. The profession is merely used as means to develop and unfold the storyline, whilst portraying the art of Rakugo itself. It must be mentioned that the synopsis of the anime is as a matter of fact a bit misleading; it is focused upon the afore-mentioned trio, albeit showcasing Yotaro's interactions with his master. This however will probably developed in the second season. Another aspect that is prevalent in the anime is drama: it was depicted in a subtle manner, without exaggerating it, making it much easier to digest and enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of this work is splendidly done, and very befitting, although it may seem at first sluggish and uninteresting to some. However, it becomes apparent that it is actually a necessary buildup to portray the characters relationship in a very satisfying manner. It is a journey that spans from their childhood to their puberty, culminating in their adulthood. It is a narrative ridden with little details, such as portraying subtly the daily interactions between the protagonists and the cast, or its setting, the 70's and 80's of Japan. Naturally, Rakugo is depicted as well in a satisfactory way: it shows viewers the difficulties of the profession, besides of the great stories contained within: it is simply delightful to listen to. In addition, it quickly becomes clear that world the protagonists live in is strongly favoured by those with status, rather than cunning. This reflects the society of that time rather well with the outdated mentality. Naturally, audiences may find the performing parts tedious, yet these are arguably rather amusing.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Shouwa is rather small, consisting of a handful of characters, yet it is certainly sufficient to portray the whole scope of this tale. As mentioned earlier, Shouwa is a very character driven story, and it excels in this department greatly. because of the gradual buildup that spans various decades, the characters were slowly fleshed out and developed accordingly to the changes these experienced - this was done through subtle interactions with their peers. The two main protagonists are Yakumo and Sukeroku, who have quite diverse personalities, which enhances the narrative. By the end of the show, audiences may have a total different view of some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nYakumo could be described a silent, cunning and self-containing character, yet from the inside insecure and delicate: it is marvelous to see his character develop through the various stages of his life, which includes the realization of himself. On the other side there is Sukeroku, a very charming and enthusiastic man, with a great talent and love for Rakugo, with no relatives. Character development and fleshing out of him is no exception either. The relationship between these two is very well-developed and presented to audiences, it is truly a tale of friendship. \\n\\n\r\nAnother crucial character in the anime is Yurie: she is the gear that triggers the wavering interactions between the cast and the main protagonists - in fact, romance is another theme that is present in the anime. As character she may seem rather underdeveloped, yet through various scenes and interactions with her peers, it quickly becomes clear that she is not as shallow as she appears to be. Her life, profession and unrequited love are thing that drove this character forth. The romance can be rather lacking, as it came pretty abruptly and was not really well-developed, alongside the reason on why she fell in love. However, love is not often a rational reaction, so it may be excused in a manner; regardless, some more expansion on it could have been welcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe studio behind Shouwa is DEEN, and the animation quality was well done, with very fluid motions. The character's movements when showcasing the performances were subtle and very detailed presented, conveying the art of Rakugo and how these are crucial for a good play. Facial expressions, sweat and similar traits managed to portray the various states of the cast. As for the art style itself, it has a slightly different take than the usual character designs which was enticing; the backgrounds were detailed, despite being composed mainly of internal locations. In some cases some inconsistencies could be found in the background characters, but this was negligible.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the soundtrack of Shouwa it was befitting, albeit a bit startling at first with various jazz tunes, as it didn't seem to fit the narrative: nevertheless, it quickly becomes apparent that this used to its advantage to upheave the pacing and importance of each scene when required. Piano or violin compositions are used as well, depending on the atmosphere. The voice actors did a splendid job, the various personalities matching with the characters, as well as wonderfully portraying the different intonations required for the various situations, be it the emotional states or the Rakugo performances itself. As for the opening and endings, these consisted of jazz, and blues, while having a great representation of what Rakugo is.\\n\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was overall a fantastic anime with a great story and characters, enhanced their interactions and the Rakugo. I was very surprised by the lack of attention this anime got - or rather, it is criminal. I throughly enjoyed this anime, in addition to the plays presented, which were quite intriguing at a personal level. Naturally, this may have been the main factor that have had viewers discontinue the anime, as it can be boring. Regardless, this is a necessary buildup for a great conclusion of the series. I want to mention the fact that viewers who expected a story focused on the difficulties after being jailed, will be let down, as this was not the case; however, audiences are rewarded with a great narrative. Moreover, a second season was announced which in turn may delve into said subject. I highly recommend people who like drama, or character driven stories to try this piece out.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "If you have ever watched stand up comedy or listened to NPR ( This American Life, Fresh Air with Terry Gross, A Prairie Home Companion from Lake Wobegone), you should check this anime out. If not, it's slow, mediocre, and overrated. The reason why it's rated so high is that it's one of those \" at least it doesn't take place in high school\" anime shows. \r\nBottom line, no pretentiousness, it's a struggling artist story: empty apartment, messy roommate, getting gigs, argue with your roommate. But, it's in anime format and the art is called \"Rakugo\" which is Japanese talking entertainment. Since you don't speakJapanese, the Rakugo scenes are literally just reading a 3 paragraph short story while a Japanese anime character flexes their voice up and down.\\n\\n\r\nArt: There is a lot of period style architecture, but it all looks the same making it boring. One room would look like the next room and it's hard to get a sense of where the characters are. The show needs more B-footage to show transition from \"golden times\" to \"desperate times.\" I can't pick up they got evicted and now live in a crappy apartment if both rooms look the same. I can't tell if the gig is at a dump or at a theater if the dump and theater look the same with the same number of people. World War 2 happens and you barely even notice it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I don't know how to judge the sound. The anime felt like reading a book. You could put stick figures and dialogue and it would still be the exact same story. \\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters: The Rakugo is the best part. They are short, entertaining, and to the point satisfying action fanboys like me with the attention span of a goldfish. But, the characters are essentially drama Mary Sues. For example, one of them is a drunkard, but he still loves his life and is happy go lucky. The show approaches alcoholism with a  \"aw shucks\" stop spending money on alcohol rather than a punch a wall, bleed out, vomit on the floor, and cry in a dumpster. Lost potential.  The other main character is an artist who stumbles at first and becomes a master with practice. The end. More lost potential. No drugs. No selling your soul to a record company. No backstabbing your childhood friend. Nobody wants to watch \" I struggled, practiced diligently, stayed clean, and became a successful artist with little stress.\" In America, so many people drop everything to pursue their art and there are so many amazing stories. In Japan, the majority pursue legitimate professions, so I guess Rakugo is so bohemian. Again, the characters are too perfect. Justin Beiber is a more interesting story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I actually like Rakugo. But I wouldn't be true to myself saying saying it's the best thing ever or even mediocre. It reminded me of David Sedaris' Santaland stories, reading short stories in the New Yorker, and how the 50s cultural revolution in America kicked ass. But that's all it did.  I have no intention of re-watching this. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview: \r\nSh\u014dwa Genroku Rakugo Shinj\u016b is the first Josei demographic anime I\u2019ve reviewed on this site. It was getting such rave reviews though that I decided to give it a try. This is a rather unique anime and certainly worth watching if you haven\u2019t seen it yet!\r\nBackground:\r\nSo what on Earth is Rakugo? Rakugo is a traditional Japanese form of storytelling that is sort of like a combination between a 1 man play, standup comedy, and beat poetry. Rakugo can trace back at least as far as the 1200s AD in written form and perhaps as early as 900AD in oral form. The period of Rakugothat this story covers is right in the title, the Showa era. The Showa era was the reign of Emperor Hirohito from 1926 to 1989. Specifically, most of the story takes place before, during, and just after WW2.\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with a petty convict named Yotaro being released from prison. Yotaro was able to survive and reform in prison due in part to the amazing stories and performances of his favorite Rakugo actor who went by the name Yakumo the 8th. Once released, Yotaro decided to find the elderly Rakugo master and beg to become his apprentice. It turns out that Yakumo, whose actual name is Bon, really isn\u2019t a social person and had no interest in new apprentices. However, Yotaro\u2019s youthful energy and enthusiasm reminds Bon of an old friend and Bon finally begins to warm up to him. The majority of the story takes place in a flashback showing the lives of Bon and his childhood friend Shin, who eventually takes the title Sukeroku the 2nd. Bon and Shin are quickly shown to be polar opposites, but nevertheless forge a strong friendship. Bon is an introverted traditionalist while Shin is a wildly energetic extrovert who wishes to take the art of Rakugo in new directions. However, Shin\u2019s unorthodox style causes friction with the deeply conservative Rakugo guild. In order for Rakugo performers to get the best venues and good audiences, they need to suck up to the guild and get their approval. The guild will blacklist any bar or performance hall that allows a performer they don\u2019t approve of. This tension between traditionalists and the need for art to expand into new territory is one of the key conflicts of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to repeat the whole plot and spoil this series, so just trust me that the human relations, psychological drama, romance, and tension are all very well executed. This series doesn\u2019t rely on any cheap tricks like shock factor or fanservice. It doesn\u2019t suddenly pull a tragic death out of nowhere to cheaply jerk some tears. The only major deaths are forecast from a mile away and STILL manage to hit your feels like a truck! The concept of old vs. young, tradition vs. new ideas, constantly clashing and causing tension is always effective in storytelling because it applies to any age and society. It was effective in Turgenev\u2019s novel Fathers and Sons for 1860s Russia, it applies to 1950s Japan, and it would apply to 2016 America. This series should also be praised for its complex and realistic characters. You the viewer get to feel like you know these characters and watching them interact is always a pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Soundtrack:\\n\\n\r\nThe art by studio Deen of Higurashi fame and is pretty top notch. It also helps that this is a low action series, so not much is moving at any one time. This allows the artists to really focus on character art and backgrounds. The background music is often beautiful and the opening and closings are as strong as you could ask for in an anime that doesn\u2019t have a massive budget. I have nothing to complain about here, so moving on!\\n\\n\r\nFlaws if any:\\n\\n\r\nTo a Japanese audience this series is pretty flawless. Maybe it could be accused of being a tad slow for some, but that isn\u2019t really an issue. What IS an issue for non-Japanese speakers is that roughly half the runtime of this series is listening to beat poetry that you won\u2019t properly understand or appreciate. All of the subtle wordplay, puns, and nuance is completely lost in translation. The character drama and themes are wonderful when they are onscreen, but the Rakugo sections (which are PLENTIFUL) will quickly have you scrambling for the fast forward on your remote!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis is a strong drama series that is one of the few \u201cmust watch\u201d series of 2016 despite the fact the lengthy Rakugo recitals will likely scare away all but the most hardened of art film snobs.\\n\\n\r\nReflection on the state of the anime industry and community:\\n\\n\r\nJust as Rakugo needed to adapt or face irrelevancy in the 1950s, the anime industry is in a tough spot right now. Sales are down, audiences are shrinking and dissatisfied, and studios are conservatively leaning on clich\u00e9d fighting Shonen and echii to carry the industry. However, the anime industry would also be in danger if they largely conceded to the will of a small but vocal group of online elitists. Believe it or not the casual/n00b bashing, condescending, elitist pricks can destroy a fandom as easily as stagnation.  If anime studios simply churned out series like Shouwa Rakugo, the small number of elitists online would be happy, but the anime industry would be doomed to financial collapse. You can enjoy unusual gems like Shouwa Rakugo, but please don\u2019t try shove series like this down the throat of your casual buddies. You aren\u2019t helping the \u201cunwashed masses\u201d develop culture, you are strangling the anime fan community to death! We the anime fans need to champion series like Berserk that can appeal to not only both elitists and casuals alike, but bring in new fans as well. I don\u2019t want to be like Thatanimesnob or Digibro and try push series like Shouwa Rakugo as the \u201csaviors of anime\u201d. This is a great series for some, but I would feel irresponsible if I hyped this series without warning it isn\u2019t for everyone.\\n",

            "content": "*Despite both the title, and the first episode spoiling the show in heavy detail, there is so much here to unwind, that I cannot bear not giving you the classic SPOILER warning. Please, watch the show if you haven't; I implore you to do so. For those who have (or those who don't care about spoilers), let's move on*\r\nArt is a powerful thing. It has the ability to captivate an audience, entrance them in a new idea they never thought of, enamor them into a sight that marvels them. There are so many types of art: paintings, drawings, stories, videos, games, and even music. Allof these things can enamor us now, but back before even the late 20th century, we didn't have videos or games (aside from maybe betting games and sports). Nowadays, not only do we have all of these things, but we can literally combine all of these. Animation is the ultimate tool for doing so, with the only thing surpassing it being interactive visual novels that can actually be played in the sense of more than just a story we control: like say, a fighting game with a visual novel story (like Blazblue). Nonetheless, we're getting horrendously off track. Earlier, I mentioned stories. There are so many kinds of stories to tell, especially in anime...\\n\\n\r\nYou can tell an epically expansive and complex narrative like Legend of the Galactic Heroes. You can tell a charismatic, absurd, and dramatic thrill ride with twists and turns around every corner, like Code Geass. You can tell an exciting and inspirational story to get our blood pumping, like Gurren Lagann. You can create a work that heavily celebrates a franchise, like Carnival Phantasm. You can tell a grippingly dark and tragic tale to remind the audience that not all good stories have to have happy endings, like Fate/Zero and its second season. You can tell a charming and lovable story mixing many ideas you'd never have seen working, like Macross. You can even tell a down to Earth, realistic story that celebrates a concept we love, like Shirobako. Or, you can be like today's anime, Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, and tell a charming, gripping, down to Earth, and realistic story that celebrates the concept of art -a concept we love- that happens to be a dramatic and sort-of inspirational thrill-ride that has a complex narrative (well, more so than many of us think). It's the best of all worlds, really. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 shows us a reformed criminal (Yotarou, his new stage name) inspired by Rakugo so much that he tries to find the master who showed it to him, with hopes that maybe said master will take him in. We follow his escapades of being introduced into the world of Rakugo at its truest, while being fed crucial information about the residents (namely, a girl named Konatsu, who hates the old man) and their lives so that Yotarou doesn't accidentally strike a horrible nerve. His former boss shows up and tries to encourage him to take up crime again, but to no avail, especially after seeing Yotarou's performance, After almost being expelled (well, more like he was expelled and reinstated), the master tells him and Konatsu about his past which led to where we are today, in a realistic and down to Earth story that unfolds as he narrates. Hell, we get to spend the rest of the series joining the fun. \\n\\n\r\nThe old man, who is now the 8th generation Yakumo, was originally known as Bon (so, for the duration of the review, I will address him as such). After a fateful meeting with Shinn (soon to be known as Sukeroku, and I will call him as such for now), they get taken up by the 7th generation Yakumo during boyhood, and we follow the dramatic and eventually tragic tale of these two men and their journey through their Rakugo careers. Bon had to say goodbye to a girl he was dating, and Sukeroku started drinking. Their careers have shown them to have notably different styles, and while Sukeroku has his perfected, Bon still doesn't know how to take advantage of his. Soon, Sukeroku and 7th Yakumo are forced to leave for the army; World War II has started.\\n\\n\r\nHe, his master's house attendant, Matsuda, and the master's wife, are forced to wait patiently, without much hope. Soon, he meets a beautiful (and I mean BEAUTIFUL) girl named Miyokichi, and it seems like things are going smoothly again. Then, the two men arrive back, and now both Bon's and Sukeroku's careers can truly take off. Inspired by how much of a \"tightwad\" Bon is, Sukeroku's latest Rakugo piece is a story about a tightwad's dream. There is soon tension not only between the two boys, or even between them (especially Sukeroku) and the Rakugo Association, but between Bon and Miyokichi. The middle of the series is about how all of these tensions truly spiral out of control, causing Sukeroku to be expelled after being denied the rank of Shin'uchi, Bon to break up with Miyokichi, and the two boys to make one last promise and then split up on unhappy final terms (part of those terms being Sukeroku and Miyokichi leaving together); it's a dramatic turn for everyone's lives. \\n\\n\r\nSoon, after the 7th Generation Yakumo has a heart attack, he reveals an underlying reason why he would never pass down the Yakumo name to Sukeroku: he was the second generation of the Sukeroku who was his rival back in his youth. Dying with that one regret, Bon is forced to take up the name Yakumo. His friend, Matsuda, soon loses his wife, and Bon goes to find Sukeroku, only to discover that Sukeroku has a child named Konatsu (Are those signals flaring yet?). He soon reunites with Sukeroku only to discover that he has lost his drive for Rakugo thanks to his wife Miyokichi, who has recently ditched him and their child, probably out of resentment for their love of Rakugo and Sukeroku's refusal to move on to a new career. After some time, they prepare one big Rakugo performance (which happens to be rather inspirational to Sukeroku despite him being the one to perform it) despite Rakugo heavily declining in popularity after the war. Hell, news of this got Miyokichi to show up, now that Yakumo has cone back.\\n\\n\r\nIn a truly tragic and impeccably told scene, Sukeroku and Miyokichi hang off a cliff after some heartfelt words by all of them spiral into their emotional climaxes, with Bon trying desperately to save them. Knowing that Bon will only die with them if he tries to save them, he falls with his wife, resulting in Shinjuu, meaning lovers' double suicide. Now, Konatsu is all alone, thinking that Bon is responsible for all of this...and he kind of is; he knows it to be true. After all, he let Miyokichi's parasitic desire for love spiral out of control when he chose his career over her, and he couldn't stop his friend from leaving with her, and he sure as hell wasn't capable of saving them after everything. Still, it's not all his fault, especially since it was Miyokichi that caused all of this to happen, especially with what happened to her and Sukeroku in the end. Bon was the one that caused her to really go haywire, but she basically took care of the rest, resulting in this tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nWe head back to the present, or rather, a few years after we last know the present. Yotarou has become a shin'uchi, Bon continues his life as the 8th Yakumo, Konatsu is now a single soon-to-be mother (with Yotarou volunteering to become the husband to take care of the child), and we are treated to Bon visiting Sukeroku's grave, in which the ghost appears in front of him, as if to tell him something. Yotarou goes to him and requests to take up the name of Sukeroku, and now he and we get what that ghost scene meant. Thus, the story ends for now, with Yotarou closing us out and teasing us about an eventual season 2.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is impressively written, without any leaps in logic or holes, and with one impressive prequel narrative. On its own, it would be a 9 for being great but not reaching extraordinary high. Then, we take the Rakugo stories into account. With one exception, every single Rakugo performance that is played from beginning to end has some meaning to the character that performs them, and most of them have pretty heavy meanings. When Yakumo played the story of the bumbling crook, that really represents him (in which his former boss points out to Bon). When  Bon plays the story about Shinjuu, it ends up happening to his friend (Sukeroku) and his former lover (Miyokichi), which he is deeply affected by. When Sukeroku plays the one about the fisherman and the girl, it probably is due to him constantly talking about girls (along with booze) and bringing them over in the earlier parts of the series. Finally, I'm not sure what the Shinigami one means to Bon (who performs it several times), but season 2 looks like it's gonna reveal that to us, especially after this season hyped it up. When we see any of these 3 major Rakugo performers get to play their work from beginning to end, it always has some meaning in their lives, whether they be then or in the future, making things a lot more complex than many of us may have realized. They are surprisingly funny, making this art-form much more charming and charismatic than we anticipated before seeing those performances.\\n\\n\r\nThere is an impressively strong cast of characters in this amazing show, some of whom are almost as realistic as the characters in Macross Plus, which sports easily the most realistic anime characters of all time. Side characters like Matsuda and Yuurakutei are still great additions to the main few with their hinted-at personal lives and fun personalities, and Konatsu has quite a lot of understandable personal baggage given what happened to her parents, that you can understand why she can be a total emotional ass. Yotarou is a funny yet truly dimwitted decoy protagonist (who'll get his time to shine in season 2) who acts very similar to Sukeroku. Well, with these guys out of the way, onto the tragic trio this season of Rakugo centers around.\\n\\n\r\nYakumo is rather stingy and cold, conflicted about his feelings towards Miyokichi and his career, who loses everyone he cared about (except Matsuda). He is the centerpiece of this tragedy, and at least some of the unfortunate things that unfold were due to either his mistakes or his inability to calm an impossibly bad situation. Despite being pretty cold and assholish -often to great comedic effect- his struggles are definitely real: trying to find your own true form of expressing your passion and trying to balance your career with your social life and relationships. He, while passionate about it, mainly does it for ends meat (convenient given that he overall loves this medium). When the tragedy hits in episode 12, it hits him especially hard and we can easily sympathize with him for what he failed to prevent. Thus, he lives on for a career that he has long since lost the true drive for.\\n\\n\r\nSukeroku is a man-child; he is a free-spirited, irresponsible, slob-like, drunken, and actually arrogant individual who only truly cares about his passion for Rakugo and how he entertains the people with it, Bon, and eventually Miyokichi and their child, Konatsu. He often gets drunk and talks about girls. He complains at the demand for him to be responsible, more than I do. His success in Rakugo makes him too cocky and ambitious, with the latter causing chagrin amongst the higher-ups, and the latter proving to be his downfall in episode 9. Still, his mindset is what I agree with personally: art should be for the people; art should be there to enrich the people's day and enthrall them, making them appreciate and enjoy your work. Sucks that he has to die without being reconciled with the Rakugo Association, for his Rakugo was entertaining as hell. \\n\\n\r\nMiyokichi is quite a broken character. Forced into prostitution just to make ends meet after her family died, she has been burned by relationships with men so many times that she somehow grew dependent on a proper and loving relationship with a man, to a parasitic degree. This lovely lady had to struggle with the fact that Bon grew more detached with her, and after he cut the relationship off, she not only started hanging with his best friend (because that is clearly a good idea in real life) but grew to love him out of desperation. Her resentment for Rakugo broke her new family apart and is the crux of why she and Sukeroku died. Shame, really. I'd love to have seen everyone's story in even further detail.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're at all familiar with Studio DEEN's track record over the past 11 years, you know how dicey their art quality is and how hit-or-miss their adaptations can be, especially concerning their work on Fate/Stay Night and Unlimited Blade Works.  While they also worked on Konosuba during the season this show came out, this show looks so much better on account of overall polish, character designs, and attention to detail. The little things like those bells with tags on them, really add this amazing touch to the world, and the character designs are pretty good if you ask me.  There were very few slip-ups here, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe phrase \"visual poetry\" is a term that is not meant to be thrown around lightly. However, this show deserves it. Masterful directing from the dialogue to the way scenes are structured. The scene in episode 9 where Miyokichi tells Bon that she'll see him in hell, is portrayed so majestically, that you can't help but marvel. The OP is visual poetry at its finest. While almost nothing moves, the sheer symbolism and craft put into it make it a feast to look at, not only for its unique and culturally traditional look, but for how much meaning is packed into almost every shot. This is further emphasized when they revoke it for episodes 11 and 12 but put it back for episode 13 now that you know literally everything the OP actually showed you due to what you just witnessed. Studio DEEN deserves to be commended for their work on this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not many of the songs in the background OST truly stick out or me to the point where I actively try to hunt them down with exception of the glorious track \"Sukeroku\" (though I centrally did try), the blaring and jazzy tunes set the stage perfectly, and every piece is used to excellent effect, like the two major scenes in episodes 9 and 12 that I referred to multiple times. As for the OP, Usurai Shinjuu, by Megumi Hayashibara, is quite the catchy and jazzy tune as well, making me snap at every beat while gawking at what the visuals of the OP display. The ED, \"Kawa, Taredoki\", by Kana Shibue, is actually without any lyrics, and is a relaxing song that's a perfect way to calm us down after many of these episodes force us to endure these highly dramatic scenes. Sure, It's not highly memorable, but it gets the job done.\\n\\n\r\nArt is an expression. Stories are expressions. This show is all about an expressive form of entertainment. When an entertainment and story-driven fictional medium like anime truly takes off, there will always be those who try to evaluate individual installments to the medium, and those people, including myself, are called critics. Critics have a very mixed reputation and are sometimes looked as stingy buzzkills who relentlessly shut down these entertainment pieces. However, while we often do take part in that, we find it especially fun to cherish stories that manage to mesmerize us so much into an impressive new world and plot. This show cherishes the art of Rakugo, and shows us many perspectives on how an artist (of any kind) approaches his or her art, and, along with the great story and impressive way it's told, this is something us critics love to see. We can get more passionate about these stories more so than most people do, so seeing works like this, really refreshes us.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, that's the perfect word to describe this show: refreshing. Can you name a single other anime that showcases the art of Rakugo? Can you name many anime where the characters often wear robes? Can you name a drama that is told like visual poetry? No one can, at least in this point in time. Not every work of art is original or done with the people or the art in mind. Some art is made for the cash, and those works are often what us critics bash (like Mahouka, The Asterisk War, and so...so many others). The medium is chock full of this stuff. Hell, all entertainment mediums have failed ambitious projects and projects that were made with cash in mind rather than quality or ambition. That's what makes works like this so refreshing to us. \\n\\n\r\nWell, that's enough rambling for now. \\n\\n\r\nThank every single one of you that ever liked any of my reviews. I would've never made it to making 50 of these if none of you cared about what I make. This review has been a lot more personal than I thought, but with a special milestone review, comes a special title that truly needs to be discussed, like this one. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu. Here's shooting for 100.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. I have to admit, this show took me by storm. A series about rakugo isn\u2019t something that we see often in the anime industry these days in particular dealing with performances on stage. As such, this series is what I like to describe as a dark horse. And for a lot of reasons, it deserves quite a lot of praise for what is.\r\nComing into the series, I had little knowledge about rakugo. It\u2019s a form of Japanese art performed on stage using creative dialogues, expressions, and body language. Quite frankly, it\u2019s very entertaining once you get the feel of it despitethe performer being stationary. Most of the time, the performances involves a comical act that goes along with a story. Sometimes, the performer brings in drama and bittersweet emotions but the bottom line is that it\u2019s described to entertain. That\u2019s what this show has done: bringing entertainment in a rarity form.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place around the 1970s. However, the show does a lot more background storytelling than what most viewers may be accustomed to. Thankfully, the series knows how to transit into the past to bring the story into the present. From the beginning, we meet Koji, a guy who got out of prison but later follows a goal to make himself into a professional rakugo performer. This sets up his encounter with Yakumo Yurakutei, a man who he looks up to and wants to learn from. After many exchanges and work, he does earn himself a spot as Yakumo\u2019s student. This is where transition comes in and we take a look at the past.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence the storytelling brings in a lot of relationship dynamics and characterization. The relationship between Yakumo and Sukeroku is a prominent example of this as we see their connection. Furthermore, the show makes us realize how different they are after examining their personalities. Yakumo is the stoic type with a cyclical personality and little intense of the opposite sex. Meanwhile, Sukeroku is just the opposite who often seeks girls in his life while maintain his hyperactive personality. Despite this, the two seems to get along as good friends and strives to become rakugo artists. There\u2019s quite a difference in their performance skills though as we can easily see how much Sukeroku is better than Yakumo. Throughout the series, Yakumo struggles at first to make a name for himself but does manage to pick up the pace once he realizes it. \\n\\n\r\nAt some point in the show, we should realize that Yakumo really strives to become an artist. This is evidenced by his lack of interest in Miyokichi, a beautiful geisha who seems to have quite an affection for him. However, they do connect in some ways. While romance isn\u2019t a prominent part of the show, it does play a role as we can easily see some budding romance between the two. Furthermore, there\u2019s also Sukeroku who seems to be smitten by Miyokichi. Get the picture? What this brings is how complex the trio\u2019s relationship can be. Yakumo and Sukeroku has become close to the point that they almost seems like brothers. When Miyokichi enters the story, it almost feels like she\u2019s a wall between the two. Meanwhile, Yakumo seems to only be in love with rakugo and strives to be better, something that he actually succeeds later on in the series. To say the least, love in this series is beyond dramatic and even has a tone of tragedy to it. I also find it amusing that the show mixes in some gender bender at one point to spice up the sexuality vibes. However, it\u2019s mostly played down as a form of art to get viewers comfortable with the style of the show; in that being artistic with its storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I find very capitalizing about the show is the personalities of the characters. Yakumo seems to have a dual personality, one that\u2019s stoic with his reserved behavior while other times behaves like a gentlemen to entertain the audience. On the other hand, Sukeroku is more like the guy who seems casual all the time and easy to make friends with. Miyokichi has perhaps the most complicated personality as she seems to want certain people like Yakumo but her motivations aren\u2019t truly clear. Is she manipulative? Maybe. Is she fragile? In some ways, yes. Is she a bit too hopeless to be romantic? Who knows really. However, it should be noticeable that she realizes about Yakumo\u2019s personal feelings and unfortunately, she isn\u2019t really part of what he has in mind for. The show capitalizes on this emotional drama and later really makes a climax out of it, something that is very memorable. Later on, we\u2019ll also see how other characters enters the show because of their tragic relationship.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the insightful storytelling and characterization, the rakugo performances are also quite entertaining. The first episode (being double length) gives good insight about what rakugo really is like with the style, body language, dialogues, and storytelling of the performer. Despite the performer being stationary, it\u2019s fairly interesting to see how they act out each play. The stories themselves each contain a theme but always prominent characters that switches between tone and mannerism according to the story. While Yakumo and Sukeroku does differ a bit between their performances, it can easily be observed that the two strives to be the best at what they do. And that\u2019s something really inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nDEEN actually puts on quite a decent effort into the artwork for this series. I\u2019m honestly surprised but the visual quality is stellar. It\u2019s also realistic to portray the 1970s with the backgrounds and simple structures. Furthermore, characters are dressed in the way that is believable. Between character designs, the rakugo performances is also an art in itself and the choreography for the show is really well delivered with clever camera angles. This is even enhanced by the creative body languages. Character expression is important and this show nailed the coffin in that not just on stage but also between character interactions in real life. From Miyokichi\u2019s emotional breakdowns to Sukeroku\u2019s joyful acting, it\u2019s quite something to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack has more of a Japanese feudal tone to it, like something from the past. It\u2019s able to capture the feel of a performance with the character voice mannerisms. In addition, the show isn\u2019t shy to deliver dynamic dialogues especially with characters like Miyokichi. The OP and ED songs also has an unique feel that adds more to the show.\\n\\n\r\nAh how I wish this show could have lasted longer. But from what it\u2019s worth, the series really attempted t do something refreshing and unique. It capitalized on every theme and way a story should be told and it damn well delivered. Characterization remains strong while we get realistic human emotions that is easily recognizable. From the clever delivery of the dialogues to powerful chemistry between characters, it\u2019s a show that I would recommend to just about anyone.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: After his release from prison Yotarou (Seki, Tomokazu) seeks an apprenticeship in Rakugo from Yuurakutei Yakumo (Ishida, Akira), a renowned master of the art who was known as Kikuhiko in his earlier years. After some coercing the elderly master accepts him as his first pupil and through Yotarou\u2019s personality and the style of his developing Rakugo, Kikuhiko is reminded of somebody from his past. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is the story of Kikuhiko\u2019s upbringing alongside his friend and fellow apprentice Sukeroku (Yamadera, Kouichi) and how their relationship with Rakugo and each other shaped their lives.\r\n[Characters]:\r\nWhere bettera place to start discussing Shouwa Genroku than with its phenomenal main characters alongside their almost equally incredible supporting cast. Due to the overall strength of the show it is hard to say whether or not its characters are its greatest accomplishment however I think it is fair to say they are its most integral element. The show hosts a great many carefully developed personalities even among its less important cast members and the way it weaves complicated sentiments and emotions together is not only believable but genius. What at first manifests as something as simple as animosity quickly transforms into a mixture of respect and admiration all the while mingling with biting jealousy \u2013 the way in which Shouwa Genroku\u2019s characters behave is intricate and conflicting and subsequently are the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist of the show, though he does not truly appear until the second episode, is Kikuhiko who is a wonderfully compelling character. While at first he dislikes Rakugo because his tutelage under the 7th-generation Yakumo master represented the end of his previous desire to be a dancer, he steadily grows to enjoy performing it over time. He attempts to find his own voice within the medium, competes for recognition and improvement against his friend Sukeroku, and at times feels like he is wasting his time entirely in Rakugo yet proceeds none the less in a manner than can only be described as extraordinary organic. Kikuhiko, along with the rest of the cast, is fantastically authentic as a character and watching them all play off one another is both immersive and entertaining. It is also worth noting that, while Ishida Akira is a voice acting legend by this point, I believe his performance in this role to be his best work by far. The subject matter of the show and its many Rakugo presentations require a very artful and diverse approach and he delivers an absolutely stunning performance.\\n\\n\r\nSukeroku is a similarly outstanding character who\u2019s characterization further emphasizes the complexities at play within Shouwa Genroku\u2019s cast. Kikuhiko is introverted, self-conscious, and unsure of himself while Sukeroku appeares effortlessly talented yet wild and carefree almost to the point of his behavior becoming hazardous. The two men couldn\u2019t be more different yet they find common ground time and time again not only through their shared love of Rakugo but in other aspects of their lives as well  \u2013 their relationship is the dramatic meat of the show and it measures up to the emphasis placed upon it by the show in excess.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, practically every notable character in Shouwa Genroku is memorable. Roles that may have been left undeveloped in other shows are explored excellently through the subtext of the show\u2019s character interactions and dialogue rendering the entirety of the show\u2019s cast meaningful and interesting rather than solely its powerhouse main characters. People are rarely black and white, they are conflicted and volatile \u2013 susceptible to changing in each mood and meeting and Shouwa Genroku illustrates this perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe name \u2018Studio Deen\u2019 over the years has effectively become synonymous with art and animation issues due to frequent quality drops and problematic adaptations throughout their history. That being said, I almost find their past missteps entirely forgivable in the face of Shouwa Genroku\u2019s incredible visual delivery. Not only is the art style crisp and consistent but it is particularly interesting because of its imaginative use of colors, expressions, and character motion. The aesthetic of the show is highly reminiscent of shows like Aoi Bungaku which is wonderful for establishing a very authentic-feeling setting.\\n\\n\r\nAt premise the idea of Rakugo presents more of a problem than anything else \u2013 the orator is practically immobile when telling their story and the length of many of the classic Rakugo narratives means that the situation will be prolonged for quite a while. How then do you make Rakugo visually compelling to watch beyond merely the character\u2019s performance? Deen answers this question brilliantly in a number of ways, many of which showcasing the strength of the medium in regards to exhibiting these performances. The expression work for one fits very well with the idea of a single character portraying multiple roles within Rakugo \u2013 the shift in character expression is one of many telltale signs that the orator is switching between characters and the show\u2019s diverse selection of expressions makes these portrayals all the more impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe imagery of the show surrounding its Rakugo elevates its visuals to the next level. Using shot reverse shot of a singular character further illustrates their swapping of roles however this technique is used sparingly enough as not to become one-dimensional or corny. The close-up shots of the character\u2019s expressions during the performance strike a great balance between the slew of differently personalities being performed and the actual mood of the performer. Seeing Kikuhiko and Sukeroku bleed through in their performances without dropping character is brilliantly balanced. Lastly, the show makes use of fictional imagery to accentuate the legitimacy of the performance. Light can be shone through a non-existant window when the character opens a door or peers outside and the environment surrounding the orator may change to different locations yet the performance remains cohesive. Shouwa Genroku goes beyond providing incredible visuals and tells the story in a way that could have only been done within the medium at hand.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative of Shouwa Genroku is just as impressive as its characters and visuals and plays to its strengths by emphasizing its character drama. The pacing is slow yet never unexciting allowing for it to play out almost full Rakugo performances which are one of the show\u2019s primary means of exhibiting character growth and change. The show itself is quite dramatic however the lighthearted subject matter and punchlines within Rakugo provide the show with excellent flexibility between the two moods.\\n\\n\r\nAlongside presenting highly compelling character chemistry and development Shouwa Genroku asks provocative questions through its narrative. Is an art form something lofty and objective or is it something that should cater to the pleasure of the audience? Do you protect tradition or do you venture something new and perhaps save the very art form you practice? Must you practice something in its original form even until it dies away or should you break its conventions and bring to it new life? These queries and themes are explored at length through the interactions and ideologies the show\u2019s characters providing offering an additional intellectual element to the show\u2019s already ingenious design.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nInitially I felt that the music of the show was merely a backdrop for the fantastic setting and scenes transpiring however as Shouwa Genroku progressed its importance and effectiveness became more evident. While at first unassuming, the soundtrack drums up the pace of each scene. The atmosphere, the mood, the character\u2019s internal thoughts \u2013 everything. The relaxed, jazzy influence of the music fits well with the pacing of the show, quickening and swelling at moments of tension or severity to accentuate the attitude of the scene. It is used sparingly and never overwhelms the show\u2019s visuals, providing a fantastic juxtaposition that underscores the importance of each development.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku is artistic, it is emotional, it is brilliant. Each component of its structure is as strong as the last and it tells a gripping story full of wonderfully written, complex characters set against incredible visuals. Though I made mention of Ishida Akira earlier the show features a number of outstanding vocal performances as its subject matter lends itself so well to the exhibition of that talent.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\\n\r\nI gave Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu a 10 because of its fantastic qualities across the board. Its characters were wonderfully realistic and compelling, the story being told was captivating, and the visual approach of the show was highly entertaining. While not without flaws the countless successes it enjoys far outshine any of its missteps.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Shouwa Genroku to anyone interested in character-dramas who aren\u2019t turned off by methodical pacing. The comedy of the show comes secondary to the development of its characters and the drama of their interactions however the show does possess a certain carefree levity that might appeal to people looking for something relaxed yet upbeat.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu has been hyped to me as the best anime of this year. Mature historical drama with amazing voice acting and editing. \r\nFirst lets tackle the voice acting which is truly spectacular. Especially during Rakugo scenes where voice actors shine at almost mindblowing levels. It really shows how great Japanese voice acting is. I am not japanese speaker so I can't really appreciate or criticize the rakugo perfomances but I can hear how the voice actors can jump between characters during the performance and it's pretty fantastic.\r\nWith that also comes the editing which smartly uses cuts and camera angles to enhance therakugo scenes and I absolutely loved it. Really great stuff\\n\\n\r\nThe drama is good and not so good. I appreciate the maturity of the series and how it tackled themes of obsession loneliness and devotion, but the story itself is hardly original and at certain points it becomes kinda stupid. I am talking about the episode 12 in particular. The stuff that is happening here feels like forced end of the plotline because author wasn\u2019t sure how to end it. It was just dumb. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of production is okay. The music is great mix of traditional Japanese music and jazz. The animation is inconsistent. Especially when it comes to scenes with audiences. You have this beautifully drawn main characters and then the camera cuts to the audience and you see blobs with eyes. I know these characters are completely irrelevant but the difference of quality is truly striking. \\n\\n\r\nOnly truly interesting character to me was Kikuhiko who was greatly complex. Some people might say that Sukeroku was the best character, but to me he was just straight up Gary Sue. Sure he\u2019s drunk and filthy and lazy but that\u2019s about all that\u2019s bad about him. He still performs godlike rakugo at the end of the day and everybody still loves him. He only has 2 interesting moments in the entire series, one comes out of nowhere but I enjoyed it, the other came way too late for me to care. Overall the cast is not bad per se and it obviously mainly focuses on the dynamic between the two main characters but there\u2019s nothing notable. \\n\\n\r\nI am glad this anime was created because it taught me about the great art of rakugo but outside of its setting the story is hardly original. Far from bad, and not so far from amazing but still far enough. \\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS !!\r\nI did not know anything about Rakugo, and when I went to see this anime surprised me a lot, I started to like Rakugo and I was looking on youtube about videos in Japan of people seeing Rakugo as much as I liked.\r\n(Story = 9,5/10)\r\nI like it a lot when you explore the past of a character who suffered with certain losses in life and how he got that way. And the way they explored was excellent, the story is very rich and captivating with their main characters who are: Bon and Shin. Rakugo was something very well presentedto those who do not know and his presentation of Rakugo with the characters were very well directed, it was not boring, they were creative and very interesting and sometimes funny depending on the kind of story they told. In the dramatic moments they were very well consistent to the scene with each perspective of the character very well presented during the plot, with certain moments very sad, but very realistic within his narrative. A pity that did not present Yotaru very well, but this season was made to show more of Bon's past.\\n\\n\r\n(Characters = 10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI loved the characters of this anime, even though they were few, were very well developed. The dialogues during Bon and Shin were a lot of fun, it's cool the interaction between them, and they developed their relationship very well during the journey, which is very nice when they recognize the work and style of Rakugo of each one during the work and how they are perfecting the skills to make a better Rakugo. The conflicts they had with these characters were essential, with good messages of lives, often exciting. The Miyokichi was a character who had a good importance in the plot, focusing well on the main drama about this character, managed to convey well the emotions to the viewer during the scenes with her.\\n\\n\r\n(Art, Animation = 9/10)\\n\r\nI loved the art, color palettes well selected, design of very well made characters. The background are very beautiful as are the used clothes. Now what struck me was how well used were some well-heeled Rakugo art scenes, also used in certain dramatic scenes to increase the weight of the scene. About the animation is very good and consistent but nothing spectacular.\\n\\n\r\n(Sound = 10/10)\\n\r\nI love Jazz as in Baccano, and a well-done jazz like this is appreciated, it was very well used during the scenes of Rakugo that gave more immersion to the work, besides the fun moments that became very cool. During the dramatic scenes they used the violin and piano very well done, leaving the scene more dramatic still. The sound effects with the instruments of ancient Japan contributed much with the immersion experience. The dubbing was something that impressed me, they did an excellent dubbing, combined the voice with each character, and during Rakugo they managed to convey a sense that the story was real, with the voice acting of each person told during Rakugo.\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment = 9/10)\\n\r\nRakugo was a unique experience, I hoped it would be a rather dull journey with some interesting things, but good thing I was completely wrong, I loved the stories of each character and his conflicts, very well done, and had a lot of fun during Rakugo. Every aspect like sound, art, animation, direction contributed even more to the experience that was Rakugo.\\n\\n\r\n(Overall = 9,5/10)\\n\r\nThis show probably will not please everyone, but if you are looking for a work with a unique premise and a well made storrytelling with slower pace this work is for you. It lacked little to be masterpiece, I think that if it were a little more impacting would have my maximum score, I hope it in the 2 season will do it.",

            "content": "Rakugo. Essentially, the art of storytelling. But through the course of these 13 episodes, we discover there is so much more to this ancient Japanese art-form. There is great attention to technique, pacing, the teller's voice, the genre of story and so on. What SGRS does is transport us to a time when this beautiful yet under appreciated art-form is stagnant and slowly dying, due to other emerging entertainments such as television. Yet also the stubbornness and pride of the elder Rakugo masters to stick to old traditions and their disdain for anything new and different. \r\nI wont go too much into the story asone of the joys is its slowly unravelling nature. But it is fairly simple on paper: it shows the friendship of two young men, both up and coming Rakugo students, and how they approach the art of storytelling (and indeed life itself) very differently. Both have boundless passion for this art, which maintains their strong lifelong bond. This bond of brotherhood is the core of the show, and it so powerful. The characters on SGRS are some of the most wonderfully complex and engaging ive ever come across in Anime. In fact just thinking about them now gets me quite emotional. This is the power of the show. Not to mention the side characters, who each have their own fleshed out and engaging stories, some very sad, but also as powerful.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of amazing characters and a quietly devastating, profound, and sometimes very sad tale, we have some breathtaking art and sound. The opening and closing credits contain beautiful melancholy jazz tunes (oh man that ending credits song just destroyed me EVERY time). The art is gorgeous in its attention to detail, the period details from the pre and post war Japan are spot on. Its obvious so much love went into this adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly could write thousands of words about this show. It has a quiet power that devastated me by its conclusion. It is so different from any other anime ive ever seen. Its not only one of the best anime of 2016, it is one of the best anime ive ever watched. A masterpiece.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "A diamond in the rough, that\u2019s for sure. Who could have thought that a show dedicated to the art of sitting down and telling a story could be so engaging? Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu has blown me away with its ability to create a thoroughly fleshed-out cast, packed to the brim with personality. I hung on to every word that was said, and in a show revolving heavily around dialogue, that would be critical to helping the anime hit the mark. The performances are always entertaining but always serve that dual purpose of opening up a window into our characters\u2019 lives and their troubles. Thisis a character drama at its sumptuous best. Coupled with some beautiful character design, charming music and expressive animation, Studio DEEN have created the criminally under watched darling of the Winter 2016 season.\\n\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is a delightful tale, mostly made as wonderful it is by the excellent, dynamic relationship forged between lead characters. The way that the timid and tidy Bon Kikuhiko is at odds with the loud and carefree Shin Hatsutaro helps drive much of the story forward. Their conflicts go a long way to developing their distinct personalities and makes for viewing ranging from side-splittingly funny to tear-jerking. At its simplest explanation, we follow the story of these two men aiming to perfect their Rakugo \u2013 the centuries-old art of delivering a story from seated (\u2018seiza\u2019) position. What makes the anime something memorable however is that it\u2019s not only about Bon and Shin trying to master their craft, but using it to help overcome their own fears and push aside the elements of their life they refuse to face. The beauty of the story is that it accomplishes so much with ease. It even goes out of its way to give commentary on the role that Rakugo has in people\u2019s lives and the gradual decline of the Rakugo industry. These ideas are all woven seamlessly into a wonderful story that wouldn\u2019t feel out of place as a Rakugo piece of its own.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t remember the last time I was so invested in a character relationship as I was between Bon and Shin. Their disgust at the way the other one approaches the world of Rakugo is at odds with an admiration they have for parts of the other person\u2019s personality they feel like they are missing from their own lives. Shin has a natural talent for Rakugo though his methods go against the style that\u2019s popular with the institution. Bon struggles to make a presence on stage and though he maintains a prim and proper approach, he can\u2019t help but feel he\u2019s being left behind. This relationship is packed with a tonne of grey areas and feels like it could break apart or bond closer at any moment. It\u2019s gripping. When romance eventually weaves its way into their lives then the strain takes the story to a whole new level. If you\u2019re a lover of multi-dimensional characters, then our lead two performers will leave you wanting more. A big thumbs up to Bon (Akira Ishida) and Shin\u2019s (Kouichi Yamadera) VA\u2019s who were superb.\\n\\n\r\nEverything Studio DEEN have done in the animation and character design department has been superb. An earthly colour tone makes it feel somewhat like a period piece. Everything has this feeling of being subdued and grounded. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu actually feels like an artwork. Characters have a distinct smirk you\u2019ll quickly come to love or a pained look that you can\u2019t help but empathise with. Animation goes a long way to making Bon and Shin\u2019s performances so entertaining. Very little is lost in translation because their faces manage to convey so much. DEEN aren\u2019t even afraid to put animation towards larger crowds and busy scenes every now. It all feels like a labour of love. This is a true redemption moment for a studio that has become the butt of many jokes over the years, particularly in the animation department.\\n\\n\r\nSmooth jazz, melancholic strings and tender piano songs are never at odds with one another in a beautiful audio package here. They work in harmony to help drive home the comedy or chip away at your heart, but it\u2019s never overwrought. Memorable melodies are to be found everywhere. A massive thank you to composer Kana Shibue for making a stunning debut in the anime industry with a score that manages to play a crucial role in making Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu as memorable as it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe less you know about Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu the better the experience will be. A tale of two men fighting to rise to the top in a dying art is enthralling and magical. It\u2019s a complete package from the art to the voice acting to the music and of course a top-notch story.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is a historical Josei manga written by Kumota Haruko that began in 2010. Just this year, an anime adaptation aired, being brought to us by Studio Deen. You may recall them as the studio behind Read or Die, Gravitation, The law of Ueki, & Sakura Trick. Just to name some of their series I've looked at. How does this historical drama compare? Let's take a look and see.\r\nStory:\r\nWe open our tale with a young man getting released from prison. He makes his way to the theatre and begs the Rakugo master, Yakumo, to make him his apprentice. Yakumo reluctantly accepts andtake Yotarou with him. At Yakumo's home, Yotarou meets Konatsu, a young woman who was raised by him. After committing a massive faux pas during one of Yakumo's Rakugo performances, Yotarou begs for forgiveness. Yakumo sits him and Konatsu down and tells them the story of how he and Konatsu's father began their lives as Rakugo storytellers. The bulk of the series follows the flashback, showing how things reached the state that they're in at the opening of the series.\\n\\n\r\nLet's examine the series' faults first. There are some fairly minor ones. The most noticeable is that Yakumo's story includes scenes that he wasn't present for and these are pretty specific scenes where there's no real reason that someone would have told him exactly what happened in detail. Is he just guessing at what happened for the sake of embellishment? It's also a bit jarring when Yakumo's story ends and we abruptly skip ahead to events that take place quite a long time after. How did Yotarou & Konatsu respond to his story? What events led them to the point where they were at the end? Bugger if I know. Maybe when they get a second series they'll spend most of it on a flashback to show us that missing time. But, as things stand, there's really not much point to Yakumo telling his story to Konatsu & Yotarou since we see neither a reaction from them nor any evidence of character growth because of it.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are a lot of positive aspects to the series. The series excels at illustrating realistic situations with all of the joys and sorrows that can stem from them. It does so in a very compelling and nuanced way. The way it handles its foreshadowed character death reminds me of A Prayer for Owen Meany. Both works involve a character reminiscing about a lost friend and both proceed to show you who this character was, faults and strengths, while demonstrating why they mattered to the reminiscing character and make a strong case for why they should matter to us too. See, Divergence Eve? It is possible to show a character's death in advance and still get the audience invested. In addition to telling the tragic story of Yakumo's old friend, the series also contains a coming of age story. Telling how he came into his own as a performer and showing his growth from child to man. The two tales are heavily intertwined and they're both superb.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAny strong slice of life narrative requires strong characters. Otherwise you just have a bunch of gits doing mundane things. Fortunately, that's an arena where this series absolutely excels. We see a lot of progression for both Yakumo and Sukeroku. The way they react to one another, the way they respond to others and the way they influence one another all change over the course of the series in a very natural way. The character progression never feels contrived or forced. It's also interesting to see how their personalities get reflected in the way they perform rakugo and how that changes as they start to develop their own styles instead of trying to copy their instructors. That isn't a simple feat nor is it something that could have been done without complex characters. The cast in general just has a great deal of verisimilitude and is really well fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this is really good. There's a lot of detail put into the snippets of rakugo performances that we see. Studio Deen clearly put a great deal of effort into making them look realistic. They actually are very impressive. The backgrounds are nicely detailed and the character designs are well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe vocal cast in this is stellar. Our three major characters, Yakumo, Sukeroku & Miyokichi are portrayed by Ishida Akira, Yamadera Kouichi & Hayshibara Megumi. Three spectacular actors and all of them are brilliant in this. The more secondary characters are well acted as well. Seki Tomokazu & Kobayashi Yuu voice our present day characters, Yotarou & Konatsu and they do really well. The music has a very classical feel, complementing the old-fashioned story telling tradition quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't any.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, is a pretty impressive series. It has a strong narrative, superb characters and acting and really good art and animation. If you're interested in historical dramas at all, I do recommend trying it. For myself, I give it an enthusiastic 9/10. Next week, I'm looking at Yuri Kuma Arashi. It's actually not a request. I kind of stumbled upon the basic premise randomly and I'm very morbidly curious. I'll get back to doing requests on the 25th.. This one just sounds so bizarre that I have to try it.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is an incredibly sophisticated show about creating art and the consequences of growing up with it. A story that takes place through not one, not two, but three generations of a rather obscure in the west form of art that is rakugo, best described as Japanese traditional stand up, focused on either comedic or horror-oriented storytelling performed by one person that only uses different voice tones during dialogues and slight gestures, with the only prop being a fan, to convey one of the previously written stories. It can be done in front of a live audience, where it showcases its truebeauty, or recorded to pass on for the future generations. \\n\\n\r\nAs you may notice, that description doesn't sound promising. A historical show about people performing such a boring activity looks boring. The thing is: it's not. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot starts off in the future, as a recently released convict and an ex gang member tries to become an apprentice of the legendary rakugo artist: Yakumo, also known as the eighth generation. He somehow gets accepted, and studies different forms of it in his master's house, which he shares with a girl that he raised - Konatsu - and sometimes his employee Matsuda. The convict receives the name of Yotarou and begins his rocky journey. \\n\r\nIt turns out, that Konatsu's father was another great rakugo artist - Sukeroku, a very talented and great in delivery artist who passed away ten years prior to the events of the first episode. She blames Yakumo for his death and harbors great resentment towards him. After a few events, the concerned Yakumo decides to tell both her and Yotarou who is searching for inspiration about his past, how he met Sukeroku, how they tried their best to be the best they can at their profession and how it all tragically fell apart, all because of something way more simple than art. \\n\\n\r\nThis show's way of storytelling can be described in one word: refined. There is no part of it that is unnecessary, every scene holds meaning and can be traced backwards or forwards to other scenes to see character development and change in the world of this show. It starts off with children: Bon and Shin, or as we later know them as: Yakumo and Sukeroku, becoming apprentices of \"the seventh generation\" rakugo master Yakumo Yuurakutei. The difference between them is that Bon wanted to be a dancer, but due to his leg getting severely hurt he was forced to do rakugo by his mother. Sukeroku was always passionate, from the very first scene we can see his love and infatuation with it. The plot takes us throughout their careers as rakugo performers and lives as normal people. Yakumo grows up to be a stoic figure that struggles to find his own rakugo, while Sukeroku quickly becomes comfortable in the environment, however pushes it too far and defies orders given to by his more experienced colleagues. Their development is consistent and in each episode the viewer can receive a powerful, emotional punch in the guts as the atmosphere and, well, the entire first episode spoils the show. Sukeroku will die and leave behind a child for Yakumo to take care of. I don't particularly like the usage of in media res in anything, but Rakugo pulls it off. It's so important that it starts this way, because it throws away the possibility of screwing up the big reveal and instead focuses on telling a story of how it got to that point, which this show is all about anyway. It's told through Yakumo's perspective, his past experiences and the information he gathered about the events he describes, which makes the viewer understand his character especially very well. You know what makes him tick at all times and what his thoughts are about any given topic the show tackles, but at the same time you are left with the mysteries of Sukeroku's mind. It creates a great dynamic and strengthens the feeling of real connection between the two, as Yakumo is always interested in his friend, which makes the viewer feel the same way as we see those events through his perception of the situation. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is crafted masterfully. It always knew what it was doing and didn't squander a single minute of its runtime to do something unrelated to its themes and ideas. A simple casual banter between the two main characters always eventually ends up on the topic of rakugo, as it's the only thing they can really think about, it's their job and they both really want to be good at it. However, the beginning and the ending of each of those talks make it feel like a real conversation, and a solid piece of writing with good build up and conclusion. The romantic storyline that comes into play later also has exactly that, however, just like anything else besides Yakumo's and Sukeroku's conversation, those story threads have a much wider exposition of ideas and topics. Rakugo is dying, and it's apparent that it's nearing its end by the time the events of the first episode occur. Both Yakumo and Sukeroku have their own ideas about how they want to go about reviving it, but one's clearly more passionate about it than the other from the beginning. It almost makes it feel like a rivalry, when it's really not, but it does make the show this much more interesting, knowing that the world is alive and changing. \\n\\n\r\nThe most impressive thing to me about Rakugo is that it has the confidence to built a story that will be boring to many. Not only is it slow paced, but throughout the 13 episode run time it presents numerous, fully animated, fully voice acted, actual rakugo performances by several cast members. Not only that, but they make them a key element of the show's thematic presentation, and it pays off. Those performances are simply astonishing, not only is the directing during those segments absolutely on point, but so is the usage of music and some of the best voice acting in modern anime. I have never seen a better example of something, that could only be created in this one medium that is anime. Those camera shots, focusing on specific parts of the characters or the audiences, following them in a way that no real camera could, is what makes Rakugo this much better than its competition. It feels realistic and fluid, but if you think about it, it's all anime magic, which is just great. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's something that I would complain about, it's that some scenes are made to be overly long. Not like they don't add to the topic, but I feel like the way the characters talk could be shortened while still maintaining the mostly consistent characterization and flow of the series. There were moments where I thought that they should just stop talking, but they add a remark that somehow makes the last one feel less important in the process, creating a rather confusing exchange. They always get out of those tight spots though, finding ways to really make it through unscathed, so it's not a huge deal. Just a writing issue, every show has those.\\n\\n\r\nThe interactions between the cast are the most endearing, charming yet tragic moments that Rakugo has to offer. The thought that nothing will go their way should constantly be in your head, because even during the happy moments, where something goes the way someone wanted it to, there's always the reminder that their life is actually a never ending, spinning circle of pain and suffering for higher causes. Sometimes it's art, sometimes it's friendship and sometimes it's actually not as important as anything like that, but nonetheless, they go through everything for a reason. That reason is always clear too. There's not a point where someone's motivations are particularly unclear, but that doesn't mean they aren't convoluted. \\n\r\nThe two main characters are best described by their Rakugo performances and the stories they decide to do. Yakumo finds himself to be more confident with some racy, or even erotic stories. He is good at creating a believable and fun women during the time he's given. Sukeroku on the other hand is simply a genius, one that isn't understood during his time or appreciated, but he's someone that could've pushed rakugo back to its rightful place in the entertainment business, but he was too care-free to properly dedicate to it. He's way more expressive, everything he performs seems to be easy. Simply put: Yakumo treats his art as a sort of a job that he has to go to every day and get better at no matter what, while Sukeroku is already good enough, but he doesn't put in the work necessary to be recognized more and more, to grow as a celebrity, as he is already a fantastic artist. Those approaches are really all the characterization you need to understand them, but there's so much more to it than just that. They have differing opinions about love, money, women, respect for those who are more experienced and other topics. But there's one thing that connects them: passion. Passion that even when faced the hardest of dilemmas, still sneaks back in to make their life even harder, and just when they think they're ready to give up on it, it comes back and breaks their heart. It's the reason behind every decision in their life, their burning desire to do rakugo, while sometimes a bit more cooled off, makes them become who they become by the end of their story together. It's not like they wanted to be there, life was supposed to be more simple than what they got themselves into, but they both are able to accept it. Why? Because its their life and relationship that they created and worked hard for, that was built off of their passion for rakugo and ended because of that exact thing. That's simply a beautiful, heart throbbing theme that this show revolves around. It's strong, well written, and makes those characters work as good as they do alongside an already great story and elevate it, as they work alongside each other nearly perfectly, well enough for me not to care about any minor mistakes. \\n\\n\r\nI mentioned previously how good the animation and directing is during the rakugo scenes, but it's not only those parts that are this good. The everyday lives of the cast look just as good, if at moments not better. The use of lighting and background art in this show is truly a feat to admire, it always creates a feeling of a new and fresh take on the place you've already seen as new camera shots and new perspectives are utilized. Not only that, but there are moments where they take it to the next level, as an example a scene from episode 9 where Sukeroku and another person are in a room, and as the light color switches from orange to black almost unnoticeably (!), as the tone of the scene itself draws the viewer in more and his brain interprets it as a natural course of action, where the characters turned off the light for a reason, rather than a bad transition. It's marvelous really. The animation is on par, smooth and polished so it will never feel weird or immersion-breaking. \\n\\n\r\nI have to mention that this is one of those shows that actually draws mouths after the voice actors perform their parts and match them together, not the other way around, and it REALLY shows. The mouth movement fits really well, much better than most other shows that only make mouths open when someone talks and closes when they're done. Here you can actually sort of see their lips, which was an extremely pleasant addition. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone always praises the visuals of this show, but I honestly prefer the music. It's also a pretty important thing in the show itself, as there's constant mentions of dancing and the rakugo performances themselves are accompanied by an entrance music. But that's not the only thing. This show nails its atmosphere by the change in its music more times than some give it credit for. It's used in rakugo scenes to make the viewer understand one of the two things better: the level of excitement in the audience, or the confidence of the performer, most of the times both, as they obviously correlate. Of course besides that, the soundtrack fits the period and setting of the show, uses traditional Japanese tunes and instruments to really emphasize that feel of Rakugo being a story that has been changing throughout time that passes in the show. The soundtrack is full of good pieces on its own and works just as well as a stand-alone, but it's clearly made for the show as the inspirations can be heard pretty easily if you've watched the show first. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is simply a must watch. It's an experience so strong and so expressive about its ideas and world view that it may even make you uncomfortable. You may not agree with the its idea of what art, love or passion is, but after watching this, you'd have to say that it is a pretty compelling argument that can't really be accused of enough flaws to make it unbelievable. It's a very grounded story, at times even awkwardly grounded as it can seem so improbable, but it really is. It's a tale of mistakes and misconceptions, and retains all the qualities that make dramas good, but gets rid of unnecessary melodrama and pushes the suspension of disbelief just far enough with each event so that it can remain grounded, and that's really what makes this show so good. It's something that you would think couldn't work as it's way too obscure and too far off from what you're used to, but it turns out it just isn't. It's something that breaks the barriers of nationality or beliefs, as those are human things that can't be changed, and remains a fantastic story available for literally anyone, just like a rakugo story performed by a skilled artist. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion. I highly encourage you to develop your own.",

            "content": "The first time I watched Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, I turned it off ten minutes into the double-size first episode. It seemed dry and unengaging. Other anime from the same season had, in the best attention-deficit traditions, included some big dramatic hook or reveal early in their opening episode to grab the viewer. Set against them, Rakugo felt tedious. But I dropped almost every other anime from that season, and I picked this one back up, finishing it in two days. \r\nWhat I realised was that Rakugo is unique among anime, in that it's a novel. Its strengths lie in the naturalistic rendering of humanbehaviour and situations as well as the detailed evocation of a historical period. It draws you in by slowly revealing fascinating, damaged characters locked in a poisonous stalemate: Konatsu, an orphaned girl who loves rakugo and could never perform it, and the foremost rakugo artist of his time, the former rival of the girl's father - Yurakutei Yakumo, who I will call Kikuhiko. Konatsu hates Kikuhiko enough to want to kill him, but lives in his house; he treats her with indifference and condescension, sometimes shading into irritation, but he never throws her out. Why? What debt does he owe her, and why does she hate him so much? How did her father die? \\n\\n\r\nAnimes tend to be driven by very different questions, which are forward-looking. Usually, the protagonists are either striving to fulfill their dreams or trying to deal with a situation which provides the impetus for the plot. Rakugo is unique, and more like a novel than almost any anime, because it's about the past, and about how the combination of your circumstances, your personality, your desires, the people you meet, and the society you live in, shape your life. Which is an excellent thing to be about when the subject of your questions is Kikuhiko.\\n\\n\r\nA diffident, strait-laced neurotic with a deep loneliness at his centre as well as a bitter determination to not give up and be abandoned again, Kikuhiko is one of the all-time great anime protagonists. He is deeply flawed and often cruel, but an innate idealism and a wounded innocence at his heart keeps him sympathetic. His psychological development is profoundly well-realised. Kikuhiko's foil, Sukeroku, is jolly and uninhibited, a supremely talented rakugoka who has a gift for drawing people to him and making them laugh. It would be predictable for Kikuhiko to simply hate him, and for them to be contrasted as dark and light, but Rakugo is far more intelligent about its characters than that. They may contrast, but they also inform each other. Sukeroku's lack of inhibition leads him to debauchery and a disregard for proper conduct which comes to hurt his career even as Kikuhiko overcomes his lack of talent with obsessive study to develop his own style of art, and his rigid decorum makes him the preferred child of the rakugo establishment. But they don't become enemies; they like each other too much. \\n\\n\r\nThe strange relationship between Kikuhiko and Sukeroku, with love and mutual artistic appreciation and jealousy and resentment all tied up in it, is at the core of the anime: their introvert/extrovert opposition shades into its depiction of the paradoxes in the art of rakugo - a totally solitary performance which requires a rakugoka to know and truly understand people, and be able to impersonate many at once, to succeed. It is steeped in tradition, and rakugokas must conform to strictly conservative standards of behaviour, as if they represent the old values of Japan. But at the same time, rakugokas are working stiffs with an especially precarious occupation, and socially speaking, just lowly entertainers. Kikuhiko cannot be in a relationship with a geisha if he wants to advance in rakugo, but the stories he tells are often bawdy; overt sexuality is in fact his specialty, despite his personal frigidity. Sukeroku's enthusiastic caricatures are at first depicted as the gold standard, but they lack the subtlety of Kikuhiko's art; it's to the anime's credit that you begin to notice and appreciate rakugo enough to realise how their art reflects who they are. The fine layering of detail combined with the naturalistic development of the characters, all scored spectacularly by a traditional shamisen-and-taiko-drums soundtrack, makes Rakugo as satisfying on a sensory level as it is intellectually fascinating.\\n\\n\r\nThese contradictions and the way the protagonists navigate them while being inevitably changed in the process, give a deep thematic richness to Rakugo, which uses the rise and fall of Sukeroku and Kikuhiko both as a way to examine artistic obsession, jealousy, love, and brotherhood, and as a way to depict the cultural shifts in Japan after World War Two. Here, its insights are not as sharp; it's more a character piece than social commentary, but the thirty-year canvas on which the story is painted allows for a sense of epic scope to the stories of the characters. Much like rakugo itself, the anime combines acute observation of humanity with a slightly artificial shape to its narrative. Its tragic end, where Kikuhiko and Sukeroku's selfish mistakes result, with karmic symmetry, in two always-expected and yet shocking deaths, feels more melodramatic than naturalistic, and yet it is brutally sad and horrifying. This anime can make what should seem false and contrived into something that hits you on a visceral level, and that's appropriate: it's what rakugo's all about.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was definitely not an extremely popular show when it aired. And yet, after a few different sources said that this show was different, but definitely worth watching, I tried it out. And the result was an amazing, sorely underrated show that is incomparable to anything else.\r\nStory: There are two sides to the story of Shouwa Genroku. There is the basic rakugo side of the story, and then there is the story of the characters, and their lives. Before this show, I had never really heard of rakugo. However, I did a quick google search, and then watched the show, and Imust say, the show did a fantastic job with this element. In the first episode, the show has a character do a full rakugo segment. And it is fascinating. I was enthralled in the actual rakugo presented, and how well the show executed said rakugo. Even if there had been no plot outside of the rakugo, I could have watched the show just for the rakugo. \\n\\n\r\nThe other big element of the story is the lives and journeys of the characters. Interestingly enough, the majority of this show is actually made up of backstory. But it was some of the most interesting backstory I have ever seen. It explores the upbringing and life of Yuurakutei, Yakumo (or known as kikuhiko). It starts with him as a young boy and his introduction to rakugo and the world that comes with it. Kikuhiko moves into a house with a rakugo master, and he meets another boy who is also an apprentice named Sukeroku. And we see these two boys grow up, and bond, and find themselves. And it is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI do not use that term lightly. But I couldn't find a better way to describe it. The story is beautiful because it is raw, and heartfelt, and interesting, and there are ups and downs, and almost anything and everything. But really, it's just so real. The show does not try to do too many things, or force things in for the audience's benefit, but instead, it tells a simple and yet very complex story of a man.  Another very interesting thing about this, is that because this is backstory, we know the general outcome of what happens to all the main characters. And yet it still managed to have me so extremely interested, because the characters and their interactions were so engaging.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Let us start with Kikuhiko. Kikuhiko is a generally steely-eyed serious man. He has a rather down to earth personality and is seemingly no nonsense. He has a very interesting type of charm. He is handsome, yes, but he is also extremely hard working and caring. And although on the outside, it would seem like he does not have a large amount of emotions, the show executes his character in a way that we can feel all of his emotions. And he has a lot of them. And he is also not a perfect man. The show does not try to make him perfect. One of the best things about this show is that they embrace each characters flaws. Kikuhiko can be brutal. But it makes his character that much more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSukeroku is the opposite of Kikuhiko. Which is possibly why they mesh together so well. Sukeroku is extremely loud, outgoing and brash. As he grows older he likes to go out and drink a lot. We get to see Sukeroku as he tries to navigate the world of rakugo which is very proper and traditional with his loud and flamboyant personality and versions of rakugo. He was a great character too.\\n\\n\r\nI'm actually not going to talk about any more characters because this review would go on forever, but there is no character that I disliked. Every single one was intriguing and had their flaws and there good parts. And they all interacted so well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm just going to comment on the character designs. The designs were really fantastic because they reflected the personality of the character. Kikuhiko's design was very serious and curt looking whereas Sukeroku had a very wild looking design. I really admired that element. \\n\\n\r\nSound: surprisingly nice too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I cannot say enough about this anime. Very rarely do I rate shows with a 10/10, but this show deserved it. And there is a season 2! The story was amazing, and very real and interesting, both in the past and the present. This show does not have enough recognition, and although it may not be for everyone, if you can appreciate a more subtle beauty in a show, then go watch this. You may just find an unforgettable experience.",

            "content": "To be excellent, an anime doesn't always need to be endowed with great ideas. It doesn't always have to explore overwhelming themes. It doesn't need to have deeper meaning. Sometimes, subtlety and proper execution of everything it does is sufficient to make a masterful series. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is such an anime.\r\nShouwa starts off in the modern day Japan but shifts to the past soon after. This time shift is handled with profound care and in quite an interesting way. The transition is written very well and doesn't feel a least bit disturbing. In such manner, we're presented with a wonderful story of friendship,brotherhood and life. One that will curve a deep feeling in your heart and make you only crave for more.\\n\\n\r\nThe defining aspect of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is the atmosphere, which is relayed in a bit peculiar yet strong way. Instead of the environmental design and background musics, what creates its atmosphere is the characters' voice acting, body language and interaction. Being an anime about rakugo, a classic medium of Japanese entertainment which is basically a rakugo performer performing a comedic play, its majority of execution is centered around these plays and characters who performs them. These performance is so brilliantly presented that without making it blatant, the anime makes the viewers understand when a performance is lacking despite a lot of efforts being put into it, or when a performance really reaches the heart easily. Basically, this anime perfectly executes how a performance has been executed; and seamlessly so.\\n\\n\r\nOne needn't to hold great knowledge about rakugo or its system to enjoy this brilliant show. I had absolutely no idea about what rakugo is when I started this series, but it didn't at all hold me back from understanding what's happening. Due to the subtle presentation, I was immensely captivated and instantly pulled into its fluid storytelling. No other anime pulled me in its atmosphere as Shouwa did and its all thanks to its magnificent execution.\\n\\n\r\nAs a purely character driven drama, Shouwa's main aspect is its characters. Similar to everything else in it, this anime presents its characters powerfully. The characters are introduced perfectly. We see their relations forming subtly as the story progresses and the character interaction really grows on us. The characters feel dear to us and this anime successfully makes us care for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of the characters and their interactions is consistent; and coherent with the main plot. We see them developing due to circumstances and their relations change accordingly. This is all handled in a plausible and realistic manner. Yuurakutei Yakumo or Bon is one of my top 10 favorite anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the writing of the characters is a masterful job, their design and facial expressions are worthy of remark. Not just the characters, but also their attires, surroundings and atmosphere, all was perfectly designed. The mesmerizing and smooth animation does an excellent job in giving the series life. It was an absolute piece of art to behold.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fairly honest, I didn't notice much of a background music in Shouwa Genroku. It did have them (I rechecked), but the seamless presentation coated them so well that they support the execution superbly without preaching their existence. It doesn't fill every moment shoving music, but rather uses them where they truly belong. This invites a serene atmosphere that allows the anime to deliver as much as possible. The OP is amazing with great visual exposition, the ending is wonderful as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important part of its sound system is the voice acting as the anime is about vocal performance. The voice actors literally have to perform vocal rakugo for this anime. I'm not very knowledgeable in seiyuu, but Shouwa's voice actors did it perfectly. From rakugo performance to dialogues between the characters to the characters talking to themselves, this anime's voice acting flourishes. I see no way for this to be done any better.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing of the story is one of the most consistent in anime. I personally liked the story a lot. This is touching, this is enchanting. I enjoyed it all through. But if I have to voice a complaint, I'd say it was slightly weak around the end of the past story. I had expected a bit more from it. It was quite out of the blue. And I found it to be quite difficult to believe because it was slightly over the top. But it was still very well directed and successfully made my eyes wet.\\n\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is an experience. It beholds a fine drama with great character emphasis. Truly a brilliant series through and through. Therefore, I bestow upon it a score of 8 out of 10, for it is worth every bit of it. A majestic series that redefines the drama genre. A rare piece of excellence of these day's anime most capable candidate for Anime of The Year 2016.",

            "content": "Rakugo: an oral art form that hails from the Genroku period of the Edo Era.  A lone storyteller, introduced by the glimmering tones of a shamisen, appears on stage to mystify an audience of all kinds with a comical tale that usually heralds some sort of a moral message. The lone storyteller, equipped with nothing but a fan to assist in his gestures encapsulates his audience through changes in tone, gesture and behaviour in order to successfully manifest the characters the story is about. Through this, the rakugo-ka is able to draw his audience into a trance that is only broken when he endshis story with an elegant bow. \\n\\n\r\nSometime in the later Shouwa Era, a young man is released from prison with a goal to become a great rakugo-ka; his passion to pursue a profession deeply rooted in tradition is contrasted with the backdrop of a rapidly modernising Japan. The young man is apprenticed to a national treasure: the rakugo-ka Yuurakutei Yakumo, who strives to preserve the traditional essence of the oral art, despite the younger generation writing it off as being a stuffy piece of entertainment reserved for the elderly. With this, the story shifts perspective and tense, and becomes almost rakugo-like in nature as the aging Yakumo recounts his past to his apprentice.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here on, Shouwa Genroku Rakguo Shinjuu clearly establishes itself as a character-focused drama that takes its time to unfold the emotions, ambitions and thought-processes of the characters that inhabit the world of the series. Far from being a boring slice-of-life character-driven anime, that relies heavily on plot-devices to push the characters forward, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu manages to establish a compelling and evocative narrative, that respects its characters and settings, whilst naturally progressing the plot without the need for artificial plot-devices.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough languid, the pacing never crawls to a halt, as focused direction and tight writing removes unnecessary exposition that often prevents the progress of failed stories akin to this one. The story is approached with a deft hand that appreciates the fact that the story is told from perspective Yakumo\u2019s memory. Minor details are approached swiftly, whilst aspects of the story that carry deep emotional importance to Yakumo are emphasised and divulged into. This approach allows for a steady, well-balanced pacing that never lags nor feels too rushed. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are most definitely the strongest point of the series. The exploration of the characters\u2019 personalities, the presentation of their growth, and the dynamics that exist within the multiple relationships are all handled with great care. This allows the characters to be presented as human beings, rather than as props that exist in order to push forward the plot. \\n\\n\r\nRakugo is never treated as a simple backdrop for the story and is part of the characterisation itself. It is Rakugo that leads to the self-actualisation of both Yakumo/Kikuhiko and Sukeroku, although their mutual love for it sends them down two very different roads. The toils that they experience, and the way they are handled, are used as artistic inspiration to bring life to the stories that the two are telling. Their individual Rakugo is also used to characterise them: Sukeroku brings an boisterous and exuberant personality to his Rakugo, enlivening the audience, whilst the more reserved and introspective Kikuhiko draws the audience into his world - keeping them entranced until his stories are over. Although bittersweet, it is a delight to see the two develop as humans whilst refining their craft, and the series does an excellent job of portraying the of the passion and despairs that come with being an artist.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why the 5-15 minute segments of Rakugo, that exist in the series, are so vital. Much of what Kiku does is affected by the importance Rakugo has on his life, and in turn his actions affect the quality of his Rakugo. Through the extended scenes where we see Kiku (and Sukeroku) orate a story, we can tell where exactly and how they have grown because their Rakugo affect their characterisation. Especially in regards to Kiku, his sneaky and intricate performances seem to reflect a darker element of his soul. It takes great to skill to intertwine the art with the character and make it fundamental to their development, but Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu manages to accomplish that in an evocative manner that resonates with the audience.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, dynamics between characters are of utmost importance as well. Although the story is told from Kiku\u2019s perspective, and he is the main attraction of the show, not a single character of importance is neglected and left as a cardboard prop on the stage. Almost every single character is presented as being multi-dimensional with flaws, ambition and struggles that are explored both introspectively and in relation to Kiku himself. Not one character\u2019s struggle is written off as being trivial, but is instead treated with a sensitivity that evokes compassion from the audience, whilst, at the same time, affecting the characterisation and perception of the other characters. For example, the geisha Miyokichi acts the source of emotional development for Kiku as his romantic relationship with her is what leads him onto the road of mastery as he is able to use her for \u201cartistic reference\u201d. However, Miyokichi is more than just romantic fodder, as Kiku\u2019s success is intertwined with her downfall as she comes to the realisation that yet another man she has put her whole faith and love into is abandoning her because she has served her purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the story is also treated with tantamount respect. The audience sees Japan go from a country that is steeped in tradition, with yukatas and kimonos being frequently worn on the streets and rakugo theatres in high attendance, to the war bringing the era of tradition to a close. With the influence from the West came American forms of entertainment that proved more popular as society shifted from tradition to progression. Thus, as time goes by, audience numbers continue to dwindle for whilst Rakugo prides itself on being \u201csteeped in tradition\u201d, the audience see it as stagnant and lacking in progression. The setting lays a good foundation for the characterisation of our characters as Sukeroku\u2019s progressive ideas on Rakugo are contrasted with his Master\u2019s (and Kikuhiko\u2019s) orthodox approach to the art form. In addition, whilst society is shown as becoming more progressive - at least in regards to fashion and the arts - more conservative ideas are highlighted as juxtaposing the apparent \u201cmodernisation\u201d of Japan. Through focused direction and clever writing, the team behind Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu have managed to make the setting of the series a living and breathing thing that doesn\u2019t just act as a back-drop for our characters\u2019 stories, but also impacts on their lives. \\n\\n\r\nWhilst much of my praise for Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is directed at its realism and natural progression, there are times where elements of the story and characters\u2019 actions can feel staged. Rather than seeing that as a flaw in the series, it can be perceived as being a dramatic device used to highlight the unreliability of the narrator. Kiku is a storyteller, not just in name but in nature too therefore elements which may seem theatrical are most likely parts of the story that Kiku has inserted for his own convenience.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons Kiku recounts his past is in order to reveal the truth behind his late friend, Sukeroku\u2019s, death. The more \u201cscripted\u201d parts of the story suggest that an altered version of the truth is being told. I thought of addressing this matter because I have seen complaints about some scenes seeming staged with some characters acting too out of character to be believed; however, the existence of Kiku - a clearly unreliable narrator - suggests that the audience is being withheld the real truth. This provides an excellent, as well as compelling, set-up for the second series because although the \u201cflashback\u201d aspect of the story has been told their are threads that will carry on to the present until the real truth is revealed. Accomplishing such a feat without making the story seem incomplete takes real sense of focus when it comes to directing. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, it is understandable why some audience members may not feel invested in the scenes with heavy theatrics.\\n\\n\r\nThe final source of delight comes from the series\u2019 audiovisuals. Despite being very dialogue heavy, the art and animation is never compromised with some of the most power scenes being where emotions are silently conveyed in changes through changes in facial expression. The voice actors were also able to successfully portray their roles - with the voices behind Kikuhiko and Sukeroku managing to perform Rakugo whilst staying true to their characters\u2019 personalities, respectively. The blues and jazz soundtrack perfectly complemented the warm-toned palette, whilst highlighting the modernisation of Japan. Whilst the classical strings of the shamisen reminded us how deeply rooted in tradition Rakugo is. If one cannot admire the story Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu has to tell, they can still admire the audiovisual splendour of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst I can find no reason to say that the series was anything other than great, it is not for everyone as the conflict is internal with gradual build-up. It is story about its characters, not about any great mission that is common in most popular series. Lastly, this isn\u2019t a complete adaptation of the source material so there are evident loose ends (especially in the final episodes), but it all provides for an interesting set-up for the inevitable second series.\\n\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu lives up to the art form that it pays homage to. It manages to provide us with an intimate insight into the lives of two men who loved and lost for their art, whilst changing themselves and each other in process. Their\u2019s is a tale that will continue to resonate even when the rakugo-ka takes his final bow and the curtain is closed. As art forms continue to evolve, the remnants of those that existed before the new one\u2019s will continue to echo on.",

            "content": "It is no exaggeration to say this show is a masterpiece, a perfectly paced story with unbelievably realistic character development. A viewer need not be a diehard fan of historical shows or even rakugo to enjoy this one.\r\nAs one can infer from the title, this show is a tragedy, and that is made clear in the first episode. It's easy to pull off tragedy if you simply throw in a lot of death flags, but this show manages to tell a tragic story without using a single one. There is no \"incurable disease,\" or even \"star-crossed lovers.\" There's nothing wrong with using those types ofthemes, but if that's all there is to it, it's difficult to make any real emotional impact; death is obviously tragic, but there are more ways a person's story can be tragic than simply death. That is what Rakugo does extremely well: it is able to make you feel truly sorry for the characters, because sometimes tragedy is inevitable, but other times it could have been easily prevented. \\n\\n\r\nBut what does that really mean? Inevitable tragedy is a result of circumstances: the characters are unable to escape their doomed fate, but what characterizes preventable tragedy? The answer is personality. If only they had been more compassionate, more careful, more diligent, then maybe the situation would have been different. It is this type of story that really hits home, and that's what this show is about, a story of tragic personalities.\\n\\n\r\nTo say this show is a masterpiece then, is to say its characters are masterpieces, and they are. The main characters are exceedingly complex, for their motives are shrouded, their anger sometimes misplaced, their compassion ephemeral. Such is the relationship when two men who call each other brothers have clashing personalities, never seeming to fit with each other just right, and yet somehow always compromising. This show portrays this complexity brilliantly, using both symbolic cinematography and actual rakugo.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is truly excellent, and I urge everyone, regardless of whether they enjoy historical anime or not, to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review, and any feedback is appreciated!",

            "content": "Under the dimly-lit canvas of a rustic theatre, surrounded by the sounds of slowly-plucked shamisen, waits an audience for a performance of great tradition. Gradually, a  man wrapped in an dignified air approaches the center of the stage, sits elegantly on his knees, takes a slight bow to welcome his gazers, and proceeds. Thus begins a performance commonly known as Rakugo or the Japanese art of oral story-telling. Rakugo involves the storyteller to orate a comical account designated between two or more characters, generally playing all roles, distinguished only by slight nuances in behavior, tone, and gestures. \r\nRakugo has been a classical trait ofJapanese art and culture since the Genroku period (of the Edo era), but has dwindled in popularity and appreciation in more contemporary times. Though, grief can be spared because with this winter\u2019s wind came a show that revitalized this once-felt obscure art-form and turned it into the driving point of undoubtedly the season\u2019s best show, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu \u2013 a charming character-driven series with tightly-knit interactions and exploration, a marvelous setting, and a bond between subject and its characters that\u2019s entirely commendable. \\n\\n\r\nSet some time after WWII - during the rapidly changing social landscape of Japan - the series follows a freshly-released prisoner who desires to learn the ways of Rakugo and gets taken under the wing of a national master named Yuurakutei Yakumo. The story changes focus from the present tale of the apprentice to a narrative of the past, concerning the master and his deceased friend Sukeroku, along with the slowly-withering art of Rakugo. Now while the premise may seem a little daunting and even a bit boring; nothing is farther from the truth. Of course, the series is an entirely character-focused, unhurried drama, so this does imply a lack of flashy fights, gratuitous panty-shots, and overpowered heroes championing the world, but in its stead what it does offer is a compelling, evocative experience that really has a handle on its ambitions.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting, subject matter, and characters are integrated so atomically well that the entire ride is just consistently smooth. The pacing is well-balanced due to everything being finely focused and progressed with clear direction that it leaves no room for wasted effort or filler messes. The combination of these elements along with the tact and grace with which they are implemented, makes this show a worthy title. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, there\u2019s the setting. The show creates its foundation through a comparative/contrasting lens; a great structural move that tells the story, through story-telling \u2013 literally. It is absolutely marvelous to see just how well it is able to integrate its backdrop/setting into its forefront, just like a good theatrical performance would; giving it the feel of a truly refined work with each frame adding something to its overall quality. The setting is heightened by the show\u2019s ability to capture the atmosphere and sentiments of Japanese society at the time, especially in relation to both the character situations and their Rakugo. Even though very subtly depicted, the show bases its portrayal of Rakugo from the perspective of slow decay. After the wave of post-war reality hits, it causes a serious sense of disenfranchisement amongst the culture and people. This allows western senses and modernism to penetrate with a force much greater than it did in the past which augments the gradual but steady disintegration of various cultural arts; Rakugo being one of them. This backdrop plays to almost every nuance crafted whether it is the evolution of characters merely depicted by their change in attire (from traditional Japanese yukatas to fashionable western suits) or the erosion of public attendance in Rakugo houses relative to other more western venues. These subtleties may go unnoticed individually, but are definitely materialized when evaluated holistically and especially when examining characterization.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the impeccable setting, comes the strongest point of the series: characters. The character dynamics, exploration, and evolution are sublime. The entire series revolves around self-actualization in a way, through one\u2019s art, and everything else revolving around it. The two protagonists, the now-master-Yakumo-then-Bon-chan or \u201cKiku\u201d and his boisterous friend Sukeroku are a delight to watch, as they tumble through various struggles and events, trying to perfect their Rakugo while trying to find their reasons for doing so. Both characters are perfect complements of each other and really play off one another to add dimension to overall characterization, and each other. The artist\u2019s journey and the character\u2019s journey intertwine like a destined love affair, growing together through both pain and pleasure. \\n\\n\r\nThis is why characterization in this show can be looked at on two-fold: from the art, and the individual dynamics. The former really lays the foundation because it not only introduces the world of rakugo in context, but integrates in a manner which complements the \u201cact\u201d. The performances are not just intricate illustrations of the art form, but also essential in tracing the metamorphosis of the characters involved, specifically Kiku. Therefore, the way Rakugo is treated isn\u2019t necessarily just a detached device, but embedded in the heart and motivations of the characters, while also delivering with full force and depth the nature of Japanese story-telling, and the skill that it requires.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there\u2019s the stellar dynamics between the characters themselves. Even though Kiku is the star of the stage, almost every other character feels multi-dimensional, with their flaws, motivations, and importance properly conveyed and explored, individually, and in relation to the bigger picture. Almost every \u201cstruggle\u201d is important and is referenced in some form of development, whether it is for Kiku or the others, giving these characters a sense of realness, complexity, and palpability that isn\u2019t easy to accomplish. For example, alongside the two main characters is another side character named Miyokichi (Yurie) \u2013a geisha initially carrying the romantic tide of the series - who acts as sort of the fodder for the emotional evolution of both characters, while also adorning her own individuality as an important element of the show. Her role on paper is solely of a foil but she (and others) end up becoming actualized entities of their own; proving how well done the palette of characters are. \\n\\n\r\nThe strength of the characters produces a resounding effect for the overall series that helps give it a strong sense of focus, result, and even thematic resonance. The sheer admiration and dedication that is reflected from the characters exudes the essence of \u201cliving for the dream\u201d. Sacrifice, brotherhood, kinship, relationships, family, and most importantly, love, is so wonderfully crafted through the fibers of Rakugo and those in this story that weave it, ultimately into a beautiful tapestry. And love here doesn\u2019t necessarily denote romance, but the kind of love that drives one\u2019s passions forwards and gives meaning to lives. It is a love that transcends beyond description and can only be felt through creation, art, or in this case, Rakugo. And this work does an excellent job embodying and expressing that love.\\n\\n\r\nTo bring the series its final touches of splendor is the animation and sound. The animation flows smoothly, with soft, bright colors that play to the vibrant tone of the show. Backgrounds are very nicely done as they bring out the juxtapositioned nature of the setting. The old but stifling feel of fading tradition is  contrasted with lively modernized elements that consistently coalesce and enhance the narrative. Furthermore, the music is oddly fitting as it combines instances of jazz or blues against the classic tunes of Japanese strings and compositions. Surprisingly, never once does any of this clash inappropriately, rather works in tandem to heighten the atmosphere, mood, and give full depth to the setting that contains it all. \\n\\n\r\nReally, there is no detractor in this show that innately brings it value down. Of course, this series won\u2019t appeal to everyone as it is very focused on the internal dynamics of its characters and the external passions that define them. Many of the episodes have 10-12 minutes of just Rakugo performances which could be burdensome to few, but as mentioned before, the performances are essential for they aren\u2019t just superfluous additions but character-defining points. Lastly, since it isn\u2019t a complete adaptation, there are loose ends to be had, and deliberately, but none of those take away from the narrative that is actually presented.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, this story is one worth telling, and even more so, worth listening to.\\n\\n\r\nNow, art forms come and go, evolve and dissolve, and keep humanity breathing with their own life force. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu shows the intricacies of that process through the lives of two men who through their art, change themselves and each other. They are a reminder of the eternality of art (even if the world changes) and those who create it (regardless of history that burns and rises). So even when the shamisen stops playing, and the dimly-lit theatre stands alone, we can still hear the stories of Sukeroku and Kiku, and Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is proud to do us that favor. \\n",

            "content": "Shouwa Rakugo is a story about life. It is a story about the art of Rakugo, of Japan's history during the Shouwa era, of friendship and family, and of sacrificing everything to reach one's potential, but particularly it is a story about life\u2014 the lives of two talented, troubled and yet ordinary men. \r\nShouwa Rakugo may only be thirteen episodes long, but it covers a period of years and decades, a turbulent series of ups and downs, much as life is itself. It depicts the rise, fall and redemption of Yakumo and Sukeroku, and many of those around them. The tearful reunion as Sukeroku returnsfrom the war in Manchuria is powerful\u2014 powerful enough that I also felt myself choking up a bit\u2014 and yet it occurs just a few short episodes into the story. \\n\\n\r\nThis is due in part to the excellent characterisation of the two and their (oftentimes strained) friendship, but it is also a result of the story's nimble pacing. One might expect an anime covering such a large span of time in so few episodes to end up feeling rushed, but this is not the case. Shouwa Rakugo makes a careful balance between the smaller and the more important events in the characters' lives. It will transition from a hospital scene to a funeral within seconds, and yet it will feel entirely natural, as if no time has actually passed. Many times I found these transitions to hold more punch than the scenes themselves. If stories like Touch and Sakura no Uta have taught me anything, it is that a quick jump to the future can carry far more emotional weight than the events preceding it. \\n\\n\r\nIt can be hard to put into words what makes Shouwa Rakugo so special, as so much of its appeal is in what it leaves unsaid. It finds greater comfort in showing its story rather than telling it. The feelings of the characters\u2014 their frustrations, their struggles\u2014 are often left implied and seldom stated outright. A character will walk along at dusk, mumbling to themselves a rakugo scene depicting the difficulties of departing from one's lover, and it will be very clear what is going on in their mind. It takes a very special anime to pull something like that off, to develop the characters such that the audience can empathize with them without dialogue or gestures. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is primarily set during the post-war period in Japan, but it thankfully does not waste time lecturing the audience about the war's effects on Japan, how Japan fought the good fight and lost, and everything we have already heard countless times before in other anime. What Shouwa Rakugo does convey about the war, it conveys through the absence of dialogue: nobody ever says \"I'm sorry\" when they listen to another person's story, because they've all been there before. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the first two episodes, it becomes very clear which direction the story is headed in and how it will end. Every major event is foreshadowed in some way, from the dialogue (\"The next time I meet you it will be in hell\") all the way to the very title of the series (\u5fc3\u4e2d). This effectively eliminates any sense of shock that the viewer might experience, but knowing what is ahead does not make the moments and the journey any less heart-wrenching. It actually makes it hurt more. \\n\\n\r\nShouwa Rakugo deserves special mention for depicting sexual, adult relationships. The heroine is not a cute, bubbly high school girl, but a geisha who makes her living by flirting with men. She is in many ways a despicable human being, and that is just fine. People often do not pick the most respectable or desirable person to be with; they come together and couple for a myriad of reasons, even if it may in the end be to their own harm. \\n\\n\r\nEven if you have no knowledge of what rakugo is\u2014 and I suspect this is the case for most people, as it was for myself\u2014 Shouwa Rakugo makes it very easy to follow by animating a wide variety of rakugo performances, rather than bombard the viewer with explanations and unfamiliar terminology. While rakugo might not be especially entertaining to the world of 2016, through watching the many performances within Shouwa Rakugo it is easy to gain an appreciation for the talent and effort that is often poured into the art. The styles of Yakumi's and Sukeroku's rakugo are so different from one another that it almost feels as though they are performing completely different forms of art, despite rakugo very much being an art defined by tradition.\\n\\n\r\nThe lengthy, 10-minute Rakugo performance in the first episode\u2014 one of many amazing moments in the show\u2014 reminded me of the ending sequence in Whiplash (one of the best films I have seen), it feeling itself like a musical performance, starting slow and clumsy and gradually building into a thunderous crescendo by the end, Yotarou's sweat visibly running down his face all the while. While he may not be beating his instrument to the point of blood flying across the stage, rakugo is an inherently quieter, more subtle form of performance than concert, requiring nothing more than a person sitting and telling a story in front of a small audience, and so bloody theatrics are not necessary. Its performances are already plenty exciting. \\n\\n\r\nAt times joyful, and ever more so devastating, Shouwa Rakugo is a truly sincere and human story. It speaks a simple, raw tale of flawed existence. It does not fluff itself with philosophy, symbolism and other obscure subject matter. It speaks to the individual: it wants you to listen, and it wants you to consider the moments in life where you truly felt beating, breathing and alive. It is in that short moment that it has meaning.",

            "content": "When I sat down to write this review I had a hard time condensing my feelings towards it into written format. This wasn't to say the story was complex; on the contrary, it was rather straightforward on paper. But when I tried to articulate my thoughts to virtual ink, nothing came to fruition. Then after I sat back and let everything that had transpired sink in, it just hit me, a simple word, yet one that was able to properly express the feelings that I had wadded up inside for this title. Simply put, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was poetic. \r\nFrom the way it delicatelycrafted its narrative, to the organic transition in which its characters found their placement in it, everything Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu did flowed like a poetic stream of unfiltered consciousness. This anime exuded an aura of refinement and class that you don't come across often. It's a caliber quite deserving of the praise directed at it. In place of the spastic eccentricity and bubblegum characters commonly found in the world of anime, we're given a tranquil environment and genuine human emotion. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is a title that unveils a compelling story about flawed characters and their pursuit for true acceptance. If I could get just one other person to experience and spread the word of this gem, then my writing this was more than worth it.\\n\\n\r\nDelving into the world of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, or Shouwa, as I'll refer to it going forward, we're introduced to Yotarou, a dimwitted bushy-tailed man who's fresh out of prison. Having a deep yearning to practice and perform Rakugo, a Japanese form of verbal entertainment that's essentially stage storytelling, he seeks out an apprenticeship under the guidance of Yakumo Yuurakutei, a man well renowned for his performing prowess in the field of Rakugo.\\n\r\nDespite what this initial premise would have you believe, the story isn't about Yotarou's journey under apprenticeship; in actuality, it chronicles his master Yotarou's life, along with his friend Sukeroku, as it showed how they dealt with the demanding requirements of the Rakugo industry, as well as the growing pressures that come with adulthood. \\n\\n\r\nTaking us back to his childhood, Yakumo \"Kikuhiko\" Yuurakutei places us at a time just before the boys met. And from then on the story blossoms on its own before coming to an inevitable stop due to an incident that's discussed during the initial episodes. While both boys found themselves in the world of Rakugo under similar circumstances, their relationship with the performing art itself differed vastly. Their relationship dynamic has been seen before: the polar opposites who don't see eye to eye. Yakumo's ying to Sukeroku's yang. The fundamentals of the story itself aren't what are impressive, but rather the manner in which it goes about executing it.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of simply following the standardized method established for this kind of narrative, we're instead thrust into a more introspective realm, with Yakumo's reminiscing in the form of a Rakugo itself. It's essentially a story within a story, which, on paper, sounds like a muddled mess, but oddly enough felt like the most organic method of absorbing the characters and viewer into the head-space of the tale. The Rakugo art form isn't only exemplified, but it's also utilized on a grand scale to encompass everything surrounding it. It's a form of immersion rarely experienced, basically the Inception of anime storytelling (And here we are, a review about a story, about a story, that contains stories... let's just leave that mindfuck alone). \\n\\n\r\nEverything that shapes the life of the zen-like Yakumo that we met in the first episode, to the reserved boy we meet in the past, all revolves around the influence of Rakugo, both on and off stage. We're given a detailed insight as to how this traditional Japanese storytelling works, as well as the lasting impact it left on the two boys that grew up to master it. \\n\\n\r\nWhat made this anime so engaging was in the way it went about layering these characters. Nothing is ever explicitly stated outright. Everything from the small mannerisms they display, to the introspective moments that draw no attention to themselves, as well as the way in which they interacted with each other, all helps to add layers to the characters on screen. It's \"show don't tell\" at its finest. And as their upbringing and personality shape the type of Rakugo they performed, it also shaped what kind of person they ultimately became. In a way, it could be said that an individual's style of Rakugo indirectly reveals the kind of person they secretly are. It's a window into their soul; as saccharine as that statement may sound, there's no better way to describe it. \\n\r\nWith Sukeroku, what was outwardly presented in his performances was the common tongue of the people. With a brash and often schmaltzy performance, he didn't care for the social constructs that the world of Rakugo wanted to build. He did it to make the people happy. And just like his style would outwardly portray, his Rakugo revealed what was truly lying dormant within him. \\n\r\nThe same also applied to Yakumo, a man who always tried upholding himself to a high standard, following the guideline of Rakugo to the letter. He too was exposed by his style of Rakugo. Rakugo provided the duality that neither would dare reveal out in the open. Like I said, it's simply poetry, a dance between what is shown and what is truly meant to be seen, or rather what is meant to be uncovered. \\n\r\nThese characters are deeply flawed but made all the more realistic because of that. They're selfish, pigheaded, condescending, but also broken, affectionate and just looking for a place they belong. There's no antagonist here, just entangled personalities trying to find their way. \\n\\n\r\nOutside of the two male characters, another character worth mentioning was Yurie, who is without question the biggest catalyst who drives the actions taken by the two male leads involved during the show's more personal moments. She's a character whose environment and past experiences did far more than mold her; they broke her. Like the others involved in the story, she masquerades herself as someone who's in control. And it's her need for co-dependence that creates a rift that ripples throughout all crucial events in the story.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing that her involvement is integral to many of the major events throughout the narrative, I won't say anything more about her involvement. Just know that without her, many of Shouwa's more poignant moments wouldn't have exfoliated into the scenes that we were gifted with. \\n\\n\r\nLike the art of performing Rakugo itself, the story also manages to perform and balance a vast array of tonal shifts throughout the narrative without feeling forcefully steered in directions. This, as a result, allowed for comedic scenes to transition seamlessly into sobering reveals without causing any tonal whiplashes. And in a story that revolves around the delicate balance between stage performances and real life drama, that balance was greatly needed. \\n\\n\r\nThe project was handled by studio Deen, which by anyone's account, is a scary thing, given their track record, but with Shouwa they actually stepped their game up. The movements and gestures of the characters showed great range and fluidity, which is a vital thing for a show that's revolved around the mannerisms of stage performers. No noticeable shortcuts were taken, and the finished product looked quite pleasing. The opening and ending themes were excellent, with the intro song \"Usurai Shinjuu \" by Megumi Hayashibara, carrying a sort of sultry/smoky jazz appeal to it. The ending theme also held up on its side with a soothing soft trumpet piece that gently set things off on a tranquil note. \\n\\n\r\nIn many ways Shouwa acts out like a Shakespearean play, in that regardless of time period or societal upbringing, the messages it explores are primal and very much a part of what it means to be human, may that be the yearning for love and acceptance, malice born from envious desires, choosing to follow gut instinct instead of rationality or just forming bonds with others for mutual benefit. Shouwa unveil these layers of human pathos in a way that invokes authentic sentiments. This anime sets a benchmark that many would have a hard time following.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show was easily the most engrossing seasonal title I've watched from the 2015/16 lineup so far. It left an impression that so few have and had some of the most realistic anime characters I've seen in recent memory. This easily became a new favorite of mine. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIf there were ever a dark horse for the 2016 Winter season, this title is it. Sadly overlooked by many, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is a show that quickly ushered you out of the cold and into the warm embrace of its heartfelt narrative. The more time you spend with these characters, the harder it became to say farewell. This might not be for everyone, given the slower pacing and absence of anime tropes associated with the medium, but for those who want something more than the usual offerings expected, I cannot suggest this enough. It's truly a work of art.",

            "content": "It is truly fascinating of what people are capable of doing to survive in society, especially when you are basically abandoned by your relatives. A young boy who once aspired to be a dancer has no choice but to learn the art of Rakugo, a form of Japanese verbal entertainment in which the storyteller sits on stage while performing a complicated comedical story. Audiences may have had the impression that it solely focuses on the profession, yet this is not the case. At first it seems that it simply served as means of survival, but it becomes apparent that the journey throughout his life wasmore than just Rakugo: it is a tale of a flourishing and wonderful friendship, conflict and realization of oneself.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, or \"Showa and Genroku Era Lover's Suicide Through Rakugo\" in its english title, is focused around Rakugo and with that, the characters and their interactions. Instead of consisting of a simple story about the ascension of two performers, which it is to a degree, it is a character driven story that ties the lives of the various individuals implicated: Yakumo, Sukeroku and Yurie. The profession is merely used as means to develop and unfold the storyline, whilst portraying the art of Rakugo itself. It must be mentioned that the synopsis of the anime is as a matter of fact a bit misleading; it is focused upon the afore-mentioned trio, albeit showcasing Yotaro's interactions with his master. This however will probably developed in the second season. Another aspect that is prevalent in the anime is drama: it was depicted in a subtle manner, without exaggerating it, making it much easier to digest and enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of this work is splendidly done, and very befitting, although it may seem at first sluggish and uninteresting to some. However, it becomes apparent that it is actually a necessary buildup to portray the characters relationship in a very satisfying manner. It is a journey that spans from their childhood to their puberty, culminating in their adulthood. It is a narrative ridden with little details, such as portraying subtly the daily interactions between the protagonists and the cast, or its setting, the 70's and 80's of Japan. Naturally, Rakugo is depicted as well in a satisfactory way: it shows viewers the difficulties of the profession, besides of the great stories contained within: it is simply delightful to listen to. In addition, it quickly becomes clear that world the protagonists live in is strongly favoured by those with status, rather than cunning. This reflects the society of that time rather well with the outdated mentality. Naturally, audiences may find the performing parts tedious, yet these are arguably rather amusing.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Shouwa is rather small, consisting of a handful of characters, yet it is certainly sufficient to portray the whole scope of this tale. As mentioned earlier, Shouwa is a very character driven story, and it excels in this department greatly. because of the gradual buildup that spans various decades, the characters were slowly fleshed out and developed accordingly to the changes these experienced - this was done through subtle interactions with their peers. The two main protagonists are Yakumo and Sukeroku, who have quite diverse personalities, which enhances the narrative. By the end of the show, audiences may have a total different view of some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nYakumo could be described a silent, cunning and self-containing character, yet from the inside insecure and delicate: it is marvelous to see his character develop through the various stages of his life, which includes the realization of himself. On the other side there is Sukeroku, a very charming and enthusiastic man, with a great talent and love for Rakugo, with no relatives. Character development and fleshing out of him is no exception either. The relationship between these two is very well-developed and presented to audiences, it is truly a tale of friendship. \\n\\n\r\nAnother crucial character in the anime is Yurie: she is the gear that triggers the wavering interactions between the cast and the main protagonists - in fact, romance is another theme that is present in the anime. As character she may seem rather underdeveloped, yet through various scenes and interactions with her peers, it quickly becomes clear that she is not as shallow as she appears to be. Her life, profession and unrequited love are thing that drove this character forth. The romance can be rather lacking, as it came pretty abruptly and was not really well-developed, alongside the reason on why she fell in love. However, love is not often a rational reaction, so it may be excused in a manner; regardless, some more expansion on it could have been welcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe studio behind Shouwa is DEEN, and the animation quality was well done, with very fluid motions. The character's movements when showcasing the performances were subtle and very detailed presented, conveying the art of Rakugo and how these are crucial for a good play. Facial expressions, sweat and similar traits managed to portray the various states of the cast. As for the art style itself, it has a slightly different take than the usual character designs which was enticing; the backgrounds were detailed, despite being composed mainly of internal locations. In some cases some inconsistencies could be found in the background characters, but this was negligible.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the soundtrack of Shouwa it was befitting, albeit a bit startling at first with various jazz tunes, as it didn't seem to fit the narrative: nevertheless, it quickly becomes apparent that this used to its advantage to upheave the pacing and importance of each scene when required. Piano or violin compositions are used as well, depending on the atmosphere. The voice actors did a splendid job, the various personalities matching with the characters, as well as wonderfully portraying the different intonations required for the various situations, be it the emotional states or the Rakugo performances itself. As for the opening and endings, these consisted of jazz, and blues, while having a great representation of what Rakugo is.\\n\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was overall a fantastic anime with a great story and characters, enhanced their interactions and the Rakugo. I was very surprised by the lack of attention this anime got - or rather, it is criminal. I throughly enjoyed this anime, in addition to the plays presented, which were quite intriguing at a personal level. Naturally, this may have been the main factor that have had viewers discontinue the anime, as it can be boring. Regardless, this is a necessary buildup for a great conclusion of the series. I want to mention the fact that viewers who expected a story focused on the difficulties after being jailed, will be let down, as this was not the case; however, audiences are rewarded with a great narrative. Moreover, a second season was announced which in turn may delve into said subject. I highly recommend people who like drama, or character driven stories to try this piece out.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "If you have ever watched stand up comedy or listened to NPR ( This American Life, Fresh Air with Terry Gross, A Prairie Home Companion from Lake Wobegone), you should check this anime out. If not, it's slow, mediocre, and overrated. The reason why it's rated so high is that it's one of those \" at least it doesn't take place in high school\" anime shows. \r\nBottom line, no pretentiousness, it's a struggling artist story: empty apartment, messy roommate, getting gigs, argue with your roommate. But, it's in anime format and the art is called \"Rakugo\" which is Japanese talking entertainment. Since you don't speakJapanese, the Rakugo scenes are literally just reading a 3 paragraph short story while a Japanese anime character flexes their voice up and down.\\n\\n\r\nArt: There is a lot of period style architecture, but it all looks the same making it boring. One room would look like the next room and it's hard to get a sense of where the characters are. The show needs more B-footage to show transition from \"golden times\" to \"desperate times.\" I can't pick up they got evicted and now live in a crappy apartment if both rooms look the same. I can't tell if the gig is at a dump or at a theater if the dump and theater look the same with the same number of people. World War 2 happens and you barely even notice it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I don't know how to judge the sound. The anime felt like reading a book. You could put stick figures and dialogue and it would still be the exact same story. \\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters: The Rakugo is the best part. They are short, entertaining, and to the point satisfying action fanboys like me with the attention span of a goldfish. But, the characters are essentially drama Mary Sues. For example, one of them is a drunkard, but he still loves his life and is happy go lucky. The show approaches alcoholism with a  \"aw shucks\" stop spending money on alcohol rather than a punch a wall, bleed out, vomit on the floor, and cry in a dumpster. Lost potential.  The other main character is an artist who stumbles at first and becomes a master with practice. The end. More lost potential. No drugs. No selling your soul to a record company. No backstabbing your childhood friend. Nobody wants to watch \" I struggled, practiced diligently, stayed clean, and became a successful artist with little stress.\" In America, so many people drop everything to pursue their art and there are so many amazing stories. In Japan, the majority pursue legitimate professions, so I guess Rakugo is so bohemian. Again, the characters are too perfect. Justin Beiber is a more interesting story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I actually like Rakugo. But I wouldn't be true to myself saying saying it's the best thing ever or even mediocre. It reminded me of David Sedaris' Santaland stories, reading short stories in the New Yorker, and how the 50s cultural revolution in America kicked ass. But that's all it did.  I have no intention of re-watching this. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview: \r\nSh\u014dwa Genroku Rakugo Shinj\u016b is the first Josei demographic anime I\u2019ve reviewed on this site. It was getting such rave reviews though that I decided to give it a try. This is a rather unique anime and certainly worth watching if you haven\u2019t seen it yet!\r\nBackground:\r\nSo what on Earth is Rakugo? Rakugo is a traditional Japanese form of storytelling that is sort of like a combination between a 1 man play, standup comedy, and beat poetry. Rakugo can trace back at least as far as the 1200s AD in written form and perhaps as early as 900AD in oral form. The period of Rakugothat this story covers is right in the title, the Showa era. The Showa era was the reign of Emperor Hirohito from 1926 to 1989. Specifically, most of the story takes place before, during, and just after WW2.\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with a petty convict named Yotaro being released from prison. Yotaro was able to survive and reform in prison due in part to the amazing stories and performances of his favorite Rakugo actor who went by the name Yakumo the 8th. Once released, Yotaro decided to find the elderly Rakugo master and beg to become his apprentice. It turns out that Yakumo, whose actual name is Bon, really isn\u2019t a social person and had no interest in new apprentices. However, Yotaro\u2019s youthful energy and enthusiasm reminds Bon of an old friend and Bon finally begins to warm up to him. The majority of the story takes place in a flashback showing the lives of Bon and his childhood friend Shin, who eventually takes the title Sukeroku the 2nd. Bon and Shin are quickly shown to be polar opposites, but nevertheless forge a strong friendship. Bon is an introverted traditionalist while Shin is a wildly energetic extrovert who wishes to take the art of Rakugo in new directions. However, Shin\u2019s unorthodox style causes friction with the deeply conservative Rakugo guild. In order for Rakugo performers to get the best venues and good audiences, they need to suck up to the guild and get their approval. The guild will blacklist any bar or performance hall that allows a performer they don\u2019t approve of. This tension between traditionalists and the need for art to expand into new territory is one of the key conflicts of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to repeat the whole plot and spoil this series, so just trust me that the human relations, psychological drama, romance, and tension are all very well executed. This series doesn\u2019t rely on any cheap tricks like shock factor or fanservice. It doesn\u2019t suddenly pull a tragic death out of nowhere to cheaply jerk some tears. The only major deaths are forecast from a mile away and STILL manage to hit your feels like a truck! The concept of old vs. young, tradition vs. new ideas, constantly clashing and causing tension is always effective in storytelling because it applies to any age and society. It was effective in Turgenev\u2019s novel Fathers and Sons for 1860s Russia, it applies to 1950s Japan, and it would apply to 2016 America. This series should also be praised for its complex and realistic characters. You the viewer get to feel like you know these characters and watching them interact is always a pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Soundtrack:\\n\\n\r\nThe art by studio Deen of Higurashi fame and is pretty top notch. It also helps that this is a low action series, so not much is moving at any one time. This allows the artists to really focus on character art and backgrounds. The background music is often beautiful and the opening and closings are as strong as you could ask for in an anime that doesn\u2019t have a massive budget. I have nothing to complain about here, so moving on!\\n\\n\r\nFlaws if any:\\n\\n\r\nTo a Japanese audience this series is pretty flawless. Maybe it could be accused of being a tad slow for some, but that isn\u2019t really an issue. What IS an issue for non-Japanese speakers is that roughly half the runtime of this series is listening to beat poetry that you won\u2019t properly understand or appreciate. All of the subtle wordplay, puns, and nuance is completely lost in translation. The character drama and themes are wonderful when they are onscreen, but the Rakugo sections (which are PLENTIFUL) will quickly have you scrambling for the fast forward on your remote!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis is a strong drama series that is one of the few \u201cmust watch\u201d series of 2016 despite the fact the lengthy Rakugo recitals will likely scare away all but the most hardened of art film snobs.\\n\\n\r\nReflection on the state of the anime industry and community:\\n\\n\r\nJust as Rakugo needed to adapt or face irrelevancy in the 1950s, the anime industry is in a tough spot right now. Sales are down, audiences are shrinking and dissatisfied, and studios are conservatively leaning on clich\u00e9d fighting Shonen and echii to carry the industry. However, the anime industry would also be in danger if they largely conceded to the will of a small but vocal group of online elitists. Believe it or not the casual/n00b bashing, condescending, elitist pricks can destroy a fandom as easily as stagnation.  If anime studios simply churned out series like Shouwa Rakugo, the small number of elitists online would be happy, but the anime industry would be doomed to financial collapse. You can enjoy unusual gems like Shouwa Rakugo, but please don\u2019t try shove series like this down the throat of your casual buddies. You aren\u2019t helping the \u201cunwashed masses\u201d develop culture, you are strangling the anime fan community to death! We the anime fans need to champion series like Berserk that can appeal to not only both elitists and casuals alike, but bring in new fans as well. I don\u2019t want to be like Thatanimesnob or Digibro and try push series like Shouwa Rakugo as the \u201csaviors of anime\u201d. This is a great series for some, but I would feel irresponsible if I hyped this series without warning it isn\u2019t for everyone.\\n",

            "content": "*Despite both the title, and the first episode spoiling the show in heavy detail, there is so much here to unwind, that I cannot bear not giving you the classic SPOILER warning. Please, watch the show if you haven't; I implore you to do so. For those who have (or those who don't care about spoilers), let's move on*\r\nArt is a powerful thing. It has the ability to captivate an audience, entrance them in a new idea they never thought of, enamor them into a sight that marvels them. There are so many types of art: paintings, drawings, stories, videos, games, and even music. Allof these things can enamor us now, but back before even the late 20th century, we didn't have videos or games (aside from maybe betting games and sports). Nowadays, not only do we have all of these things, but we can literally combine all of these. Animation is the ultimate tool for doing so, with the only thing surpassing it being interactive visual novels that can actually be played in the sense of more than just a story we control: like say, a fighting game with a visual novel story (like Blazblue). Nonetheless, we're getting horrendously off track. Earlier, I mentioned stories. There are so many kinds of stories to tell, especially in anime...\\n\\n\r\nYou can tell an epically expansive and complex narrative like Legend of the Galactic Heroes. You can tell a charismatic, absurd, and dramatic thrill ride with twists and turns around every corner, like Code Geass. You can tell an exciting and inspirational story to get our blood pumping, like Gurren Lagann. You can create a work that heavily celebrates a franchise, like Carnival Phantasm. You can tell a grippingly dark and tragic tale to remind the audience that not all good stories have to have happy endings, like Fate/Zero and its second season. You can tell a charming and lovable story mixing many ideas you'd never have seen working, like Macross. You can even tell a down to Earth, realistic story that celebrates a concept we love, like Shirobako. Or, you can be like today's anime, Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, and tell a charming, gripping, down to Earth, and realistic story that celebrates the concept of art -a concept we love- that happens to be a dramatic and sort-of inspirational thrill-ride that has a complex narrative (well, more so than many of us think). It's the best of all worlds, really. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 shows us a reformed criminal (Yotarou, his new stage name) inspired by Rakugo so much that he tries to find the master who showed it to him, with hopes that maybe said master will take him in. We follow his escapades of being introduced into the world of Rakugo at its truest, while being fed crucial information about the residents (namely, a girl named Konatsu, who hates the old man) and their lives so that Yotarou doesn't accidentally strike a horrible nerve. His former boss shows up and tries to encourage him to take up crime again, but to no avail, especially after seeing Yotarou's performance, After almost being expelled (well, more like he was expelled and reinstated), the master tells him and Konatsu about his past which led to where we are today, in a realistic and down to Earth story that unfolds as he narrates. Hell, we get to spend the rest of the series joining the fun. \\n\\n\r\nThe old man, who is now the 8th generation Yakumo, was originally known as Bon (so, for the duration of the review, I will address him as such). After a fateful meeting with Shinn (soon to be known as Sukeroku, and I will call him as such for now), they get taken up by the 7th generation Yakumo during boyhood, and we follow the dramatic and eventually tragic tale of these two men and their journey through their Rakugo careers. Bon had to say goodbye to a girl he was dating, and Sukeroku started drinking. Their careers have shown them to have notably different styles, and while Sukeroku has his perfected, Bon still doesn't know how to take advantage of his. Soon, Sukeroku and 7th Yakumo are forced to leave for the army; World War II has started.\\n\\n\r\nHe, his master's house attendant, Matsuda, and the master's wife, are forced to wait patiently, without much hope. Soon, he meets a beautiful (and I mean BEAUTIFUL) girl named Miyokichi, and it seems like things are going smoothly again. Then, the two men arrive back, and now both Bon's and Sukeroku's careers can truly take off. Inspired by how much of a \"tightwad\" Bon is, Sukeroku's latest Rakugo piece is a story about a tightwad's dream. There is soon tension not only between the two boys, or even between them (especially Sukeroku) and the Rakugo Association, but between Bon and Miyokichi. The middle of the series is about how all of these tensions truly spiral out of control, causing Sukeroku to be expelled after being denied the rank of Shin'uchi, Bon to break up with Miyokichi, and the two boys to make one last promise and then split up on unhappy final terms (part of those terms being Sukeroku and Miyokichi leaving together); it's a dramatic turn for everyone's lives. \\n\\n\r\nSoon, after the 7th Generation Yakumo has a heart attack, he reveals an underlying reason why he would never pass down the Yakumo name to Sukeroku: he was the second generation of the Sukeroku who was his rival back in his youth. Dying with that one regret, Bon is forced to take up the name Yakumo. His friend, Matsuda, soon loses his wife, and Bon goes to find Sukeroku, only to discover that Sukeroku has a child named Konatsu (Are those signals flaring yet?). He soon reunites with Sukeroku only to discover that he has lost his drive for Rakugo thanks to his wife Miyokichi, who has recently ditched him and their child, probably out of resentment for their love of Rakugo and Sukeroku's refusal to move on to a new career. After some time, they prepare one big Rakugo performance (which happens to be rather inspirational to Sukeroku despite him being the one to perform it) despite Rakugo heavily declining in popularity after the war. Hell, news of this got Miyokichi to show up, now that Yakumo has cone back.\\n\\n\r\nIn a truly tragic and impeccably told scene, Sukeroku and Miyokichi hang off a cliff after some heartfelt words by all of them spiral into their emotional climaxes, with Bon trying desperately to save them. Knowing that Bon will only die with them if he tries to save them, he falls with his wife, resulting in Shinjuu, meaning lovers' double suicide. Now, Konatsu is all alone, thinking that Bon is responsible for all of this...and he kind of is; he knows it to be true. After all, he let Miyokichi's parasitic desire for love spiral out of control when he chose his career over her, and he couldn't stop his friend from leaving with her, and he sure as hell wasn't capable of saving them after everything. Still, it's not all his fault, especially since it was Miyokichi that caused all of this to happen, especially with what happened to her and Sukeroku in the end. Bon was the one that caused her to really go haywire, but she basically took care of the rest, resulting in this tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nWe head back to the present, or rather, a few years after we last know the present. Yotarou has become a shin'uchi, Bon continues his life as the 8th Yakumo, Konatsu is now a single soon-to-be mother (with Yotarou volunteering to become the husband to take care of the child), and we are treated to Bon visiting Sukeroku's grave, in which the ghost appears in front of him, as if to tell him something. Yotarou goes to him and requests to take up the name of Sukeroku, and now he and we get what that ghost scene meant. Thus, the story ends for now, with Yotarou closing us out and teasing us about an eventual season 2.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is impressively written, without any leaps in logic or holes, and with one impressive prequel narrative. On its own, it would be a 9 for being great but not reaching extraordinary high. Then, we take the Rakugo stories into account. With one exception, every single Rakugo performance that is played from beginning to end has some meaning to the character that performs them, and most of them have pretty heavy meanings. When Yakumo played the story of the bumbling crook, that really represents him (in which his former boss points out to Bon). When  Bon plays the story about Shinjuu, it ends up happening to his friend (Sukeroku) and his former lover (Miyokichi), which he is deeply affected by. When Sukeroku plays the one about the fisherman and the girl, it probably is due to him constantly talking about girls (along with booze) and bringing them over in the earlier parts of the series. Finally, I'm not sure what the Shinigami one means to Bon (who performs it several times), but season 2 looks like it's gonna reveal that to us, especially after this season hyped it up. When we see any of these 3 major Rakugo performers get to play their work from beginning to end, it always has some meaning in their lives, whether they be then or in the future, making things a lot more complex than many of us may have realized. They are surprisingly funny, making this art-form much more charming and charismatic than we anticipated before seeing those performances.\\n\\n\r\nThere is an impressively strong cast of characters in this amazing show, some of whom are almost as realistic as the characters in Macross Plus, which sports easily the most realistic anime characters of all time. Side characters like Matsuda and Yuurakutei are still great additions to the main few with their hinted-at personal lives and fun personalities, and Konatsu has quite a lot of understandable personal baggage given what happened to her parents, that you can understand why she can be a total emotional ass. Yotarou is a funny yet truly dimwitted decoy protagonist (who'll get his time to shine in season 2) who acts very similar to Sukeroku. Well, with these guys out of the way, onto the tragic trio this season of Rakugo centers around.\\n\\n\r\nYakumo is rather stingy and cold, conflicted about his feelings towards Miyokichi and his career, who loses everyone he cared about (except Matsuda). He is the centerpiece of this tragedy, and at least some of the unfortunate things that unfold were due to either his mistakes or his inability to calm an impossibly bad situation. Despite being pretty cold and assholish -often to great comedic effect- his struggles are definitely real: trying to find your own true form of expressing your passion and trying to balance your career with your social life and relationships. He, while passionate about it, mainly does it for ends meat (convenient given that he overall loves this medium). When the tragedy hits in episode 12, it hits him especially hard and we can easily sympathize with him for what he failed to prevent. Thus, he lives on for a career that he has long since lost the true drive for.\\n\\n\r\nSukeroku is a man-child; he is a free-spirited, irresponsible, slob-like, drunken, and actually arrogant individual who only truly cares about his passion for Rakugo and how he entertains the people with it, Bon, and eventually Miyokichi and their child, Konatsu. He often gets drunk and talks about girls. He complains at the demand for him to be responsible, more than I do. His success in Rakugo makes him too cocky and ambitious, with the latter causing chagrin amongst the higher-ups, and the latter proving to be his downfall in episode 9. Still, his mindset is what I agree with personally: art should be for the people; art should be there to enrich the people's day and enthrall them, making them appreciate and enjoy your work. Sucks that he has to die without being reconciled with the Rakugo Association, for his Rakugo was entertaining as hell. \\n\\n\r\nMiyokichi is quite a broken character. Forced into prostitution just to make ends meet after her family died, she has been burned by relationships with men so many times that she somehow grew dependent on a proper and loving relationship with a man, to a parasitic degree. This lovely lady had to struggle with the fact that Bon grew more detached with her, and after he cut the relationship off, she not only started hanging with his best friend (because that is clearly a good idea in real life) but grew to love him out of desperation. Her resentment for Rakugo broke her new family apart and is the crux of why she and Sukeroku died. Shame, really. I'd love to have seen everyone's story in even further detail.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're at all familiar with Studio DEEN's track record over the past 11 years, you know how dicey their art quality is and how hit-or-miss their adaptations can be, especially concerning their work on Fate/Stay Night and Unlimited Blade Works.  While they also worked on Konosuba during the season this show came out, this show looks so much better on account of overall polish, character designs, and attention to detail. The little things like those bells with tags on them, really add this amazing touch to the world, and the character designs are pretty good if you ask me.  There were very few slip-ups here, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe phrase \"visual poetry\" is a term that is not meant to be thrown around lightly. However, this show deserves it. Masterful directing from the dialogue to the way scenes are structured. The scene in episode 9 where Miyokichi tells Bon that she'll see him in hell, is portrayed so majestically, that you can't help but marvel. The OP is visual poetry at its finest. While almost nothing moves, the sheer symbolism and craft put into it make it a feast to look at, not only for its unique and culturally traditional look, but for how much meaning is packed into almost every shot. This is further emphasized when they revoke it for episodes 11 and 12 but put it back for episode 13 now that you know literally everything the OP actually showed you due to what you just witnessed. Studio DEEN deserves to be commended for their work on this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not many of the songs in the background OST truly stick out or me to the point where I actively try to hunt them down with exception of the glorious track \"Sukeroku\" (though I centrally did try), the blaring and jazzy tunes set the stage perfectly, and every piece is used to excellent effect, like the two major scenes in episodes 9 and 12 that I referred to multiple times. As for the OP, Usurai Shinjuu, by Megumi Hayashibara, is quite the catchy and jazzy tune as well, making me snap at every beat while gawking at what the visuals of the OP display. The ED, \"Kawa, Taredoki\", by Kana Shibue, is actually without any lyrics, and is a relaxing song that's a perfect way to calm us down after many of these episodes force us to endure these highly dramatic scenes. Sure, It's not highly memorable, but it gets the job done.\\n\\n\r\nArt is an expression. Stories are expressions. This show is all about an expressive form of entertainment. When an entertainment and story-driven fictional medium like anime truly takes off, there will always be those who try to evaluate individual installments to the medium, and those people, including myself, are called critics. Critics have a very mixed reputation and are sometimes looked as stingy buzzkills who relentlessly shut down these entertainment pieces. However, while we often do take part in that, we find it especially fun to cherish stories that manage to mesmerize us so much into an impressive new world and plot. This show cherishes the art of Rakugo, and shows us many perspectives on how an artist (of any kind) approaches his or her art, and, along with the great story and impressive way it's told, this is something us critics love to see. We can get more passionate about these stories more so than most people do, so seeing works like this, really refreshes us.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, that's the perfect word to describe this show: refreshing. Can you name a single other anime that showcases the art of Rakugo? Can you name many anime where the characters often wear robes? Can you name a drama that is told like visual poetry? No one can, at least in this point in time. Not every work of art is original or done with the people or the art in mind. Some art is made for the cash, and those works are often what us critics bash (like Mahouka, The Asterisk War, and so...so many others). The medium is chock full of this stuff. Hell, all entertainment mediums have failed ambitious projects and projects that were made with cash in mind rather than quality or ambition. That's what makes works like this so refreshing to us. \\n\\n\r\nWell, that's enough rambling for now. \\n\\n\r\nThank every single one of you that ever liked any of my reviews. I would've never made it to making 50 of these if none of you cared about what I make. This review has been a lot more personal than I thought, but with a special milestone review, comes a special title that truly needs to be discussed, like this one. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu. Here's shooting for 100.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. I have to admit, this show took me by storm. A series about rakugo isn\u2019t something that we see often in the anime industry these days in particular dealing with performances on stage. As such, this series is what I like to describe as a dark horse. And for a lot of reasons, it deserves quite a lot of praise for what is.\r\nComing into the series, I had little knowledge about rakugo. It\u2019s a form of Japanese art performed on stage using creative dialogues, expressions, and body language. Quite frankly, it\u2019s very entertaining once you get the feel of it despitethe performer being stationary. Most of the time, the performances involves a comical act that goes along with a story. Sometimes, the performer brings in drama and bittersweet emotions but the bottom line is that it\u2019s described to entertain. That\u2019s what this show has done: bringing entertainment in a rarity form.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place around the 1970s. However, the show does a lot more background storytelling than what most viewers may be accustomed to. Thankfully, the series knows how to transit into the past to bring the story into the present. From the beginning, we meet Koji, a guy who got out of prison but later follows a goal to make himself into a professional rakugo performer. This sets up his encounter with Yakumo Yurakutei, a man who he looks up to and wants to learn from. After many exchanges and work, he does earn himself a spot as Yakumo\u2019s student. This is where transition comes in and we take a look at the past.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence the storytelling brings in a lot of relationship dynamics and characterization. The relationship between Yakumo and Sukeroku is a prominent example of this as we see their connection. Furthermore, the show makes us realize how different they are after examining their personalities. Yakumo is the stoic type with a cyclical personality and little intense of the opposite sex. Meanwhile, Sukeroku is just the opposite who often seeks girls in his life while maintain his hyperactive personality. Despite this, the two seems to get along as good friends and strives to become rakugo artists. There\u2019s quite a difference in their performance skills though as we can easily see how much Sukeroku is better than Yakumo. Throughout the series, Yakumo struggles at first to make a name for himself but does manage to pick up the pace once he realizes it. \\n\\n\r\nAt some point in the show, we should realize that Yakumo really strives to become an artist. This is evidenced by his lack of interest in Miyokichi, a beautiful geisha who seems to have quite an affection for him. However, they do connect in some ways. While romance isn\u2019t a prominent part of the show, it does play a role as we can easily see some budding romance between the two. Furthermore, there\u2019s also Sukeroku who seems to be smitten by Miyokichi. Get the picture? What this brings is how complex the trio\u2019s relationship can be. Yakumo and Sukeroku has become close to the point that they almost seems like brothers. When Miyokichi enters the story, it almost feels like she\u2019s a wall between the two. Meanwhile, Yakumo seems to only be in love with rakugo and strives to be better, something that he actually succeeds later on in the series. To say the least, love in this series is beyond dramatic and even has a tone of tragedy to it. I also find it amusing that the show mixes in some gender bender at one point to spice up the sexuality vibes. However, it\u2019s mostly played down as a form of art to get viewers comfortable with the style of the show; in that being artistic with its storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I find very capitalizing about the show is the personalities of the characters. Yakumo seems to have a dual personality, one that\u2019s stoic with his reserved behavior while other times behaves like a gentlemen to entertain the audience. On the other hand, Sukeroku is more like the guy who seems casual all the time and easy to make friends with. Miyokichi has perhaps the most complicated personality as she seems to want certain people like Yakumo but her motivations aren\u2019t truly clear. Is she manipulative? Maybe. Is she fragile? In some ways, yes. Is she a bit too hopeless to be romantic? Who knows really. However, it should be noticeable that she realizes about Yakumo\u2019s personal feelings and unfortunately, she isn\u2019t really part of what he has in mind for. The show capitalizes on this emotional drama and later really makes a climax out of it, something that is very memorable. Later on, we\u2019ll also see how other characters enters the show because of their tragic relationship.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the insightful storytelling and characterization, the rakugo performances are also quite entertaining. The first episode (being double length) gives good insight about what rakugo really is like with the style, body language, dialogues, and storytelling of the performer. Despite the performer being stationary, it\u2019s fairly interesting to see how they act out each play. The stories themselves each contain a theme but always prominent characters that switches between tone and mannerism according to the story. While Yakumo and Sukeroku does differ a bit between their performances, it can easily be observed that the two strives to be the best at what they do. And that\u2019s something really inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nDEEN actually puts on quite a decent effort into the artwork for this series. I\u2019m honestly surprised but the visual quality is stellar. It\u2019s also realistic to portray the 1970s with the backgrounds and simple structures. Furthermore, characters are dressed in the way that is believable. Between character designs, the rakugo performances is also an art in itself and the choreography for the show is really well delivered with clever camera angles. This is even enhanced by the creative body languages. Character expression is important and this show nailed the coffin in that not just on stage but also between character interactions in real life. From Miyokichi\u2019s emotional breakdowns to Sukeroku\u2019s joyful acting, it\u2019s quite something to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack has more of a Japanese feudal tone to it, like something from the past. It\u2019s able to capture the feel of a performance with the character voice mannerisms. In addition, the show isn\u2019t shy to deliver dynamic dialogues especially with characters like Miyokichi. The OP and ED songs also has an unique feel that adds more to the show.\\n\\n\r\nAh how I wish this show could have lasted longer. But from what it\u2019s worth, the series really attempted t do something refreshing and unique. It capitalized on every theme and way a story should be told and it damn well delivered. Characterization remains strong while we get realistic human emotions that is easily recognizable. From the clever delivery of the dialogues to powerful chemistry between characters, it\u2019s a show that I would recommend to just about anyone.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: After his release from prison Yotarou (Seki, Tomokazu) seeks an apprenticeship in Rakugo from Yuurakutei Yakumo (Ishida, Akira), a renowned master of the art who was known as Kikuhiko in his earlier years. After some coercing the elderly master accepts him as his first pupil and through Yotarou\u2019s personality and the style of his developing Rakugo, Kikuhiko is reminded of somebody from his past. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is the story of Kikuhiko\u2019s upbringing alongside his friend and fellow apprentice Sukeroku (Yamadera, Kouichi) and how their relationship with Rakugo and each other shaped their lives.\r\n[Characters]:\r\nWhere bettera place to start discussing Shouwa Genroku than with its phenomenal main characters alongside their almost equally incredible supporting cast. Due to the overall strength of the show it is hard to say whether or not its characters are its greatest accomplishment however I think it is fair to say they are its most integral element. The show hosts a great many carefully developed personalities even among its less important cast members and the way it weaves complicated sentiments and emotions together is not only believable but genius. What at first manifests as something as simple as animosity quickly transforms into a mixture of respect and admiration all the while mingling with biting jealousy \u2013 the way in which Shouwa Genroku\u2019s characters behave is intricate and conflicting and subsequently are the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist of the show, though he does not truly appear until the second episode, is Kikuhiko who is a wonderfully compelling character. While at first he dislikes Rakugo because his tutelage under the 7th-generation Yakumo master represented the end of his previous desire to be a dancer, he steadily grows to enjoy performing it over time. He attempts to find his own voice within the medium, competes for recognition and improvement against his friend Sukeroku, and at times feels like he is wasting his time entirely in Rakugo yet proceeds none the less in a manner than can only be described as extraordinary organic. Kikuhiko, along with the rest of the cast, is fantastically authentic as a character and watching them all play off one another is both immersive and entertaining. It is also worth noting that, while Ishida Akira is a voice acting legend by this point, I believe his performance in this role to be his best work by far. The subject matter of the show and its many Rakugo presentations require a very artful and diverse approach and he delivers an absolutely stunning performance.\\n\\n\r\nSukeroku is a similarly outstanding character who\u2019s characterization further emphasizes the complexities at play within Shouwa Genroku\u2019s cast. Kikuhiko is introverted, self-conscious, and unsure of himself while Sukeroku appeares effortlessly talented yet wild and carefree almost to the point of his behavior becoming hazardous. The two men couldn\u2019t be more different yet they find common ground time and time again not only through their shared love of Rakugo but in other aspects of their lives as well  \u2013 their relationship is the dramatic meat of the show and it measures up to the emphasis placed upon it by the show in excess.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, practically every notable character in Shouwa Genroku is memorable. Roles that may have been left undeveloped in other shows are explored excellently through the subtext of the show\u2019s character interactions and dialogue rendering the entirety of the show\u2019s cast meaningful and interesting rather than solely its powerhouse main characters. People are rarely black and white, they are conflicted and volatile \u2013 susceptible to changing in each mood and meeting and Shouwa Genroku illustrates this perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe name \u2018Studio Deen\u2019 over the years has effectively become synonymous with art and animation issues due to frequent quality drops and problematic adaptations throughout their history. That being said, I almost find their past missteps entirely forgivable in the face of Shouwa Genroku\u2019s incredible visual delivery. Not only is the art style crisp and consistent but it is particularly interesting because of its imaginative use of colors, expressions, and character motion. The aesthetic of the show is highly reminiscent of shows like Aoi Bungaku which is wonderful for establishing a very authentic-feeling setting.\\n\\n\r\nAt premise the idea of Rakugo presents more of a problem than anything else \u2013 the orator is practically immobile when telling their story and the length of many of the classic Rakugo narratives means that the situation will be prolonged for quite a while. How then do you make Rakugo visually compelling to watch beyond merely the character\u2019s performance? Deen answers this question brilliantly in a number of ways, many of which showcasing the strength of the medium in regards to exhibiting these performances. The expression work for one fits very well with the idea of a single character portraying multiple roles within Rakugo \u2013 the shift in character expression is one of many telltale signs that the orator is switching between characters and the show\u2019s diverse selection of expressions makes these portrayals all the more impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe imagery of the show surrounding its Rakugo elevates its visuals to the next level. Using shot reverse shot of a singular character further illustrates their swapping of roles however this technique is used sparingly enough as not to become one-dimensional or corny. The close-up shots of the character\u2019s expressions during the performance strike a great balance between the slew of differently personalities being performed and the actual mood of the performer. Seeing Kikuhiko and Sukeroku bleed through in their performances without dropping character is brilliantly balanced. Lastly, the show makes use of fictional imagery to accentuate the legitimacy of the performance. Light can be shone through a non-existant window when the character opens a door or peers outside and the environment surrounding the orator may change to different locations yet the performance remains cohesive. Shouwa Genroku goes beyond providing incredible visuals and tells the story in a way that could have only been done within the medium at hand.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative of Shouwa Genroku is just as impressive as its characters and visuals and plays to its strengths by emphasizing its character drama. The pacing is slow yet never unexciting allowing for it to play out almost full Rakugo performances which are one of the show\u2019s primary means of exhibiting character growth and change. The show itself is quite dramatic however the lighthearted subject matter and punchlines within Rakugo provide the show with excellent flexibility between the two moods.\\n\\n\r\nAlongside presenting highly compelling character chemistry and development Shouwa Genroku asks provocative questions through its narrative. Is an art form something lofty and objective or is it something that should cater to the pleasure of the audience? Do you protect tradition or do you venture something new and perhaps save the very art form you practice? Must you practice something in its original form even until it dies away or should you break its conventions and bring to it new life? These queries and themes are explored at length through the interactions and ideologies the show\u2019s characters providing offering an additional intellectual element to the show\u2019s already ingenious design.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nInitially I felt that the music of the show was merely a backdrop for the fantastic setting and scenes transpiring however as Shouwa Genroku progressed its importance and effectiveness became more evident. While at first unassuming, the soundtrack drums up the pace of each scene. The atmosphere, the mood, the character\u2019s internal thoughts \u2013 everything. The relaxed, jazzy influence of the music fits well with the pacing of the show, quickening and swelling at moments of tension or severity to accentuate the attitude of the scene. It is used sparingly and never overwhelms the show\u2019s visuals, providing a fantastic juxtaposition that underscores the importance of each development.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku is artistic, it is emotional, it is brilliant. Each component of its structure is as strong as the last and it tells a gripping story full of wonderfully written, complex characters set against incredible visuals. Though I made mention of Ishida Akira earlier the show features a number of outstanding vocal performances as its subject matter lends itself so well to the exhibition of that talent.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\\n\r\nI gave Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu a 10 because of its fantastic qualities across the board. Its characters were wonderfully realistic and compelling, the story being told was captivating, and the visual approach of the show was highly entertaining. While not without flaws the countless successes it enjoys far outshine any of its missteps.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Shouwa Genroku to anyone interested in character-dramas who aren\u2019t turned off by methodical pacing. The comedy of the show comes secondary to the development of its characters and the drama of their interactions however the show does possess a certain carefree levity that might appeal to people looking for something relaxed yet upbeat.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu has been hyped to me as the best anime of this year. Mature historical drama with amazing voice acting and editing. \r\nFirst lets tackle the voice acting which is truly spectacular. Especially during Rakugo scenes where voice actors shine at almost mindblowing levels. It really shows how great Japanese voice acting is. I am not japanese speaker so I can't really appreciate or criticize the rakugo perfomances but I can hear how the voice actors can jump between characters during the performance and it's pretty fantastic.\r\nWith that also comes the editing which smartly uses cuts and camera angles to enhance therakugo scenes and I absolutely loved it. Really great stuff\\n\\n\r\nThe drama is good and not so good. I appreciate the maturity of the series and how it tackled themes of obsession loneliness and devotion, but the story itself is hardly original and at certain points it becomes kinda stupid. I am talking about the episode 12 in particular. The stuff that is happening here feels like forced end of the plotline because author wasn\u2019t sure how to end it. It was just dumb. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of production is okay. The music is great mix of traditional Japanese music and jazz. The animation is inconsistent. Especially when it comes to scenes with audiences. You have this beautifully drawn main characters and then the camera cuts to the audience and you see blobs with eyes. I know these characters are completely irrelevant but the difference of quality is truly striking. \\n\\n\r\nOnly truly interesting character to me was Kikuhiko who was greatly complex. Some people might say that Sukeroku was the best character, but to me he was just straight up Gary Sue. Sure he\u2019s drunk and filthy and lazy but that\u2019s about all that\u2019s bad about him. He still performs godlike rakugo at the end of the day and everybody still loves him. He only has 2 interesting moments in the entire series, one comes out of nowhere but I enjoyed it, the other came way too late for me to care. Overall the cast is not bad per se and it obviously mainly focuses on the dynamic between the two main characters but there\u2019s nothing notable. \\n\\n\r\nI am glad this anime was created because it taught me about the great art of rakugo but outside of its setting the story is hardly original. Far from bad, and not so far from amazing but still far enough. \\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS !!\r\nI did not know anything about Rakugo, and when I went to see this anime surprised me a lot, I started to like Rakugo and I was looking on youtube about videos in Japan of people seeing Rakugo as much as I liked.\r\n(Story = 9,5/10)\r\nI like it a lot when you explore the past of a character who suffered with certain losses in life and how he got that way. And the way they explored was excellent, the story is very rich and captivating with their main characters who are: Bon and Shin. Rakugo was something very well presentedto those who do not know and his presentation of Rakugo with the characters were very well directed, it was not boring, they were creative and very interesting and sometimes funny depending on the kind of story they told. In the dramatic moments they were very well consistent to the scene with each perspective of the character very well presented during the plot, with certain moments very sad, but very realistic within his narrative. A pity that did not present Yotaru very well, but this season was made to show more of Bon's past.\\n\\n\r\n(Characters = 10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI loved the characters of this anime, even though they were few, were very well developed. The dialogues during Bon and Shin were a lot of fun, it's cool the interaction between them, and they developed their relationship very well during the journey, which is very nice when they recognize the work and style of Rakugo of each one during the work and how they are perfecting the skills to make a better Rakugo. The conflicts they had with these characters were essential, with good messages of lives, often exciting. The Miyokichi was a character who had a good importance in the plot, focusing well on the main drama about this character, managed to convey well the emotions to the viewer during the scenes with her.\\n\\n\r\n(Art, Animation = 9/10)\\n\r\nI loved the art, color palettes well selected, design of very well made characters. The background are very beautiful as are the used clothes. Now what struck me was how well used were some well-heeled Rakugo art scenes, also used in certain dramatic scenes to increase the weight of the scene. About the animation is very good and consistent but nothing spectacular.\\n\\n\r\n(Sound = 10/10)\\n\r\nI love Jazz as in Baccano, and a well-done jazz like this is appreciated, it was very well used during the scenes of Rakugo that gave more immersion to the work, besides the fun moments that became very cool. During the dramatic scenes they used the violin and piano very well done, leaving the scene more dramatic still. The sound effects with the instruments of ancient Japan contributed much with the immersion experience. The dubbing was something that impressed me, they did an excellent dubbing, combined the voice with each character, and during Rakugo they managed to convey a sense that the story was real, with the voice acting of each person told during Rakugo.\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment = 9/10)\\n\r\nRakugo was a unique experience, I hoped it would be a rather dull journey with some interesting things, but good thing I was completely wrong, I loved the stories of each character and his conflicts, very well done, and had a lot of fun during Rakugo. Every aspect like sound, art, animation, direction contributed even more to the experience that was Rakugo.\\n\\n\r\n(Overall = 9,5/10)\\n\r\nThis show probably will not please everyone, but if you are looking for a work with a unique premise and a well made storrytelling with slower pace this work is for you. It lacked little to be masterpiece, I think that if it were a little more impacting would have my maximum score, I hope it in the 2 season will do it.",

            "content": "Rakugo. Essentially, the art of storytelling. But through the course of these 13 episodes, we discover there is so much more to this ancient Japanese art-form. There is great attention to technique, pacing, the teller's voice, the genre of story and so on. What SGRS does is transport us to a time when this beautiful yet under appreciated art-form is stagnant and slowly dying, due to other emerging entertainments such as television. Yet also the stubbornness and pride of the elder Rakugo masters to stick to old traditions and their disdain for anything new and different. \r\nI wont go too much into the story asone of the joys is its slowly unravelling nature. But it is fairly simple on paper: it shows the friendship of two young men, both up and coming Rakugo students, and how they approach the art of storytelling (and indeed life itself) very differently. Both have boundless passion for this art, which maintains their strong lifelong bond. This bond of brotherhood is the core of the show, and it so powerful. The characters on SGRS are some of the most wonderfully complex and engaging ive ever come across in Anime. In fact just thinking about them now gets me quite emotional. This is the power of the show. Not to mention the side characters, who each have their own fleshed out and engaging stories, some very sad, but also as powerful.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of amazing characters and a quietly devastating, profound, and sometimes very sad tale, we have some breathtaking art and sound. The opening and closing credits contain beautiful melancholy jazz tunes (oh man that ending credits song just destroyed me EVERY time). The art is gorgeous in its attention to detail, the period details from the pre and post war Japan are spot on. Its obvious so much love went into this adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly could write thousands of words about this show. It has a quiet power that devastated me by its conclusion. It is so different from any other anime ive ever seen. Its not only one of the best anime of 2016, it is one of the best anime ive ever watched. A masterpiece.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "A diamond in the rough, that\u2019s for sure. Who could have thought that a show dedicated to the art of sitting down and telling a story could be so engaging? Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu has blown me away with its ability to create a thoroughly fleshed-out cast, packed to the brim with personality. I hung on to every word that was said, and in a show revolving heavily around dialogue, that would be critical to helping the anime hit the mark. The performances are always entertaining but always serve that dual purpose of opening up a window into our characters\u2019 lives and their troubles. Thisis a character drama at its sumptuous best. Coupled with some beautiful character design, charming music and expressive animation, Studio DEEN have created the criminally under watched darling of the Winter 2016 season.\\n\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is a delightful tale, mostly made as wonderful it is by the excellent, dynamic relationship forged between lead characters. The way that the timid and tidy Bon Kikuhiko is at odds with the loud and carefree Shin Hatsutaro helps drive much of the story forward. Their conflicts go a long way to developing their distinct personalities and makes for viewing ranging from side-splittingly funny to tear-jerking. At its simplest explanation, we follow the story of these two men aiming to perfect their Rakugo \u2013 the centuries-old art of delivering a story from seated (\u2018seiza\u2019) position. What makes the anime something memorable however is that it\u2019s not only about Bon and Shin trying to master their craft, but using it to help overcome their own fears and push aside the elements of their life they refuse to face. The beauty of the story is that it accomplishes so much with ease. It even goes out of its way to give commentary on the role that Rakugo has in people\u2019s lives and the gradual decline of the Rakugo industry. These ideas are all woven seamlessly into a wonderful story that wouldn\u2019t feel out of place as a Rakugo piece of its own.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t remember the last time I was so invested in a character relationship as I was between Bon and Shin. Their disgust at the way the other one approaches the world of Rakugo is at odds with an admiration they have for parts of the other person\u2019s personality they feel like they are missing from their own lives. Shin has a natural talent for Rakugo though his methods go against the style that\u2019s popular with the institution. Bon struggles to make a presence on stage and though he maintains a prim and proper approach, he can\u2019t help but feel he\u2019s being left behind. This relationship is packed with a tonne of grey areas and feels like it could break apart or bond closer at any moment. It\u2019s gripping. When romance eventually weaves its way into their lives then the strain takes the story to a whole new level. If you\u2019re a lover of multi-dimensional characters, then our lead two performers will leave you wanting more. A big thumbs up to Bon (Akira Ishida) and Shin\u2019s (Kouichi Yamadera) VA\u2019s who were superb.\\n\\n\r\nEverything Studio DEEN have done in the animation and character design department has been superb. An earthly colour tone makes it feel somewhat like a period piece. Everything has this feeling of being subdued and grounded. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu actually feels like an artwork. Characters have a distinct smirk you\u2019ll quickly come to love or a pained look that you can\u2019t help but empathise with. Animation goes a long way to making Bon and Shin\u2019s performances so entertaining. Very little is lost in translation because their faces manage to convey so much. DEEN aren\u2019t even afraid to put animation towards larger crowds and busy scenes every now. It all feels like a labour of love. This is a true redemption moment for a studio that has become the butt of many jokes over the years, particularly in the animation department.\\n\\n\r\nSmooth jazz, melancholic strings and tender piano songs are never at odds with one another in a beautiful audio package here. They work in harmony to help drive home the comedy or chip away at your heart, but it\u2019s never overwrought. Memorable melodies are to be found everywhere. A massive thank you to composer Kana Shibue for making a stunning debut in the anime industry with a score that manages to play a crucial role in making Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu as memorable as it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe less you know about Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu the better the experience will be. A tale of two men fighting to rise to the top in a dying art is enthralling and magical. It\u2019s a complete package from the art to the voice acting to the music and of course a top-notch story.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is a historical Josei manga written by Kumota Haruko that began in 2010. Just this year, an anime adaptation aired, being brought to us by Studio Deen. You may recall them as the studio behind Read or Die, Gravitation, The law of Ueki, & Sakura Trick. Just to name some of their series I've looked at. How does this historical drama compare? Let's take a look and see.\r\nStory:\r\nWe open our tale with a young man getting released from prison. He makes his way to the theatre and begs the Rakugo master, Yakumo, to make him his apprentice. Yakumo reluctantly accepts andtake Yotarou with him. At Yakumo's home, Yotarou meets Konatsu, a young woman who was raised by him. After committing a massive faux pas during one of Yakumo's Rakugo performances, Yotarou begs for forgiveness. Yakumo sits him and Konatsu down and tells them the story of how he and Konatsu's father began their lives as Rakugo storytellers. The bulk of the series follows the flashback, showing how things reached the state that they're in at the opening of the series.\\n\\n\r\nLet's examine the series' faults first. There are some fairly minor ones. The most noticeable is that Yakumo's story includes scenes that he wasn't present for and these are pretty specific scenes where there's no real reason that someone would have told him exactly what happened in detail. Is he just guessing at what happened for the sake of embellishment? It's also a bit jarring when Yakumo's story ends and we abruptly skip ahead to events that take place quite a long time after. How did Yotarou & Konatsu respond to his story? What events led them to the point where they were at the end? Bugger if I know. Maybe when they get a second series they'll spend most of it on a flashback to show us that missing time. But, as things stand, there's really not much point to Yakumo telling his story to Konatsu & Yotarou since we see neither a reaction from them nor any evidence of character growth because of it.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are a lot of positive aspects to the series. The series excels at illustrating realistic situations with all of the joys and sorrows that can stem from them. It does so in a very compelling and nuanced way. The way it handles its foreshadowed character death reminds me of A Prayer for Owen Meany. Both works involve a character reminiscing about a lost friend and both proceed to show you who this character was, faults and strengths, while demonstrating why they mattered to the reminiscing character and make a strong case for why they should matter to us too. See, Divergence Eve? It is possible to show a character's death in advance and still get the audience invested. In addition to telling the tragic story of Yakumo's old friend, the series also contains a coming of age story. Telling how he came into his own as a performer and showing his growth from child to man. The two tales are heavily intertwined and they're both superb.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAny strong slice of life narrative requires strong characters. Otherwise you just have a bunch of gits doing mundane things. Fortunately, that's an arena where this series absolutely excels. We see a lot of progression for both Yakumo and Sukeroku. The way they react to one another, the way they respond to others and the way they influence one another all change over the course of the series in a very natural way. The character progression never feels contrived or forced. It's also interesting to see how their personalities get reflected in the way they perform rakugo and how that changes as they start to develop their own styles instead of trying to copy their instructors. That isn't a simple feat nor is it something that could have been done without complex characters. The cast in general just has a great deal of verisimilitude and is really well fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this is really good. There's a lot of detail put into the snippets of rakugo performances that we see. Studio Deen clearly put a great deal of effort into making them look realistic. They actually are very impressive. The backgrounds are nicely detailed and the character designs are well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe vocal cast in this is stellar. Our three major characters, Yakumo, Sukeroku & Miyokichi are portrayed by Ishida Akira, Yamadera Kouichi & Hayshibara Megumi. Three spectacular actors and all of them are brilliant in this. The more secondary characters are well acted as well. Seki Tomokazu & Kobayashi Yuu voice our present day characters, Yotarou & Konatsu and they do really well. The music has a very classical feel, complementing the old-fashioned story telling tradition quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't any.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, is a pretty impressive series. It has a strong narrative, superb characters and acting and really good art and animation. If you're interested in historical dramas at all, I do recommend trying it. For myself, I give it an enthusiastic 9/10. Next week, I'm looking at Yuri Kuma Arashi. It's actually not a request. I kind of stumbled upon the basic premise randomly and I'm very morbidly curious. I'll get back to doing requests on the 25th.. This one just sounds so bizarre that I have to try it.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is an incredibly sophisticated show about creating art and the consequences of growing up with it. A story that takes place through not one, not two, but three generations of a rather obscure in the west form of art that is rakugo, best described as Japanese traditional stand up, focused on either comedic or horror-oriented storytelling performed by one person that only uses different voice tones during dialogues and slight gestures, with the only prop being a fan, to convey one of the previously written stories. It can be done in front of a live audience, where it showcases its truebeauty, or recorded to pass on for the future generations. \\n\\n\r\nAs you may notice, that description doesn't sound promising. A historical show about people performing such a boring activity looks boring. The thing is: it's not. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot starts off in the future, as a recently released convict and an ex gang member tries to become an apprentice of the legendary rakugo artist: Yakumo, also known as the eighth generation. He somehow gets accepted, and studies different forms of it in his master's house, which he shares with a girl that he raised - Konatsu - and sometimes his employee Matsuda. The convict receives the name of Yotarou and begins his rocky journey. \\n\r\nIt turns out, that Konatsu's father was another great rakugo artist - Sukeroku, a very talented and great in delivery artist who passed away ten years prior to the events of the first episode. She blames Yakumo for his death and harbors great resentment towards him. After a few events, the concerned Yakumo decides to tell both her and Yotarou who is searching for inspiration about his past, how he met Sukeroku, how they tried their best to be the best they can at their profession and how it all tragically fell apart, all because of something way more simple than art. \\n\\n\r\nThis show's way of storytelling can be described in one word: refined. There is no part of it that is unnecessary, every scene holds meaning and can be traced backwards or forwards to other scenes to see character development and change in the world of this show. It starts off with children: Bon and Shin, or as we later know them as: Yakumo and Sukeroku, becoming apprentices of \"the seventh generation\" rakugo master Yakumo Yuurakutei. The difference between them is that Bon wanted to be a dancer, but due to his leg getting severely hurt he was forced to do rakugo by his mother. Sukeroku was always passionate, from the very first scene we can see his love and infatuation with it. The plot takes us throughout their careers as rakugo performers and lives as normal people. Yakumo grows up to be a stoic figure that struggles to find his own rakugo, while Sukeroku quickly becomes comfortable in the environment, however pushes it too far and defies orders given to by his more experienced colleagues. Their development is consistent and in each episode the viewer can receive a powerful, emotional punch in the guts as the atmosphere and, well, the entire first episode spoils the show. Sukeroku will die and leave behind a child for Yakumo to take care of. I don't particularly like the usage of in media res in anything, but Rakugo pulls it off. It's so important that it starts this way, because it throws away the possibility of screwing up the big reveal and instead focuses on telling a story of how it got to that point, which this show is all about anyway. It's told through Yakumo's perspective, his past experiences and the information he gathered about the events he describes, which makes the viewer understand his character especially very well. You know what makes him tick at all times and what his thoughts are about any given topic the show tackles, but at the same time you are left with the mysteries of Sukeroku's mind. It creates a great dynamic and strengthens the feeling of real connection between the two, as Yakumo is always interested in his friend, which makes the viewer feel the same way as we see those events through his perception of the situation. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is crafted masterfully. It always knew what it was doing and didn't squander a single minute of its runtime to do something unrelated to its themes and ideas. A simple casual banter between the two main characters always eventually ends up on the topic of rakugo, as it's the only thing they can really think about, it's their job and they both really want to be good at it. However, the beginning and the ending of each of those talks make it feel like a real conversation, and a solid piece of writing with good build up and conclusion. The romantic storyline that comes into play later also has exactly that, however, just like anything else besides Yakumo's and Sukeroku's conversation, those story threads have a much wider exposition of ideas and topics. Rakugo is dying, and it's apparent that it's nearing its end by the time the events of the first episode occur. Both Yakumo and Sukeroku have their own ideas about how they want to go about reviving it, but one's clearly more passionate about it than the other from the beginning. It almost makes it feel like a rivalry, when it's really not, but it does make the show this much more interesting, knowing that the world is alive and changing. \\n\\n\r\nThe most impressive thing to me about Rakugo is that it has the confidence to built a story that will be boring to many. Not only is it slow paced, but throughout the 13 episode run time it presents numerous, fully animated, fully voice acted, actual rakugo performances by several cast members. Not only that, but they make them a key element of the show's thematic presentation, and it pays off. Those performances are simply astonishing, not only is the directing during those segments absolutely on point, but so is the usage of music and some of the best voice acting in modern anime. I have never seen a better example of something, that could only be created in this one medium that is anime. Those camera shots, focusing on specific parts of the characters or the audiences, following them in a way that no real camera could, is what makes Rakugo this much better than its competition. It feels realistic and fluid, but if you think about it, it's all anime magic, which is just great. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's something that I would complain about, it's that some scenes are made to be overly long. Not like they don't add to the topic, but I feel like the way the characters talk could be shortened while still maintaining the mostly consistent characterization and flow of the series. There were moments where I thought that they should just stop talking, but they add a remark that somehow makes the last one feel less important in the process, creating a rather confusing exchange. They always get out of those tight spots though, finding ways to really make it through unscathed, so it's not a huge deal. Just a writing issue, every show has those.\\n\\n\r\nThe interactions between the cast are the most endearing, charming yet tragic moments that Rakugo has to offer. The thought that nothing will go their way should constantly be in your head, because even during the happy moments, where something goes the way someone wanted it to, there's always the reminder that their life is actually a never ending, spinning circle of pain and suffering for higher causes. Sometimes it's art, sometimes it's friendship and sometimes it's actually not as important as anything like that, but nonetheless, they go through everything for a reason. That reason is always clear too. There's not a point where someone's motivations are particularly unclear, but that doesn't mean they aren't convoluted. \\n\r\nThe two main characters are best described by their Rakugo performances and the stories they decide to do. Yakumo finds himself to be more confident with some racy, or even erotic stories. He is good at creating a believable and fun women during the time he's given. Sukeroku on the other hand is simply a genius, one that isn't understood during his time or appreciated, but he's someone that could've pushed rakugo back to its rightful place in the entertainment business, but he was too care-free to properly dedicate to it. He's way more expressive, everything he performs seems to be easy. Simply put: Yakumo treats his art as a sort of a job that he has to go to every day and get better at no matter what, while Sukeroku is already good enough, but he doesn't put in the work necessary to be recognized more and more, to grow as a celebrity, as he is already a fantastic artist. Those approaches are really all the characterization you need to understand them, but there's so much more to it than just that. They have differing opinions about love, money, women, respect for those who are more experienced and other topics. But there's one thing that connects them: passion. Passion that even when faced the hardest of dilemmas, still sneaks back in to make their life even harder, and just when they think they're ready to give up on it, it comes back and breaks their heart. It's the reason behind every decision in their life, their burning desire to do rakugo, while sometimes a bit more cooled off, makes them become who they become by the end of their story together. It's not like they wanted to be there, life was supposed to be more simple than what they got themselves into, but they both are able to accept it. Why? Because its their life and relationship that they created and worked hard for, that was built off of their passion for rakugo and ended because of that exact thing. That's simply a beautiful, heart throbbing theme that this show revolves around. It's strong, well written, and makes those characters work as good as they do alongside an already great story and elevate it, as they work alongside each other nearly perfectly, well enough for me not to care about any minor mistakes. \\n\\n\r\nI mentioned previously how good the animation and directing is during the rakugo scenes, but it's not only those parts that are this good. The everyday lives of the cast look just as good, if at moments not better. The use of lighting and background art in this show is truly a feat to admire, it always creates a feeling of a new and fresh take on the place you've already seen as new camera shots and new perspectives are utilized. Not only that, but there are moments where they take it to the next level, as an example a scene from episode 9 where Sukeroku and another person are in a room, and as the light color switches from orange to black almost unnoticeably (!), as the tone of the scene itself draws the viewer in more and his brain interprets it as a natural course of action, where the characters turned off the light for a reason, rather than a bad transition. It's marvelous really. The animation is on par, smooth and polished so it will never feel weird or immersion-breaking. \\n\\n\r\nI have to mention that this is one of those shows that actually draws mouths after the voice actors perform their parts and match them together, not the other way around, and it REALLY shows. The mouth movement fits really well, much better than most other shows that only make mouths open when someone talks and closes when they're done. Here you can actually sort of see their lips, which was an extremely pleasant addition. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone always praises the visuals of this show, but I honestly prefer the music. It's also a pretty important thing in the show itself, as there's constant mentions of dancing and the rakugo performances themselves are accompanied by an entrance music. But that's not the only thing. This show nails its atmosphere by the change in its music more times than some give it credit for. It's used in rakugo scenes to make the viewer understand one of the two things better: the level of excitement in the audience, or the confidence of the performer, most of the times both, as they obviously correlate. Of course besides that, the soundtrack fits the period and setting of the show, uses traditional Japanese tunes and instruments to really emphasize that feel of Rakugo being a story that has been changing throughout time that passes in the show. The soundtrack is full of good pieces on its own and works just as well as a stand-alone, but it's clearly made for the show as the inspirations can be heard pretty easily if you've watched the show first. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is simply a must watch. It's an experience so strong and so expressive about its ideas and world view that it may even make you uncomfortable. You may not agree with the its idea of what art, love or passion is, but after watching this, you'd have to say that it is a pretty compelling argument that can't really be accused of enough flaws to make it unbelievable. It's a very grounded story, at times even awkwardly grounded as it can seem so improbable, but it really is. It's a tale of mistakes and misconceptions, and retains all the qualities that make dramas good, but gets rid of unnecessary melodrama and pushes the suspension of disbelief just far enough with each event so that it can remain grounded, and that's really what makes this show so good. It's something that you would think couldn't work as it's way too obscure and too far off from what you're used to, but it turns out it just isn't. It's something that breaks the barriers of nationality or beliefs, as those are human things that can't be changed, and remains a fantastic story available for literally anyone, just like a rakugo story performed by a skilled artist. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion. I highly encourage you to develop your own.",

            "content": "The first time I watched Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, I turned it off ten minutes into the double-size first episode. It seemed dry and unengaging. Other anime from the same season had, in the best attention-deficit traditions, included some big dramatic hook or reveal early in their opening episode to grab the viewer. Set against them, Rakugo felt tedious. But I dropped almost every other anime from that season, and I picked this one back up, finishing it in two days. \r\nWhat I realised was that Rakugo is unique among anime, in that it's a novel. Its strengths lie in the naturalistic rendering of humanbehaviour and situations as well as the detailed evocation of a historical period. It draws you in by slowly revealing fascinating, damaged characters locked in a poisonous stalemate: Konatsu, an orphaned girl who loves rakugo and could never perform it, and the foremost rakugo artist of his time, the former rival of the girl's father - Yurakutei Yakumo, who I will call Kikuhiko. Konatsu hates Kikuhiko enough to want to kill him, but lives in his house; he treats her with indifference and condescension, sometimes shading into irritation, but he never throws her out. Why? What debt does he owe her, and why does she hate him so much? How did her father die? \\n\\n\r\nAnimes tend to be driven by very different questions, which are forward-looking. Usually, the protagonists are either striving to fulfill their dreams or trying to deal with a situation which provides the impetus for the plot. Rakugo is unique, and more like a novel than almost any anime, because it's about the past, and about how the combination of your circumstances, your personality, your desires, the people you meet, and the society you live in, shape your life. Which is an excellent thing to be about when the subject of your questions is Kikuhiko.\\n\\n\r\nA diffident, strait-laced neurotic with a deep loneliness at his centre as well as a bitter determination to not give up and be abandoned again, Kikuhiko is one of the all-time great anime protagonists. He is deeply flawed and often cruel, but an innate idealism and a wounded innocence at his heart keeps him sympathetic. His psychological development is profoundly well-realised. Kikuhiko's foil, Sukeroku, is jolly and uninhibited, a supremely talented rakugoka who has a gift for drawing people to him and making them laugh. It would be predictable for Kikuhiko to simply hate him, and for them to be contrasted as dark and light, but Rakugo is far more intelligent about its characters than that. They may contrast, but they also inform each other. Sukeroku's lack of inhibition leads him to debauchery and a disregard for proper conduct which comes to hurt his career even as Kikuhiko overcomes his lack of talent with obsessive study to develop his own style of art, and his rigid decorum makes him the preferred child of the rakugo establishment. But they don't become enemies; they like each other too much. \\n\\n\r\nThe strange relationship between Kikuhiko and Sukeroku, with love and mutual artistic appreciation and jealousy and resentment all tied up in it, is at the core of the anime: their introvert/extrovert opposition shades into its depiction of the paradoxes in the art of rakugo - a totally solitary performance which requires a rakugoka to know and truly understand people, and be able to impersonate many at once, to succeed. It is steeped in tradition, and rakugokas must conform to strictly conservative standards of behaviour, as if they represent the old values of Japan. But at the same time, rakugokas are working stiffs with an especially precarious occupation, and socially speaking, just lowly entertainers. Kikuhiko cannot be in a relationship with a geisha if he wants to advance in rakugo, but the stories he tells are often bawdy; overt sexuality is in fact his specialty, despite his personal frigidity. Sukeroku's enthusiastic caricatures are at first depicted as the gold standard, but they lack the subtlety of Kikuhiko's art; it's to the anime's credit that you begin to notice and appreciate rakugo enough to realise how their art reflects who they are. The fine layering of detail combined with the naturalistic development of the characters, all scored spectacularly by a traditional shamisen-and-taiko-drums soundtrack, makes Rakugo as satisfying on a sensory level as it is intellectually fascinating.\\n\\n\r\nThese contradictions and the way the protagonists navigate them while being inevitably changed in the process, give a deep thematic richness to Rakugo, which uses the rise and fall of Sukeroku and Kikuhiko both as a way to examine artistic obsession, jealousy, love, and brotherhood, and as a way to depict the cultural shifts in Japan after World War Two. Here, its insights are not as sharp; it's more a character piece than social commentary, but the thirty-year canvas on which the story is painted allows for a sense of epic scope to the stories of the characters. Much like rakugo itself, the anime combines acute observation of humanity with a slightly artificial shape to its narrative. Its tragic end, where Kikuhiko and Sukeroku's selfish mistakes result, with karmic symmetry, in two always-expected and yet shocking deaths, feels more melodramatic than naturalistic, and yet it is brutally sad and horrifying. This anime can make what should seem false and contrived into something that hits you on a visceral level, and that's appropriate: it's what rakugo's all about.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was definitely not an extremely popular show when it aired. And yet, after a few different sources said that this show was different, but definitely worth watching, I tried it out. And the result was an amazing, sorely underrated show that is incomparable to anything else.\r\nStory: There are two sides to the story of Shouwa Genroku. There is the basic rakugo side of the story, and then there is the story of the characters, and their lives. Before this show, I had never really heard of rakugo. However, I did a quick google search, and then watched the show, and Imust say, the show did a fantastic job with this element. In the first episode, the show has a character do a full rakugo segment. And it is fascinating. I was enthralled in the actual rakugo presented, and how well the show executed said rakugo. Even if there had been no plot outside of the rakugo, I could have watched the show just for the rakugo. \\n\\n\r\nThe other big element of the story is the lives and journeys of the characters. Interestingly enough, the majority of this show is actually made up of backstory. But it was some of the most interesting backstory I have ever seen. It explores the upbringing and life of Yuurakutei, Yakumo (or known as kikuhiko). It starts with him as a young boy and his introduction to rakugo and the world that comes with it. Kikuhiko moves into a house with a rakugo master, and he meets another boy who is also an apprentice named Sukeroku. And we see these two boys grow up, and bond, and find themselves. And it is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI do not use that term lightly. But I couldn't find a better way to describe it. The story is beautiful because it is raw, and heartfelt, and interesting, and there are ups and downs, and almost anything and everything. But really, it's just so real. The show does not try to do too many things, or force things in for the audience's benefit, but instead, it tells a simple and yet very complex story of a man.  Another very interesting thing about this, is that because this is backstory, we know the general outcome of what happens to all the main characters. And yet it still managed to have me so extremely interested, because the characters and their interactions were so engaging.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Let us start with Kikuhiko. Kikuhiko is a generally steely-eyed serious man. He has a rather down to earth personality and is seemingly no nonsense. He has a very interesting type of charm. He is handsome, yes, but he is also extremely hard working and caring. And although on the outside, it would seem like he does not have a large amount of emotions, the show executes his character in a way that we can feel all of his emotions. And he has a lot of them. And he is also not a perfect man. The show does not try to make him perfect. One of the best things about this show is that they embrace each characters flaws. Kikuhiko can be brutal. But it makes his character that much more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSukeroku is the opposite of Kikuhiko. Which is possibly why they mesh together so well. Sukeroku is extremely loud, outgoing and brash. As he grows older he likes to go out and drink a lot. We get to see Sukeroku as he tries to navigate the world of rakugo which is very proper and traditional with his loud and flamboyant personality and versions of rakugo. He was a great character too.\\n\\n\r\nI'm actually not going to talk about any more characters because this review would go on forever, but there is no character that I disliked. Every single one was intriguing and had their flaws and there good parts. And they all interacted so well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm just going to comment on the character designs. The designs were really fantastic because they reflected the personality of the character. Kikuhiko's design was very serious and curt looking whereas Sukeroku had a very wild looking design. I really admired that element. \\n\\n\r\nSound: surprisingly nice too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I cannot say enough about this anime. Very rarely do I rate shows with a 10/10, but this show deserved it. And there is a season 2! The story was amazing, and very real and interesting, both in the past and the present. This show does not have enough recognition, and although it may not be for everyone, if you can appreciate a more subtle beauty in a show, then go watch this. You may just find an unforgettable experience.",

            "content": "To be excellent, an anime doesn't always need to be endowed with great ideas. It doesn't always have to explore overwhelming themes. It doesn't need to have deeper meaning. Sometimes, subtlety and proper execution of everything it does is sufficient to make a masterful series. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is such an anime.\r\nShouwa starts off in the modern day Japan but shifts to the past soon after. This time shift is handled with profound care and in quite an interesting way. The transition is written very well and doesn't feel a least bit disturbing. In such manner, we're presented with a wonderful story of friendship,brotherhood and life. One that will curve a deep feeling in your heart and make you only crave for more.\\n\\n\r\nThe defining aspect of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is the atmosphere, which is relayed in a bit peculiar yet strong way. Instead of the environmental design and background musics, what creates its atmosphere is the characters' voice acting, body language and interaction. Being an anime about rakugo, a classic medium of Japanese entertainment which is basically a rakugo performer performing a comedic play, its majority of execution is centered around these plays and characters who performs them. These performance is so brilliantly presented that without making it blatant, the anime makes the viewers understand when a performance is lacking despite a lot of efforts being put into it, or when a performance really reaches the heart easily. Basically, this anime perfectly executes how a performance has been executed; and seamlessly so.\\n\\n\r\nOne needn't to hold great knowledge about rakugo or its system to enjoy this brilliant show. I had absolutely no idea about what rakugo is when I started this series, but it didn't at all hold me back from understanding what's happening. Due to the subtle presentation, I was immensely captivated and instantly pulled into its fluid storytelling. No other anime pulled me in its atmosphere as Shouwa did and its all thanks to its magnificent execution.\\n\\n\r\nAs a purely character driven drama, Shouwa's main aspect is its characters. Similar to everything else in it, this anime presents its characters powerfully. The characters are introduced perfectly. We see their relations forming subtly as the story progresses and the character interaction really grows on us. The characters feel dear to us and this anime successfully makes us care for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of the characters and their interactions is consistent; and coherent with the main plot. We see them developing due to circumstances and their relations change accordingly. This is all handled in a plausible and realistic manner. Yuurakutei Yakumo or Bon is one of my top 10 favorite anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the writing of the characters is a masterful job, their design and facial expressions are worthy of remark. Not just the characters, but also their attires, surroundings and atmosphere, all was perfectly designed. The mesmerizing and smooth animation does an excellent job in giving the series life. It was an absolute piece of art to behold.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fairly honest, I didn't notice much of a background music in Shouwa Genroku. It did have them (I rechecked), but the seamless presentation coated them so well that they support the execution superbly without preaching their existence. It doesn't fill every moment shoving music, but rather uses them where they truly belong. This invites a serene atmosphere that allows the anime to deliver as much as possible. The OP is amazing with great visual exposition, the ending is wonderful as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important part of its sound system is the voice acting as the anime is about vocal performance. The voice actors literally have to perform vocal rakugo for this anime. I'm not very knowledgeable in seiyuu, but Shouwa's voice actors did it perfectly. From rakugo performance to dialogues between the characters to the characters talking to themselves, this anime's voice acting flourishes. I see no way for this to be done any better.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing of the story is one of the most consistent in anime. I personally liked the story a lot. This is touching, this is enchanting. I enjoyed it all through. But if I have to voice a complaint, I'd say it was slightly weak around the end of the past story. I had expected a bit more from it. It was quite out of the blue. And I found it to be quite difficult to believe because it was slightly over the top. But it was still very well directed and successfully made my eyes wet.\\n\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is an experience. It beholds a fine drama with great character emphasis. Truly a brilliant series through and through. Therefore, I bestow upon it a score of 8 out of 10, for it is worth every bit of it. A majestic series that redefines the drama genre. A rare piece of excellence of these day's anime most capable candidate for Anime of The Year 2016.",

            "content": "Rakugo: an oral art form that hails from the Genroku period of the Edo Era.  A lone storyteller, introduced by the glimmering tones of a shamisen, appears on stage to mystify an audience of all kinds with a comical tale that usually heralds some sort of a moral message. The lone storyteller, equipped with nothing but a fan to assist in his gestures encapsulates his audience through changes in tone, gesture and behaviour in order to successfully manifest the characters the story is about. Through this, the rakugo-ka is able to draw his audience into a trance that is only broken when he endshis story with an elegant bow. \\n\\n\r\nSometime in the later Shouwa Era, a young man is released from prison with a goal to become a great rakugo-ka; his passion to pursue a profession deeply rooted in tradition is contrasted with the backdrop of a rapidly modernising Japan. The young man is apprenticed to a national treasure: the rakugo-ka Yuurakutei Yakumo, who strives to preserve the traditional essence of the oral art, despite the younger generation writing it off as being a stuffy piece of entertainment reserved for the elderly. With this, the story shifts perspective and tense, and becomes almost rakugo-like in nature as the aging Yakumo recounts his past to his apprentice.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here on, Shouwa Genroku Rakguo Shinjuu clearly establishes itself as a character-focused drama that takes its time to unfold the emotions, ambitions and thought-processes of the characters that inhabit the world of the series. Far from being a boring slice-of-life character-driven anime, that relies heavily on plot-devices to push the characters forward, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu manages to establish a compelling and evocative narrative, that respects its characters and settings, whilst naturally progressing the plot without the need for artificial plot-devices.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough languid, the pacing never crawls to a halt, as focused direction and tight writing removes unnecessary exposition that often prevents the progress of failed stories akin to this one. The story is approached with a deft hand that appreciates the fact that the story is told from perspective Yakumo\u2019s memory. Minor details are approached swiftly, whilst aspects of the story that carry deep emotional importance to Yakumo are emphasised and divulged into. This approach allows for a steady, well-balanced pacing that never lags nor feels too rushed. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are most definitely the strongest point of the series. The exploration of the characters\u2019 personalities, the presentation of their growth, and the dynamics that exist within the multiple relationships are all handled with great care. This allows the characters to be presented as human beings, rather than as props that exist in order to push forward the plot. \\n\\n\r\nRakugo is never treated as a simple backdrop for the story and is part of the characterisation itself. It is Rakugo that leads to the self-actualisation of both Yakumo/Kikuhiko and Sukeroku, although their mutual love for it sends them down two very different roads. The toils that they experience, and the way they are handled, are used as artistic inspiration to bring life to the stories that the two are telling. Their individual Rakugo is also used to characterise them: Sukeroku brings an boisterous and exuberant personality to his Rakugo, enlivening the audience, whilst the more reserved and introspective Kikuhiko draws the audience into his world - keeping them entranced until his stories are over. Although bittersweet, it is a delight to see the two develop as humans whilst refining their craft, and the series does an excellent job of portraying the of the passion and despairs that come with being an artist.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why the 5-15 minute segments of Rakugo, that exist in the series, are so vital. Much of what Kiku does is affected by the importance Rakugo has on his life, and in turn his actions affect the quality of his Rakugo. Through the extended scenes where we see Kiku (and Sukeroku) orate a story, we can tell where exactly and how they have grown because their Rakugo affect their characterisation. Especially in regards to Kiku, his sneaky and intricate performances seem to reflect a darker element of his soul. It takes great to skill to intertwine the art with the character and make it fundamental to their development, but Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu manages to accomplish that in an evocative manner that resonates with the audience.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, dynamics between characters are of utmost importance as well. Although the story is told from Kiku\u2019s perspective, and he is the main attraction of the show, not a single character of importance is neglected and left as a cardboard prop on the stage. Almost every single character is presented as being multi-dimensional with flaws, ambition and struggles that are explored both introspectively and in relation to Kiku himself. Not one character\u2019s struggle is written off as being trivial, but is instead treated with a sensitivity that evokes compassion from the audience, whilst, at the same time, affecting the characterisation and perception of the other characters. For example, the geisha Miyokichi acts the source of emotional development for Kiku as his romantic relationship with her is what leads him onto the road of mastery as he is able to use her for \u201cartistic reference\u201d. However, Miyokichi is more than just romantic fodder, as Kiku\u2019s success is intertwined with her downfall as she comes to the realisation that yet another man she has put her whole faith and love into is abandoning her because she has served her purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the story is also treated with tantamount respect. The audience sees Japan go from a country that is steeped in tradition, with yukatas and kimonos being frequently worn on the streets and rakugo theatres in high attendance, to the war bringing the era of tradition to a close. With the influence from the West came American forms of entertainment that proved more popular as society shifted from tradition to progression. Thus, as time goes by, audience numbers continue to dwindle for whilst Rakugo prides itself on being \u201csteeped in tradition\u201d, the audience see it as stagnant and lacking in progression. The setting lays a good foundation for the characterisation of our characters as Sukeroku\u2019s progressive ideas on Rakugo are contrasted with his Master\u2019s (and Kikuhiko\u2019s) orthodox approach to the art form. In addition, whilst society is shown as becoming more progressive - at least in regards to fashion and the arts - more conservative ideas are highlighted as juxtaposing the apparent \u201cmodernisation\u201d of Japan. Through focused direction and clever writing, the team behind Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu have managed to make the setting of the series a living and breathing thing that doesn\u2019t just act as a back-drop for our characters\u2019 stories, but also impacts on their lives. \\n\\n\r\nWhilst much of my praise for Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is directed at its realism and natural progression, there are times where elements of the story and characters\u2019 actions can feel staged. Rather than seeing that as a flaw in the series, it can be perceived as being a dramatic device used to highlight the unreliability of the narrator. Kiku is a storyteller, not just in name but in nature too therefore elements which may seem theatrical are most likely parts of the story that Kiku has inserted for his own convenience.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons Kiku recounts his past is in order to reveal the truth behind his late friend, Sukeroku\u2019s, death. The more \u201cscripted\u201d parts of the story suggest that an altered version of the truth is being told. I thought of addressing this matter because I have seen complaints about some scenes seeming staged with some characters acting too out of character to be believed; however, the existence of Kiku - a clearly unreliable narrator - suggests that the audience is being withheld the real truth. This provides an excellent, as well as compelling, set-up for the second series because although the \u201cflashback\u201d aspect of the story has been told their are threads that will carry on to the present until the real truth is revealed. Accomplishing such a feat without making the story seem incomplete takes real sense of focus when it comes to directing. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, it is understandable why some audience members may not feel invested in the scenes with heavy theatrics.\\n\\n\r\nThe final source of delight comes from the series\u2019 audiovisuals. Despite being very dialogue heavy, the art and animation is never compromised with some of the most power scenes being where emotions are silently conveyed in changes through changes in facial expression. The voice actors were also able to successfully portray their roles - with the voices behind Kikuhiko and Sukeroku managing to perform Rakugo whilst staying true to their characters\u2019 personalities, respectively. The blues and jazz soundtrack perfectly complemented the warm-toned palette, whilst highlighting the modernisation of Japan. Whilst the classical strings of the shamisen reminded us how deeply rooted in tradition Rakugo is. If one cannot admire the story Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu has to tell, they can still admire the audiovisual splendour of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst I can find no reason to say that the series was anything other than great, it is not for everyone as the conflict is internal with gradual build-up. It is story about its characters, not about any great mission that is common in most popular series. Lastly, this isn\u2019t a complete adaptation of the source material so there are evident loose ends (especially in the final episodes), but it all provides for an interesting set-up for the inevitable second series.\\n\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu lives up to the art form that it pays homage to. It manages to provide us with an intimate insight into the lives of two men who loved and lost for their art, whilst changing themselves and each other in process. Their\u2019s is a tale that will continue to resonate even when the rakugo-ka takes his final bow and the curtain is closed. As art forms continue to evolve, the remnants of those that existed before the new one\u2019s will continue to echo on.",

            "content": "It is no exaggeration to say this show is a masterpiece, a perfectly paced story with unbelievably realistic character development. A viewer need not be a diehard fan of historical shows or even rakugo to enjoy this one.\r\nAs one can infer from the title, this show is a tragedy, and that is made clear in the first episode. It's easy to pull off tragedy if you simply throw in a lot of death flags, but this show manages to tell a tragic story without using a single one. There is no \"incurable disease,\" or even \"star-crossed lovers.\" There's nothing wrong with using those types ofthemes, but if that's all there is to it, it's difficult to make any real emotional impact; death is obviously tragic, but there are more ways a person's story can be tragic than simply death. That is what Rakugo does extremely well: it is able to make you feel truly sorry for the characters, because sometimes tragedy is inevitable, but other times it could have been easily prevented. \\n\\n\r\nBut what does that really mean? Inevitable tragedy is a result of circumstances: the characters are unable to escape their doomed fate, but what characterizes preventable tragedy? The answer is personality. If only they had been more compassionate, more careful, more diligent, then maybe the situation would have been different. It is this type of story that really hits home, and that's what this show is about, a story of tragic personalities.\\n\\n\r\nTo say this show is a masterpiece then, is to say its characters are masterpieces, and they are. The main characters are exceedingly complex, for their motives are shrouded, their anger sometimes misplaced, their compassion ephemeral. Such is the relationship when two men who call each other brothers have clashing personalities, never seeming to fit with each other just right, and yet somehow always compromising. This show portrays this complexity brilliantly, using both symbolic cinematography and actual rakugo.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is truly excellent, and I urge everyone, regardless of whether they enjoy historical anime or not, to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review, and any feedback is appreciated!",

            "content": "The anime itself is about story telling and this anime has one of the best stories I have  ever seen! \r\nSo this is the second time I have ever really written a review and it doesn't help the fact that I'm a little half awake right now. But I wanted to write this while the series was fresh in my mind. \r\n    It is safe to assume that this is by far one of the most under rated anime series of this season. I first read about this anime during the beginningof the fall seasons. I thought it sounded a bit interesting so I saved it to my \"plan to watch folder.\"  with the fall season ending and the winter season about to begin I found myself re-looking through the shows I planed to watch. When I re read the plot of Shouwa genroku rakugo shinjuu I honestly thought it sounded a bit boring. I really thought I would probably end up dropping this anime since it is the complete opposite of what I look in a show. Like most people I came into the winter season excitedly waiting for Erased (which was pretty good but that's a different story.)  I saw the first episode of shouwa genroku rakugo shinjuu come up on the site I normally go to watch anime. I thought what the heck it's probably going to be kind of boring but I will watch it since I have nothing better to do. \\n\\n\r\n      The first episode is 45 minutes and from the very beginning to the ending of that first episode I found myself completely submerged in to the story. I was actually disappointed when I found out the rest of the episodes were only 23 mins. After watching the first episode I found myself already wanting to write a review for the series just to get the name out there!  This show is exactly why you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. In the end this show ended up being one of my favorite anime of all time. Sorry for the super long ass introduction but now to get to the actual review :p. \\n\\n\r\n      As I mentioned earlier when reading the synopsis of the series it may not sound that entertaining but don't let it full you! The show itself is about Rakugo.. A very old form of story telling in Japan. I honestly had never heard of Rakugo until watching this show. The story itself revolves around 3 men (Two who were like brothers yet rivals and one who is an ex convict who was captivated by the story telling of Rakugo.)  and how Rakugo has impacted their lives.  The first series (yes there will be a second season super excited!) dives more into the depth of Yakumo and Sukeroko, and how rakugo became a part of their lives. \\n\\n\r\n     Shouwa genroku rakugo shinjuu has the best character development I  have honestly really seen in an anime. For me you know a show is good when  you see yourself there with the character, either laughing,  crying,  being angry,  etc with them. Watching SGRS I found myself drawn not only to the main characters but the supporting characters as well. Another thing as well is this show has quite a few veteran VAs playing the characters which is amazing! Two of the VAs played in Cowboy Bebop so you knows it's already awesome. \\n\\n\r\n     SGRS is one of the most emotional shows I have watched.  From episode one you already know what to expect before you are even fully introduced to the story. You know you are about to take a one way trip on the feels train. You think you know your final destination,  you think you can emotionally handle it but trust me by the last two episodes you will be up for the feels. \\n\\n\r\n     The Rakugo can get a little boring sometimes. Rakugo is a dying business and watching the characters struggle in the world of a dying art and trying to change with the times really gets to you. Rakugo has several different effects on each character, some love it,  some hate it but at the end Rakugo changes them to better or worse. \\n\\n\r\n      SGRS is also a story about finding yourself. You can at least find one character in the show you can relate to.  Each character struggles with trying to find themselves and a lot has to do with either the Era they were born in, the family they were born in or even their own gender. \\n\\n\r\n   I also am probably a little bias to SGRS because I do tend to like shows or movies that represent a certain time period and SGRS represents some of my favorite time periods the 40s and the 60s.\\n\\n\r\n   The art as well is very good. To others it may seem a bit different and you may even get a bit \"annoyed\"  with the random swirl on one of the character's nose. However where some may not like the character design most can agree the background animation is great. \\n\\n\\n\r\n     The music is also great as well. Music to me plays a big part in film and animation. Music itself can easily influence your emotions by the tone of the music. SGRS has some of the best music I have ever heard. \\n\\n\r\n    Well I better end this before it turns into a novel and I start typing random stuff on here that makes no sense due to me being  half asleep .  So as a conclusion please give SGRS a chance I promise you by the first episode you won't regret it. I even forced my boyfriend to watch a few of the episodes and he kept going on about how it sounds boring and terrible and blah blah blah and by the end of the second episode he was asking me to show him more episodes. I guess that isn't a good reason if you don't really know my bf but trust me it means something since the dude can be an anime snob. Anyways take your seat on the one way trip to the feels where you will laugh, be pissed, cry etc. Trust me when I say by the time you finish this show you will love it.... I honestly think I may even like it a little more than  erased D:... Well I hope this helped a lot!",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu might be the most under recognized anime on this site. In my opinion, no show is more well-made in terms of directing, writing, and voice acting. It is rated extremely high on MAL, but its popularity remains extremely low. So why did I give it a 9/10, and why do people refuse to watch it? \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nRakugo, which is what the story is centered around, is a form of Japanese story-telling in which a lone storyteller gets on stage and tells a story with limited props and movement while creating the voices of different characters. The show succeeds the most inthis aspect, because this definitely sounds boring at first. But the brilliant directing and amazing voice acting brings each story to life and makes you feel like you are there watching the performance live. It does, however, require concentration on the viewers side to follow along with each story. But if you do concentrate, it\u2019s worth it.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual plot is also very appealing, as we see two Rakugo story tellers that are exact opposites grow up in the same household as they try to rise up in the Rakugo world. The story covers the two characters entire lives from early childhood until mid-life, and the fact that the story did not feel rushed despite being only 13 episodes is a testament to the good writing and pacing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t much to say about the art other than that it was solid. In season two, the art direction gets much more creative, but in season one, the animation stays consistent and crisp while creating some beautiful shots of old Japan. I would have liked to see more creativity in the visuals overall. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack manages to create the tone for the anime perfectly, which is sort of a creepy, old setting that makes you feel like you are in Japan. However, the lack of music/ost that you take away from the show is disappointing. While with some shows, just hearing a song can bring back tons of memories, there isn\u2019t really a song or ost like that in this show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters in the show are very hard to relate to, which brought down my overall enjoyment of the show from a 10 to a 9. The protagonist, Yakumo, is a shy, good looking boy who was forced into Rakugo in order to survive. He makes some decisions that are hard to understand, and many of the characters have a very old and backwards way of thinking, which is accurate for this age in Japan, but nevertheless makes the characters unlikeable. \\n\\n\r\nSukeroku is the most likeable character in the show who is the opposite of Yakumo, and the relationship between the two is nice to see. He is someone who not only wants to be a famous Rakugo performer, but wants to change the art form. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters overall being a bit disappointing is made up for by the story and direction, and looking ahead, the characters in season two are great, the plot gets even better, and the visuals are more creative. I\u2019m sure many people will disagree with me not liking the characters, but one thing is certain: Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is one of, if not the most well-made anime ever, and is a show that everyone should at least give a chance.",

The toppings look uninteresting but they're actually extremely interesting when given a chance and the flavour is so deep and meaningful that it hits you hard at some points. After taking a bite you will be looking at the pizza in shock and confusion and think \"How the hell is this so good? Why am Ienjoying this?\". Rakugo has a distinct taste with it and it's not for everyone but it's got a really nice aroma, texture and flavour to it. \\n\\n\r\nRakugo is the underrated pizza, it's the pizza with yogurt on it. For those willing to go out their comfort zone and for seekers of strange and unique experiences in taste, it's definitely a great pizza.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9/10\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n",

            "content": "Development and evolution are part of the human nature, yet most people are unable to control or predict the course it will take.  Shouwa Genroku Rakugo cleverly explores this by presenting the audience with two almost polar opposite protagonists. Yakumo on one hand represents the ideal pupil that tries to follow in his master\u2019s footsteps and Sukeroku who in contrast is an overly talented pupil who doesn\u2019t hesitate in contradicting his master. \r\nTheir styles of learning also vary greatly, while Yakamo prefers to take a more formal approach by reading and repeatedly reciting his stories. Sukeroku on the other hand prefers to attend thepub or brothel and tell stories from real life experiences; this unorthodox approach is the reason why his opinions and ideas vary greatly from the rest of the rakugo community.\\n\\n\r\nSuggestions of change are not always welcomed/accepted in well-established fields as they present a sense of unease and insecurity. The field of rakugo appears to flourish after the war bringing laughter and entrainment to people\u2019s lives; yet the development of technology on the other hand brings new methods of entertainment which rises in popularity at an alarming rate. Illustrating how the development of technology brings fragility to well-established areas, will crumble unless it manages to develop accordingly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a very enjoyable anime that explores some mature themes.\\n",

Most people would read the synopsis but I don't (well sometime I do XD) and when I started watching the anime I was surprised and I wondered \"how the hell can you make an anime interesting if it's about story telling?\" so I dropped it after the first episode when it was still airing and when the series finished I had nothing to watch so I picked it up again and boy was I surprised the seriessomehow make it interesting till the end and GOD the story are  characters are good.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\\n\r\n10 really!?!\\n\r\nWell personally I would give it a 9.4 but I rounded it to 10 because 9 is not quite enough for this amazing piece of entertainment the story is well paced and not repetitive unlike my initial thought, the story will become very interesting at around episode 3-4 but don't skip the beginning even if it's a tad bit boring because there is lot of useful information about the art of \"Rakugo\" there is not much to say about the story without ctrl+v the synopsis.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - 7\\n\\n\r\nOne of the big downside of the anime is the art but in no mean is it bad it's just lacking of style it's very generic, the character design is good the only bad thing is the animation it's decent at best the could've been a lot better it sometimes feels very choppy.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nSound is very good the op is to be desired I just skip it because it's not good\\n\r\nand the ending also is not great (I just skip them both) the ost is great lot's of edo era music pieces.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\\n\r\nEvery character is unique and you will develop feeling and empathy with them, there are no very generic character apart from one wich I won't mention because this is a spoiler free review.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement - 9 \\n\\n\r\nThis anime was a good surprised and definitely my top pick for this season I would recommend to watch and even read the manga + season is coming and I'am very hyped.",

            "content": "Some time ago I was thinking that anime was lacking a good show with historical premise, and then Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu arrived. Considered by many the underrated gem of this season, it has undoubtedly become on a smart and beautiful masterpiece.   \r\nWhile the story starts with Yotarou, an ex-convict, begging for the opportunity to become Yakumo's trainee in the hope to become in a rakugoka someday, the real plot develops when Yakumo starts to tell the story of his life. From this point we embark on a trip full of irony, rawness and above all karma. The topics covered in the showare realistic and adapted to the period in which it develops, and although never seems to be any unexpected twist, near the end there are some revelations that will make fit some pieces that did not seem important at first. The way in which Rakugo is introduced, is efficient, making it shine artistically, but while still being entertaining. Despite its historical and artistic theme, it never holds on unnecessary symbolism or abstract art to seem more interesting than it is. A great story is not the most complicated, is which has control over its plot, knows how to give it a good closure yet still manages to be entertaining, and Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu meets and exceeds that purpose.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if the story is already great, the characters are no less. Kikuhiko (Yakumo) and Sukeroku, the main characters, are two guys who had to go through several difficulties in their childhood, and learn Rakugo under the lessons of the 7th generation Yakumo is presented as an opportunity to continue their life. Although with different initial perspectives on the Rakugo and despite their opposite personalities, both end up with the same ambition to become Shin'uchi. The main repertoire is strong, but the secondary still manage to shine with characters like Miyokichi, a woman who depends on men to be happy or the aforementioned 7th generation Yakumo, a master with many secrets under his rank. There is not a single stereotyped character, each one of them has a definite personality and the luxury of developing a backstory which allows us to understand the reasons for their actions. However, the icing on the cake is the very accomplished interactions between all of them.\\n\\n\r\nBut the strengths of the show do not end there. The art is well drawn, directed and embodied, with an ambitious atmosphere and a beautiful and cared color palette that highlights the details of each scene. The character design is simple but detailed enough to give personality to each character and their animation is smooth yet dynamic when they interpreting the various Rakugo stories. The sound proposal is a masterful blend between traditional Japanese music and jazz. The compositions of Ringo and Kane are outstanding and the Japanese musical instruments used as taiko, biwa, fue and other ones are several, but the overall sound does not feel overproduced, it's entirely organic and suits the show in an impressive way. The opening is a pleasant piece of jazz sung by Miyokichi's voice actress and the ending is an instrumental track that closes every episode on a melancholic note. The voice actors also do a quality job, although it is expected with big names such as Akira or Megumi in the repertoire.\\n\\n\r\nStellar in all its nuances, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is not just a highlight of the season, but of anime itself and deserves every second, every minute of your time and attention.\\n",

I hate this specific narrative device just as much now as when i first encountered it in Tenjou Tenge, but I like this series despite the way it cucks you in the beginning.\r\nGive it a go, just don't expect to get to know the guy you first think is the main character, he's actually a side character. \r\nThis would be my complaint; you don't get to know anything about him, he might as well be a piece of smiling cardboard. His achievements alienate me somewhat from him, because the rest of the series continue to point out thestagering amount of work his predecessors had to put in to become good at what they do, and then he just *magicaly* achieves their level without any noticable struggle. We don't get to see him practicing or failing or doing anything remotely characterbuilding. And this makes me fear the second season. If it turns him into the main character, then i fear i'll be let down because the first season spent all of it's time on a different set of characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, the characters are very lovable, and the story is mostly believable. It's a 7 approaching 8. Worth watching.",

            "content": "I have a soft spot for shows like this. Similar to another one of my favorites, Bakuman, this is a show about artists and storyteller, and as a self-proclaimed storyteller I find it much easier to attach myself to the show. Aside from personal bias, however, this show quickly rose to one of my all time favorites by merit alone. As a note I will refer to the show as Rakugo, since the name is super long and all.\r\nI don't know what musky dungeon Studio Deen was keeping the team that made this and several other brilliant anime from the past few seasons, but whereverit is they need to keep them down their so they can keep pumping them out. The craftsmanship that went into this is beyond what I've seen in quite a while, mixing visual and audial elements in a masterful blend. Rakugo has a lot of things going for it, but I'll only touch on a few since I'm lazy and don't really want to write too much. So I'll keep it down to the character, dialogue, and storytelling performance . \\n\\n\r\nTo start, the character work in this show is amazing. There is only a handful of main characters and each have a wonderful chemistry with each other that makes all of their interactions spark with such energy and emotion you can't help but get caught up in it all. Their personalities are all fairly distinct from each other, some working well together and others clashing. In either case you never really feel like you're dealing with just characters in the show. They all have a realness in their complexity, all of them bringing their own ingredients to the big melting pot of drama. \\n\\n\r\nIt's this drama where I think this show's strongest point lies. Especially in the dialogue. Thank the nippon gods that this show does not fall into the same hole shows like this, and other anime, fall into. The hole of shitty, expository dialogue. It's really for a show like this to make that mistake, too. When you have so many characters dealing with all of these different problems it's easy to be a lazy writer and just the characters explain it in a way that's stilted and bland. Rakugo, however, has a great mix of visual story telling and realistic dialogue that give you everything you need to know. If a character has beef with another they don't exclaim what it is so the viewer understands right away. The show invests time to build tension, to reveal the complexities of characters and the story over time in such a way where you are invested in the characters and understand things from multiple angles in a way that you don't find too often. \\n\\n\r\nAll of this wouldn't be possible without the great writers, but also not without the voice actors being as top quality as they are. This really comes through in the Rakugo scenes. To be brief, Rakugo is a traditional Japanese Storytelling art-form similar to one-man plays. There is a singular storyteller who engages the audience with a story, typically with some moral, and the only restrictions are that they must be sitting and their only prop is a fan. With that out of the way, Rakugo shows off it's stuff during these scenes. Watching a character sit down and tell a story could easily be made incredibly boring, but amazingly enough the show manages to make each performance breathtakingly engaging to the point where you can just feel the quality of the performance.\\n\\n\r\nTheir use of dynamic angles, music, and lighting enthralls the viewer to the point where you just kind of forget that you are watching a story within a story. The voice actors themselves do an incredible job of acting as another character acting as well. Keeping the original characters personality through their performance.  The quality gets to the point where you can actually tell if someone is doing \"good Rakugo\", as the show likes to call it, just by watching it. Almost as if you were actually watching someone performing it, crazy idea I know. \\n\\n\r\nNow all of this isn't to say this show doesn't have its flaws, because it does. The story itself, though amazing, is a bit slow at times. Whether this be through the necessity of proper storytelling or just natural slumps in it, it does have it's moments where you are just crawling through an episode. And since it is a drama that is heavily reliant upon dialogue and visual storytelling, I'm sorry to tell you that it's VERY talking heavy. But hey, what else would you suspect. \\n\\n\r\nAs of now only season 1 is out, which focused a lot on the backstory of a few characters rather than some of the newer characters in the show. I understand that quite a few people had some problems with that, but personally I enjoyed that part of the story anyway and I felt that the context was very much needed. Season 2 promises to move on with the story of the current characters, and with some juicy cliffhangers and a heart wrenching final scene. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this series gets a...9.8/10 for. Not perfect, like I said it has it's slumps. But really it's such a great show, and a particularly favorite topic for me, that I can't help but love every moment of it.\\n\\n\r\nTrash, but oh so close to perfect. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Mastuda is best girl.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is such a good show. If you're curious, on the fence, or wonder why this is such a high-rated anime despite having and odd premise (like I was), then I 100% recommend this anime. Go watch it now and see how good it is.\r\nThe show has incredible characters, a complex (yet easily understandable) plot, and shows a realistic portrayal of a enthralling comedic art form (Rakugo) exclusive to Japan. The story is such an intriguing narrative, and just as you get comfortable, or think that the episode is just there as filler or padding, they hit you with some crazy plotelement/twist out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, animation, art, and overall sound design are top-notch. Nothing that necessarily stuck out while watching. However, when looking back, I realized that they really did do a great job with everything, but it's just that the plot and characters are what really grab your attention and take center stage.\\n\\n\r\nI won't go into the plot, because I know that if someone tried to convince me to watch this particular show by describing the plot to me, I would disregard their recommendation out of sheer boredom of the premise. Instead, just trust me that this show is well produced, and incredibly well written. I never thought I would like a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe only anime that I can think of that resembles this one is March Comes in like a Lion. There are a lot of similarities to be drawn between the two shows, but let's just say that if you like one, then you'll probably like the other.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: 10/10 incredible show.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING - SPOILERS BELOW - ONLY READ IF YOU HAVE SEEN ALL OF THE ANIME\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere couldn't have been a better ending. I wouldn't especially mind if they had continued the story of the two siblings in a 3rd season, but this ending really wraps things up perfectly. It's really cool to see an anime that shows the full life of the main character all the way up until their death, as well as the impact they had on others after their death.\\n\r\nMy ONLY critique is that I didn't really like the afterlife parts, as the rest of the show was totally normal and realistic, but suddenly things got supernatural. However, the supernatural parts were still good and relevant. Plus they only lasted like 2 episodes out of both seasons, so I'm willing to let it slide.",

            "content": "The life of artists is not always portrayed accurately in works of fiction, so watching Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu do it well was incredibly refreshing. I will be abbreviating the title as SGRS from time to time.\r\nSummary: Be warned, this series is not for everyone. It is extremely dialogue-heavy, and does not baby the viewer. This being said, if attention is paid, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is an incredibly moving and resonant tale about life, sacrifice, and persistence.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nMost of the 13 episodes are flashbacks from the perspective of the protagonist, Bon/Kiku/Yakumo 8th. He details his trials and tribulations along his journey in becoming oneof the most influential Rakugo performers in the world, a multi-decade-long journey. The drama that is shown is some of anime's best, in terms of quality and enjoyability, and is done in a way that may make the viewer forget it is fiction for a time. SGRS takes a simple premise, runs with it, and never looks back.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\n The art style and animation quality, while not groundbreaking, was of high quality throughout each episode. This is especially true for the character designs. Facial expressions are exceptional in portraying emotion, the stylistic diversity of the main cast leaves nothing to be desired, and each character's design matches perfectly with their voice. This, coupled with subtle use of background scenes and colors to convey tone or foreshadow, earns SGRS a 10/10 for Art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nBoth music and voice acting are of the utmost importance in Slice of Life series, and SGRS absolutely delivers in both categories. As far as Voice Acting goes, voices match character designs well, the voice actors deliver elegantly in dramatic scenes, and they make Rakugo entertaining, even to those who are not familiar with it (at least, in my experience.) The jazz-inspired OST, ED and OP all match the tone of the show well, and are quite catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nNot much to say here without giving anything away, but if the characters feel like real people, I have absolutely nothing to complain about in regards to character development. Each one feels unique, complex and complex, especially Sukeroku and Kiku.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nMy experience as a drummer and actor in my younger years made the process of learning Rakugo relatable, and made it rewarding when they succeeded. Seeing their interpersonal drama was an absolute treat, though it felt a bit slow at times. This being said, it was never difficult to watch, and nothing felt too insignificant to sit through. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu shines as an enthralling drama, and is a refreshing change of pace from typical anime. The art is gorgeous, the cast and music fit the narrative perfectly, and the characters felt extremely well-developed.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is one of the standout anime of Winter 2016. This anime is definitely not for everyone specially not for those who don\u2019t like Josei-drama thing.\r\nStory: The story takes place world war II era. It\u2019s a story about A man\u2019s journey of becoming country\u2019s one of the most renowned rakugo master (basically you can say it\u2019s about story teller). Not often you can see a drama-josei story pretty charming. So, in a statement I can say, the plot is pretty much simple. However, the execution was PERFECT and I mean absolute PERFECT. \r\nArt & Animation: The art was pretty good and easyon the eye. The animation is at its best. Credit definitely goes to Studio DEEN. \\n\\n\r\nVoice Performance: Not that, you can see this section often in a review but I definitely had to say something about the voice performance because you watch the series, the voice performance is very critical. Akira Ishida (it was also heard he has recorded it one take) and Kouichi Yamadera has done a outstanding job to fully bring out characters perfectly itself. \\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound: In two words absolutely beautiful. It\u2019s just fit perfectly with the environment of the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: There are definitely some characters that are stands out for what their purpose is. There are good characters, bad characters, stupid characters and each character had done their purpose very well, like I said before the seiyuu performance is absolutely top notch about bringing the personality.   \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: All I had done in this review is praising how good Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is and there are simply no negatives that I had talked about. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu will become one of the best series in coming years. Words can\u2019t describe how good this anime is, you just have to watch it and see for yourself. \\n",

            "content": "I made a video: you can find it at my YouTube channel \"BasementOtaku\"\r\nVideo Script:\r\nShowa Genroku Rakugo Shinju (9/10): Holy buckets a 9 out of 10?! More information on my rating system is in the video description. Now it is time to slip on verbiage as I begin a potentially spoiler filled review. \r\nTo tell you the truth I dropped this show after its first episode. It was awful, the premise was intriguing and the thug who appeared to be the main character was new, I love most shows in older time periods but IT WAS SO SLOW! The pace was that of molasses, slowly drippingbefore my eyes, I just couldn\u2019t continue to watch it. It is still an amazing show, but if you don\u2019t want to suffer through the first episode the basic information you need to know is that an old story teller is showing us his past after taking in a student for the first time. He has lives with a young woman who is the daughter of his now dead friend who blames blames him for her father's death. That is all you really need to get out of the first episode. Now back to the review, I figured the history of the old master would take a few episodes and didn\u2019t like what I saw. Lucky for me other more dedicated anime viewers watched the show in its entirety and sung its praises so I had to take a look. Man am I glad I did! This show is similar to Berserk in that its history arc is a fantastic story on its own and even knowing this show has a second season planned I am would be happy with the offering given. I haven\u2019t seen a story have such a gratifying build up with characters that felt this real in a long time. It looks amazing, it sounds even better and the payoff is spectacular. Now I am seriously torn because I want to give this show a 10 out of 10 rating but the fact that the first episode was so repulsive and that the show takes awhile to pick up its pace has me docking it the one point. I understand that the show was most likely trying to be faithful to the manga but the first episode should have been tighter, and I believe adapting it to fit a 24 minute time slot would have been for the best. In the end it was a show that made me think, it made me reflect on my own life and the cruelty of existence, being kind enough to give me a good cry or two along the way.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is a great choice for you if you think you'd enjoy a series that criticizes tradition and the inability or unwillingness to adapt to the progress of civilization.\r\nFirst, let me explain what rakugo is since we're westerners. You see, the show follows rakugo, which is a theatrical japanese performance told by a performer. Traditionally there's only one person telling a single story on stage while acting out all the characters. It's one of those dying out industries which couldn't adapt to modern day standards of entertainment which are varied and easier to access than before, relying on its traditionalism to carryout its greatness.\\n\\n\r\nSo since there's plenty of people who might be like, oh it's about this niche thing in japan, sounds fucking boring, rakugo, the practice, and Rakugo, the anime, put great value in storytelling and the Rakugo, the anime, has the courage to criticize the fact that the practice was unwilling to apparently adapt to modern times. So even if it sounds like something boring, it is aware of how much of a niche thing it is and exactly why people don't look up to it. Which is something very easy to respect for me.\\n\\n\r\nThere's one thing that might be damaging to the anime's storytelling performance though, and that is the fact that it starts with an episode in the present day and then afterwards goes on telling 95% of its remaining story before said present day. You see the natural expectations of a viewer here would be that you'd find out what happened in an episode or maybe a few more and then the story would pick up from the current day with the things its presented and with the apparent main character it had tinkered in the first episode. Due to the natural expectations of a story that uses flashbacks, you might have some of your enjoyment killed by thinking the story's is supposed to be in the present day since chronologically that's how we started and that's the relevant part, since why the fuck would you start the story with what's not relevant, but let me explain why the show has chosen to do what it did and why it is relevant.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason Rakugo chose to present its first episode with the current day situation rather than follow the events chronologically from the very start is to direct your gaze towards what's important to observe in the actual story. Basically think of what you'd think when you'd ask your grandpa who fought in Nam who lost his arm there, \"Grandpa, how'd you lose your arm?\". You know what the story is gonna be about, you know what to expect from the story. You will expect a story about what made him how he is and why he is how he is right now. Well, that's the kind of story Rakugo is going to tell. And that's why it's important you see the current day situation. So you can ask your grandpa how he lost his arm in the war.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, Rakugo had the strongest sense of storytelling in anything I've ever watched in animated form. I've doubted it sometimes when some scenes seem pointless or that they only drag out what is happening, but I admit that I was pretty fucking wrong. Pretty much everything that I saw dragging its feet across absolutely payed off in fleshing out the characters and fleshing out the message that I took away from all this. I ultimately felt satisfied because nothing seemed like it went to waste or was unsensical from the story's perspective and it felt very much like a complete story, with a beginning, a middle and an end, arguably told in that order, and it carried out a point and presented real relatable and if not, completely understandable characters from their point of view and that of the time things took place in.\\n\\n\r\nLet me exemplify the compliment I've given the story by talking a bit about its theme which is progression. If you want to take what I said for granted, you can skip this paragraph, since I'm gonna talk a bit about the direction some characters are going to take, which you might want to be in the dark on, however, since from the very first episode Rakugo does exactly that itself, as well as with its title, I promise I'll at least be more reserved than the series itself. As I've said, the story criticizes traditionalism and unwillingness to change, having as a theme progression. This becomes especially prevalent early in the story when the current day master gets taken in by HIS rakugo Master to train him in the arts of rakugo. He used to practice dancing before that and due to the fact his leg got fucked up he could never dance again. How is this following in the theme of progression? You see, a man dancing is frowned upon since it's something done traditionally by women. This set high prejudice on the young master since he can't possibly be part of this tradition and he's forced to progress through life with a practice he has no passion for and his real passion was taken from him. In addition to this he was pretty much abandoned through his apprenticeship assignment to rakugo, so this sets a kid all alone with total strangers, forced to practice for a job he doesn't even like. The young master has to adapt to his current life since this is the bad situation he was thrown in, with which he feels he has no control over. (PS: I'm refering to him as young master due to the fact this character will have many names in the series and the confusion that might be inflicted to you due to this is far less than the possible confusion that might be inflicted if I refered by one random name of his.) Then in contrast to him, there's a stray kid, one who actually wants to do rakugo and is absolutely passionate about it, who has absolutely nothing and came to ask for an apprenticeship from the young master's master. His passion for rakugo is obvious and he's actually quite talented at it. Alike the young master, he also has nothing left and lost pretty much everything he had valuable in his life, but unlike the young master, he still has a passion. They end up growing up as brothers, the series showing how they view each other, how they take for granted what they have and how much they would wish they would have the strengths and life the other person did. The series shows the complex they've developed as a result of getting close to one another as a result of how they adapted. The series makes you understand the circumstances through which their relationship begins, how their relationship has impacted both of them, and what was the end result of their relationship. Everything in the story is like this. Everything in the story has a point. Everything in the story fleshes out who the young master has become. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I don't want to be overwhelmingly positive, since that always makes me skeptical of the person presenting me the show. So I'll also say what you might dislike about it. My first worry while watching Rakugo was that I might not like the theatrical performances since something that is intended to be traditionally japanese doesn't really follow my interests. However I was positively impressed with the first few rakugo shows in the series, and not as interested with the others. The series somehow picked out the best performances to attract me into its audience, with some comical performances and a more serious story in the mix which made me understand how this can be enjoyable and made me respect it. It would've been very difficult for me to enjoy Rakugo anywhere as much as it is, or maybe even at all, if this wouldn't have had happened. If you don't like theatrical performances by default, I don't expect you to find enough respect for the series to admire it. So I'd say it is dependent on your first impression as an audience, so it's not impossible that you might be unimpressed by the performances themselves. The later performances don't get worse, they're entertaining, but they serve a purpose more than they are meant to be entertaining, showcasing where the characters are at. Another thing you might dislike is the pace, especially if you expect the series to get to present time at any point in time. The series might seem like it drags on since you might not be invested in the present situation or thinking too much of it. And it's not something you can help since it is more rewarding later and seemingly pointless at times since it's build up. Another possible thing that might make you dislike Rakugo is the aforementioned preset expectation of \"if this story takes place in present time, everything important must happen in the present time\" but hopefully I cleared that off right off the bat so it wouldn't have much of an effect on you. Other than these things, there's not a lot of things that could completely kill your enjoyment, except if you don't like what the story fundamentally has to offer, which is a drama and an insight into the fall from grace of an industry with less and less attendants or its setting of Japan after WW2 after the invasion of Manchuria due to their mentality back then or anything of the sort, but even then I'd say the modernization of the world is an enemy to their day old mentality, so I can't say I see the setting as a specific obstacle.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it could also be that you might find the artstyle a bit monotone, the show isn't really in your face about anything and it chooses to take a more realistic and mellow approach to things, reflected in its musical choices with jazzy and traditionally sounding japanese mostly comprising the soundtrack. It fits the chilled out nature of a theatric show visually and the sound also creates the right atmosphere for that too . I'd say it is even ambitious at times with some shots given from a perspective that is clearly harder to animate than just drawing the characters talking from a close-up perspective or anything of the sort, with also taking its time to animate the audience, the spectators, the different facial expressions expressed in the flash of a moment of a character at the performances and so on and so forth, even if it would be easier to just focus on the performance itself. It puts a great deal of detail into what it does. Just like you'd expect. Otherwise, there's nothing I can think of complaining about, the voice acting department does a great job, artistically it does a pretty good job and everything else you've had an insight of how much I've enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately I thought Rakugo was a great story about the progression of an industry represented through a good dramatic story about how the constantly shifting times have affected these people and how they had to adapt to their circumstances. If you're looking for anything like this, Rakugo will not dissapoint, it has a tragic story that might feel a bit ridiculous if you don't know what the title does translate to, the build up to it is great, the insight and parallels to drive into the industry are plentiful and the characters are respectable and understandable. I was very satisfied with the story, and if you think you'd like anything of the sort of what I've just described, you should give it a try. But again, don't feel compelled to do so just because I've enjoyed it a lot. Take in what I've said, I might be blind to some of its flaws due to how much I've liked it, case in which I'd like to find out what are said flaws. I've been dissapointed by shows before due to how positive of an opinion people had of various series and I'd hate it if I would fit in that category in your case. I thought it was a great story, but will it interest you? Think about that question before following through on my suggestion. If you think the answer is yes, then I wholeheartedly recommend it then.",

            "content": "*Disclaimer* \r\nJust personal scratch. \r\nAdvised, possible spoilers. \r\nOpinion & Informal\r\nArt: 6/10 Mature style. Standard anatomy. Casual-realistic art style. It was good, but not impressive. There was nothing done art-wise that deserves any note. No panoramic shots or nature impact scenes. There were no impact shots used at all. Clean and crisp, but no real detail in the art or scenery. \r\nAnimation: 7/10 Nothing to complain about but nothing to praise either. No impact scenes or animation at all. Standard movements and frame use. Heavy use of cut-less shots, but surprisingly fit into what the show was going for so it's not a minus. Movements wereabout average. No impressive fluidity or flair, considering this show makes a point of Rakugo having an element of how important the mannerisms of the storyteller are...for as much as this show did in glorifying Rakugo it didn't exactly use any impact-animations to show off any of these so-called impressive mannerisms. To be clear it did show off Rakugo mannerisms, but the problem is is that there wasn't a single scene that had any impressive __animation__ showing this off. That's why the animation score for this show is only average-good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 Characters were well done. The main cast seemed very human. I'm sure any viewer could find at least one semblance of relatability to any of the characters. I personally found black-haired MC relatable on more than one account. The dynamics between the main cast was done very well too...how certain characters would act as each other's support, rival, motivation, object of envy, and mode of reconcile were all done...done well...believable...Well, I'm just particularly surprised at how well the main characters were fleshed out in what is only a thirteen episode show. This show didn't really go for the cute-factor so none of the girls were cute or likable because there was pretty much only one or two recurring girls in this show; the midget and the Geisha lady. This show was pretty much only about the two male leads only and what it so great about that is that both of them are actually likable (to me personally) and, again, relatable in one way or another. I can believe their dynamics. I can believe their doubt. I can believe their anger. Yada yada yada... They're just believable. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10 Aside from that main jazz theme. There wasn't any real noticeable bgm in this show that clicked. This show was about Rakugo so the lack of interesting bgm can be easily overlooked. The jazz theme alone was enough to hype up certain scenes or add flair to others. The OP and ED were about average, didn't really invoke any deep feelings or help to add to the show's style. The sound design was neat at a few moments. There was some clever use of sound to add some impact and get a certain type of mood going, but nothing that would make this area a highlight. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 6/10 Not much to say. I found the overall plot boring and standard. It's just the relationship between two men, how they push each other forward and how they go on with their lives. The twist with this show is that it's all about Rakugo. Please, if I see the word Rakugo one more time...Oh, there's a second season...\\n\\n\r\nDevelopment: 10/10 This. The development hit all the marks that I was looking for to make me not find this show a bore. Can't really put it into words, but I just personally liked how the two MC dudes relationship developed and how the rest of the cast such as the kiddo, Geisha lady, and the various Masters did their part in developing both the MC's as individuals. I should write more here, but I can't bring what I want to say to mind.  \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 6/10 An ending-setup for S2. Not really impressed with the conclusion. Did happen to answer some questions, conclude the Master's (white-hair'd dude now) story, and setup the story for the new kid. The fact that this was a blatant S2 ending setup sorta got on my nerves. At least just give it a proper open-ended ending at least even if S2 is a guaranteed happening. The ending was abrupt and left a bad taste in my mouth. Just my personal gripe. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 7/10 I honestly dislike realistic, down-to-earth shows like this because I prefer watching wild, anime-esque fantasy...giant robots, cute girls, super powers, etc. Honestly surprised I liked this as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 Surprised at this myself. Thought it was going to be a bore. Character and story development were what really shined in this show and are what saved my opinion of it. \\n\\n\r\nHype Factor: No hype moments.\\n\\n\r\nLewd/Service Factor: Mature teasing. Other than that no lewd or service. \\n\\n\r\nCute Factor: The midget kid was sorta cute, but only because that's just how anime works in regards to midgets. Zero cute factor. \\n\\n\r\nArtsy Factor: This is artsy. Good storytelling found here. Very interesting mode of conveying character feelings and development through Rakugo performances.\\n\\n\r\nStyle Factor: Style != Artsy. Style more along the lines of unconventionality either in animation or storytelling. Some style found here, but not much. Standard recounting of past story.\\n\\n\r\nAction Factor: No action found here. \\n\\n\r\nRevised: 9-5-18 at 11:11 PST",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is one of the most refreshing anime to come out it recent times. Before it aired, many had average expectations for this anime due to its niche premise and somewhat uninteresting key visual. However, with the series ending, many can agree that this is easily one of the best anime of the season. It\u2019s not just the characters in the anime that tell a story using their rakugo, but the anime itself too with their characters. This anime sets a standard for character studying in anime and it\u2019s so satisfying. The genre and content may not be for everyone, but nonetheless,it\u2019s a really well written series. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is easily the dark horse of the season.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe story focuses on Yuurakutei \u201cKikuhiko\u201d Yakumo and his life as a rakugo performer. It shows how his life was before he got successful and how he came to be. You see from his point of view on certain aspects of his past and how he copes with them. First of all, the plot is just a backbone for its characters. Besides the unique premise on focusing on a niche topic like rakugo, everything else doesn\u2019t sound to special, We\u2019ve seen many different stories on a man\u2019s journey on how he became successful, but Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu embraces this plot structure and uses it as its frame for its characters. The things that happen to Kikuhiko and the way he deals with them is impressive. The story stars off with telling you the ending, and you\u2019re just seeing everything unfold. You know the outcome so it should still be predictable, yet when the climax happens, your still on the edge of you seats. If that\u2019s not good writing, I don\u2019t know what is. The way the story unravels, the way multiple tones are used throughout the series, the way you see these characters develop, it\u2019s just marvelous. And knowing that we\u2019ve only seen half of it, and there\u2019s a second half, I couldn\u2019t be more satisfied. \\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nAs a mentioned before, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, uses its plot to support the characters, rather than using the characters to support its plot. This makes this series a character-focused series and its done so well. The somewhat non-linear structure of the series is also a nice option. First you see the present Kikuhiko, the older one. Then you jump back to his past to see how he became such a person. This is a smart choice because the series already tells you what he turns out to be, but the thrill comes from how became like this, what did he goes through. It interesting to keep in out mindset the final outcome, and seeing how these pieces fit together. Very smart structure indeed. Would it have been nice if the story jumped back and forth between the past and present, I\u2019m not sure, but the anime worked very well the way it is. The dialogues in the anime are really good too as they improve on the character relations. The series is slow-paced, but it adds to the relaxation. However, the early episodes aren\u2019t as interesting because of the pacing. Also, the anime is filled with a good amount of rakugo performances. These moments are very entertaining and it\u2019s nice to feel like an audience at times. However, these rakugo performances aren\u2019t used to showcase the characters\u2019 skills, but rather to show how they feel and what their sanity is. A very good example would be the Shinigami story Kikuhiko tells near the latter half of the story, it shows how he can use such a twisted story that relates to something tragic that happened in his real life. It showed how he as a character not only got better at rakugo, but lost a bit of his humanity. This mind-blowing development was done by a rakugo performance, just one! My only tiny gripe might be that some of the performances drag out a little too long, and it wants you to go back to seeing more of the story. Other than that, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu did a fantastic job here. \\n\r\nPresentation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe best thing about Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is its characters. It not just the characters and how they change, nor is it the interactions they have with one another, but rather it the realism these characters bring. Every character in every way is fantastically written. First of all, Kikuhiko is one of the best written characters I\u2019ve seen in a long time. The way he changes as a character was fantastic. What first started out to be a social introvert who looks at rakugo in one way and one way only, slow starts to become a character who realizes the diversity in rakugo, how there\u2019s different styles to choose from, and how creating bonds with other people made him stronger. It\u2019s not like he started off flawed and ended up flawless. No, he still ends up being a flawed character, and that\u2019s exactly why he\u2019s so damn realistic. The other main character of this series, Shin, isn\u2019t as well developed as Kikuhiko (because the anime really is about just him), but even though he\u2019s not our protagonist, he\u2019s still very well developed. The doesn\u2019t change too much throughout the series and that\u2019s a good thing. From beginning to end, he ended up sticking to his ideals and believes. This shows how consistent of a character he was. There are some slight developments he gets at the end that shows how he did change a bit (which I don\u2019t want to spoil), and that shows the flaw he has, that he couldn\u2019t always be consistent. And other supporting characters like Konatsu, Yotarou, Miyokichi all get fine development to add some realism to their characters. They don\u2019t need to be likeable characters, but they are well written characters. However, the real star of the show is Kikuhiko and Shin\u2026 mostly Kikuhiko.\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThis might just be Studio Deen\u2019s most polished art to date. To simply put it, it\u2019s fantastic. The character designs are really interesting. The way Kikuhiko and Shin looks really matches their personalities so its seeing these two characters together as they create some sort of contrast. The backgrounds, is not only impressive by Deen standards, but by anime standards in general. The backgrounds are very well detailed. What\u2019s even better is the architecture designs, as they have so much detailing to them. The color palette is restricted to colors with lower contrast and it really does improve the mood. Also the facial expressions made in the anime are very realistic and very well chosen for its situations. Overall, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is Deen\u2019s best art work to date.\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nStudio Deen not only manages to make the art much better compared to their standards, but they managed to keep consistent, good animations that looks better than a lot of other anime today. Not once was there a quality hiccup. The character movements are fluid and fantastic. During the Rakugo scenes, there\u2019s a lot of character movements, such as hand gestures and expression changes, and they were all done really well. It made me feel like I was watching a real rakugo performance. The background animations aren\u2019t too special though. At times it does feel a little static, but it\u2019s fine. But overall, the animation in Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is very consistent and it complements the art. \\n\r\nAnimation: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nFor an anime about rakugo, you would expect some fine voice acting. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu doesn\u2019t disappoint. The cast itself is really impressive, especially since there\u2019s a lot of well-known old school seiyuu here. Ishida Akira is perfect as Kikuhiko. Ishida is a talented seiyuu no doubt, and he uses all of his talent in the role. He manages to depict the flawed character flawlessly. The way he was able to present this character and change his tones as the character changed his actions was great. Also, during the rakugo scenes, Ishida manages to make Kikuhiko look like a completely different character, one who is either constricted or one who is in character. Yamadera Kouichi, who is another talented seiyuu from the past, does an excellent job as Shin. This may be one of his most unique roles he\u2019s done since he does more calm characters, but he manages to do Shin\u2019s voice in delight. Hayashibara Megumi, who is another talented seiyuu, did a fine job as Miyokichi. Seki Tomokazu and Kobayashi Yuu also did really good with their characters, even if their characters didn\u2019t play a big role in this season (but will in the next season). The amount of enthusiasm the seiyuu put in the rakugo performances is just brilliant. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nAnother thing that really shines in Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is its music. It really shines due to its uniqueness and how it matched the series. The OP, \u201cUsurai Shinjuu\u201d, is really catchy, while being mysterious at the same time. Hayashibara\u2019s vocals in the OP are haunting and soothing at the same time and it really makes a good mood for the series. The ED, \u201cKawa, Taredoki\u201d, is strictly okay. It doesn\u2019t have any vocals, but the jazz music is somewhat soothing. The background music used is top-notch. At times the anime uses traditional Japanese music, primarily the use of shamisen, and it really increases the mood, especially during rakugo scenes. Also the use of jazz at times is really nice, as it complements how Japan started to become more modern during those eras. \\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nTo be honest, I never expected myself to enjoy Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu as much as I did. The key visuals made me think that this anime is not for me. I couldn\u2019t be happier when I was surprised from this. The thing I got the most from this series was these characters as they felt so human and so well developed. The way Kikuhiko developed as a character was so entertaining to watch. Plus, the rakugo scenes, which are bundled with fantastic voice acting, are really entertaining, even is a couple of them turn out to be a little too long. The production values are not only outstanding by Studio Deen\u2019s standards, but by this season\u2019s standards too. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu ended up to be the biggest surprise of this season as it gave us such memorable characters and such good presentation. It\u2019s non-linear structure in terms of storytelling was a really smart choice. And the way the anime presented its flawed characters flawlessly was fantastic. Kikuhiko\u2019s development as a character is the true star of this series. And the fact that there\u2019s an entire half of a story left to tell is really exciting. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu might not be for everyone, but it\u2019s definitely worth a try because just like the main characters, this anime\u2019s got a story to tell. \\n\\n\r\n+ A fascinating story about a man\u2019s journey in society and how he changes as person.\\n\r\n+ Kikuhiko\u2019s development as a character is astonishing \\n\r\n+ Very entertaining rakugo performances that are used to showcase the inner feelings of the characters\\n\r\n+ Its non-linear structure, with them starting off at the ending of the season was a smart decision\\n\r\n+ Fantastic voice acting from the cast, especially Ishida Akira as Kikuhiko\\n\r\n- First two or three episodes are a tad bit slower than the rest of the series\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10",

            "content": "Stories within stories within stories. Outside of the captivating rakugo performances told in distinct styles, this show offers an intergenerational character drama showing how the course of one's life can lead one to become bitter or give up on the best part of oneself. The show accomplishes its goal superbly, and the only negative things I could say about it would involve how much that goal appeals to me. The story by its nature involves a lot of pettiness and focuses on interpersonal relationships rather than war, politics or philosophy. The only humor is what arises naturally in such a complex bringing-to-life of the characters'experiences, with some help from a few lively characters. It did suit my taste that sexuality was treated as a normal part of life and not in the cringey way anime stereotypically portray it. This is an anime you could recommend to your mother\u2014in a good way.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu doesn't have the most unique premise, I'm sure you can find similar stuff in many places if you replace Rakugo with something else. However, just like it is in Rakugo, the way the story is presented can change everything.\r\nStory/Characters: 10\r\nThe storytelling of this show deserves every praise it gets, it just flows perfectly. Some episodes cover years whereas others are over in a day but you'll never feel like the pacing is off. Some recitals can take up half the episode but if they're left in, they're left in for good reason. It's not just the pace either, the storytelling hasa real poetry feeling to it. The train enters a tunnel as two passengers' conversation grow dark, a flickering drop of water is shown on the teapot during a sad moment. It's impossible to not notice how much effort is put into the simplest things to amplify the story. All of the characters feel real and are developed masterfully throughout the show. I haven't felt so passionate about a show and its characters... ever!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nHonestly, I'm one of those \"young people who prefer movies to theater\", but I found the dry Rakugo scenes very enjoyable which alone speaks volumes about the voice acting. The unique soundtrack of this show is also perfection to me. The tracks move between jazz and traditional seamlessly and match the mood of each scene. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art is the weakest point of the show. It's not bad, it's just a bit better than the generic modern animation. I feel like a more unique, traditional artstyle would suit the show. Also I really liked the decision of keeping the Rakugo scenes mostly dry with just changes in camera angles.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen the show, Shouwa Rakugo now stands at the top of my recommendation list. That might not mean much since I'm fairly new to anime but trust me, this show is amazing!\\n\\n\r\n>> SPOILERS BELOW <<\\n\\n\r\nAbove is how I felt about the first 11 episodes. I was ready to give it a 10/10 without reservation but I hate the ending. This might not be how everyone feels but to me both MCs lost their minds during the last half of Episode 12. Their actions just felt so out of character. Since I loved the show, the way they handled the ending felt more heartbreaking than the characters' deaths. Sad to give this one a 9.\\n\\n\r\nFirst 11 episodes: Masterpiece (10)\\n\r\nOverall: Great (9)",

            "content": "I believe it is safe to say that Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju is the sleeper hit of the Winter 2016 season.\r\nWhat got me interested in the series is how it centers around the traditional Japanese performance known as \"rakugo\". It's basically where a single performer gets on stage and tells a normally amusing tale. It's kind of like stand-up comedy, only the performer is sitting down. The first episode does a pretty good job incorporating this art and introducing it to the viewers. The main story is fantastic, telling of talent, fame, and friendship, as well as the changing of time.\r\nWith a great story comesgreat characters, and this is one done well. We mostly focus on two characters and their relationship over the years, as well as their career in the rakugo industry. The relationship between the two is fascinating with how they go in and out of hating and loving each other. What I like about it is how it truly feels like an actual friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing much in the animation that's really distinguishable from other shows, but it still fits with the drama and the time period it is set in.\\n\\n\r\nThis show really surprised me. Prior to the show airing, the summaries didn't make sense (most likely they were from a poor translation), so I went in not knowing a whole lot. With episode one, I was hooked and found an interest in rakugo. Upon the conclusion of the show, it was announced another season will come in the future, which has me so excited. If you're looking for a good period piece with well-written drama and traditional Japanese art, this show is the one to see.",

            "content": "This anime in a sense is a story about well story-tellers. These people try and work hard over a course of years to master this form of storytelling known as rakugo. And it isn\u2019t as easy as one might expect it to be. This anime is all about rakugo\u2019s effect on these people\u2019s lives. \r\nWhen I went into this anime- I honestly thought it was going to be boring. But, I realized that wasn\u2019t going to be the case at all after being done with the first two episodes. This anime is actually does not really focus much on rakugo- rather mainly on the characters.Yes, this anime is honestly nothing without the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are not meant to be likeable or entertaining- if anything they are meant to be portrayed as actual real people. I have noticed that all of these characters have both negative and positive qualities- making them as realistic and as human as possible.  For, example let\u2019s take a look at our main male protagonist Bon also known as Kikuhiko.He is such a layered character and honestly there are so many things I can discuss about him. But, I will keep it brief in this review. \\n\\n\r\nBon has had it rough all his life, especially since enduring an injury that prevented him from dancing ever again. He was abandoned by his folks and was taken as an apprentice to practice Rakugo. However, no matter how hard he tried he could never live up to expectations. He was constantly overshadowed by his friend Shin. He was miserable cause he felt like he didn\u2019t have a purpose in life. He felt completely useless and so practiced long and hard to be the best in rakugo. Unlike Shin, he didn\u2019t do it because he loved it- but simply because he wanted to gain something that would add some value to his dull life. However, with time he does grow to really love it.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to do so, he was willing to give up anything or anyone for that matter- making him seem very cold and distant on the outside. But, that\u2019s only because of belief that he needed rakugo more than anything else to make his existence relevant. That\u2019s why he always pleased the elders unlike Shin- and worked to the bone- while even trying to reinvent himself. He also fears being abandoned ever again- and this thing constantly haunts him. It\u2019s also sad to see how this thing comes to back to bite him later on the show. The detailed exploration of Bon\u2019s character was one of this anime\u2019s major highlights.\\n\\n\r\nShin or Sukeroku, might seem like a loveable goof who always drinks and can effortlessly do rakugo- but honestly there is more to him than that. That is also given major focus later on. He was one of the main reasons which helped Bon become so hard working in trying to perfect his own rakugo. I would have liked that they would have explored Shin\u2019s character as much Bon\u2019s, but that\u2019s honestly a nitpick on my part.\\n\\n\r\nI also particularly enjoyed the bond these two individuals had in this anime as well. It didn\u2019t ooze with bromance, as their relationship had problems like any other. They were envious of each other for different reasons- but yet they still always had each other\u2019s backs no matter. Because of their complex friendship- no wonder everyone and their mothers shipped them like crazy in this anime!\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story , I liked how it was a bit different from your average drama anime. This anime educated me a lot on rakugo- which I honestly wasn\u2019t aware of prior to this anime. What I liked, but might irk others is that they didn\u2019t straight up explain what the hell rakugo is to the modern audience. But, with each passing episode we got to learn more about it and how this thing works. Instead of telling, they actually showed us rakugo and how it can make people both happy and sad. That and how it is an art whose popularity has been dying down. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime does take place in the early the twentieth century at the beginning of episode 2.  Despite, all the time skips- the show was really well-paced and nothing felt rushed at all. I found that impressive since they did try to pack a story that takes place over the course of several decades within about thirteen episodes. I would however admit, that some of the rakugo they did tell was boring and I felt like dragged on, but only during the first half of the anime. Even when Shin, a person skilled at telling funny rakugo would perform- I would just wait for it to be over cause I wanted them to get along with the story. But, during the second half I loved all the rakugo they told. That is actually the only gripe I have with the story. That could be due to the fact that some of them get lost in translation or such stories are not entertaining to people nowadays. I wonder, if the rest feel the same or not.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, there is another underlying theme of how rakugo\u2019s importance was going to disappear with time. And I kind of predicted they were going to go in that direction. Like, how television and movies will kind of take over. But, they touched on the subject just once- and didn\u2019t bother with it ever again. I do hope they will further explore this in the upcoming sequel.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was done by Studio Deen, whom I could never ever hate unlike others- because they made Fruits Basket and Higurashi ( two anime I love to death). And now this anime is another reason why I will continue to look forward to Studio Deen\u2019s future projects. In fact, 2016 just might be Studio Deen\u2019s year cause they are coming out with so many great things (Super Lovers excluded though).  The animation was really good and I liked how the look was kind of dull- and not anything bright, colourful or sparkly. The character designs like its characters were also realistic. Bon however looks incredibly like Ebisu from Noragami Aragoto though! Am I the only one who thinks so? \\n\\n\r\nSo, I am hoping Deen will make more shows like Rakugo, cause if they do so- then they will automatically make my list of favourite anime studios. No one hardly looks forward to Deen\u2019s anime (then again I can\u2019t blame people cause they do a lot of yaoi)- but that might change thanks to this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu had great drama that is impactful and emotional moments that will make you sad. It\u2019s a very simple but yet interesting story that had me hooked episode after episode. It excels thanks to its characters and the development given to them. This is surely a strong contender for anime of the year hands down.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I will award this anime with a score of 9 out of 10 and that it is a MUST WATCH. I would like more people to check out this anime- but I wouldn\u2019t want people to hype the shit out it. Cause after seeing what happened to Erased, I realized hyping anime or anything for that matter isn\u2019t a good thing. \\n",

            "content": "It would have been a shame if an anime about people who tell stories fell short in plot and narrative. Luckily, I don't believe this one did. From start to finish I was captivated by the story, even as it changes, evolves and crescendos. There's a lot of charm and heart to it without feeling too contrived. The characters were amazingly well developed and relate-able. \r\nWriting this as someone who is probably older than most anime-viewers, I feel like this hits on some ideas and concepts that, while they won't be alien to younger viewers, likely rings true to an older crowd. Regrets, old loves,lost ambition and more really flesh this out to make for such a true tale of human nature. \\n\\n\r\nThere may be points where this show is a little slow in getting to the point. And there are times when the animation goes from magnificent to pretty good. It's beautiful and moving when it needs to be. This isn't an anime if you like fast-paced action or gimmicks. But if you're looking for a heartfelt story and strong characters, this is it.",

            "content": "I didn't intend to watch this anime initially because I thought it would be another anime like Chihayafuru. Don't get me wrong, Chihayafuru is a nice anime with beautiful art but the story got boring after awhile because there was too much emphasis on Karuta (which I can't appreciate) and very little on characters development. Anyway, long story short is that I'm so glad I decided against my doubts to give Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu (SGRS) a shot because Kikuhiko looks so hot! HAHA...\r\nFirst and foremost, SGRS is an anime for more mature audience. There is no kawaii-ness or sugarcoating in the way the storyis presented. Every emotion, dialogue, action are as real and raw as they can be. So for viewers who are looking for a feel-good anime with lotsa cuteness, comedy and happy endings, you may be disappointed. Anyway, so here goes...\\n\\n\r\nStory and Settings:\\n\r\nDespite what is written in the synopsis, SGRS largely surrounds the story of Yakumo Yuurakutei (a.k.a Kikuhiko) in his younger days which brings us back to the Showa period. So aligning with this period, you can expect to see nostalgically beautiful buildings, infrastructures and costumes. And what's nice about the Shouwa period is that not many animes use this setting so it's a refreshing change. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I almost gave up halfway through ep 1 because I really wasn't keen on Yotaro's story. But I'm glad I didn't give up as it starts to get interesting from ep 2 onwards with Kikuhiko and Sukeroku's past and how they trained to become successful Rakugo Storytellers. Without giving the story away, SGRS is about their friendship, finding their respective futures, romance (but that's not the main theme), dreams, tragedies and regrets - and that's what makes this anime realistic because that's what real life is. \\n\\n\r\nHalf the story is filled with scenes of Rakugo but I assure you they're not boring which I had initially thought because some stories they tell are actually quite interesting and funny, so don't press the FF button and skipping them. The pace of the story development may also sometimes appear slow but do not be fooled because it can also suddenly pick up speed or take a right-turn. I recalled having to rewind a few scenes due to not paying attention and then missing important scenes and conversations.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork:\\n\r\nSGRS' artwork is beautiful and the colours are very rich. And did I mention that Kikuhiko is hot? Yes, I did (hehe). And what I really appreciate is that the character designs are beautiful and realistic. What I mean by 'realistic' is that they don't have strange blue/red/pink hair and they don't spot gravity-defying nonsensical hairstyles that lotsa modern animes love to use. Also, the characters change their clothes and appearance, HALLELUJAH! So throughout the whole 13 episodes, I get to see at least 4-5 different Kikuhikos and I love it! Same goes to the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\r\nI'm pleased with all the VOs except Yotaro's who consistently speaks in a false falsetto which sounds irritating and painful to the ears, especially he speaks very fast as well. I love Yotaro as a character but only when he doesn't talk.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed SGRS very much and each episode's ending pulls me right into the next wanting to know more. The story nicely wraps up and jumps back to present day which also left me wondering if I've had enough or I should follow-up with Season 2? And I'm so glad I did because although I prefer Season 1, Season 2 contains important information not revealed in Season 1 and continued developments of Kikuhiko and the rest. So if you're planning to watch this, be sure to watch both Seasons.",

            "content": "Although I doubt this review will be found helpful by anyone almost 2 years after airing, I had to share my opinion on it. It is a work of art, from start to finish. Seasons one and two. Everything about this show is amazing and awe inspiring. I have watched this show three times in its entirety, and every time I've watched it, I have admired it more. I can't say enough how much this show affects me, as almost every episode has me clutching my chest and saying aloud \"this show is so good.\" \r\nWhen I first watched season 1, I gave it 9/10.When I re-watched it with someone, I found myself giving it a perfect score. Yes, the characters didn't do what I wanted them to, and yes, that was frustrating. However, they did exactly what they should have done to live up to each character's personality. I think that is a sign of truly masterful characterization. I hated each character at times, but in hindsight, everything they said and did made sense to who they were. And in hindsight, I loved each character in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not a story for people looking for action or something plot-driven. For those with patience, it is a work of art about the human condition, and is a beautiful display of emotion and drive in otherwise somewhat mundane characters and their lives. \\n\\n\r\nI do not praise shows lightly, but this is a one-of-a-kind type of anime. However, I can promise that if you have patience and empathy, this show will leave you thoroughly fulfilled. I don't know that any anime can ever compare to it in that sense, and I cannot think of a higher praise to give it.",

            "content": "Such a truly one of under-popular anime of all time, this anime is a seriously hidden gem between the most hyped anime out there and i dare to say this anime is one of the best ever created. Even i honestly didn't notice this anime first, until i saw many people give good impression on this anime, and boi they weren't wrong. And till now, it's still one of my favorite anime of all time...\r\n-Warning some spoilers-\r\n-Story- (10)\r\nThis is the unique one, who made this anime always stick on my mind. Story of this anime is about a guy who become a disciple of arakugoka ( a rakugo master), after he got impressed by the master's performance when he was still in the jail. Rakugo is one of a culture show in Japan which just there is one person as storyteller and narrator to tell story with various themes but full with inspiration. Probably many of you still don't know what it is, same like me at first, but this is the point of the story. This anime, slowly but surely, keeps trying to get us inside more deeply to know and even enjoying rakugo show. The story alone focus on two viewpoint, first the disciple guy, Youtaro, and his master when he's still young. For the next episodes, the story just keeps driving for being more solid than before, so it won't disappoint you till the end...\\n\\n\r\n-Art- (9)\\n\r\nThe animation art is gorgeous and smooth, this proves everyone is wrong about negative critics on DEEN Studio, which many people said always makes shitty anime with trash quality. Seriously, sometimes that just bothers me because people always blame DEEN for what they've done to FSN and always compare it with ufotable's version. And for some reasons, the animation kinda brings nostalgic on me cause it looks similiar with Sakamichi no Apollon, and that's why the animation always fits with my eyes..\\n\\n\r\n-Sound- (10)\\n\r\nAll sounds factors including voice acting, OP & ED, even soundtrack are really matching for the anime. Ishida Akira and Seki Tomokazu surely knows how to voicing the characters, and even all voice actors for supporting roles, they tried nicely done for this anime. Altought the Opening song is awesome, the Ending exceed my expectation. If you ever watched Mushishi and listen the ending song, this anime ending is not strange for you, the jazz music with slowly pace, will make you lost yourself for one minute, absolutely one of my favorite for this season. About the soundtrack, everything is cool especially when Shamisen (Japanese Tradiitional Guitar) be played in the anime..\\n\\n\r\n-Character- (8)\\n\r\nAll charcters here are typical of character which make us to never can hate them for some reasons. As i said before, there are two main characters here which have their own stories. First Youtaro, the guy who wanna be a Rakugoka and become a disciple from a Master Rakugo, and then start his lesson how to get that dream. And second one is Yakumo-sensei, a Rakugoka who become a master for Youtaro, this anime also focus on Yakumo's past about how he can be a famous Rakugoka. And also, all supporting characters are nice and have positive sides for the anime story. So far, that's the only my explanation for characters because i don't give too much spoiler here..\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment- (10)\\n\r\nI REALLY enjoy it so far, and expect more of this anime come soon. This anime surely knows how to make you laugh, amazed, and even give a heartwarming feeling into your heart...\\n\\n\r\n-Overall- (10)\\n\r\nIt's perfect 10/10 anime for me and i hope there will be more anime like this in the future, i hope. I surely suggest this anime for you if you wanna try to watch anime with full of calmness, heartwarming, and slice of life story, you won't be disappointed i swear...",

            "content": "You know something? I love the josei genre.  It's rare to find a lot of these these days but josei series always have a knack for having an original story and letting the characters do their own thing instead of relying on a formula for the upcoming consequences.  I will come up and say this is the first 9/10 I have given an anime since Oregairu (which premiered 3 years ago) and the best anime since Hunter x Hunter 2011.  Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is absolutely the best anime of the winter 2016 season and is a strong candidate for anime ofthe year 2016.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story takes place during the Shouwa Era in Japan which occurred from December 25, 1926 through January 7, 1989.  It starts of a little closer to the end of the era in the beginning (which would be the present) but the story mostly takes place in the flashback during the times of World War II in the first season of the show.  It tells the tale of Bon (an ex-geisha dancer who retired because of a crippled leg) and Shin (just some boy from the streets) as they are taken by their master Yuurakutei and learn the foundations of a Rakugo performer.  Rakugo is a form of comedic storytelling in Japan that was popular in the older times but has been slowly dying out because of the country just moving on to what is modern and what they consider more popular.  The directing is without a doubt the strongest part of this anime.  It relies on the characters with however they express themselves and the story just naturally flows making things more realistic and believable.  It provides development for the 2 main protagonists from children with ambition to grown ups with a certain vision of how they view things that was created by their experiences.  While the show is dialogue heavy, the conversations between the characters and especially the rakugo performances bring out the best of them even though they may not be able to reveal it that easily during normal interactions.\\n\r\nMy only complaint would have to be at the climax.  NOT SPOILING.  The climax was more unfitting than it was disappointing.  It just did not feel right since maybe us viewers may have expected a lot after all of the greatness they offered from the first episode.  People may take the climax if different ways but I see it as the anime's largest fault but thank God it does not detract from this wonderful experience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The funny thing about this anime is that the character's aren't even human beings (they are moving drawings) but they are still portrayed with so much emotion and humanity to keep you invested in the historical setting they live in.  Everything the characters do feel human and that's what helps the wonderful writing and directing of the series shine.  You have goals when you are younger, some will excel using less effort than those who struggle, you give up on distractions when youre goal becomes a dream, you feel trapped when you are bombarded with expectations and are blinded to see only one direction, and sometimes when you fulfill your dream you can't help but feel this small bit of unsatisfaction like there is something missing or there is something else that you need to find that you were not seeking before.  Shin and Bon go through all these trials with their heads held high and they carried the story with so much passion and held on to their true selves while developing as people.  Even Miyokichi was a character that stood out and almost stole every scene she was in.  She was a fascinating woman when she was introduced but viewers began to hate her for the bitch she becomes in later episodes.  In my eyes, her development was negative but it was still understandable and made her change for the benefit of the story.  Some anime fans seem to mistake the fact that good characters DO NOT ALWAYS EQUAL good people.  I have no complaints with any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening was very enticing but the score was phenominal.  The sound of the koto and shamisen brings you into the setting of ancient Japan and you can feel the customs and old culture.  This original score will also rival the upcoming anime this year.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Animation was solid for the most part but the visuals not only look nice but it helps in expressing the characters feelings and thoughts when they are the ones struggling to express themselves.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Studio Deen does not have the best track record and the last amazing anime I remember from them was Higurashi.  But they totally stepped up their game and put so much heart into this anime.  This anime just made my top 10 and I really hope for an anime with this level of depth, mature themes, and realism very soon.  This anime gets a high, well deserved 9/10.",

            "content": "Complex story told in a simple way is one of the less represented types of story in anime because because it takes a lot of skill on every step of execution. Yet, SGRS just nails it to the wall so hard it's basically breaking the damn wall. \r\nArt: original manga was made by a woman who drew quite a bit of bl manga, if you know what that entails take a cookie from the shelf. If you don't, if basically means you should expect a lot of handsome and feminine men who all passively look like they are on the ready to give in torandom surge of homolust. If you're not into it, don't worry, there's not reeaaally anything gay in the show and it didn't even bother me (the most heterosexual man in solar system). Well back to art. I already said designs are elegeant, flamboyant, handsome but what about the quality of it? You might know DEEN for their very memorable, experimental art house animation where they draw action scenes on as few frames as possible while using their legs or even just dropping pen on the the paper until the blobs look close enough to what should be happening. Unfortunately none of that is here, you'll have to make do with accurate lines, consistent animation quality (no sakuga here but it's decent throughout) and beautiful backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Hoooooo damn baby/10\\n\r\nYes I think it's that good. As SGRS is all about storytelling through gesture, mimicry and most importantly voice, a lot of love went into voice acting. It's just a pleasure to listen, usually anime is quite cheesy in this aspect and tends to be overly dramatic but in a show drama it's right as home. All the little nuances, tones and rhythm are there and they flow wonderfully. It's eaey to get completely immersed and feel yourself in the audience. \\n\r\nMusic is not too common throughout and most of it will be diagetic which once again helps the immersion. It's not intrusive and doesn't stand out too much but it's still really good. In particular I'd like you to enjoy the opening song written by Shiina Ringo. If you're on this site i can pretty safely call a weeb so go give her good ass music a listen (and then google tokyo jihen). \\n\\n\r\nStory: In short, it's all about characters, the way the grow, interact and just live feels very natural and genuine, they feel like real people. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's grounded and realistic, it's still a drama, not a biopic but it's still way, way more real than most anime out there. Everyone has some human flaws, they struggle with problems you can relate to without being a storyteller in 20th century japan. That's what this show is about, there are plenty of bright and cheerful moments but otherwise it's a struggle against tradition, against society and against yourself, a lot of the times you have to do one of these to make it through life and it's engrossing to watch such a varied cast of sympathetic characters be thrown into the maelstrom of life and fall with it their own way. I won't say it deeply explores those topics but it doesn't have to, it's about characters, not social commentary. \\n\\n\r\nFun factor: while I think everyone who considers anime their hobby should watch it, the ones who are most likely to enjoy the most are fans of period pieces and slow burn dramas. It might seem like a serious show that would require a lot of investment to watch but in reality it's a very straight and comfy ride that can both make you laugh and tear up. \\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI\u2019m lucky enough to still have one of my Grandfathers alive and well.\r\nHe has been the best Grandpa I could have hoped for. Showing up to my birthdays, graduations, and sports games. Treating me with both love and respect. Handing me a casual fifty-dollar bill whenever he gets the chance.\r\nYet his best gifts are his memories, the stories he tells when my brother and I sit close by and ask about another part of his life. Stories about his time as a milk man, ice man, and salesman. Stories about his tattoos and the gangshe associated with. Stories about my own troublemaking father.\\n\\n\r\nI hope to have stories like my Grandpa\u2019s when I grow old; I hope I\u2019m making them now. Until then, the storied Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu proves that, like my Grandpa, the best stories come from the heart.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nRakugo begins by following Yotaro, a convict just released from prison. With no money or family, he makes it his mission to become the apprentice of Yakumo, the greatest rakugo artist of Yotaro\u2019s generation. Luckily, he does, and, following a rather rude mishap, Yakumo chooses to tell both his \u201cdaughter\u201d Konatsu and Yotaro his life\u2019s story.\\n\\n\r\nThis opening blurb glosses over much of the first episode. That\u2019s not because it\u2019s terrible but because the anime already has in mind where it wants to focus. Indeed, the first episode performs three duties: introduces the audience to rakugo, gives us the current state of Bon\u2019s (Yakumo\u2019s real name) character, and sets the stage for the true story that needs telling.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what a story is told.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of Rakugo (approximately eleven-and-half episodes) is comprised of Bon\u2019s personal recounting of the life he led and the brother he lost. He goes into so much: where he came from, his first love, living with Shin, his turning-point play, and so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout all of Bon\u2019s experiences, the anime explores a handful of levels.\\n\\n\r\nOne level is historical. The audience learns about what rakugo is, how it works, and what it went through during the war and the evolution of entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nOne level is romantic. What love does to people, as well as what people will give up to pursue their passions. Shin trying to save Miyokichi, Bon letting Miyokichi go despite loving her so he could reach higher rakugo heights, and Miyokchi basically cursing Bon for his mistreatment of her attest to this romantic notion handily enough.\\n\\n\r\nOne level is dramatic. The deaths of certain characters, Bon\u2019s personal struggles, and the smaller moments \u2013 like Bon denying someone an apprenticeship or Shin\u2019s expulsion \u2013 create drama that avoids being overbearing while simultaneously being interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Rakugo is not an intense or thrilling or deep anime. It never tries or claims to be so. But what it does become, through intertwining those three separate levels, is a personal tale told from the heart.\\n\\n\r\nThat makes sense because, after all, this story is Bon\u2019s. But it is more than that, especially when considering the rakugo premise. Despite the countless stories he has told, he has never told this one. And, even smarter, it is not just a story about him but from him. In every other performance, Bon must become somebody else. But for this tale, histale, he simply has to be himself.\\n\\n\r\nWriting of this cleverness can be seen throughout much of the anime. Take the rakugo performances themselves. They more or less reflect the state of the narrative at that time. A story about greed and a story about turning over a new leaf have direct ties to the characters and the events that they experience, adding to the show\u2019s writing prowess.\\n\\n\r\nAppropriate enough, Rakugo\u2019s intricate execution can only be understood right before the end while reflecting on the beginning. Where Bon\u2019s story starts with him meeting Shin and slapping the boy\u2019s hand away, it finishes with him desperately clinging on and reaching for the hand of the man that has given him so much. A full-circle narrative whose connecting points (relevantly) speak volumes about the entire tale.\\n\\n\r\nSmaller details also fill the narrative. The parallels in the Yakumo and Sukeroku names. Shin giving Bon his precious rakugo fan. Bon, without his cane, running at Shin to bring him into an embrace.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout all of Rakugo, it focuses on a specific idea: finding a form of rakugo. Initially, that doesn\u2019t seem very relatable \u2013 rakugo is quite a niche role. But interpreting this notion in the context of the story, it is not just about rakugo. It\u2019s about finding one\u2019s self.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, one of Bon\u2019s primary conflicts is this issue. Yet it also extends to both Shin and Miyokichi. Shin has already found himself; it\u2019s what makes his rakugo so strong. And Miyokichi combines them both: She has found herself by not being herself for others.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this theme drives the narrative because it is what drives Bon forward. And through his myriad of ups and downs, highs and lows, the audience as well starts to wonder if they have found themselves, too.\\n\\n\r\nGiven this intense character focus, the show does not have a tangible plot. In fact, the audience already knows the ending: Shin dies. The narrative is nothing more than Bon\u2019s story. What he felt, what he did, and what he learned. And that\u2019s the beauty of it all: It is the journey, not the destination, that matters.\\n\\n\r\nEven its potential negatives are covered. An argument against the show is that one does not really get to see much of Shin and Miyokichi\u2019s relationship. But Shin calling out Miyokichi\u2019s real name (Yurie), when Bon was never told, indicate handily enough the connection the two oddballs shared.\\n\\n\r\nAnother potential negative is Yotaro\u2019s mob boss appearing literally right after Yotaro mentions him. But this instance has meaning since it follows that ever-present theme of finding one\u2019s self.\\n\\n\r\nThe background reveal on Bon\u2019s master Yakumo could also be seen as a negative, but it\u2019s made up for by the harshly truthful nature of the conversation.\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest argument against Rakugo happens in the final episode. Or rather, it doesn\u2019t happen. In an interesting move, the immediate aftermath of Bon\u2019s season-long story is not shown. Instead, it jumps forward in time many years.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems like a mistake. The anime started off by setting up some intriguing relationships \u2013 between Bon and Konatsu, Bon and Yotaro, and Yotaro and Konatsu. Yet the audience doesn\u2019t get to see them unfold, transpire, or change. Again, not even once Bon completes his personal story. It feels like something should have been given.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s fine, though, for one reason only: A second season exists (soon). To be fair to Rakugo, this story is Bon\u2019s, not Yotaro\u2019s or Konatsu\u2019s. So while it is not a major problem now, it certainly will be if, later on, the anime chooses to ignore the relationships between the master, the daughter, and the apprentice.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, Rakugo\u2019s narrative power does not falter no matter what gets thrown its way.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nRakugo\u2019s art and animation are likewise very strong in their execution.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially on an artistic level. Despite the frequent visits to the theater and its stage, the anime features many different locations and therefore backgrounds. A street on the eve of its first snowfall. A quaint town surrounded by blue sky, green grass, and yellow trails. A row of lighted festival stalls, leading to a darkened lake. The show constantly switches up its backgrounds, allowing it to thrive on variety.\\n\\n\r\nBut Rakugo\u2019s art truly shines in the symbolic techniques it regularly uses. For instance, some of the rakugo performances inject visual depictions of the stories being told, representing just how masterful that particular performer is at the piece.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best examples, however, is Bon\u2019s shinigami rendition. The people being replaced by candles and the reduction in screen-size to include more black space around it, demonstrate the show\u2019s (ironic yet welcome) show-don\u2019t-tell approach.\\n\\n\r\n(The visuals of the opening and ending tracks also deserve a shout-out. The former\u2019s drowning of Miyokichi, and the latter\u2019s colorful shapes, further indicate Rakugo\u2019s penchant for deft symbolism. In this case, a feeling of suffocation and structure, respectively.)\\n\\n\r\n(Also, the ED visuals switching out the main cast for the \u201cnew\u201d cast for next season was a nice touch in the final episode.)\\n\\n\r\nEven the animation manages to keep up. Rakugo requires a surprising amount of movement which the characters thankfully adopt. Their different facial expressions and body orientations make the performances come alive as they inject their own brand of rakugo.\\n\\n\r\nOff the stage, animation remains within acceptable ranges, especially considering the art itself and the performances. Bon walking with his cane, Shin jumping into Bon\u2019s arms, and Miyokichi looking down on Bon as petals swirl about her keep the animation and \u201caction\u201d on screen from feeling too static.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are strong, too. Bon\u2019s sleek physique and handsome face. Shin\u2019s wild hair and loose-fitting robes. Miyokichi\u2019s floral yukata, different hair designs, and attractive assets. They are all not just adults but fitting-looking characters for the time, tone, and type of anime Rakugo happens to be.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nRakugo continues its dominance in the character department.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps obviously, Bon steals the stage. He\u2019s not just a great character (which he better be, given that the anime is almost exclusively centered on him); he\u2019s a phenomenal character.\\n\\n\r\nHis journey spans multiple parts of his life while characterizing, exploring, and developing his character at nearly every junction. He starts off as a cold, crippled boy, not wanting to take part in this weird storytelling art known as rakugo. As he connects with Shin, he also becomes slightly envious of him. All the while, he fails at rakugo, believing himself unable to improve.\\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s abandoned by Yakumo as he and Shin go off to war. During this time, Bon begins the rakugo climb. He falls in love for the first time, he practices daily, and he discovers that he doesn\u2019t just want a simple, thankless life.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Shin returns, Bon finally finds comfort on stage while crossdressing in a play. Taking up sensual, erotic stories, audiences start to not only listen but get enticed by his rakugo. He discovers that he performs rakugo for himself and nobody else. But his pursuit of even higher heights leaves him unable to see what he truly does rakugo for and leaves his relationship with Miyokichi waning.\\n\\n\r\nAfter losing his brother and his lover, as well as his master and attendant, he is now alone, abandoned once again. At first, he thinks that this loneliness is exactly what he wanted: more time for himself and thus more time for his rakugo. Indeed, he becomes the poster boy of the art. Yet he cannot forget about the best friend he lost.\\n\\n\r\nSo when he finds Shin holed away with his new daughter and Miyokichi nowhere in sight, he chooses to get Shin, the best rakugo performer in the world, to take up the Yakumo family name instead.\\n\\n\r\nHis time away from the theater and the city and the bustle lets him understand that what he wants isn\u2019t loneliness \u2013 he simply wants Shin. Unfortunately, the conflicting nature of the romance they all share together kills Shin and Miyokichi in a freak accident, leaving Bon alone to fulfill his and Shin\u2019s promise.\\n\\n\r\nBon had blamed himself for Shin and Miyokichi\u2019s fall into ruin. Their deaths only exacerbated this thought. However, it becomes ultimately evident in his response to Konatsu\u2019s words about someday killing the man who \u201ckilled\u201d her parents: \u201cKill me, then. I\u2019d feel much better.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s the conclusion to Bon\u2019s person (for now). And this investigation does not even cover half of what he went through. Regardless, the execution in his arc, the events he experiences, and the development he goes through make him without a doubt one of the strongest characters in the medium.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of this strength is owed to three different aspects: Shin, Miyokichi, and his theme on loneliness.\\n\\n\r\nShin was a nice guy. Arrogant (and perhaps deservedly so) but kind. For he had the best of intentions: He wanted to save rakugo, and he wanted to do it all for the people.\\n\\n\r\nThe juxtaposition between him and Bon is astounding. Bon is classy, elegant, and straight-laced whereas Shin is loud, energetic, and carefree. Shin\u2019s personal ideals also juxtapose with Bon\u2019s. Unlike Shin, Bon wasn\u2019t sure how to approach rakugo, and he did it all for himself.\\n\\n\r\nBut they are also very similar. Both are apprenticed to Yakumo. Both fall in love with Miyokichi. Both are fantastic rakugo performers.\\n\\n\r\nThe best example, though, combines both their contrasts and similarities. The promise they make \u2013 for Bon to create an unchanging rakugo and for Shin to create an ever-changing rakugo \u2013 highlights not only the contrasting personalities and nature of the two men but also the staunch relationship they share as brothers.\\n\\n\r\nMiyokichi brings a different caliber of character. She\u2019s attracted to cold men and not nice guys (as she puts its). In other words, she loves Bon and not Shin. For her, she just wants to be a \u201cgood woman\u201d for her man by supporting him. Which is exactly what she tries to do. She teaches Bon about women, dotes on him regularly, and supports him in his endeavors.\\n\\n\r\nYet she gets dumped hardcore by Bon, leading her to lust after Shin \u2013 to the point that they conceive a child together. But, again, her heart is for Bon only. If her sleeping with other men while married to Shin is not enough proof of her fleeting feelings, her only listening to Bon\u2019s rakugo performance and not Shin\u2019s, as well as not caring for her own daughter because it\u2019s also Shin\u2019s, indicates this well enough.\\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s an emotionally complex character to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nMiyokichi\u2019s involvement, however, does not deter the relationship that Bon and Shin share. Indeed, Bon would always listen to Shin eventually whereas Bon would almost never give in to Miyokichi\u2019s demands. And when Miyokichi says she will get revenge on Bon, and somewhat does by \u201ckilling\u201d Shin indirectly, she\u2019s not the one that haunts Bon. Shin is.\\n\\n\r\nThe contrasts, the relationships, and the layered parallels not only bolster Bon but also Rakugo as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nAnd connected through them all is that theme on loneliness that propels Bon, Shin, and Miyukichi\u2019s characters even further ahead.\\n\\n\r\nBon\u2019s loneliness is evident in the abandonment he constantly experiences. But Shin deals with loneliness, too. He believes the best rakugo is rakugo that suits what the audience wants, meaning he does not want the audience to feel lonely. Miyokichi as well. She herself refuses to be lonely, moving from man to man in the hopes of placating her feelings.\\n\\n\r\nLoneliness also seeps into the events themselves. Bon and Shin are at their lowest point emotionally when lonely: Bon is abandoned by everyone while Shin loses his beloved rakugo. Shin and Miyokichi hook up when they both find themselves alone. And Bon and Miyokichi are at their fiercest together when Miyokichi\u2019s loneliness cannot be contained any longer.\\n\\n\r\nThe kicker is how this theme ties into the premise. Rakugo is simultaneously a lonely art and a collective one. The performer is alone on stage while the audience supports him or her from afar. Meaning, rakugo itself revolves around loneliness.\\n\\n\r\nSuch clever, beautiful writing is simply the norm for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nRakugo\u2019s strongest outing comes from the music and sound-work it includes.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP mixes clock sounds, whispered vocals, and irregular instrumental and lyrical work to make a piece that\u2019s enticing and sumptuous and flavorful. The ending track, in comparison, avoids weird compositions and a singer altogether. The smooth trumpet, accompanied by the violin and piano, craft a peaceful ride at the end of every episode, making it a relaxing, cool ED to hear.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the original soundtrack contains dramatic, melancholy pieces that fit the mood of the anime. But it mostly goes cultural, incorporating different tunes, instruments, and arrangements that fit the premise and time period well. The foreign feel definitely adds to the overall appeal of the show, but it also gives Rakugo another twinge of peculiarity.\\n\\n\r\nYet some of Rakugo\u2019s strongest sound offerings are not musical in the strict definition of the word. Rather, the anime\u2019s ability to use sound as a tool to tell its tale once again elevates the show towards newer, more compelling heights.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the use of a grating, brooding sound induces the same feeling of dread that Bon feels when he doesn\u2019t know what will become of him. Or the frantic, overbearing piano during Bon\u2019s first performance makes it hard to hear his words, reflecting his current nerve-racking state.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while it almost does not even need to be said, the voice-acting performances are simply superb. Akira Ishida and Kouichi Yamadera as Bon and Shin, respectively, demonstrate their range, emotion, and skill both on and off the rakugo stage.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI will admit, when this one first started airing, I was tentative. I distinctly remember (read: there are records of) me not fully impressed with where the story itself was going or what it ultimately wanted to do.\\n\\n\r\nIt has been nine months since then. Such time has let me meet different people, let me watch new anime, and let me experience more of what life has to offer. Basically, like Bon, I\u2019ve changed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd suffice it to say, my perspective has changed, too.\\n\\n\r\nI remember myself laughing while watching. Not because something was funny. In fact, there was only one true instance of comedy (when one of the new rakugo kids had big, frizzy hair). No. It was because I was taken aback by how splendid the anime was.\\n\\n\r\nMultiple moments can be selected to make this clear, but the one that stuck with me the most occurred in episode eleven. For it contains the \u201cbest\u201d rakugo performance.\\n\\n\r\nBon and Shin perform together, showing the strength in their respective approaches side-by-side. Unconventional also in its location; not in a theater or some grand hall, but on the side of Shin\u2019s shack with his daughter being the only member watching the two greatest rakugo performers to ever live.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not fair to say that \u201cthere is nothing else is like it in the medium.\u201d Not just because that\u2019s hyperbole but also because other anime have included similar aspects. Japanese-culture premises, wicked symbolism, and strong characters are not something that this one came up with.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that one scene is not groundbreaking or even stunning. Indeed, I\u2019d argue that nothing in the anime is of that nature. But this is all precisely the point; it\u2019s a simple, plain tale that nails it all.\\n\\n\r\nIts maturity in content and drama and themes. The passionate, realistic relationships held between the characters. An insane amount of execution in nearly every facet of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIt was hard not comparing it to other anime because of what it didn\u2019t do. No fantasy. No strangeness. No nonsense. No gimmicks. No conveniences. It was a simple, normal tale that was true, fair in its delivery.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s so much more. Bon\u2019s incredible character arc is awesome to see unfold. The sharp writing and dialogue. Konatsu as a kid. Interesting rakugo performances. A juicy, messy romance between the lot.\\n\\n\r\nI debated with myself for a long time over my personal connection with the show. On whether or not this one deserved the highest of honors. I\u2019m talking conversing with me in the mirror and speaking with my mother about it over the phone.\\n\\n\r\nFor those that know of my style, I look at every anime on its own. What it did, what it accomplished, and so on. I\u2019m all about fairness. Even so, this one made me question the standards anime should uphold and challenged my usual line of thinking.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, it\u2019s an anime that provided me with a completely new experience, a small story I can later tell to my own grandkids. For this reason and the many previously listed, it earns that top-tier award that\u2019s so rarely given out.\\n\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu paints a fantastic tale. Its narrative is both wonderful in its message and tight in its composition. The characters are layered with immense care and detail. And the symbolic visuals, amazing sound work, and sheer technical prowess support everything throughout the entire experience. Not as perfect as my Grandpa\u2019s stories but pretty darn close.\\n\\n\r\nBravo!\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, history, romance, and drama intertwine to form a personable, well-written tale about rakugo and finding one\u2019s self\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, varied locales, symbolic techniques, nice animation, and fitting character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Bon\u2019s character arc is one of the strongest in the medium, with him, Shin, and Miyokichi being connected through stark juxtaposition, complicated relationships, and a thorough theme on loneliness\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, good OP, good ED, good OST, nice sound-design choices, and superb VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, the overall \u201cuniqueness,\u201d maturity, and execution are so impressive that they challenge the perception of the medium as a whole\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 10/10",

            "content": "\"In a world overflowing with entertainment I want to create a path for Rakugo to survive\"\r\n- Sukeroku Yuurakutei\r\nStory (9):\r\nThe story is mostly about the lives of two great Rakugo performers, Sukeroku and Yakumo. We see them mature from children to adults as they learn to perform the art of Rakugo. But it is not only the characters that mature, but also their Rakugo. As the characters learn and develop, their Rakugo does too. The story had great pacing and felt quite realistic, it was really quite beautiful.\r\nCharacters (9):\r\nThe characters are really what make this anime fantastic. Our main characters are Yakumo and Sukeroku, who startoff as two abandoned children who are learning Rakugo under the same master. Very quickly they become adults and start performing. As mentioned above, the characters are very developed and lovable. The relationship between our MC's was highly realistic, they love each other, then become frustrated with each other, have a fight and then go back to loving each other again. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9):\\n\r\nThe music had quite a 'vintage' quality to it, which suited the anime very well. The music was likeable and the animation of the op and ed sequences was just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors had the difficult job of voicing full Rakugo performances, which they managed to pull off amazingly. They also suited the roles of the characters well. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9):\\n\r\nThe artwork done by Studio Deen was very well done. As the voice actors had the difficult job of voicing the Rakugo performances, the studio had the difficult job of animating them and they also did a terrific job of that. The art was consistent, had a nice style and good detail.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment (9):\\n\r\nOverall I think that this anime was an incredible watch, it was really incredible in every category and I can't find any faults! If you loved the drama and friendship of animes like Nana you will be certain to enjoy this as well.\\n\\n",

            "content": "A very heartfelt anime with outstanding music that completely transports you to the time period where this story wants you to go.\r\nThe characters are refreshing and new,; they have their own ambitions, joys, trauma and way of coping with it that really makes them stand out from the tired old sterotypes we've all grown used to seeing in.\r\nIt's able to engage the viewer in this story about two young rakugo apprentices trying to find and make their own place in this world and all the hardships and enjoyment they'll encounter along the way. Although slow at times, there's always something happening that can keep youinterested. Admittedly, I was a bit skeptic of having to sit through actual rakugo, and even if the show's audience appreciated it much more than I ever could do, it surprisingly was quite charming in a way. \\n\\n\r\nWhy a 7 then? I only seem to go on about praising the show, what doesn't make it a 10? Simple: the show and I weren't on the same wavelength. I am sure many won't really get irked by the way it handles some plot points but man, did I get frustrated at times.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this it's just me rambling with some light spoilers, so you can make your decision of continuing or not.\\n\\n\r\nDo you know who deserves much, much better? Konatsu. She is cut down, dismissed and talked over time and time again because of the single fact she is a woman. The thing that makes me mad is how the show actually portrays this as something I need to accept, not something that will be change, and believe me, it doesn't. \\n\\n\r\nThe only other woman in this show is her mother, an obsessive person who by the life of me I cannot figure out how the characters couldn't put a stop to her. Miyokichi can be a really interesting person, don't get me wrong, the times she talks about something that doesn't involve \"kikuuu san~\" we get some introspective moments; however, as already stated this only occurs when Kiku isn't involved, something that happens, oh, i dunno, like 10% of her screen time? Not nearly enough, because let me tell you, when she's with him I have never seen more red flags in a relationship. Oh, and her voice is extremely annoying. Dropping it out there, not being petty. It just is.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, is it just me, or are there incredibly obvious subtexts of kiku being gay for sukeroku? Because god damn, it was so blatant I was pretty much prepared for someone to do something regarding that. I don't know if it's just implied for the audience to catch on and understand that in those times it was seen badly enough that kiku rejected this part of himself (it\u00b4s so so clear for me guys, I swear, like each episode there are 5 or more instances that it's obvious he likes sukeroku, if this were a heterosexual couple I would be 100% sure they'd end up together by the end of the 2nd episode of backstory) or there is actually nothing and the people making this are blind. Again, another time where I'm just supposed to accept this and don't question this conservative views at all.",

            "content": "I don't think I'm the best kind of guy to review this kind of anime, but considering just how good it is and still how neglected it was by the bulk of mainstream viewers, I decided to see if I can help boosting this anime's reviews.\r\n\"Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu\" was easily one of the best anime series I've seen from 2016. I knew nothing about rakugo before going in and I felt super entertained by the rakugo performed in this series. Right on the first performance in the first episode I was really drawn to it. I caught myself laughing at the presentation along thecrowd that was watching it in the theater. So the anime is not just drama revolving around the performers doing rakugo, it is also full stetches of rakugo. The first episode features minutes upon minutes of one of the characters doing their routine. And one may think that this sounds boring, but it is actually very cool! So every once in a while you'll catch a full rakugo routine and this is important, because getting to watch the evolution of the characters' rakugo along with their own evolution is pivotal to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is gripping. It is involving. I can't remember the last time I started and finished an anime series in less than a week. You get to see characters growing, the evolution of their rakugo, the evolution of their relationships with one another, all this set to a constantly evolving post-war Japan.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one minor personal drag I have is that I would sometimes get annoyed at a certain characters' BS. Like \"Ugh, there goes Kikuhiko again with this sh*t\" or \"Sukeroku, could you just stop being a dirtbag for a freaking second and listen?\". But again, this is a personal issue of mine, specially because it doesn't keep the characters from being complex and well done.\\n\\n\r\nI apologize if all of this sounds like a bunch of rambling, but I'm not used to writing anime reviews.\\n\\n\r\nGive this series a watch. It is criminally underrated considering something like Re:Zero is very likely to win Crunchyroll's \"Anime of the Year\" poll and we rarely see someone talking about Rakugo Shinjuu.",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu focuses on the bond between a former yakuza member named Sukeroku and a former dancer turned rakugo apprentice named Yakumo who each undergo their own different developments involving the Japanese storytelling performances known as rakugo. The series goes through a number of decades in exploring the different tribulations faced by both men as they progress through the world of rakugo from learning the flaws of their storytelling style to trying to adjust rakugo to the changing times of audience interests in different entertainment venues.\r\nBefore I get into my thoughts on the series as a whole, I should explain more about rakugo.Rakugo is a performance where a storyteller sits on stage to tell a long and complicated funny or sentimental story. Each storyteller has their own different style of storytelling they would present in their performances that can be theatrical, sentimental, musical, or telling a ghost story. Around the time of the post-World War II era that part of this series is set in, rakugo was in a period of transition as the performance struggled to connect with audiences as they sought out other forms of entertainment with the coming of new technologies like television.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto my thoughts on Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, the series does a great job with getting into the heads of Sukeroku and Yakumo within rakugo. Both men have had their different upbringings in life and both enter the world of rakugo for different reasons that shape their approaches to their performances. As a former felon, Sukeroku sought to become a rakugo performer to clean up his life and goes for a more casual approach for a rakugo style compared to the more traditional style employed by those within the rakugo association he's part of, this leading him to become more aware of how the traditional style is turning away audiences with the changing times. As a former dancer, Yakumo was injured in his former profession and finds that he has no choice but to take part in rakugo to still have a profession to follow. However, his disinterest in it is apparent from his performances being too focused on execution over emotion until Sukeroku's presence gives him inspiration to develop his own unique style. Both men also find themselves following different paths with rakugo that lead the series to take a more dramatic direction as episodes progress.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also believably depicts rakugo with its performances and traditions. Each of the rakugo storytellers have their own unique styles for wordplay and performances they play out in the depiction of their stories and these nuances are believably depicted. It also believably portrays the struggles of the profession during and following World War II as performances become censored by the military and start to attract less audiences, struggling to stay relevant when more options of entertainment have become available to the Japanese populace. The younger generation of performers also start clashing with their older predecessors over changing with the times so rakugo does not totally die out as a form of entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nIssues with Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu are mostly minor. The animation for the series is a bit underwhelming with a decent number of shortcuts employed with minimal movement and still shots often employed. The series is left open-ended as it still continues on to its later second season focusing on Yakumo training a new student in old age. Also due to its very Japanese and historical themes, the series may not be for everyone due to its heavy Japanese themes.\\n\\n\r\nStill if you have a love for elements of Japan's history or wish to know more about the country's culture, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu does a great job focusing on how the tradition of rakugo is viewed by Sukeroku and Yakumo as they become more involved within its performances and traditions.",

The squeaking of the wooden stage or tapping of a paper fan, the architectural details of the theaters or the movement of fabrics, are all rendered with extreme skill. The people who worked on SGRS clearly loved traditional Japanese culture and the art of Rakugo, and it shows.\r\nThe characters are wonderfully human, flawed, and complex.

            "content": "Rakugo is a story about storytellers. \r\nAs one of the most hailed less popular series on online forums, I have decided to watch this anime on a whim. I finished the first season in one sitting (which rarely happens) and found myself surprised by this anime.\r\nMaybe it was because this was the first Josei anime I have watched. But the themes discussed in this anime are what I have never experienced before, or often just not talked about in real life. Prostitution. Broken Romance. Linging Hatred without Malice.  Adultery. Haunting Past. All under the scope of realism. That's what makes this anime special. It'snot a show in which you just say \"cuz it's anime\".\\n\\n\r\nBut why such a low rating compared to others (7/10)?\\n\r\nWell, to me, 7/10 rating is still above average (I tend to give an average anime around 6/10).\\n\r\nIt has reveals some good aspects but had faults which just didn't suit me.\\n\r\nBut unlike other anime I rated 7/10, this one has elements of a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: raising to 8/10 after finishing 2nd season. This season is incomplete without finishing the second one.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nAs a story about storytellers, the way the plot is present is fabulous. But Rakugo has overlooked one of the most important aspect in storytelling: THE TOPIC.\\n\\n\r\nRakugo, or Japanese storytelling is a slow medium which has little place for the fast and evolving world of today. The story seems rather slow paced (compared to other anime these days), and that alone may throw people off. But Rakugo just isn't a topic that can keep the interest of a viewer for 13 episodes. As I got halfway into the season, I was finding myself skipping parts of anime, given how repetitive it got. Could have avoided this by having much less episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself has intriguing elements, but it just feels like that I am turning on an anime at half-speed after a certain point. The pacing felt even slower than Shinsekai Yori in my opinion. It might have just been due to watching a genre I wasn't used to.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: raised to 8/10 after finishing 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSolid. But I am not the judge at art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe background music is properly played at right time. Solid.\\n\\n\r\nedit: raised to 9/10 after 2nd season. I didn't notice too much in detail when I first saw this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is where Rakugo shines at. All characters feel just realistic. They just feel like the average John Doe we may meet in real life. And flawed like any normal human beings. I am astounded by how complex the characters are, unlike a couple hotshot characters in main stream with no substance to relate (Eren Yeager for example). And we can feel the characters' pain as we delve into their past and learn about them. It's as if you are listening to their live accounts of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this alone, is I see why this anime is praised as a masterpiece. And I agree that the character development in Rakugo is one of the best I have seen in this medium.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nBut it just felt too slow. Just like how willpower is a depletable resource, there was a limit for me how to get in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIt is one of the anime with complex themes and deep characters, but sadly is plagued by a repetitive topic and slow pacing. However, the character development alone can place this in the masterpiece section for some.\\n\\n\r\nI plan to finish the second season and see if it changes my view. I have halfway in season 2 as of writing this review.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: 8/10 after 2nd season\\n",

Beyond that, the viewer gets to learn about a traditional Japanese artform. I can't recommend it enough, especially as it seemsthe second season helps settle some of the unrest left by the ending of the first. This is how storytelling should be done.",

            "content": "\"Rakugo\" is a classic traditional Japanese entertainment where one person single handed  plays a story with multiple characters. It sounds boring. That's what I initially had in mind but I gave it a chance so I started watching and as each episode goes by I got more curious and enjoyment out of it. I like how the story is arrange, the character development is just steady grows as each episode goes.  The attachment I had for both main character is so equal where I dont favour one or another. \r\n    Basically, Bonand Shin were living together as kids with a Master of Rakugo. How the build up each other personality and fill up each others lives. Thus, this anime shows how tough is life for both of them and surviving as life goes on. It is interesting to see how the story revolves around these two people. I do recommend it, really kills time. \\n",

            "content": "Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu opens with a former mobster being released from prison. Immediately, he is given the nickname \"Yotaro\" when he seeks out Yakumo Yurakutei, who is the Rakugo master. However, despite this initial introduction in the first episode, we are lead, almost seamlessly, into Yakumo's story. It begins during his childhood, when Yakumo - then named Kikuhiko - first encounters fellow apprentice and soon-turned lifelong rival, Sukeroku. Throughout the anime, we watch Kikuhiko's growth as both a person and a storyteller. Perhaps most importantly, we see how Sukeroku invokes Kikuhiko's growth, and how Kikuhiko, in return, evokes Sukeroku's. The pace of the storyis gentle, yet there is always some sort of underlying tension beneath it that urges the plot forward. This could be some sort of rivalry between Kikuhiko and Sukeroku whose friendship is rocky and bitterseweet, or Miyokichi, the woman in their lives who wins the duo's hearts. With the plot, there are certainly a few holes that could be filled, and the Rakugo performances can be burdensome if the viewer does not quite enjoy the art. However, the Rakugo is what slows down the drama, introducing normalcy into the characters' lives, which is what gives Rakugo Shinjuu that wistful mood.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the first episode, we have gotten an accurate sense of the mood of the anime. The soundtrack flips between a contemporary jazzy instrumental and the traditional Japanese shamisen, paired with a flute or perhaps a voice. Simply put, the music in this anime represents the characters themselves: Kikuhiko, a traditional, dignified storyteller, contrasted by Sukeroku, a contemporary storyteller who breaks whatever mold by which he is constrained. It also takes us between two time periods. The shamisen is a reminder of the past, when Rakugo was still flourishing, while the jazz represents the new age, while Rakugo fades out from mainstream entertainment. Both tracks were very well done, with a great deal of variation in each of their respective tracklists. There is a great emphasis placed on sound in this anime, whether it be the soundtrack or the voice acting. Acting out professional storytellers is no easy task. Yet, the voice actors have indeed brought their best to the table. Kikuhiko's elegant, hard-working demeanor is shown through his character's mellower voice, which portrays Rakugo stories that are poetic or sentimental in nature. His Rakugo is done for himself- a direct representation of his reflective, perfectionist personality. Kikuhiko's voice flows like water, while Sukeroku's voice crashes like waves. Sukeroku, who is a man who marches to the beat of his own drum, is far more expressive in both his voice and face than Kikuhiko. His Rakugo is dramatic, almost to the point of mockery, and is made to make others happy, much like Sukeroku's warm, but raunchy personality.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps what makes this anime such a masterpiece are the subtleties with which everything is established. One of these aforementioned subtleties is the art. Throughout the series, we watch as the backgrounds ease into a new age: Rakugo theatres, and traditional Japanese houses are replaced by newer, more Western architecture, such as jazz cafes or cinemas. The decay of the Japanese culture as after WWII is made clear through the rising unpopularity of Rakugo and the closing of geisha districts. Fewer and fewer people frequent the theatres, while kimonos are swapped for Western suits. Little details such as these truly transport the viewer into the time period, and creates a nostalgia for the Edo era. The art itself is certainly an expression of this anime's mood. Though the colours are bright with splashes of super saturation, they are mostly muted- an accurate depiction of the turbulent drama that is smoothed out by Kikuhiko's introspective narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAs with all great anime (in my opinion, at least), the characters of Rakugo Shinjuu are truly the stars of the show. Each character's personality is established through their actions, their facial expressions, or their very designs. Kikuhiko's devotion to perfection and aversion to change are clearly shown by his afternoon activities and clothing choices. While he spends his days clad in a kimono, practicing Rakugo stories, Sukeroku is a man who lives much more in the moment, shown by his often risky, but still enjoyable style of storytelling. His edgy lifestyle is accentuated not only by his nightly meetings with women and alcohol, but also by his messy hair and rumpled clothing. With two amazing main leads, the story moves along briskly through their daily lives. Their differences only serve to highlight each others' weaknesses and strengths, making them both well-rounded, multi-dimensional characters. The next most developed character would be Miyokichi, the geisha who seduces drama into the male duo's lives. Her personality is shown by her career choices- working first as a prostitute, then a geisha, and yet again a prostitute, she already establishes her tendency to rely on others, men in particular. This particular trait also shows up in her words, and her dreams of becoming a wife who can faithfully support her husband. Her dependency continues to develop when she constantly searches for a male to rely on. It would be no exaggeration to say the Miyokichi was the main catalyst for change. Yet, despite all her flaws (or perhaps, because of them), Miyokichi evokes the audience's sympathy as well as their disgust at her audacity. Her character's ability to do both is quite the feat.\\n\\n\r\nThe series closes as we are jerked back into modern day, with the perspective now focused on Yotaro, our cutely idiotic mobster. Overall, I very much enjoyed this series, which was quite obvious in the way I devoured it all in one sitting. What drew me in most were the relatable and potent characters, as well as the well-thought out soundtrack. Despite its brilliant execution, Rakugo Shinjuu remains rather unknown which is sad to hear. I highly recommend this series.\\n\\n\r\nRakugo Shinjuu may be about artful storytelling, but that is also what this series is, in and of itself.",

            "content": "Lovers Suicide through Rakugo Review\r\nRakugo is an act of storytelling by a person in front of mass crowd, taking the role of multiple characters of the story. Most stories tends to be comedic, but it also covers tragic tales and drama. Rakugo is an age old traditional Japanese art of storytelling with which I wasn\u2019t familiar with that much to be entirely honest. And when I read the premise of this show, which solely dedicates to Rakugo, I wasn\u2019t that much interested in the first place. But still, the title of the show intrigued me, so I went on with it. Lets just say itwas a good experience. A calm, soothing mature experience that revolved around the drama of life. Today\u2019s review, one of the underrated shows of 2016\u2019s, \u201cSh\u014dwa Genroku Rakugo Shinj\u016b\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nPremise\\n\\n\r\nThe show takes place in the Japanese Showa period (1926\u20131989) where media wasn\u2019t as developed as today\u2019s and Rakugo was one of the kings of entertainment. People from around the town gathered before the stages to see various Rakugo stars perform their charm. One of the Rakugo master from the story is Yakima Yuurakutei who gets a surprise visit from a prisoner from the state prison, stating that he wants to be Yakima\u2019s apprentice, learn and perform Rakugo. This persuasive act of the prisoner reminds him of his age old friend Sukeroku (who was as stubborn as the new guy is.) Soon, the story drags the viewers back to fifty years, as the rest of the show tells a tale of a flashback memory, which is equally interesting, tragic and dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe show features five main characters, but the leading characters of the show drags down to only two; Yakima and Sukeroku. The two characters are complete opposite of each other, while Sukeroku is funny, jolly and always looking for quick money whenever he can, Yakima is grumpy, moody and patient. The show starts their tale from the day these characters first met, and slowly continues to tell the story of their lifetime. As I was watching the show, I said to myself, no way these two can be friends. But to my utter surprise, the show pulls of this hard task and slowly develops the characters where the friendship become real strong as if the characters are like brothers. The characters are what pulls this show and makes the anime interesting. In fear of becoming monotonous, the story also featured an important side character, Miyokichi, who has significant effect in the long run of the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThis is a tale of talent, tradition, envy, betrayal, love and most of all, the Japanese art of storytelling in middle age. The story starts with giving you a hint of what happens in the future, and drags you to the past. It then shows you how the characters meet their ultimate fate, which you knew from the first episode. This is an art that was not new, but was interesting nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s ost\u2019s are heavily traditional, and I think some are even custom made with actual instruments, which is very rare in the industry. The show\u2019s opening is pretty gothic not gonna lie; Gothic, but good. Reminded me of Tatami\u2019s ed. The ed of the show is made of trumpet solo, again, feels like custom made with the use of actual instruments. If that is what they did, then props to the show.\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show is intentionally made with light pallets, and considering it is a pure drama show, the pallet fits perfectly. But to be entirely honest, it\u2019s as mediocre as it can get. The art wasn\u2019t the best of this season, wasn\u2019t the worst either. I liked the portrayal of the characters and how their looks fit with their personality, that was something.\\n\r\nVoice Acting\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting of this show was top notch, considering the voice actors literally had to perform Rakugo in the studio; I can only say, well done. The voice acting fit the characters properly, made everyone\u2019s personality unique. Overall, my verdict for the voice acting is, they really did a good job with it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, I had no idea what Rakugo was, but the show introduced me to Rakugo. And to my utter surprise, I enjoyed that. I enjoyed most of the Rakugo\u2019s the characters performed in the show. And considering they also told a standalone story of two friends simultaneous journey, that explored aspects of life such as talent, love, hatred, envy, misery, and friendship, Sh\u014dwa Genroku Rakugo Shinj\u016b earns a solid\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nWith a recommendation to stream it whenever possible. The show is available in Crunchyroll for streaming, and the show is getting a second season adaptation. So, if you want to visit this work of art, this might be the best time to explore, before that release of second season. Thank you all for your patience. I will see you guys on my next review.",
