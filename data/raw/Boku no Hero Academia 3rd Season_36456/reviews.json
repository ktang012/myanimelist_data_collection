            "content": "My Hero Academia is no longer the 2nd coming of Hunter x Hunter. Rather, it is starting to look like the 2nd coming of Fairy Tail. \r\nStory:\r\nWe don't really have any plot or driving motion in the series anymore. The lack of build-up in former seasons is backfiring hard, and the pacing which is all over the place is not helping. The content itself is practically pure heroism for the sake of it, and heroes winning because they are the main characters. Really starting to look like it's made by Marvel. \r\nThe new arc is really bad. First part of the \"training\" ending in 5minutes without there being any content whatsoever. At least series like Yu Yu Hakusho --which did the same thing-- had different routes which people could choose within the forest. HxH did the same thing and it lasted 11 episodes and it was fantastic. Naruto did the same thing and introduced key plot elements and characters. In Hero Academia's case, there is no content behind it. All characters just use their trademark moves once. Literally nothing happens outside it. After a hard day of doing the said nothing, we get some manservice/fanservice, women and men bathing because apparently that's the point of this series now.\\n\\n\r\nI am afraid the word \"terrible\" is not even enough to describe the current writing. Fanservice fillers, romantic feelings used as a running gag. The main content is comedy. C o m e d y. Jokes that aren't funny at all. The pinnacle of the humor was a scene where dude ate cake while lifting weights. Thus far, the series has focused most on eating food. What type of a person writes FTS like this? This isn't shokugeki no souma... The series doesn't even look like it's based to a written story, more like seems to be some premade story macro which the author forgot to fill with content.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters are the reason why I am watching this show, they are being handled really poorly. Much like with the story, there is no development with the characters either. Unless we consider asspulled power control \"development\". The filler where they act out of character and look like clowns is really not serving any of them. Does Bones not know what Source Fillmaker is? We literally don't need soft-core fanservice, thank you very much. \\n\\n\r\nKacchan has been super annoying since the very beginning and looks like he is suffering the Sasuke-effect forever and always, much like that Bullet for my valentine song. It's so frustrating and unnecessary. Could they please develop him into a decent character already instead of making him look like the combination of Hulk and the main dude from Black Clover. So many of the rest of our heroes-in-training only radiate comedy, not characteristics. I don't like that very much.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains are the best and the worst part. Really simple-minded characters who have basically no reason to do anything they are doing. Giggling evily because they so evil and whenever they do anything it's practically keikaku doori tier meme. At least they bring some interesting factors to the series and look cool, some even badass. They are supposed to be the half of this show, after all what are heroes without villains... Yet at the same time they seem to only exists for the heroes. Like in episodes 3-4 \"yo, we came here now because lol iunno we wanna scare you.\" This is not how you write villains. No matter how you look at it, the boss villain had no reason to send anyone there. Keikaku doori once again I guess.    \\n\\n\r\nThe only character who gets thru any development is an angry kid who is mad at heroes.. hmmm. doesn't this sound familiar? Anyone remember the part where Sasuke and Naruto learned to control chakra with anti-gravity trees? Didn't we have this exact kid right there. In here, he is just so random it's almost as if the author thought he was cool in Naruto and wanted to put his own here.  He even says the same line \"like person like that exists\". Believing all ninjas, oh sorry, I mean heroes are selfish. smh\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\\n\r\nBones has been putting effort into it and never stopped. It's the same as before and that's exactly how it should be. Of course, the series could use approximately 20 times less of those comedic relief scenes. Some nice songs are present, but there really should be more. Many of them don't really shine,. Especially the battle OST is there in the shadows behind prioritized voice acting. The OP song is really acquired taste tho. I like how it seems better every time I hear it. Voice acting is obviously identical.. outside the out of character filler where they acted like bunch of clowns, of course.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment::\\n\\n\r\nI like this show. I have always liked this show, but damn if I don't wish it was better. There is practically nothing new (currently) for a person such as myself who has seen all BTS series already. I can safely say that Hero Academia is currently being as bad as shonen series ever are. This isn't what the characters deserve at all.\\n",

            "content": "After a great first season and a no less than fantastic second season My Hero Academia is back at it again with season 3, not even six months since season 2 ended. I wrote in my early review for season 2 that I was skeptical that it would be able to carry on being as well refined as season 1 was. Now that the second season is done there is no doubt that I was worried all for nothing. This is the exact thing I'm feeling heading in to the third season of Hero Acca. I'll just sit back and enjoy the ride, cause Ican already tell it'll be a good one. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Great (8)\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much that can be said about Hero Acca that hasn't been said already. The story is nothing really special in terms of its originality but it\u2019s in the sheer polish and perfection of the tropes and standard shounen elements that Hero Acca shines. Season 1 we had the very standard, but brilliantly phased, origin story of our main hero as well as most of the lovable supporting cast. Season 2 we got the best god damn tournament arc I've had the pleasure of beholding alongside the obligatory teacher-student-mastering-your-power-arc\u2122 but adding some great curveball such as a whole new main villain which overshadowed most other antagonists not only in the show itself but most of the shounen genre. Season 3 has thus far only begun, but by a handful of episodes in we've already set the groundwork for some of the best character interactions with the increased focus on Hero Class-B as well as the huge cast of newly introduced villains, some of which I hope can match Stain in either depth or impact. Sadly, it still gets points taken for lack of originality but since the show is clearly not going for being original at this point, I wouldn't say that its inherent lack of originality hurts the show as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Great (8)\\n\\n\r\nWith dynamic movements that really feel like they've got some weight behind them and fewer static panning shots than ever the general animation of Hero Acca remains as great as the previous season which itself was quite a leap up from the first season. I think that what truly makes Hero Acca look so nice is the lack of any major dips in animation quality generally found in most other anime. This consistency lets the viewer get deeper immersed in the show. Instead, Hero Acca has a tendency to suddenly spike in animation quality, seen many times during the previous seasons, especially season 2. I have no doubt in my mind that season 3 will deliver in that regard, partially confirmed by the fantastic fight scene in episode 4. It's really in the art department that Hero Acca suffers. Or rather, the background art and world that suffers. I've mentioned the lack of originality of this show multiple times already, but never is it as apparent as when looking at the background art of Hero Acca. It could be replaced with the background art of most other shows and the average viewer wouldn't even know something had changed. This is a critique of Hero Acca in general, and not just season 3. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Great (8)\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is great as ever, delivering deep, believable emotions despite the language barrier. Neither sound design or soundtrack is really worth mentioning though since they're in all honesty pretty forgettable. The fact that I can't really remember any of the background music reinforces that statement. It works well enough for setting the right tone for the scene, but it simply doesn't stick with you when you've finished the episode as some great soundtracks can. So, based on all of this how come sound still receives an 8? Simple. Because the OP and ED are kick ass, as usual. Rarely will a show keep me hooked from the very first second all the way until the screen fades to black. Not to mention the story that has been told continually through all the openings ever since the first season. I highly suggest you check out Mother's Basement's video on the topic. Hands down some of the best OPs and EDs out there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fantastic (9)\\n\\n\r\nIt's with its characters that Hero Acca always has shone brighter than most and the show shows no intent on giving up on developing its characters to a downright astounding point. If there\u2019s one thing that most shows fail to do it would be to develop a character. While simply giving a character a believable motivation and one or two personalizing traits might seem enough at times that would not be good enough for Hero Acca. Not even as an introduction to a character. I could bring up the best episode of the series so far, Deku vs Todoroki in the Tournament arc (fight me) as an example of absolutely stunning implementation of character development but since that discussion rightfully belongs to a season 2 review, I\u2019ll use a brand-new character as an example (light spoilers for ep 1-2 of season 3), Kouta Izumi who is probably the most interesting character of season 3 thus far. \\n\\n\r\nKouta has a very complex heritage to deal with, being the son of two heroes called Water Hose who both died fighting the villain Muscular when he was very young. Because of his youth at the time of his parents\u2019 passing he couldn\u2019t quite understand the why and how of it all. He felt that they left him alone. This has caused Kouta to feel a deep distain towards not only heroes but hero culture as a whole. Without hero culture, his parents might still be alive. The complex part of this comes from his pure love towards his parents blended with his rage and hatred towards all that they represented. He\u2019s too young to see that by spitting on hero culture, he doesn\u2019t just disregard his parents\u2019 ambitions and beliefs but also their love for him because there is no doubt that they did what they did every single day to keep others safe, to keep him safe. He has even gone as far as to set aside his quirk he inherited from them, thus disrespecting their very memory. The fact that he loved his parents more than anything while displaying such hate towards everything they stood for which for all intents and purposes hatred towards them directly. \\n\\n\r\nKoutas character reminds me of Todoroki and his until recently neglected quirk inherited from his father who he hated more than anything until Deku helped him realize his own person and who he intends to be and to step out of his father\u2019s shadow, but if I got started on that again I\u2019d be here all day. \\n\\n\r\nThe groundwork laid down by the previous seasons of Hero Acca guarantees that most of the cast is as developed as they could possibly ever need to be but with the introduction of brand new villains and a greater focus on Hero Class 1-B there is plenty of work to be done still. Only time will tell what happens but if the past is anything to go by I\u2019ve got nothing but excitement for this season. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Outstanding (10)\\n\\n\r\nI probably haven\u2019t enjoyed a show as intently as Hero Acca Season 3 since well\u2026 Season 2 probably. The excitement I feel every time I fire up another episode can only be matched by shows such as Gurren Lagann and Mob Psycho 100. My eyes are glued to the screen from start to finish. I can go from sporting the widest grin or laughing along with the characters to feeling real despair or wiping away tears from my cheeks within the margin of a few minutes, all in pure enjoyment. This show made its well-deserved way to my top 5 nearly by pure heart alone. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Fantastic (9)\\n\\n\r\nHero Acca Season 3 stays on the same path as its previous seasons to become a great classic shounen. From a stellar story filled to the brim with polished and extremely enjoyable clich\u00e9s to some of the most alive animation and fantastic openings and ending to hands down the most well-developed cast of its size I\u2019ve ever seen. I love every single thing about Hero Acca, and season 3 looks to be nothing if not more Hero Acca!\\n",

            "content": "I always considered mha for a mediocre enjoyable show. 60 episodes in and we had very little story progression and world building which is dissapoiting.\r\nSeason 3 started of with a typical generic school trip. Few attempts of comedy here and there that simply didn't land. Other than that some todoroki development and deku vs muscular build up were only things worth seeing first 3 episodes.\r\nCharacters training was much longer than it should have been. Wasted some time imo. Deku vs muscular fight was okay. The animation was great but again it was so generic and it lacked both creativity and choreography. No tactics used atall. It was just a flashy fight with 2 dudes punching each other with fists. I know, i know you are gonna say \"BuT MHa fIgHTs aRe ABouT StorY\" so is almost every fight in anime, that doesn't mean it should be mindless. On the plus side deku got some development. \\n\\n\r\nAm i the only one that noticed how repetitive mha is? \\n\r\nSeason 1 is basically characters training, villains invading\\n\r\nseason 2 is trounament arc, villains invading and finally season 3 is characters training and villains invading. There is nothing new. There is no bigger, deeper plot to get invested in to.\\n\r\nLike always bunch of dumb villains that lack motivation appeared and i simply didn't care for them. There was that tsundare girl, that discount dead pool guy, mindless musuclar who is just killing for the sake of killing, that discount stain guy that was like a lizard or something, dude with big lips and uhhh what was his name again? That dude that's obviously todorokis brother or something. It's so predictable. On the plus side one thing that mha does good is the character desgins. Despite them looking goofy at times. At least they are memorable even tho the characters themselves aren't.\\n\r\nLong story short students fight some villains and bakugo gets captured even tho bakugo clearly could have prevented it but he didn't because... he is a angry brat that wants to be acnkowladged.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is AFO vs All might fight... Again some good animation even tho there were some errors. We still don't know anything about AFO's motivation like with almost every vilalin in this show. He was supposed to be badass and his OST was supposed to be scary but it just wasn't. Not to mention his generic quirk... All might vs AFO was the peak of the season tho. It told the great story and it was good for all mights character. But we all knew all might was gonna win and he wins the most generic way possible. With final punch... The fight was dull from the actaul fighting perspective.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is just too safe. There is no suspenese, we just know good guys are gonna win. Even when bakugo was kidnapped he got retrieaved at the end. Everyone was just injured and they recovered. Even tho all might is my favorite character, his death would have made this show so much better. \\n\\n\r\nSecond arc was sooooooooo boring even tho it was filled with action. There was literally almost nothing big happening. There was a whole episode dedicated to rooms lmao. And again we get to the generic tournament arc with too many boring side cahracters that i don't care for. Mha is introducing too many, too fast. Side characters are very forgetable and the development is unievene. Even tho the cast is better than the terrible plot of this show it's still highly overrated. Too many bland characters with generic motivations and view points. Bakugo vs Deku was actaully good. I like bakugo more now even tho i still think his peronality is forced. Like why do you scream so much? I get that people had high expectations for you since birth but why so much? Tone it down ffs lmao. He is literally yelling at everyone around himself. It makes his personality unbelievable. The fight itself had the best choreography out of the 3. The animation was great too. \"The big 3\" was pretty overhyped. In temrs of character designs they are basically naruto, sasuke and sakura. Mirio is only one with potential out of the 3.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style this season is basic like always. All in all mha is enjoyable show with terrible plot. This season has very little story progression. The show itself doesn't stand out in any way.\\n\\n\r\nP.S people are giving mha too much credit for executing the generic tropes well. It doesn't do it THAT well. It's a overstatement.",

            "content": "The beloved shounen series is back again, adapting some of the manga\u2019s finest arcs. \r\nAlthough it starts with a slightly unnecessary, but well-handled recap episode, it gets right to the story afterwards, starting off with some cool set-up and character moments. Then, things get serious. \r\nSuddenly, villains are everywhere, putting everyone to a test. \r\nWhat is so loveable about shounen is the theme of not giving up and pushing to the limit, overcoming your obstacles no matter how great they are. Which BNHA exemplifies. On one side with the battles themselves. Especially the fight between Izuku and the physically superior Muscular will have you hyped,with its awesome visuals, set-up and epic sound. On the other side with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first arc of the season, multiple characters get a lot more time to shine, showing what they are made of. So we get to see them use their powers more and work together. Aside from that, class B also gets a spotlight on them after they were introduced in Season 2. Not forgetting to mention the cool villains, each of them unique and promising, with special mention here to Toga, Twice and Dabi. It\u2019s so great to see everyone getting moments of character. The large cast of BNHA has always been entertaining due to its diversity and organic feeling, mostly with all the interactions taking place between classmates. All of the characters are likeable and quirky, but they are also distinct and unique in their own way. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is on point again with its artstyle, cinematography and most appealing of all: the simply awesome fights. Studio Bones reminds us again what they are known for. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening, it took a little while to get used to. However, it still has some great visuals and a track that will be in the playlists of many fans, even if the two of them don\u2019t seem to mix together at first. The ending is loveable and cute, giving some nice time spent with everyone in manga panel style. However, let\u2019s not forget the epic music that plays at the moments it counts. You know, the moments that will stick out in our memories. \\n\\n\r\nThere were moments that made my heart race. I\u2019m enjoying the anime thoroughly, and will see it through towards the finale, expecting to see more of what we love about Boku no Hero Academia. \\n\\n",

            "content": "(Note: I wrote this review right after episode 9 of season 3 of BNHA, so if you want to read my thoughts on episode 10 and 11, go to the section that starts with \u201cEDIT.\u201d This isn\u2019t a traditional review of season 3, it is more of a retrospective for the entire series up to this point. This is not my full review, as it is too long, if you want a link to my full review, pm me.)\r\nConsidering the praise that Boku No Hero gets, a lot of the fans of the series usually include the clause that the reasons that BNHA is popular,is more so from the execution of its concepts and themes more so than the actually originality of it\u2019s premise or setting. I can agree to this notion, what BNHA excels at is the execution of its ideas, at least compared to its lackluster premise. But in many ways, this has only secured the anime as being mediocre instead of actively bad. There are many things that BNHA does right, but this never overcomes the myriad of both narrative and thematic problems that comes with the nature of it\u2019s story. What should also be said is that BNHA when compared to most other shounens, fails at basic narrative and thematic storytelling. This retrospective will contain spoilers for every season of BNHA, Naruto, The Law of Ueki, Madoka Box, HxH, FMAB, Shokugeki No Soma S1-S2, YYH, and Giant Robo: the Day the Earth Stood Still.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned in my previous review for BNHA Season 2, I feel like the character motivations of most of the characters are pretty decent if not good; I can still attest to this, the main draw of BNHA is its character. I still also agree with my assessment of the lack of personality traits that each character has. Under further consideration, I feel like the characters have more problems than just the dearth of legitimate personalities within the show. The most prevalent of the problems is the amount of characters that the audience is expected to care about, in class 1-A, there are 20 students and 6 teachers in total. This is the \u201cmain cast\u201d of characters, and as an audience, we are expected to care about every single one of them. Unfortunately, the amount of main characters reduce the amount of screen time any one character gets to a handful of minutes. In season two, Uraraka, Todoroki, Iida, Yaoyorozu, and Tokoyami all had character \u201carcs,\u201d but, calling the scene or two that each character got a character arc would in actuality be exaggerating the amount of development any one character got. \\n\\n\r\nUraraka\u2019s arc was maybe my favorite of the bunch, as the feeling of failure and disappointing those you love, is more or less a trancedential feeling that everyone has experienced at some point. The problem with her arc is that it felt more or less truncated because we really had no reason to really care about Uraraka winning the sports festival, she really never had the necessity to accept failure and the sports festival was a poor outlet for this arc as well. The sports festival may be an important event to the school and the economy of Japan, there really isn\u2019t that high of stakes for the actual students who attend UA. Although it may be a good opportunity for the students, the sports festival occurs every year, and it has very little bearing on the student\u2019s lives while attending UA. There was the empty threat that those who don\u2019t perform well at the sports festival might be moved class 1B, but knowing that they both cover the same course material, the actual changing of classes seems very stakeless. There was room for Uraraka\u2019s arc to potentially be amazing, her motivation to become a hero to help her parent\u2019s struggling financial state is compelling. But, the placement of the arc within the sports festival and the little amount of time we see Uraraka spend interacting with her parents, makes her arc one of the more lackluster of the bunch. It would have been much more intriguing had the audience got to see what Uraraka\u2019s home life is actually like, more or less, the audience only gets a monologue from Uraraka about her homelife; her monologue also doesn\u2019t go into enough detail to really sympathise with her struggle as much as an actual scene at her house would bring to the audience. I feel like aside from seeing Uraraka\u2019s home life, the other thing the anime/manga should have done was to make UA much more cutthroat than it comes across as in the show. A good example of what they could have done was to create a school setting more like the one from Shokugeki No Soma. Toutsuki Culinary Academy feels cutthroat, this is partially because of the personalities of the characters in the anime/manga, but the real cause of this feeling is that the threat of expulsion is always hanging above the heads of the characters. There is no arc within the first two seasons of Shokugeki No Soma where any of the characters feel secure in their position at the academy, and this is what BNHA needed to make Uraraka\u2019s arc compelling.\\n\\n\r\nTodoroki and Iida both suffer from similar problems that cause their arcs to be as lackluster as Uraraka\u2019s. The main problem that I have with their arcs is that any subtle development of the characters are quickly undercut by the writing. Todoroki\u2019s arc was perhaps the most fascinating from the second season, it had themes on abuse and identity that I could personally relate to. My family aren\u2019t abusive, but I was attracted to the themes of accepting one\u2019s own identity. Unfortunately, the lead up and pay off of Todoroki\u2019s arc undercut all of the dramatic setup of the premise. Ultimately, I believe in the intelligence of the audience of a story when it comes to understanding symbols and themes; Kohei Horikoshi, does not. My main problem with Todoroki\u2019s arc was the lack of subtlety in the resolution of the arc. What can be said, and what should be said, is that trauma is a deeply personal issue that when written about with fictional characters should be overcome through deep introspection and somber monologues; but, the resolution of Todoroki\u2019s arc was Deku screaming \u201cit\u2019s your power as well!\u201d while in a fight between the two of them towards the end of the sports festival. After the festival arc, Todoroki approaches Deku and says something akin to \u201cI\u2019m not totally over the trauma, but what you said to me really helped.\u201d I feel like this stole a potentially emotional realization from the character, and the lack or subtlety in the character writing of the arc caused me to have a sour taste in my mouth. \\n\\n\r\nIida\u2019s arc on the other hand struggles due to the awkward fitting nature of the arc to the character it\u2019s attached to; At the end of the sports festival, it is revealed that Iida\u2019s older brother, Ingenium, was hospitalized by Stain, this leads Iida to try to take revenge against the villain. The main problem is that up to this point, Iida has been a stoic character. Thus the portrayal of him giving in to his emotions feels more like a wrestling heel turn rather than a natural progression of his inherent character traits. I am fine with the idea of Iida giving into his emotions, but after Stain is defeated, he returns back to what he always was. Deku\u2019s virtue signalling yet again made the arc feel relatively week; the flow of the story telling at the point in the anime felt very off. I am no storytelling expert, but what I can say is that Deku and Todoroki saving Iida from Stain as they discuss the virtues or heroism, was perhaps the most boring way to resolve this arc. Iida pretty much reverts back to the character he always was, I would say he might actually be a worse character because of this arc if anything. I always saw Iida as the moral compass of the series, in season 1 and season 3 so far, this has been true. I felt like Kohei Horikoshi missed the chance to make a much better arc here; What could have happened was the family of students at UA could have been targeted by Stain in order to filter out students that can\u2019t handle the trauma that professional heroes have to deal with on an average basis. Deku\u2019s mom could have been targeted and either seriously injured or killed, and he could have been the one that went after Stain. This could have been a great chance to see what Deku would do if the villain he had to catch, harmed a family member. Iida could have been the moral compass in this arc for Deku, and this would have given the Deku (The main character of the series) more reason to become a hero than his stated goal throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nYaoyorozu and Tokoyami\u2019s arc both feel really truncated when we consider their inclusion in the actual series. I guess the one I would start off by discussing is Yaoyorozu\u2019s arc, mostly because it is non-existent but it\u2019s presence in the series has been used to counter my notion that the characters in BNHA seem flawless. Her arc was about gaining more confidence in her own abilities; but the audience were never given any reason to care about her confidence issues up to that point. I would also argue that there was no evidence that she had these issues up until the midterm exam arc where she has to beat Aizawa with Todoroki. In this arc, her confidence problems are introduced and resolved by the end of the episode, so considering it to be actual development would be hyperbolic to say the least; to the average viewer, she has always acted like she was at the end of the \u201carc.\u201d Yaoyorozu, like most characters in BNHA is a non-character, she may do things in the story but she doesn\u2019t really have any traits that she can call her own. Most of the side character\u2019s personalities blend together to make any if not all of their dialogue interchangeable. A good example of this unique trait that the side characters have in BNHA, Episode 8 in S3 gave to us the \u201cI want to save Bakugo too, but it\u2019s dangerous\u201d episode. In this episode, every character at some point says a line like that; there is not a unique reaction from any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nPeople have also argued to me that Tokoyami had a character arc in S2, and had plenty of room to develop. This argument stems from the fact that Tokoyami doesn\u2019t have full control over his shadow abilities. What I would argue against that however, is that isn\u2019t a character flaw nor is it a thematic idea that can be built off of; this is mostly because most people conflate character growth and character development, these ideas are similar but not the same. Character development is the progression of a character\u2019s personality. Character growth on the other hand is when a character\u2019s skills and abilities become more competent. Tokoyami doesn\u2019t really have any character flaws, even if he gains better control over his quirk, I doubt his personality would change in any meaningful way.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this is to say, is that the bigger cast of BNHA might be the biggest problem that the anime has; most characters don\u2019t have enough screen time to develop in any meaningful way. What I have noticed is that everyone says that BNHA is building up to a grander thematic narrative about the nature of heroism; I can agree that BNHA is about the circumstances and environment that create a hero. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think BNHA is actually saying anything about heroism. In my review on S2, I mentioned my myriad of problems with the Stain Arc, and I still hold to my thoughts on that particular arc. Stains arc was meant to justify the setting of the series, it was supposed to discuss the trivialization of heroism within the setting. Yet we are given very little reason to actually agree with his stance on heroism, the series is cognisant of the thematic flaws of having a story on heroism being set in a hero school, but it doesn\u2019t take any serious action to discuss its merits as a setting.\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019m writing this, we are 9 episodes into season 3 of BNHA. At this point, Deku is still the same character he has always been. At this point, the writing is the same quality it has always been. At this point the setting is as dull as it has always been. In many ways, this season so far has epitomizes the problems of BNHA as a whole much more so than the other two seasons have. From this point on, I\u2019m going to be drawing a lot of comparisons between BNHA and other shounen series.\\n\\n\r\nNaruto can be called the muse for BNHA, the influence that BNHA draws on from Naruto is clear as day; In many ways, it is the Naruto of the new anime generation. Naruto however, is actually really good and doesn\u2019t suffer from the same style of character writing that plagues BNHA. To prove my point, I would like to draw comparisons between the parallel characters in both series. First of all, I think there might be some merit in discussing the characters of Naruto and Deku on a thematic level and the quality of both character\u2019s development throughout their respective series. I would like to also emphasize that I am only 99 episodes into Naruto, so I haven\u2019t actually seen it to its conclusion; most of the conclusions I\u2019m about to draw is based off of my current knowledge of both series.\\n\\n\r\nWhen comparing Deku and Naruto, what should be mentioned first is the motivations of both characters. They both have similar motivations and I feel like discussing that quality may illuminate my problems with Deku as a character. At the beginning of Naruto, it is revealed to the audience that at some point Hidden Leaf village was attacked by a Nine Tailed Fox; this demon cost the lives of a huge proportion of the population of Hidden Leaf village, it also couldn\u2019t be defeated by normal means and had to be sealed in Naruto Uzumaki at the cost of his parent\u2019s life. Being parentless and having the Nine Tailed Fox sealed within him, he was ostracized since he was born. This lead him to become somewhat of a delinquent because of the lack of attention he received from his teachers and other authority figures. This caused him to want to become the Hokage, and this also satisfies his need for attention. At school, he is bullied and ostracized even more because he is a slow learner, his slow learning is caused by the Nine Tails and how it biologically messes with his body. But, being a part of squad 7 and going on various ninja missions slowly lead to him gaining more and more maturity as the series goes on, it also lead to him gaining more friends and overall gaining elements of his life that as a child he didn't have. Various characters like Jiraiya and Tsunade become parent figures to him, and Sasuke and Sakura fill in various gaps in his life.\\n\\n\r\nDeku on the other hand was bullied as a child because he was quirkless, this lead him to have a complex about this aspect of his life and as such he begins idolizing All Might and hero society based on how they protect the weak. This leads to him dedicating his life to become a hero. After displaying an act of heroism in front of All Might, All Might decides to give him his quirk and train him to become the world\u2019s greatest hero. So the main problem with Deku\u2019s character is how his motivations are very barebone, as a character, he doesn\u2019t have much going on. What makes Deku worse as a character is that he already has all of the qualities of a hero; so we don\u2019t really see Deku develop, we just see him becoming a better hero in terms of combat. This makes any conflict involving Deku really boring, and the potential drama regarding him is lackluster at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe character that Deku has the most in common with from Naruto is probably Rock Lee; but the key differences between both characters are important ones, and they shouldn\u2019t be overlooked when analysing both series. Rock Lee is a side character first and foremost, this is where he belongs as a character because aside from being lovable, he doesn\u2019t have many traits that could be built upon if he had his own story. Rock Lee was born with the inability to use genjutsu and ninjutsu, in school he was bullied for this; but, the society of Hidden Leaf village prioritizes ninjas and they are the most respected members of Hidden Leaf society. As such, he pushes himself to the limit to prove that he can become a ninja, so he pushes his body to its utmost limits to master taijutsu. He wasn\u2019t given his power, and when he is in a fight the dramatic weight that comes with his loss is much heavier than Deku\u2019s. Rock Lee has clear, defined, limits and these limits come to ahead when he fights Gaara only to get disheartened after he loses because it made it clear that it\u2019s impossible for him to overcome those who have the ability to use genjutsu and ninjutsu. After he recovers from his hospitalization, he goes back to train in order to someday become a fully fledged ninja. Deku is given one of the most powerful abilities in the series, but it felt very unearned. When we consider the dramatic weight that Deku remaining quirkless could have brought with it, the series could have given Deku more depth than what he has at the moment. Deku has a good foundation as a character, the execution of characterization in a few places was also fantastic, but Deku could have been better had certain choices regarding his power been made.\\n\r\nKota Izumi from season 3 also has a counterpart from Naruto; he is essentially a worse written Konohamaru. Yaoyorozu feels like a poorly executed Ino mirror. Aizawa is just a different version of Kakashi. Todoroki is essentially a toned down Sasuke. Uraraka\u2019s brand of uselessness is pretty much a mix between Hinata and Sakura. There is very  few aspects of BNHA that are actually original, and this is a problem because the story isn\u2019t well enough executed to overlook how derivative the story is. That being said there are aspects of the show that I do like. All Might has a legitimately great character arc. Unfortunately, these aspects are few and far between. \\n\\n\r\nWhen we examine the setting of BNHA, the first thing one may notice is how it normalizes fantasy. This comes with a myriad of benefits but the drawbacks that come with it\u2019s setting far outweighs the benefits. The population of the world is 80% super humans, but the world does not looks different in any way. The multitude of institutions that were created in a response to super powers are all very unoriginal and they all seem way too bureaucratic; the setting, more or less seems like a generic anime Japan rather than a realistic portrayal of a setting like the one in BNHA. Yet BNHA isn\u2019t fantastical enough to be compelling, the fantasy of BNHA is very subdued and overly regulated. In the mrbtongue video called \u201cTUN: Magic\u201d he makes the argument that what makes fantasy compelling is how it represents the in between of reality and imagination and the normalization process of most stories only weakens the overall quality of the fantasy setting. Although quirks aren\u2019t exactly magic, the normalization of the quirks and the realistic system for quirks zaps away all of the creativity either way. It says a lot when the most fantastical power the audience has seen thus far is Mr.Compress\u2019 ability to trap people in marbles. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting of BNHA is one of the weakest areas of the entire series, as such, I would like to compare the magic/power settings of FMAB and HxH to the power setting of BNHA. Since BNHA yearns to be realistic, a comparison between alchemy and quirks is merited. Alchemy from FMAB is probably the most grounded magic system in any shounen anime, it has hard rules that the characters have to abide by. \u201cHumankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost.\u201d Alchemy isn\u2019t a power that can create, it is inherently transformative in nature; Alchemy is also a rigid in nature, those who don\u2019t follow the rules or practices of alchemy usually get punished. This is how the Elric Brothers became deformed, since FMAB is a story about trauma and greed, a rigid magic system where those who use forbidden teachings or tries to against the laws of alchemy are punished, was inherently a good decision for the story. But on a minute to minute basis, alchemy feels pretty realistic within its setting because of the effort made to make it feel real within the setting. A great example of this is the alchemy circles, in order to perform alchemy, alchemy circles are necessary (unless you are the Elric Brothers). Edward Elric doesn\u2019t need to draw a alchemy circle before using alchemy, but he does have a prerequisite that most other alchemists have; he has to clap his hands together and then touch a surface before he can transform anything. This was a conscious choice by the mangaka because it connects to the themes of religion within the show since his hands clapped together look like an act of piety, and he never had to do this before he meet the Truth. This is an ironic power because he is an atheist. So from FMAB, we get a very rigid, realistic, and thematically relevant, magic system.    \\n\\n\r\nThis is what BNHA should have been like with its power/magic system, here and there we get glimpses of what could have been but these glimpses quickly come in conflict with how quirks actually work within the setting. 80% of humans in the setting of BNHA is born with a quirk, these quirks very somewhere between useful to useless abilities. These abilities more or less come with drawbacks as well. Since quirks are based on the biology of the person who uses them, it is similar to using a specific muscle or body part, overuse leads to great strain on the user. Mineta can only throw a small amount of his weird hair balls before his head starts bleeding, Kaminari isn\u2019t insulated to electricity and his head short circuits if he uses his power to much. In the S2 of BNHA, this is a pretty important plot point in the fight between Deku and Todoroki, Todoroki in that arc chose to not use his fire power because of his strained relationship with his dad. This ultimately leads to his body freezing up because he overuses his ice half. His power was intended to balance eachother out if he utilizes one half more so than the other. So far, I\u2019m pretty sure that the power system sounds pretty decent in BNHA; however, the system actually doesn\u2019t work that way. There are a myriad of heroes that don\u2019t have drawbacks when over using one's own abilities. A great example of this is Tokoyami, his ability is pretty much just magic, and unlike Todoroki, Mineta, and Kaminari, his power doesn\u2019t come with any physical strain. His power only has one drawback, and that drawback is that his power can become uncontrollable at night. Deku also doesn\u2019t have clear drawbacks with his power, I guess the one drawback is that you have to be moderately fit in order for the power to settle in your body. Kirishima also has no drawbacks for using his hardening ability. Tsuyu is just a frog. Mezo\u2019s healing and replication abilities don\u2019t seem to have any clear limits, nor does he have any real drawbacks for using his abilities like he does.\\n\\n\r\nBNHA\u2019s powers are too realistic to be inherently interesting, but not realistic enough to be immersive; So I want to take a brief aside to discuss HxH and how Nen works. I feel like HxH has one of the best magic systems in all of anime, it does a lot right, it scales, its intuitive, and it\u2019s flexible enough for anything to be possible. This matches the tone of HxH, it\u2019s a story about wonder and freedoms; There is a real sense of adventure in HxH that isn\u2019t present in a lot of other series. It captures this feeling with flying colors, and the magic system of the series is partially responsible for this. Nen, like spirit energy in YYH or chakra in Naruto, is a form of spiritual energy that can be used and refilled over durations of rest. In HxH, Nen can manifest in 6 different ways: Enhancer, emitter, transmuter, conjurer, manipulator, and specialization. Each way Nen can manifest is largely based off of a character\u2019s personality, and the amount of variety in each type of Nen is tremendous. What is also nice about HxH is seeing the characters improve their fighting techniques in various ways; It is also possible to learn techniques from multiple different nen trees at the cost of never mastering a specific tree. If this sounds very game like to you, I would agree, it does sound like a game. But I would argue that it is immensely more interesting than watching Deku just become stronger.\\n\\n\r\nThe power system in BNHA isn\u2019t it\u2019s biggest problem when it comes to the conveyance of fantasy, the powers themselves are very boring. I also have seen shows that have made very similar systems to quirks but succeeded where BNHA has failed. Two good examples of this would be The Law of Ueki and Medaka Box, they both have powers that serve a similar role within the plot and are about the same power level. \\n\\n\r\nThe Law of Ueki, like BNHA, is overall pretty lackluster; both series have similar problems but one area that The Law of Ueki excels at and BNHA fails at, is the concepts for the powers of the characters. What I mean is, BNHA has boring powers, and the mundanity of its powers comes at the cost of the entertainment value of the show. Let\u2019s compare and contrast the powers of BNHA to that of The Law of Ueki.  In BNHA, the main character\u2019s super power is super strength (and speed, it comes with the territory), in Ueki, Ueki has the ability to turn trash into trees (he also has angel powers later on). The side characters of BNHA have super speed, fire and ice powers, lots of them have super strength, the ability to make things float,  weird appendages, and so on and so forth. Let\u2019s now compare that to Ueki: Seiichro Sano has the ability to turn towels into steel so long as he holds his breath. Hideyoshi Sayo has the ability to turn sounds/voices into portraits that he can place on surfaces. Ai Mori has the ability to turn other people into a lover of glasses so long as she gets her opponents to make a cutesy pose. Rinko Jerrard can turn beads into bombs. The inherent level of intrigue between a fight with someone who has the power to turn trash into trees, and a man who can turn towels into steel so long as he holds his breath, is inherently more interesting than anything that has come out of BNHA. This makes BNHA rely on cheap gimmicks to make the fights \u201cinteresting,\u201d but many of these gimmicks are either forgotten about or the audience gets desensitized to the gimmick pretty fast. I have seen Deku break his bones so many times that it feels like it doesn\u2019t even matter when it happens anymore; So far, the second and third seasons made a big deal about him learning how to \u2018fight in a new way,\u2019 but the ham fisted way that he has leveled up so far makes his struggle feel cheapened. He learned how to go full-cowl after hearing about taiyaki in a microwave, and then he jumped around in a alleyway for like an hour. What this is to say, is that the threat of breaking bones in BNHA is around the same level of threat to the character as Yusuke (from YYH) using all of his spirit energy at once. Pair the empty threat of injury in the show with Recovery Girl\u2019s ability to heal injuries, we have a show with very poor direction when it comes to its action. This is made all the worse from the first scene of the first episode, where it is revealed that Deku will become the greatest hero of all time; since the goal of becoming the greatest hero of all time is the assumed end point of the show, we as an audience know that he won\u2019t die. \\n\r\nA show that inhabits a similar setting and similar powers, is Medaka Box. However, Medaka Box has great fight choreography. As such, I want to compare BNHA\u2019s best fight (in my opinion) in terms of choreography with various fights from Medaka Box. Although this might be a controversial opinion, BNHA\u2019s best fight is still probably the fight between Deku and Bakugo; there is a certain energy and interpersonal drama in this fight that isn\u2019t present in All Might vs. Nomu, Deku vs. Todoroki, Iida, Todoroki, and Deku vs. Stain, and Deku vs. Stronk Villain. I will get to my problems with those fights when I discuss the individual arcs and their merits. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, I like the motion/rhythm and the interpersonal drama of Deku vs. Bakugo in season 1 because it represents a bunch of feelings that hit close to home for me; change is a thing that can split friendships apart, rendering them irreparable because certain relationships can survive under very specific circumstances. This is the case with Deku and Bakugo; Although I will get to the specific details of their relationship later, I think a basic understanding of the character conflict is necessary. After Deku gets One For All, Bakugo loses his shit, this is more or less because he finds himself being surpassed by Deku; he sees his childhood \u2018friend\u2019 and he sees how Deku has developed, whereas he himself has been relatively stagnant since then. Deku on the other hand, has to prove to All Might that he is worthy of having One For All. Thus when they come into conflict during a practice simulation, it becomes a conflict between these two conflicting goals. Although the stakes aren\u2019t that high in comparison to any fight from the sports festival arc or really any other arc, the personal drama between the two is largely what makes this compelling. But in terms of choreography, this fight may be the best. The other fights in the series has largely been slug fests that stay relatively stationary, but in this scene we get to see Deku pull off martial arts grapples. The tight corners and the more interesting win condition for Deku (capturing the fake nuclear bomb) more interesting than had it been a straight up fight between the two characters. This also gave the audience a taste of Deku\u2019s intelligence, which at a later point he has been defined for; The show does this by having Deku analyze Bakugo\u2019s combat style as they are fighting, the resolution of the fight, where he uses One For All to destroy the upper floors of the building to give Uraraka the chance to get past Iida and take the fake nuclear bomb. In turn, he took a major blow from Bakugo. This breaks both of his arms, and at this point in the series, the audience hasn\u2019t been properly desensitized to his injuries, this was an intense fight and the resolution of the fight was fun but was also a good moment for characterization for Deku. It reinforces two traits of Deku, it reinforces his self-sacrificing nature, and it displays to the audience his intelligence.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat this fight reminded me of was a similar series of battles that came from Medaka Box S2. The second season of Medaka Box was dedicated to the conflict between the student council and the mysterious elite class. In the world of Medaka Box, there are three different kind of people: normals, specials, and abnormals. Abnormals themselves are split up into two different types, positives and negatives. Normals have no special abilities, specials are those born with talent but don\u2019t really have any attributes that can be considered supernatural, and abnormals have supernatural abilities and between positives and negatives these abilities can be a net positive ability (like supernatural reflexes) or negative abilities that usually come at a cost, like the ability for anything that is touched will rot away. The goal of the elite class is to create more specials and abnormals, it is revealed that the entire campus of the school is a testing ground for these experiments; the current plan that the elite class is going to sacrifice the entire school population to have the few that survive gain the abilities of specials and abnormals. This leads to the intervention of the student council. This leads the student council to infiltrate the elite class\u2019 hideout, the infiltration is intense; its set in a underground facility that seems like it is miles deep and the structure is labyrinthine in structure. \tAs they descend further into the underground facility, the fights and action gets more intense, the tension is palpable when watching this arc because the verticality of the series coincides with the party getting further from safety. Medaka Box uses a specific troupe in shounen anime to its utmost extent, it\u2019s the troupe where the party gets split up and each of them have to overcome obstacles/opponents that make them display their own unique talents and powers. Needless to say, all of the fights are great, I\u2019m not sure if any one fight is better than Deku vs. Bakugo, but the strength of the entire arc and the context surrounding each battle is better than the classroom scenes that surround the aforementioned battle in BNHA. But this season of Medaka Box made a big deal about verticality in it\u2019s cinematography, and that connects to it\u2019s themes on social structures and the idea of power, it is also represented in the majority of the fight scenes in this season; the biggest example of this is Kouki Akune vs. Itami Koga and Youka Naze, where the characters are breaking through floors and pulling off a mix of wrestling moves and kamen rider special attacks. The best I could say about BNHA\u2019s direction is that it doesn\u2019t always use arial swoops and not all of the trees are layered pngs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI guess I am being forgiving when I don\u2019t compare Jojo and Naruto to BNHA in terms of fight choreography; I know that a lot of people like to say that Deku is \u201cone of the smartest shonen protagonists, if not the smartest,\u201d I can say without a doubt in my mind, that he is about average intelligence when we compare him to actually smart characters. In BNHA, there is nothing near the level of Shikamaru vs. Temari, Naruto vs. Neji, or Squad 7 vs. Zabuza. In BNHA, there is nothing like any fight in Jojo. The powers of BNHA are too generic to really make any complex fight where intelligence is really necessary to win, the closest the show ever gets to being actually smart with it\u2019s fights is Deku, Todoroki, and Iida vs. Stain. But, even then, the fight choreography made the fight pretty boring. The hypest moment in the show so far has been All Might vs Nomu, and even then, the fight choreography was rather simple if not a little boring. I am aware of the upcoming fight between All Might and All For One, and that may take the place of the last hypest moment from the show. As I stated earlier, I like everything that has to do with All Might, and the resolution of his arc in the show may make me increase my score for the show up to this point. \\n\\n\r\nThe next part of my review is dedicated to examining every arc up to this point, this is to examine the themes on heroism in BNHA and to elaborate on my problems with the narrative up to this point (in the anime). \\n\\n\r\nThe UA Entrance Exam Arc: The entrance exam arc was a pretty good start to BNHA as a anime; It sets up the goals of the series and is probably the reason why many people believe that Deku is not only the hardest working shonen protagonist, but also the smartest. It\u2019s set up in the first scene of the show that Deku will become the greatest hero of all time, this leads me to believe that the show will be dedicated to showing Deku\u2019s development into the greatest hero of all time. Thus it can be assumed that the story\u2019s themes is about the environment and the circumstances that creates a hero. Cool premise, am I right? I have a bunch of problems with it though, the first and foremost problem is that Deku already is pretty much the embodiment of a hero from the get go. He attempts to save Bakugo in the first episode despite the likelihood that he would die in the process, and by the end of the entrance exam, he is voted into going to UA because he displays all of the character traits of a hero. I guess there is no way to make BNHA a show unless we have Deku get a quirk and have him get accepted into UA; so functionally, I guess this is how he gets in. He works out for a summer until he is given One For All by All Might. At this point in the show, I was thinking that perhaps Deku\u2019s understanding of heroism is superficial and that by attending UA, he will somehow become more heroic. At this point though, I was still a little mad that the show is set at a school. If we recall the premise of the show, it\u2019s roughly about the environment and circumstances that create heroes. BNHA\u2019s answer to this question is: Hero School. It is perhaps the most boring answer to that question, because it trivializes the concept of heroism to be something that can simply be learned at school. I then came to believe that maybe the story will acknowledge this fact, and maybe it will discuss the artifice of hero society. I mean, from the first episode, it came across as most heroes were superficial and did things for publicity, fame, or fortune; I mean even All Might isn\u2019t above the commoditization of heroes in this universe, I mean, there is All Might action figures and posters. When people want you to remember things, they usually say \u201cput a pin in that,\u201d but the fact that All Might is a sell out as well is such an important fact that I want all of you reading this to nail it to a wall with a railroad spike. \\n\\n\r\n\t2. UA Introduction and Villains\u2019 Invade UA Arc (aka everything else in Season 1): For the most part, I can say I enjoyed the rest of the first season of BNHA. I do have a load of problems with the series at this point, but, there isn\u2019t anything too egregious in this part of the series. The worst I can say about this section of the show is that the focus of Deku\u2019s journey to become a hero is slowly lost. The show at this point begins to focus more and more on side characters that I don\u2019t really care for; As I mentioned before, the show feels truncated when it comes to character development and focus because the anime wants to give attention to every character. This makes most of the characters in the series at this point seem more like gag characters or bait waifus/husbandos. At this moment, I was thinking that BNHA would be as superficial and romanticized in its depiction of heroism as it had lead on to be. This prediction held true, but at the moment, I was still optimistic. In this part of the series, we are also introduced to The League of Villains, I thought these guys were going to be relatively minor characters throughout the series, but this notion proved to be incorrect. The climax of season one also made me rock hard because of All Might vs. Nomu; BNHA put a carrot on a stick and was dangling it right in front of my face. It had yet to actually do anything with it\u2019s themes but rumors I heard on the internet was foreshadowing two things to me: One, there will be a tournament arc, and it will be cool. Two, there is a character called Stain, and his arc is all about the deconstruction of heroism. The series had me hooked at that moment, I was destined to watch every season of BNHA to come out at that point, and so far this has held true. \\n\\n\r\n3. The Sports Festival Arc: This arc was a massive disappointment to me, and there are a lot of contributing factors to this disappointment. I guess the biggest reason is that the sports festival arc contains to much content for it\u2019s short run time to really develop upon. BNHA really wants us to care about all of it\u2019s characters, as such, it tries to give each character in the show something to do in this arc. This could be seen as a good thing, but the fact that we have to be introduced to class 1B, have Uraraka\u2019s and Todoroki\u2019s arc, and set up Stain in 11 episodes is a lofty goal for any series. Pair all of that content up with the amount of characters that Kohei Horikoshi wants to give attention to, we have a arc that has horrible narrative focus. Uraraka gets like 3-5 scenes to both start and conclude her arc, a talented director could somehow make this work; but since this is an adaptation, the show more or less has to stick with the source material. \\n\\n\r\nEverything in this arc seems like it was seriously rushed, the most egregious example of this is Todoroki\u2019s arc. Todoroki\u2019s arc has a lot of strong parts to it, it gives us a very great backstory to Todoroki, and it goes a long way to set up certain setting details that I thought were going to be relevant later. In many ways, it also contextualizes Endeavor as a character to the audience and it reinforces the idea that heroism is dead in BNHA. That being said, the arc is so fraught with problems that the construction of the arc seems a bit misguided from the beginning. I think Kohei Horikoshi wanted to discuss trauma, but he has no experience writing about such topics, so it comes off across like he had no idea on what he was going to do with the character. I guess I should elaborate further on this problem; the main problem with Todoroki\u2019s arc is how Deku resolves Todoroki\u2019s trauma. As I stated earlier, trauma is a pervasive, it isn\u2019t a character flaw, and nor should it be treated as such. Kohei Horikoshi treats it as such, his development is very unnatural; it feels like he is a wrestler that pulled a heel turn. He is portrayed as a villain because of his trauma, but his motivations seem very reasonable, so I can\u2019t really side with Deku when he reforms Todoroki. The show treats Todoroki\u2019s trauma as a character flaw, something he could get over easily if he has some sort of realization. This steals a very introspective development arc from Todoroki, he could have been one of the greatest characters in BNHA if he was given the development required to properly make a recovery arc compelling. Instead, Kohei Horikoshi decided that the best way to resolve Todoroki\u2019s trauma was to have Deku yell at him for twenty or so minutes, contained in the most boring fight scene I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I should talk about the tournament arc, it wasn\u2019t that good overall. That is not to say that it didn\u2019t have it\u2019s moments but the structure of this arc is a bit lackluster. Like I stated before, the Sports Festival Arc loses narrative focus, since that\u2019s a lofty statement, so I guess I should elaborate on that. Deku doesn\u2019t really have any way to develop in this arc, his goal for this arc, more or less is to prove himself to the world. But this is a pretty uncompelling goal, and I don\u2019t like how the show portrays this vanity as a good thing. That was a pretty petty complaint, but I feel like Kohei Horikoshi would agree with me because this whole arc is dedicated to giving the side characters things to do. It was just kind of boring to see characters with no personality, doing things I couldn\u2019t give less of a fuck about. In actuality, who cares about Kirishima and TetsuTetsu? TetsuTetsu is more or less a gag character, it\u2019s pretty annoying how much time I remember was spent \u2018developing\u2019 his character. In actuality there is no depth to his character, so it feels rather misguided how much time has been spent in season 3 to him; but this is a trait that is pervasive throughout all the members of class 1b. I also feel like it\u2019s rather misguided to have more characters introduced when there was already too many characters in class 1a. To reinforce this fact, let me ask a few questions. What is the name of the character who has weird plant hair power? Is Bakugo a good character? Who actually cares about Mina vs Aoyama? Will Toru ever get any development? Will Sato, Koda, Jiro, Sero, Ojiro, Aoyama, Shoji, Mineta, Toru, Mina, or Asui ever do something of any importance? Of the students that I have deemed important, how much of that actually matters when it comes to the themes or the narrative of the story? Who actually cares about Yaoyorozu vs. Tokoyami? Has any character actually developed throughout the course of the series so far? Aside from in doujins, does Midnight have any fans? (aside from the ones who just like her appearance) For that matter, does any female or male characters (aside from Uraraka, Iida, Deku, Todoroki, AM, and Yaoyorozu) have any actual fans? Did anyone feel any tension for the characters in season 1 when they were in danger? As a continuation to that, did any of you feel any tension when the class was being attacked by villians in S3?\\n\\n\r\nThese questions were just the first thing that came to mind when thinking about the characters of BNHA; but these small/petty complaints and questions start building up. At times, I feel like there really wasn\u2019t any narrative coherence in this section of BNHA because it keeps jumping from character to character and each and everyone of them is boring. For that matter, every character\u2019s goal in BNHA is the same, every student wants to become the greatest hero ever; that really robs Deku of his most identifying feature. I guess that Deku is supposed to be a neutral audience stand in, and the fact that he is boring may be a good story telling technique; that being said, it most definitely doesn\u2019t work for me.  What also doesn\u2019t work for me is how Bakugo is supposed to be a foil for Deku, and the fact that they are both 1 dimensional pretty much makes this connection all the worse. In a better series, I wouldn\u2019t be thinking about why characters are popular or what their function in a series is. I would be immersed in the series, but this series does everything in its power to take me out of my immersion. \\n\\n\r\n4. Hero Killer/Stain Arc: This is most likely the most analyzed arc in all of BNHA, many people also herald it as one of the best arcs in shounen manga/anime. I have also heard innumerable think pieces on how Stain is one of the best villains in anime, and how the idea of Stain alone is a great concept. I would say Stain is a victim of three problems: The setting and the goal of this arc are at odds, the writing for Stain is pretty lackluster, and the thematic ideas behind Stain\u2019s character, despite being in the right place, are poorly written. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with my first problem with Stain\u2019s arc. The setting of BNHA is pretty unbelievable, this is only a problem when we consider that Stain is supposed to be the spark that influences others to start becoming villains.  As such, it would have behoved the series had the setting of BNHA been more gritty, less romanticized, and more polarizing.  It\u2019s not that there is a dearth of setting details that could have been used to help immerse the audience in the world of BNHA but all of the setting details are really misused; for example: due to Todoroki\u2019s backstory, we learn that many heroes choose partners that would directly lead to stronger children. We also learn that many heroes are treated like celebrities, and many of them have various endorsement details. Some heroes, like Mt.Lady come across as directly reckless because they like the attention it gets them. We as an audience even learn that heroes might be directly leading to crime based off of how hero culture embellishes villains, we know this because in towns that have lower hero activity, there is less crime. What would have really driven this narrative home was if the students at UA were less pure than they were. Another factor that could have helped this narrative would be if All Might and other characters we were supposed to think were icons of heroism were actually scumbags in real life. The only hero that comes across that way is Endeavor, and he was intentionally made to look like the biggest dick ever. But, all of these postulates are wrong, this isn\u2019t actually what this arc is about. The Stain Arc isn\u2019t about how the commoditization of heroes in BNHA lead to these destructive drawbacks. We know this because Stain idolizes All Might; now I want you to take the fact that I had all of you nail to the wall earlier, and take a look at it. All Might is as much of a sell out and or a commodity as much as any other hero if not more so. It is also implied that Mt.Lady was only being reckless because she is a relative newcomer to professional heroism. Also the audience isn\u2019t given much reason to believe hero culture is actually a bad thing, society in BNHA is as clean as it gets, and the amount of regulations on heroes that are present, pretty much assures that most heroes are under inspection by big brother at all times. The anime also tells us about a lot of problems in hero culture, but it doesn\u2019t show us anything of substance. So the audience doesn\u2019t really have a gauge to decide for ourselves if hero culture is good or bad, as far as we know, it is perfectly fine and should be protected. So if we think about it, what is Stain\u2019s arc really saying about heroism? \\n\\n\r\nThis leads into my second point about the writing of Stain, it isn\u2019t ever clear what he means when he idolizes All Might. Eventually it comes across as All Might is the best because he is stronk and he acts like a hero; Stain seems to make a deal about how most heroes are really weak and how that is a bad thing for heroism, but in reality that isn\u2019t really saying much about hero culture. It isn\u2019t really the deconstruction of heroism that I was lead on to believe. It\u2019s a very superficial commentary on heroism, and it is a terrible learning moment for every character involved in this arc, since it doesn\u2019t really give any character pause for introspection. I guess Iida has his moments to \u2018develop\u2019 but as I argued earlier, it isn\u2019t compelling because it is so unbelievable. But, when it comes to the actual dialogue of Stain, he basically talks in edge. I have been told that I should cut him some slack as a character when I analyze his intentions and his motivations, because he is a crazy person and that what he talks about only appeals to those who are already unstable. However, the last episode of season 2 proves this point to be mute because videos on  his narrative is spread around/ gone viral and is widely accepted as a valid viewpoint by the public. I think he was meant to be a compelling idea to both the audience and the characters of BNHA but in reality the end goal that he was meant to serve was greatly missed if that was the end goal for the character.\\n\\n\r\nI get why Stain was necessary for the plot, as I stated earlier, he was most likely created to course correct the plot of BNHA; it was meant to give the plot more narrative focus, it was also meant to raise the stakes of the plot. In many ways, it could be argued that Stain was introduced to correct the thematic ideas of BNHA: since BNHA is set in a hero school, this could have been a great opportunity to discuss the notion of heroism. But, the Stain Arc cheapens the idea of heroism more than anything else. I also know that I am right because the scumbag Endeavor and Mt. Lady become role model figures for Deku in S3; So the social darwinist position of might equals right is very much true in this series. Even though I am a ancap, but I hate this thematic position because of how much it demystifies the notion of heroism. BNHA does everything in its power to make heroes and heroism as lame as possible. Mother\u2019s Basement has argued that BNHA is thematically a capitalist story, but the anime/manga missed the opportunity to discuss the nature of commodity fetishism in this arc. Thus helping my belief that saying MB is wrong is like saying the sky is blue.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I still can\u2019t figure out what the Stain Arc is really trying to say about heroism. I think the reading that hero culture enables villainy is the best reading of this arc, but it kind of fails at the execution because of the writing. I could just be wildly off base, but I kinda doubt that.\\n\\n\r\n5. The Midterm Exam Arc: Nothing of note happens when in this arc, it just shows the students of 1a becoming more capable professional heroes and nothing else. This is probably where Uraraka\u2019s arc should have been placed because she never really had anything to prove during the Sports Festival Arc, the threat of failing the test is more high stakes to her character than doing only pretty well at the Sports Festival. Yaoyorozu\u2019s character arc is in this arc, it was pretty bad in terms of character development. But, seeing her work with Todoroki to beat Aizawa was pretty fun. This is also where Uraraka\u2019s love for Deku is revealed. \\n\\n\r\n6. The Training Camp Arc: This arc is pretty much a continuation of the Stain Arc, most of the events that transpired in that arc directly lead to the events of this arc. At this point, the story was doing two things that I really like. The first thing that I really like is the darker tone, it raised the stakes and the villains actually being successful in their mission made them feel less like the saturday morning cartoon villains that they felt like earlier. The second thing I liked was the writing, I would argue that it is still far from optimal, but we can tell that in between the Stain Arc and this arc, there has been a noticeable mitigation of edge. The edge has been replaced with legitimate intimidation and dark feel.  That being said, the show still hasn\u2019t taught Deku anything and Kota was a pretty terrible addition to the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo there was a lot that I liked from this arc, the best example of what I liked was the fight between Deku and Stronk Villain (I forgot his name). Even though I knew that Deku wouldn\u2019t die, the direction in this scene and the animation worked perfectly in tandem to reinforce the emotional response of helplessness and then lead to the sensation of overcoming a tough obstacle. That being said, I didn\u2019t like the events surrounding this particular fight nor did I like the choreography that much. But on a emotional level, it worked perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the fight earlier was in service to the development of maybe one of the worst characters of all time, Kota. This scene was supposed to display to the disillusioned Kota, the value of heroes. I think the main problem with Kota is that he is super generic, to the point where I was able to predict his backstory and the resolution of his arc, I was even able to verbatim quote what he would say. His character was so bland that I can\u2019t believe they actually included him; I think what makes Kota not work at all as a character is how he is a one shot character. I think he was just introduced as a means to get Deku to fight stronk dude and nothing else, he isn\u2019t really that likeable and he is pretty much the worst iteration of this archetype. If you want to watch a good iteration of this archetype, I would suggest watching Naruto, Konohamaru is a much more compelling version of this character because he parallels Naruto as a character, and the development that Konohamaru matches Naruto\u2019s because Naruto slowly becomes a mentor figure to him (a character, who like Naruto, doesn\u2019t have any parents). Kota\u2019s development pretty much is just a bland realization that heroes are necessary and that he should feel bad for punching Deku in the balls.  What this is to say, is that Kota is a bad character because he contributes very little to the themes of BNHA. This is true of most characters if not all of them, just remember my postulates on the characters of BNHA earlier. I am still not sure what the purpose of Deku or All Might really is, especially in the Stain Arc and this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe Setting of BNHA: One of the biggest flaws of BNHA is it\u2019s poor execution of many of its characters and it\u2019s themes, this is probably due to two reasons: One of them is the aforementioned amount of characters, but the problem I want to focus on at the moment is the setting of BNHA. Settings can be a powerful tool when utilized right. The setting of any iyashikei or slice of life relies heavily on the characterization that is personified because of the setting; the same is true of shonen series. HxH is about childhood wonder, so it relies heavily on the sense of wonder that comes with the setting. FMAB is a story about war and loss, thus it is set in a WW2 style setting. Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still is a deconstruction of classical characters; thus the setting has to work in two regards, the first of which is to recreate the classic feeling of the 70s Giant Robo series, and the second is to make it a setting where it is possible to have leagues of villains and giant robot fights, a setting where it is possible to have police officers with super powers. It executes this by having most buildings have a classic european design, the show also has a nostalgia inducing color palette. If I had to describe BNHA\u2019s color palette, I would use the adjectives sterile, and bland. On their own, these words aren\u2019t inherently bad; but when it comes to a series that sets out to have a specific, romantic tone to heroism, I think these attributes are not good. The colors of BNHA are neither subdued enough to feel nostalgic or reminiscent, but they aren\u2019t bright enough to be cartoonish or cheerful. It is in that sweet spot where almost no emotions can be evoked from the scenery in the show. Pair this with the very thin line work, and everything seems way too clean than it should be. A great example of this is the entirety of the UA Campus, the worst offender of this is the classroom which is as sterile and bland as it gets. There is nothing like building a tone based off of bland industrial rooms with no interesting aspects aside from how bland it is. The setting of BNHA should have been more similar to Kekkai Sensen, they both inhabit similar worlds, since in both settings\u2019 the populace is mainly super human. BNHA should have been dirtier, more crowded, vertical. They imply that those with great quirks tend to be near the top of the hierarchy in BNHA, but we really don\u2019t get a sense of the society in this world, nor do we get a sense of any outside world. I feel like if anything, BNHA seems like it is too self contained within Japan. This containment lead me to ask a million questions that I know won\u2019t be answered. For example: Why are almost all of the top heroes and most powerful villains in Japan? This question alone subsequently creates more questions, why is All Might the symbol of peace world wide if all he did was protect Japan? Why is UA in Japan? Are there people with more powerful quirks than One For All? What is society like in China, America, Britain\u2026 etc like now that there are superpowers?  I guess because Japan looks the same as it ever was, so would every other country. \\n\\n\r\nMrbtongue made a great video on Mass Effect 3 that includes the postulate that science fiction is a socratic seminar between the author and the hypothetical. Every science fiction/science fantasy work is the answer to a hypothetical situation. Using this reading, BNHA\u2019s setting is based off of the premise \u201csuppose that 80% of the population of the world was born with super powers, what would happen?\u201d BNHA answers the questions that come with this hypothesis in the laziest possible way: superpowers cause heroes and villains to become an industry of their own, institutions are made to regulate superpowers, the world is basically the same as it ever was. Perhaps BNHA\u2019s world is as boring as it is to have as much mass appeal as possible. I mean western superhero movies take place in modern, clean, cities, and they also have flimsy excuses for premises. BNHA is accessible if nothing else, it uses western comic iconography whilst being cliche enough to WSJ fans. It isn\u2019t smart enough to really answer any of my questions, so I feel like BNHA is only supposed to be appreciated on a surface level, the entire world and conflicts that take place within it is as superficial as it gets (even Stain, if not especially Stain). \\n\\n\r\nI guess I am not sure what else to add to my analysis of each completed arc so far; but I just remembered that I never talked about each fight. In many regards, my forgetting about writing on these fights speaks louder than any analysis that I could write on them. Most fights in this series are boring and uninventive, and the few fights that do something new usually have other elements that piss me off. I guess that is because shonen anime is notorious for having lots of character development scenes contained within fights; I\u2019m not about to start complaining about that necessarily, but I would have preferred it if some development scenes didn\u2019t revolve around fights. The most egregious example was Todoroki vs. Deku, and all of my problems with treating trauma as a character flaw and also resolving his issues in a fight by yelling at him.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the astote readers would have probably noticed a running theme in my analysis of BNHA so far. That theme is that Deku isn\u2019t really driving the plot anymore, his personality traits and his motivation hasn\u2019t been the main focus to the plot for a while, he has just felt more like the passenger in his own story. None of the conflicts from the second half of the first season onwards have been driven by Deku as a character, he is just kind of there doing his own thing, learning nothing. People might argue that he is becoming more heroic because he saved Kota, but we all know that he would have done that if he was replaced with his counterpart from the first episode of BNHA. \\n\\n\r\nThere is an argument that Deku\u2019s arc is that he is becoming more responsible as the show keeps going on. The examples I can think for this arc comes from the first episode and has continued up to this point; let me explain, in the first episode Deku ran up to a villain that he had no chance of beating to save Bakugo. This shows that his self sacrificing nature is a bad trait, because he keeps putting himself in danger. In his fight against Bakugo, Deku sacrifices both of his arms to secure the fake nuclear bomb. In his fight against Todoroki, Deku breaks both of his arms and all of his fingers to get through to Todoroki. When he saves Iida from Stain, he goes into the alley (and signals that he is in danger) and fights against a threat that has taken out countless heroes. In the third season, Deku goes against Stronk Boi in a 1v1 fight to save Kota, and in the current arc he relied on Todoroki, Iida, Yaoyorozu, and Kirishima to save Bakugo. But, my argument against this arc is two fold. The first problem with it is that we never got a sense that Deku would try to do things by himself, or that he was reckless/irresponsible to begin with, he has always been a team player and he has always been portrayed as in the right. He has always been rewarded if not enabled to be irresponsible, and we only get hints here and there that he might be over his head but he is never outright wrong in any of his actions. My second problem with this arc is that every single shounen series has a arc similar to this contained within it, if anything, the great majority of shonen protagonists have similar arcs and they are also usually more subtle than the one from BNHA. Naruto, Deisuke, Gon, Soma, Ueki, Yusuke, and Edward Elric, all have the same arc as Midoriya but they are all better than his. \\n\\n\r\nSo I\u2019ve roughly been complaining about BNHA for the past 10\u2019000 words, why does it matter what people think of this series? Well first and foremost, the \u201cnew big three,\u201d is BNHA, Boruto, and Black Clover, all three of them are Naruto fanfiction. Ten years into the future when no one longer cares about BNHA, I would argue that every series will basically be derivative copies of BNHA and the fans of BNHA will most likely complain about the newer series. So I just want to say that it is a cycle, and we have accepted that future series will be unoriginal; the fact that the main argument that many use as a defence of BNHA is \u201cit\u2019s unoriginal but it is well executed,\u201d only proves that as an anime community we have accepted mediocrity. It turns out Digibro was right all along, the main shows that are popular now of days are simply echoes of a better time for the medium and BNHA is the epitome of this.\\n",

            "content": "Before this, I would recommend reading my reviews of the first two seasons of Boku no Hero Academia. Many details that explain my opinion on this series in a broader sense are already covered there.\r\nThis season picks up where the previous season left off, with the students preparing to go to an inevitably doomed summer training camp. The plot takes a much darker tone this season, with The League of Villains newly-emboldened by Stain's actions in season 2, and full of fresh faces. The first arc of this season gives the new villains a chance to show off what they're made of, and set upthe league as a more immediate, tangible threat.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling too much, the following arc goes even further into developing The League of Villains, finally introducing their leader and revealing his true plan. It also sets up for a changing of the guard for both the heroes and the villains, building towards Deku and Shigaraki becoming arch-enemies in the vein of their mentors.\\n\\n\r\nWhile these two arcs excel due to their establishing a greater cast of villains and creating a sense of genuine threat, the following arc doesn't fare quite as well. The Provisional License Exam arc doesn't serve much purpose in the overarching plot other than to get the story from point A to point B. While there is some exploration of Todoroki's grudge against his father, this isn't anything we haven't already covered elsewhere. Ultimately, without it being as firmly rooted in the emotional journey of its characters, it has a lot less substance than the other arcs, and feels awkward and transitionary.\\n\\n\r\nThis is exacerbated by some uncharacteristically bad pacing for this series, with two filler episodes sandwiched into it along with some added scenes and dialogue, presumably included to make sure that the season ended at a good point rather than smack in the middle of another arc.\\n\\n\r\nWhile one of the two filler episodes (technically three, but the first was a start-of-season recap) follows a similar idea to season 2's surprisingly good filler episode, in covering events that happened offscreen to secondary 1-A characters, the other is a completely unnecessary waste of time that accomplishes little more than plugging the movie. And even the better of the two fails to repeat the same success of season 2's filler, partially because while the previous one came as a breather episode inbetween story arcs, this one directly interrupted the plot in progress. It also doesn't help that Tsuyu is a better character than Yaoyorozu (fight me, nerds).\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is also noticeably worse during filler, in particular for Uraraka and Bakugo. Uraraka gets a lot of screentime in additional scenes, but almost all of her dialogue in these scenes revolves around her uncertainty around her feelings for Deku, something we had already established and which didn't need repeating ad nauseam. Bakugo on the other hand plays up all his worst character traits in the movie-plugging filler episode, but where his recklessness in canon is usually due to his anger and frustration with Deku, here it's pure idiocy.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the exam is over, however, the quality immediately picks back up. And whatever disservice the filler may have done for Bakugo, it's easily forgotten after he gets some long overdue character development. While Bakugo was never a bad character, he wasn't a likeable one either. But Bakugo's character arc has been long in process - with his entire worldview being flipped on its head the moment Deku gained a quirk, Bakugo has been challenged with the thought that he's no longer superior to everyone around him - a belief that he had always taken for granted until then. This season finally takes this setup and brings it to a conclusion redeeming an oft-maligned character in the process.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while the quality of this season does take a noticeable dip during the provisional license exam, even then it isn't bad - just underwhelming in comparison. Outside of this arc, it matches (and in places exceeds) the benchmark the previous season set.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for any mistakes the series may make, it still manages to retain investment in both the ever-evolving setting and its quirky (pun not intended) ensemble cast, the latter in particular benefiting not only from more character arcs, drama, and development, but from increased downtime letting us see more of these characters outside of their roles in the plot, fleshing out more of their personalities and character dynamics.\\n\\n\r\nWith the series ending on a foreboding note, Hero Academia promises great things to come - but for now, Hero Academia 3 is an impressive, if uneven, entry in the series.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: One Piece, Naruto",

            "content": "Superhero stories feels like it\u2019s been populating the entertainment industry from these recent years. Marvel and DC successfully adapted many of these superhero tales with huge fanbases. The CW Network have aired shows with a large following like The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, and Legends of Tomorrow. My Hero Academia always reminds me that it has a place with its own set of superheroes and villains. With that in mind, I was pretty ecstatic about the return of My Hero Academia.\r\nThe third season does a bit of recapping at first to get viewers comfortable with its characters, story setting, and general concepts. As someone who hasbeen following both the anime and manga, I knew what was to expect as the series is structured with story arcs. From the first half of the show, we follow Class 1-A as the first semester at U.A has concluded. Known as the \u201cForest Training Camp Arc\u201d, it details the events of our young heroes participating in a training camp. They are supervised by a hero group known as the Pussycats but incidents happen that leads the arc into quite a chaos. It\u2019s no surprise either as My Hero Academia likes to build tension and make story with its characters. From the Training Camp arc, we are introduced to a character named Kota who has a distasteful view towards heroes. The show explores his reasons for this while also adapts how he begins to change after meeting certain people. Enter Deku. He is pretty much symbolic for what Kota detests because of his values and desire to become a hero. The arc details of what it really means of being a hero and opening his eyes to reality.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, it\u2019s also clear that the series has dangerous adversaries for the heroes to face. The League of Villains has been teased from season 2 and in this season, they make themselves known with malicious intentions. Their core members exposes the dangers our heroes faces but they also have a hidden agenda. That brings into the question of a guy named Katsuki Bakugo. You\u2019d remember him as the arrogant guy who always strives to be the best with a huge ego. From this season, you\u2019ll also see what it means to be a hero from his point of view. Nonetheless, I think there may be an overemphasis on the idea of making heroes. Every episode and arc dedicates an immense amount of time to such concepts that sometimes, I wonder if there\u2019s just too much. I say this because after a certain amount of episodes, the storytelling feels a bit redundant without much development. Heroism becomes too symbolic even in the case of All Might. On the contrary, one could also mention that All Might is a symbol of being a real hero. He represents courage, integrity, peace, and self-sacrifice. The apex of the show has him battle out against a powerful enemy from the past that draws out perhaps one of the most important episodes of the franchise. While still overemphasizing the idea of heroism, it\u2019s significant enough to prove what being a hero is all about.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the series still has its sense of humor. There exists many moments in the show that offers to delivery comedy ranging from Mineta\u2019s ridiculous perverted antics to an episode about checking out everyone\u2019s rooms. Bringing back to the main plot, the second half of the show features the hero license exams and internship arc together. It now transcends from young heroes to take their next step in following their dreams. New characters are introduced while familiar ones are bought back together to add to the drama. It also adds bits of tense rivalry between certain characters that may or may not be pleasing to remember. But I must say, preparing these heroes in such a way feels like the pacing could have been improved. I\u2019m not a big fan for the latter half of the show as most of those episodes didn\u2019t make much of an impact. Even in terms of personal enjoyment, I find myself losing interest when watching Deku, Bakugo, Momo, Todoroki, Enji, Tenya, Ochaco, or others compete to earn their spot. Some of the new characters like Mei did occasionally spark my interest but nonetheless felt underwhelming. What about the new characters like the ones from Shiketsu High School? To me, they\u2019re unique individually but lacks development and isn\u2019t well crafted enough for true appeal. I\u2019m not going to lie, it felt like the show sometimes has too many characters in a story arc at once and doesn\u2019t really bring out their true potentials.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, I guess you may be asking if character relationships develop further in this season. It definitely proves itself being able to capitalize on the complex relationship such as with Deku and Bakugo, Deku and All Might, or Deku and Koda. But for other characters like Ochaco, they really take a pitfall. There\u2019s obvious romance that blooms from her towards Deku but the season acts more like a ship tease with no true hope of sailing sail. Never say never though, right? Just not this season.\\n\\n\r\nComing back to this franchise definitely reminded of the Shounen Jump action I was looking for. A superhero action series like this isn\u2019t complete without its colorful character cast and their action roles. It offers all sort of characteristics where every hero or villain is unique. However, it may be noticable that some episodes dropped in quality compared to previous seasons. Yoshihiko Umakoshi worked on a variety of roles from previous seasons ranging from character designs, chief animation director, and key animation. In this season, he\u2019s absent as a role of animation director. That doesn\u2019t mean the third season fell apart though because in some of the more climatic episodes, there\u2019s definitely high quality animation. The explosiveness and energy of the fighting scenes from some of the more important episodes really are worth praising. There\u2019s also the dynamic character motions with emotional content that adds more value to many scenes this season. There\u2019s even environmental physics and other background animation that are worth paying attention to. To me, I think My Hero Academia Season 3 started off a bit slow but was able to work itself up again to bring these storybook characters to stardom. The familiarity of the soundtrack also brings together moments that you won\u2019t forget. \\n\\n\r\nAfter three seasons of My Hero Academia, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the momentum of this roller-coaster isn\u2019t going to stop for a good while. Superhero shows often portray characters as exactly what they are \u2013 a symbol of justice and peace. While My Hero Academia does continue to follow that concept, it has moments that truly capitalizes on the meaning of this ideology. With more episodes on the way in the future, I still have bright hopes for this franchise.",

            "content": "[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS for Hunter x Hunter, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, Naruto, and Boku no Hero Academia Seasons 1, 2, and 3]\r\nWhenever a show gets super popular here on my anime list dot com, a large group of anime viewers watch it and give it a rating. This rating is calculated with all the other user's ratings and creates an overall ranking system. The system MAL employs emphasizes an overall ranking that naturally lends itself to abuse by people who want their favorite show to be #1. This results in a lot of fluff being upvoted to near the top, and italso gives shallow people a means to push shows they don't like down the rankings. It emphasizes all the bad things about criticism, leads people to attack each other based on whether or not they gave their favorite show a good enough arbitrary number, and unfortunately can also lead people to have a lot of false expectations based on a misleading number.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to Boku no Hero Academia. a show that has drawn comparisons to Hunter x Hunter and taken the anime community by storm, while sporting 3 seasons with very high ratings in the MAL rankings. It is these comparisons to Hunter x Hunter and the bloated MAL ranking that gave me the impression that BNHA was going to push the shounen genre in a bold new direction, much like Hunter x Hunter did.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't. Boku no Hero Academia is an average superpower shounen that follows closely (extremely closely) in the steps of Naruto and Hunter x Hunter without really adding anything new to the genre. Normally I would watch something like this, shrug, and move on. But the MAL ranking raised my expectations, which led me to be disappointed. It's a rather odd predicament as I'm forced to find some middle ground between my expectations based off what I was told, and the reality of what Boku no Hero Academia actually is. It fails to live up to the gold standard Hunter x Hunter set, but should I really be comparing the two? Comparing anything to Hunter x Hunter is rather unfair, but if the community wants to make those comparisons I'll be happy to tear them down. let's begin!\\n\\n\r\n~Art/Animation~\\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019ll start off with the best part of the show: the art and animation. Everything is certainly drawn and animated well, and all the backgrounds appear to be drawn well.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t to say that I don\u2019t have serious gripes with the how the show chooses to present itself visually. You see, in most shows I would call good, a number of non-verbal techniques are used to tell the audience things about what they\u2019re seeing without telling them. Usually the staff find ways to let the audience know that the fight or confrontation they\u2019re witnessing is important, or they convey what feelings the combatants are experiencing via the camera, animation, body language, etc. This can be depicted with audio or visually but for something that\u2019s animated, visual usually works best. Stuff like this is NECESSARY during big fights to sell the significance and scope of what\u2019s happening.\\n\\n\r\nThe point of a big climactic fight is to create a duel of clashing ideologies of characters that come to a head in a dynamic battle that is SUPPOSED to be an emotional crescendo where everything is hashed out and everything they\u2019ve wanted to say and express comes out. This does not happen in the fight between Deku and Bakugo. It should have. Their rivalry is key to the structure of the series and it is supposed to carry a lot of emotional weight behind it. It\u2019s the BNHA equivalent of Naruto vs Sasuke. Yet watching what is supposed to be the climax to season 3, the dominant emotion I felt during it was boredom. It doesn\u2019t successfully convey any of the emotions of their jagged, unstable relationship and the fight itself doesn\u2019t really solve anything. In big fights like Gon vs Neferpitou and Naruto vs Sasuke, the characters actually talk to each other. They yell at each other, respond to the others\u2019 comments, and are driven emotionally and strategically by the actions of their opponents. This does not happen during the Deku-Bakugo fight. Deku spends the entire fight thinking about their relationship, while Bakugo has a few lines that don\u2019t connect emotionally due to how restrained the vocal delivery is. This is the most vulnerable we\u2019ve ever seen Bakugo and this is really the best direction they could accomplish? His body language doesn\u2019t change. His movements don\u2019t change. Neither do Midoriya\u2019s. This is a problem, as it implies that the emotions of the scene aren\u2019t changing their behavior. This is just another angsty fight for them.\\n\\n\r\nTo elaborate with an example (spoilers for Return of the Jedi): during Return of the Jedi, there is an excellent fight scene between Luke and Darth Vader. A part of the reason this fight works so well is that Luke\u2019s movements and body language change during the fight. At one point, Vader really gets under his skin by making some comments about Leia. While Luke does indicate this audibly (yelling), its his attacking style that changes the most. Suddenly, he\u2019s hammering Vader with really violent, angry strikes that indicate his emotional state has been changed and he can longer control his anger. It expresses the emotions of the fight in a subtle way that\u2019s engaging to the audience. This is also important because it indicates Vader is succeeding in trying to corrupt Luke by making him give in to his anger.\\n\\n\r\nNow think about how a scene that\u2019s also very important in BNHA season 3 handles it. Deku and Bakugo do not change their general fight movements and strategy during this fight at all. They also don\u2019t talk to each other much, making this a very awkward-feeling fight that doesn\u2019t convey much emotion and doesn\u2019t accomplish anything. The animation style doesn\u2019t change either. What Deku and Bakugo are feeling is established entirely through their inner thoughts or outright told to us. This is a big no-no when it comes to a visual medium.\\n\\n\r\nFor an example in the realm of anime, Naruto employed non-verbal storytelling extremely well during the fight between Rock Lee and Gaara. After Lee removes his weights, the animators employ a lot of speed blurs and very quick animation to indicate Lee\u2019s blinding speed. Rather than throwing Lee into a speed-line tunnel like most shows would, you see Lee\u2019s extremely blurred outline zip across the screen. They do tell us Lee\u2019s fast, but they support this by having him zip around while Gaara is moving like normal. This does an excellent job of establishing how ridiculously fast Lee is flying around by showing his speed relative to Gaara\u2019s normal movements. Having the camera pan around Gaara also helps sell this by conveying to the audience the same disorienting, overwhelmed feeling that Gaara is experiencing.\\n\\n\r\nThis is another thing the fight between Deku and Bakugo, and all the fights in BNHA, lack. The animators neglected to take advantage of the visual medium they were using to add a creative spin on the storytelling in fights. It\u2019s the same restrained animation during the fights and outside of them, which leaves the fights feeling flavorless and dull. There\u2019s no visual pop at all. No fun angles, no experimental animation styles, no interesting framing. Nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThere are ways to tell the audience things without using words, and BNHA has consistently displayed no capacity to employ aspects of non-verbal storytelling. It would rather tell you what characters are thinking and feeling rather than showing them. This is a sin in storytelling, and one of the first big no-no\u2019s you\u2019ll learn in any film school or lesson in storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a creative way to express its story and emotions visually, it would be difficult for me to say the animation department did a job here. Everything moves as it should, but that\u2019s the absolute minimum compliment you can give something that\u2019s animated . Animation/art 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~Music~\\n\\n\r\nThe score in this show is extremely bland. I can\u2019t think of a single track that sticks out, and its placement is equally bland. Music 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\\n\r\nI have a mountain of criticisms regarding the story. (Here\u2019s the key points if you wanna TLDR: villains are basically team rocket in that they always lose, no one ever dies so the plot never establishes a truly dangerous or threatening tone, the story is full of extremely safe and recycled storylines, and there are far too many characters focused on which bloat the run time and slows pacing to a crawl.)\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, one flaw that kept popping up in this season was how they attempted to keep developing ALL of Deku's classmates. This results in a plot that moves slow as molasses. The \"testing/graduation\" phase of Hunter x Hunter focused on 4 individuals mostly, allowing it to truck through the entire testing process within just 11 episodes. BNHA has trudged through this same process for going on for 3 seasons now. There is no need to keep track of how minor characters are training to develop their powers. It's excessive. Deku, Bakugou, Iida, Todoroki, Uraraka, Tsuyu, and maybe Tokoyami are the ONLY student characters who should be focused on at this point. That's it. AND THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP US UP TO DATE ON 20. You can keep SOME of the minor characters involved, but not every last one of them! That bogs down the pace and makes small arcs take an eternity!\\n\\n\r\nYou do not need to let the audience know every single thing that's happening to every character. It's excessive and takes too much time. Some things just aren't going to be relevant to the story down the road. Do I really need to be shown exactly how the tape guy is getting stronger? Is it going to become important? I doubt it. A single line of dialogue later would serve the same purpose. It's unnecessary, it bloats the run time, and in most cases takes up screen time that could be used to help the audience get to know the main characters better. This issue comes up constantly, starting with the opening recap that takes forever to re-establish the quirks of the heroes because there are WAY too many of them.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, people die a lot in Hunter x Hunter. And they die in Naruto, too! It's a good way to keep the viewer on their toes and to keep the universe the creators established feeling dangerous and threatening. Whenever I see an expendable character like Pixie Bob not die in a situation she probably should have died in, it annoys me because it reinforces the notion that none of the characters in BNHA can or will die. As such, I find it hard to feel invested when there's no threat of actual significant harm to any of the main characters. They all have blatant plot armor. Other examples included Best Jeanist surviving in episode 9 in what would have been a great opportunity to establish the overwhelming power of All for One by having him wipe out the number 4 hero; and All Might surviving the fight with All for One when again\u2026having AFO killing him would have been a great way to establish how powerful and threatening he is. Instead, All for One loses to a total asspull in which they wave off All Might\u2019s crippling injury because \u201cpeople give me strength\u201d bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of villains, they certainly fail to leave an impact. They tend to go on long tirades to make up for their lack of interesting backstories or motives, but that isn\u2019t their biggest problem. The biggest flaw here is that they never, ever win. How great would it have been for All Might to have died to establish All for One as an overwhelming villain? Killing the number one hero would've done it. Hell, killing Gran Torino or Best Jeanist would have done it. Just SOMEONE. That way I can believe at some point the villains in this show might actually succeed long-term. Turning Bakugo into a villain which might destabilize the wills of the heroes? They failed. Neutralizing anyone on the kill list during the forest raid? They failed. Accomplish anything during the raid in season one? They failed. Killing All Might when that is all All for One wished to do? He failed. The villains in this series are no better at their job than Team fucking Rocket. There\u2019s nothing to them, they always lose, and they aren\u2019t even entertaining. They exist purely to give the protagonists something to fight.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a lack of long-term consequences in this universe. What I mean by that is that any time a potential idea that could shake up the narrative is introduced, it\u2019s immediately waved off at the convenience of the plot. For example: how lame is it to have his mom take a hard stance against UA's irresponsible bullshit only for All Might to go on some heroic spiel and neutralize her concerns. This would have really made things interesting, as not being allowed to go to UA would have: 1, surprised me for the first time in the entire series and 2, would have been a grounding moment in Deku\u2019s development. He\u2019s basically completely disregarded his mother\u2019s feelings and anyone else\u2019s who might have cared about him by being reckless and throwing himself into danger with no disregard to his own safety. But it\u2019s immediately forgotten after All Might basically begs. Lazy.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good example of this is when Eraser said he thought about expelling the students but doesn\u2019t. Mainly because they should be expelled. This is where the concept of BNHA taking place in a school kind of hurts it. Once a student is expelled, obviously they're done there for good. But in, say, Hunter x Hunter, the Hunter exam is just that: a test. Anyone can take it however many times they want. That means that if characters take some drastic action that disqualifies them, all they would have to do is just re-apply the next year. The writers took advantage of this by doing exactly that to Killua, in the process establishing his homicidal nature and unbalanced emotional state. Point being, Hunter x Hunter set itself up for success by thinking 2 steps ahead. Also, they were willing to take chances like separating Killua from Gon in a year to establish an important character trait. That's excellent writing. BNHA's half-assed one foot in-one foot out approach to grounding its characters looks shoddy by comparison. If you\u2019re gonna expel them, do it. Don\u2019t pretend like you were going to and then wave it off because it\u2019s convenient. And don\u2019t pretend like the outcome of the exams matter if you\u2019re just going to let anyone who failed take a couple classes so they pass anyways. It\u2019s lazy.\\n\\n\r\nThat about sums it up. Story 3/10\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nI previously mentioned my issues with focusing on too many characters. But even the ones that are supposed to be focused on really haven\u2019t developed much at all. The best example of this I can think of is Deku and Uraraka.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"romance\" between Uraraka and Deku is one of the most pathetic and undercooked romances I've seen across all of film and TV. It's already hard enough to care considering how their relationship stays parked firmly in neutral and has been for 3 seasons now, but was it really impossible to give Uraraka a personality? She is easily the least fleshed out character of the main bunch and this half-assed romance crap is thrown in our face in almost every arc. They have done absolutely nothing to advance the relationship, so why does it keep coming back for no reason? At this point bringing it up again and again only reinforces the growing notion that Uraraka\u2019s only personality trait is liking Deku. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the villains, I already mentioned their problem: they never win and they have no interesting backstories or motives.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really grade for enjoyment. How much you enjoy something is determined by the product of your experiences in life and what you consider to be a quality production, which are different for every single person. As such, attempting to grade something inherently subjective with an objective grading metric is a paradox.  I will leave this score blank.\\n\\n\r\n~Conclusion~\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll put it bluntly: The key weakness BNHA suffers from is that it has no balls. It takes no chances, has no creativity, makes no sacrifices, and displays no ability to do anything new with the shounen genre in its 3 seasons of existence. But this may not necessarily be entirely its fault. After all, the reason I came into BNHA expecting something great was because it was burdened with unfair comparisons that were unlikely to be met.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I initially thought it was bad was because I was comparing it to Hunter x Hunter, and the reason I did that was because the high MAL ranking and constant comparisons to it in reviews raised my expectations beyond what was realistic to expect. Divorcing BNHA from those lofty comparisons and what I'm left is a totally average and acceptable shounen that has passable animation, average music, mediocre characters, and a bland story that lifts heavily from Naruto and Hunter x Hunter without adding anything of its own to what it borrows.\\n\\n\r\nBoku No Hero Academia Season 3 gets a 4/10.\\n",

I disliked the nonsensical villain motivations in Season 2 and I feel that their motivations seem to make even less sense in Season 3.\r\nSince Season 2, we have seen that most of Hero Academia's villains want to kill All Might because he happens tobe the so called \"symbol of peace\". Why would any villain want to kill the \"symbol of peace\"? According to Hero Academia, villains want to kill the symbol of peace because they want to deprive Japanese citizens of the hope that any hero can save them from any kind of danger at any moment in time. By the way, we don't really know if any country other than Japan actually exists in this fictional superhero and that just makes suspending one's disbelieve a little harder needs to be. \\n\\n\r\nHow exactly does a villain materially or emotionally benefit from depriving people of the hope that All Might or any other hero can save them at any point in time? How does killing All Might or any of the students of UA high satisfy a villain's emotional or physical needs? None of these important thematic questions are ever answered. The sad fact is that almost all of the villains have motives that conveniently push the plot forward and create some much needed suspense and tension. But in their attempt to kill All Might and UA students, the villains have sacrificed their physical well-being and their emotional needs. It makes no sense for villains to have motivations that don't personally benefit them in any imaginable way. \\n\\n\r\nIn real life or in stories that have realistic characters, villains have one of the following motivations; greed, curiosity, a lust for power, a desire for revenge, spiteful envy or a desire for dangerous fun. Is it possible to write villains who want to kill All Might or the students of UA High for realistic reasons? Of course it is, but it's generally easier to write villains who exist for the sole purpose of perpetuating a poorly conceived storyline. Made in Abyss and Kokkoku both have villains with interesting and unique motivations that actually make sense. You can check out my reviews for those two anime.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend watching the first seasons of both of those anime rather than watching the 3rd season of Hero Academia, unless you like Hero Academia's world building and you want to find out how the story's going to end. You can watch this shipwreck to the very end, but I'm jumping ship with what's left of my sanity. \\n\\n\r\nNow back to my review. The only one or two villains in Hero Academia have a somewhat realistic motivations and they're just minor characters who get as little screen time as possible. The villain I liked, fights for fun and his goals occasionally conflict with the goals of the Villain Vanguard. He's like a less interesting version of Bleach's Kenpachi. This is actually the least disappointing aspect of Season 3's storyline. \\n\\n\r\nTo get to the heart of the problem of villain motivations, we need to examine Hero Academia's most important villain: Stain. In Season 2, we were introduced to a villain called Stain. The extent to which you like Stain's character development will determine the extent to which you will enjoy watching Season 3. If you love Stain then you will love Season 3. If you hated Stain then you will hate Season 3. If you felt ambivalent about Stain's character then you will feel ambivalent about Season 3's storyline. \\n\\n\r\nVillain motivations is just one of the fundamental problems that plague Hero Academia's storyline, but I think the single biggest problem: is Stain's character development. First of all, Stain has no backstory in the anime nor does he have a backstory in the manga. Why exactly Stain set out to kill licensed heroes he thought were fake heroes with ill motives remains a mystery. Season 3 expects us to believe that lots of villains were inspired by Stain's actions, which makes no sense because that implies that lots of villains actually care about the heroic qualities of Japan's heroes. By definition, the word \"villain\" implies that one has a selfish and self-centered worldview. To truly be worthy of the title of \"villain\" one's priority should be one's personal well-being not someone else' heroic qualities. You cannot be a \"villain\" if you selflessly want to better society by purging it of incompetent and ill intentioned heroes. If you had Stain's motivation, then you would feel deeply insulted by the idea of being called a \"villain\" and you would never associate yourself with someone called a villain. Anyone who claims to be motivated by Stain's ideology would never to call themselves a villain or even allow themselves to be within spitting distance of anyone who happens to have villainous intentions. Horikoshi, Hero Academia's creator, has never described Stain as a misunderstood vigilante and that makes the fact that he inspires individuals who openly describe themselves as villains even more confusing. \\n\\n\r\nHorikoshi also does a piss poor job of convincing us, the viewers, that any so called villain who believes in Stain's incoherent ideology has an emotional makeup that makes even a lick of sense. Humans can have irrational motivations, but even irrational motives make some kind of sense to those who hold such motives. Terrorists and suicidal cult members, however bizarre their motivations may seem to the average person; can easily articulate or demonstrate the motives behind their actions. The same cannot be said for anyone of the villains in Hero Academia. \\n\\n\r\nThe other problems that plague Hero Academia's storyline and character development include; Deku's and other important heroes' increasingly powerful plot armor, the nonsensical rules that hero students are forced to abide by for the sake of maintaining some semblance of tension or drama in the story's overall plot, and the subtle but pernicious sexism that undermines some of the series best story arcs. \\n\\n\r\nSince Deku mastered the One for All quirk in Season 2, he has not encountered a villain or obstacle he could not physically or emotionally overcome. Not only does this plot point suck away all the drama and tension we enjoyed at the beginning of series, it also makes the overall plot a bit too easy to follow. \\n\\n\r\nAnd any hope we had for some dramatic tension later on in the story was crushed by the fact that Hero Academia's plot armor not only protects Deku from being killed, but also prevents him from experiencing any kind of emotional suffering. Since he mastered his quirk, he has not lost a single fight to a villain. If he lost a few fights to some villains once in a while, the story would be a lot more interesting and exciting. Deku's ever growing plot armor makes the story monotonous and predictable. \\n\\n\r\nNow it's time to get into what might be the most controversial part of my review: Hero Academia's pervasive and pointless sexism. There are 3 main problems with the way women are portrayed in Hero Academia. The first of which is the fact that no matter how hard superheroines work, they never achieve as much as their male counterparts even when they have superior quirks. Momo is a great example of this. Her quirk is incredibly powerful and she should be the number 1 student at UA high based on her grades and her masterful control her of work. But Horikoshi never let's her unleash her true potential. There are so many so many things she do with her powers that series never even hints at. She could spawn grenades, heat seeking missiles, ultrasonic guns, tear gas and any number of incredibly useful tools from her flesh. But Horikoshi paints her as a surprisingly unremarkable superheroine with the emotional weaknesses of a stereotypical Japanese girl. \\n\\n\r\nSince Season 2, Momo has not come any closer to being UA's best student despite her amazing potential. Like a lot of female characters in Hero Academia, she lacks self-confidence and believes that she cannot make important life decisions without the emotional support of a man. In Season 3, Momo is relegated to the role of a mildly interesting side character and it's up to the toughest male characters to almost singlehandedly save the day. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, women are consistently portrayed as being less motivated and less hard working than men for no other reason than the fact they are women. Even if we suppose that women in real-life Japan don't work as hard as men even when they are exceptionally talented, this series forces all it's female characters to never even attempt to push beyond the artificial physical and emotional limits they place upon themselves. It's fine if one female characters fits a certain gender stereotype, but a story in which all female characters suffer from the same female problems is not only less realistic, but also less fun to watch. The 1st episode of Season 3 portrays all the female characters as lazy fun lovers, but portrays men as hardworking and dedicated to their training as heroes. Someone will argue that female social pressure makes the ladies less motivated and a little more relaxed, but that makes no sense in the context of a dangerous and life-threatening school environment where students are attacked by powerful villains on a regular basis. The terrifying prospect of being killed by a villain should be enough motivation to keep any student on their toes regardless of their gender.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, too many female characters seem to lack self-confidence simply because their women. There are no men in Hero Academia who lack self-confidence and that's really suspicious. Even Mineta, one of the weakest quirk holders and arguably the least motivated male character, never experiences a crisis of confidence or  a moment of doubt. He never even considers quitting UA High. In this series women are less self-confident, regardless of how powerful their quirk is, simply because they're women. There is a difference between revealing gender stereotypes and reinforcing them. Hero Academia wholeheartedly indulges in gender stereotypes that weaken the impact of the story. If any of the male heroes questioned their abilities as heroes or decision makers, the story would be more interesting and engaging. What if Deku experienced a crisis in self-confidence? Wouldn't that be fun to watch? Or are all men immune to the emotional suffering that plagues female characters? The fact that men never hesitate or falter in this series, makes Hero Academia feel like a silly power fantasy written by a man for men. \\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you're convinced that Hero Academia's veneer of thematic depth makes it the greatest shonen anime ever written, at some point in Season 3 you're going to feel the crushing weight of all the story problems I've just described.",

            "content": "My hero academia came out at a perfect time. The very popular long running series Naruto ended, and superheroes were all the rage in western culture. Everyone was searching for the next series to quench the thirst. That\u2019s when the anime community was introduced to a long running super hero fighting anime, \u201cMy Hero Academia.\u201d. Horikoshi created the number one hero in the series to look like Captain America & Superman\u2019s love child. The number one hero has moves referencing American states which the protagonist uses. Clearly the show was shouting out at a western audience & it worked. The show brought in anime fans,superhero fans, American fans, and casual viewers. At one point, even I was liking the show. It was until after a few days of sitting on it that I started to realize the show was not something I could praise. I went back through my experience & noticed all its plot inconsistencies, poor characterization, bad story-telling, boring fights, weak villains, and its repetitive structure in every season. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing I\u2019ll point out is poor characterization because I rank that highly for my metric scale. Nearly every character in MHA is badly written. Considering this is a show about heroes the main thing you want to do is create relatable characters. Otherwise an audience won\u2019t feel emotional investment to care about their progression. It\u2019s why the western hero Spiderman is one of the most beloved heroes of all time. This is because despite his powers he has relatable problems humans go through. All the characters in MHA are cardboard cutouts of each other or knockoff versions of better characters from better series. They react the same and don't stand out unless the author demands it for an episode to poorly manipulate audience\u2019s emotions. \\n\\n\r\nExample\u2019s: 1a: Uraraka has an arc explaining how poor her family is to be forgotten about. The conflict isn\u2019t resolved or discussed again. It was introduced to be forgotten about. Also it wasn't hinted at beforehand, it was dropped out of nowhere. A better writer might have shown us hints beforehand or show Uraraka work on resolving said issue like getting a job. Have Uraraka work & balance school to show her dedication to solve the problem. \\n\r\n1b: Iida deals with the dilemma of revenge, which went against his previous moral\u2019s, to easily forgetting about it after a chat with a friend. This is never mentioned again and the emotional investment to his family was never hinted at. It was dropped out of nowhere. A good author might have shown hints, or have it take-longer for Iida to overcome the moral dilemma. Perhaps Iida starts to question hero society or his previous moral ideas. \\n\r\n1c: Momo has an arc showing her insecurities & has a panic attack. This behavior was never hinted previously. The audience is thrown off again. The \"insecurity\" is cured after a conversation & is forgotten about. \\n\r\n1d: Shoto has an arc describing family trauma but after a conversation mid battle is convinced to change by visiting his abusive mother and to work out issues with his abusive father. Although, Shoto\u2019s issues are sometimes mentioned this cheapens the character. Why should an audience be concerned if character\u2019s problems are solved through a chat? A good author would show Shoto slowly developing solutions on his own\u2026not have a lead play \u201cGod\u201d to solve everyone\u2019s issues. I will address the lead in a bit. \\n\r\n1e: Bakugou has an ongoing arc/gag of his wailing inferiority complex. It doesn't make sense as the one he feels inferior to is powerless whiny wimpy Izuku Midoriya. I can only assume its because Izuku is the main character but Bakugou doesn't know this. The motivations he has are to be a hero because he wants to be the best. Wow such rich motivation & not at all childish or cliche... The bullying he does as a child I thought would be do to having abusive parental figures. However, his family life is fairly good. So, the only excuse for him actively picking on the weak must be because he is a sociopath. Also for some reason the author thinks its a great idea to have him constantly opening up his feelings to the one he's abusing. When it makes no sense. Why would any bully confess personal insecurities to their victim? This reminds me of a Key & Peele skit titled 'School bully'. The only way I can see why Bakugou is a favorite amongst fans is because his commentary about the show is disturbingly meta...extra's fumigate, nothing makes sense, nobody is worth remembering, & Deku is the worst. - Yes that sums up the show nicely! \\n\\n\r\nThere are no realistic psychological dilemma's for any of the teens without it coming out of nowhere, used for audience manipulation, or being \"cured\" after a talk. Otherwise characters exist as literal unfunny gags. An author who uses manipulative sob tactics in characters without presenting hints, or indications, beforehand and does not execute the resolution properly is a terrible writer.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIzuku Midoriya/Deku is the worst shonen protagonist of all time. Deku is essentially a boy scout bore who is cringe worthy at best and extremely annoying at worst. In the beginning Deku claims being a hero is his number one goal yet idolizes a bully & never once trains. Once Deku learns he has no powers he essentially gives up. He never trains his body to achieve his goal another way, or to defend himself against bullies. All Deku did for fourteen years, according to the information from the first episode, was take notes of heroes, cry, & complain. Its until a deus ex machina happens where the number one hero, who happens to be the leads cherished idol, All Might, decides to select him as a student & give him free superpowers. It happens after All Might witnesses Deku attempt to \"save\" a bully from a monster - whom would have easily killed him if it wasn't for plot armor. And meanwhile, three able pro heroes stood by for no reason. If those three pro heroes reacted normally/logically/consistent with the story then Bakugou would have been fine. The author made them stand by for no reason. It was an attempt to make Deku look heroic when in fact he was reckless & wore heavy plot armor. So, after one event of recklessness/stupidity an event Deku caused, the number one hero picks Deku a random, lazy, timid, crybaby he just met to be a successor and give free ultimate power to. Why? Oh, it\u2019s because Deku reminded All Might of himself. All Might was given free powers as a human once too. So, All Might did it for the feels. Is this guy really the number one hero? Quite frankly that logic makes him sound like a complete idiot. We find out he has a huge battle scar from being reckless yet he picks the first reckless kid he sees...\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that someone like Deku was selected would make any hardworking person pissed. Deku gets unrealistic, undeserved, free, overpowered things for being reckless & dumb. The show could have gone in a better direction. Deku could have remained human to explore bigotry/racism in this universe of quirk vs non-quirk users & which species is worthy to the better qualities of life. However, the creator doesn\u2019t want to take on such complex issues and instead ignores them after human Deku gets powers. Perhaps Deku could have trained to be a hero despite what anyone said. It would have given a message of working hard for what you want. Instead, Deku gets everything handed to him through deus ex machina\u2019s, crying, & by events he causes. In season 2 another deus ex machina happens as magically its explained that Deku's quirk has a will of its own that can break him out of mind control quirks! So, whenever Deku is out his quirk can come in to save him. Talk about plot armor! What is inspiring about that?! What happens to Deku is luck, plot armor, & deus ex machina's for someone very undeserving whiny & *pathetic.  \\n\\n\r\nDeku after one year of *strength* training somehow learns advanced combat fighting abilities & easily goes toe to toe with Bakugou, Shinso, Shoto, & villains. How does strength training = precise combat knowledge and Deku suddenly losing previous timid behavior in fierce battles? Notes/Weight Lifting do not equal a black belt in martial arts. Why would all of a sudden his personality trait change randomly while fighting? Its because the author isn\u2019t consistent in his story telling. Suddenly you can watch a few UFC matches, take notes, and use those moves without practice in a heated battles against bullies you fear and murderous psychopaths?! Bakugou & other students trained longer than the lead. Suddenly one year is all it takes for Deku to catch up? An example: the toss Deku does against Bakugou season 1. I have experience in martial arts and that move is not \u201ceasy\u201d. If you tried it without practice or knowledge you\u2019d be flattened. Deku is 5\u20195 Bakugou is 5\u20197 thats at least 15 Ibs of difference. Considering Bakugou was wearing 6 Ibs gauntlets its an added 12 Ibs. Bakugou has trained more than a year, has more muscle mass, and has experience in those moves. It is not possible for someone with no experience/practice to use a moves like that in heated battle and succeed against someone very experienced. If you don\u2019t believe me then try to strength train for a year and use a move like that on an experienced fighter who is bigger, stronger, and taller than you. Then, in season 2 he does it to a kid who is 5'9 - thats at least 30 Ibs in difference!! You expect me to believe that?! Then, to give evidence of \"training\", Deku season 2 trains for a week during an internship & when he gets back is able to do acrobatic air moves like Bakugou. The creator obviously did no research into the significance of martial arts training. Those moves are difficult & take time. They take more than a week to achieve. Naruto had realism as far as hard work & training go. All those characters trained for years to preform martial arts moves. In Yu Yu Hakusho, Yusuke trained for six months with a master S class fighter. Deku trains for a week...Again why should I root for this whiny brat? Deku claims to be an underdog - yet he gets everything handed to him, has deus ex machinas, everyone loves him, has the number one hero up his ass, every girl wants him, has the number one quirk, is the chosen one, & learns moves faster than experienced fighters. This is all happening less than 60 episodes in! \\n\\n\r\nFor the exams to enter UA, Deku gets the highest amount of rescue points (73) for beating an off limit zero-point robot to save 1 person. Why? The robot was worth no points & Deku only saved one student. The plot changes consistency to benefit the lead thats why. Thus, there will be no tension and you can expect him to always win. There we\u2019re thousands of applicants who trained longer and harder than Deku. Why should/would Deku after one year of strength training beat them? Why was he the only one out of thousands to attack a zero point robot? If the plot was realistic someone would\u2019ve helped Uraraka knowing they\u2019d get a rescue point. Why should they reward students for destroying something they said was zero points, and who significantly injure themselves in the process? If that we\u2019re a real crisis it would very problematic. Deku would be on the ground broken bones/useless while more villains came in. Why should he get the most rescue points? Deku only saved 1 student that\u2019s the amount he should get. If Uraraka hadn't bitch slapped him he would've died! So again Deku is awarded for recklessness & plot changing its consistency much like how those three pros stood by. This happens every season! It means you can't take the rules set in this show seriously as the author changes them whenever it benefits the *horrible lead.\\n\\n\r\nDeku\u2019s fighting animation is terrible, 'Deku punched another guy to victory instead of showing off strategic battle understanding, clever tactic, or killer animation.'. Deku is one of the \"smartest\" students but never uses this so-called gift. Instead he endangers children, destroys his body over the feels, is reckless, & acts out on soft emotional trigger bait.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s awful that whenever other characters get a \"moment\" in the series they are forgotten about, played for comedy, used to down play the significance of abuse (Shoto), or later used for just having a \u2018crush\u2019 on Deku (Uraraka). They have no goals of there own unless Deku has something to say about it. Everything important to other characters development has to revolve around the *pathetic lead & its bullshit. \\n\\n\r\nDeku is a hero who is emotionally unstable, admires people who hate him, & gets things through deus ex machinas. If you re-watch the series you'll notice all of Bakugou's meta commentary is disturbingly spot on. Everyone acts like extra\u2019s, nobody is memorable, nothing makes sense, and Deku is the worst. Period. Now lets move forward.\\n\\n\r\n2a - Inconsistent/Idiotic plot. The exams set up for entering the #1 hero school in Japan are insanely stupid. The exam is to fight as many robots as possible under a time limit. The robots are worth points and after the time runs out the top scoring kids will be accepted. This is unbelievably uncreative, useless, & *moronic. Why don\u2019t they evaluate applicants *mental health or/& have *psy. tests. Thats what every police force does. If heroes are protecting the public and have very *dangerous quirks they should be evaluated. They should make sure these applicants with *dangerous powers are not sociopaths, psychopaths, manipulators, liars, or spies. Otherwise, who is to say villains, spies, etc. won't enter UA, do to these easy admission requirements, steal knowledge, & crush Japan!? The \"#1 hero school\" in Japan has no psychological tests, & no shown measures to prevent spies or villains from being admitted. As later we find out there is indeed an unknown spy(s) gathering information. Nice going, \"number one hero school\"/Plot.\\n\\n\r\n3a - The villains are awful- In season 2 students are punished for self-defense or saving people from a serial killer. Yet they saved/defended themselves season 1 during the USJ attack and weren't punished. Did the writer forget that? Oh wait, this time its being used as emotional manipulation to make us feel sympathy for the leads. Well I don't. The villains in MHA are the absolute worst. The villains are unsympathetic, boring, ugly, generic, & moronic. Why should I feel anything for a protagonist if the villain they face is pathetic? Shigaraki, one of the main villains, infiltrates the number one hero high school in broad daylight & acts surprised his mission fails. Firstly, he invading a national hero high school guarded by dozens of pro heroes & staff members who out class him and he's surprised things didn't work? If the show made sense students would have used phones or used quirks to alert others. If the show made sense the \u201cNumber one hero school\u201d would have cameras in facilities, security guards, & emergency buttons all over. If the show made sense some of those *adult *experienced villains would have killed or significantly injured students. Next, Shigaraki kidnaps a hero student which in turn reveals his location & gets his master thrown in jail. Again, what a dumb plan. Why is he obsessed with teenagers & not focusing on gathering experienced adults for his organization? Overall, Shigaraki does nothing to properly advance goals. I\u2019ve caught up with the manga & I'll warn you his actions only get progressively more stupid. Spoilers: He destroys a weapon that works to eliminates quirks for what reason? That weapon would prove very useful in defeating heroes which is what he wants to do...Next the creator thinks its a great idea to introduce these braindead Nomu monsters. I guess its an attempt to make the villains look better by comparison. Similar to how robots are thrown in next to our bland heroes. However, this only makes both groups feel lackluster as they rely on these things instead of their own strengths, or personalities. The other villains like Stain have no depth, sympathy, charm, charisma, or are even good looking. Why are all of them ugly? If these villains want absolute destruction of heroes, why are they so concerned with teenagers in high school? Why not go into the underground villain society, gather *adult *experienced members, or stress about the *thousands of trained *adult pros hunting them? Why is this ignored? It's ignored because this series makes no damn sense!\\n\\n\r\n4a- bad story telling- If this is a \"number 1\" hero school why aren\u2019t lessons, philosophies, *anti heroes, ideas, or moralities taught or talked about?! Why do they all think alike and act like robots!? Why do they only fight robots?! It\u2019s just, 'let\u2019s fight because you\u2019re bad.'. There is no meaning or understanding. There is no valid emotional buildup. It\u2019s just thrown out of nowhere and resolved the same. There is nothing creative, innovative, or new about the show. In fact why are some of these students admitted to this \"number 1\" hero school? Most of the students are complete idiots. I thought this was a \"2 percent acceptance rate\". I would understand if it was set in America but this is Japan. The series makes it a point to stress about the overwhelming importance of quirks. It states if you don't have one you're essentially useless & can never be a hero. Its begging to have a human come in like Space Cobra, Spike S, Space Dandy, Guts, Nic Brown, or Rock Lee to prove these racists wrong! Why tell us UA was accepting humans to have none be admitted? The creator could have used this information as an opportunity to place a human hero in his story. However, that would take significant attention away from his prized bitch Izuku. \\n\\n\r\nIn season two the majority focuses on a televised school sports festival which apparently has more viewership than the olympics. Yet two out of the three main events are fighting fodder robots, and playing chicken. Yes... I'm sure I'd love to spend time watching a bunch of bratty kids fight dumb robots and play chicken. The players are first year UA students. So already an audience knows these are inexperienced fighters. Here's how the writer should have done the event- Take the top five students out of sixteen district hero high schools to fight. The fights are five on five matches till one team is left. That winning team wins grand prize of money, fame, ranking, etc. and makes the school reputation & revenue go up. This would set up attention to seniors, juniors, etc. UA characters would watch these fights as the writer would introduce other characters because the ones we have SUCK. Skip all the robots, chicken games, and go straight to fights. There are stakes for school rep. student careers, etc. and it would make a hell of a lot more sense to tune in watching this! Have one, or more, of a fighter be a human and show 'em kicking ass. Show how far schools go to keep reputations. How status & popularity are apart of hero success and why its wrong. Show the class wanting to be in this top five selection and how it motivates them to train etc. All these are great elements that could have been added!\\n\\n\r\nIn season 3 we have a license exam. If students pass they get to be legal heroes. The setup for the exam is fighting to then saving staged victim citizens. WHERE ARE THE MENTAL EVALUATIONS?! Good god this incompetent. I mean this is where they are given freedom to fight criminals in public and you don't give students interviews, questions, psy. tests, etc.? It is common sense! Nearly every UA kid passes except Bakugou and Todoroki. However, they have a chance to pass by taking extra classes. So who cares about them failing as they can easily pass later. Why did every UA student pass? As far as I can tell some of them are very incompetent. What the writer could have done is have half fail the first test. Those that failed would have to wait a year to try again. That way we could get some necessary development for those lame bland characters. Having everyone pass feels illogical given we've seen how moronic most of the kids are. \\n\\n\r\nIn season 3 they introduce a few new characters. One character that comes to mind is Inasa. Inasa is a freshmen at SA - the rival school for UA. Inasa's power is wind manipulation, like Jin from YYH. Inasa is a loud eccentric character who gets overly excited about team spirit & hates rudeness. Inasa isn't arrogant, even though he has rights to be, as his quirk control is better than any student seen. Inasa believes herorism is being honorable & respecting others. When he sees others not living up to these ideals he disavows them. The character design is like Victor Krum from the harry potter series. I like this character as he has a central idea, isn't rude, and is mature enough to admit self-errors. Also he is one character who isn't manipulated by the *bitch Deku on how to 'change' or is 'inspired'. Inasa should be filled with pride but he is obsessed with bugs, making friends, and being polite. The other characters introduced are bland. Mirio, a top student, has a gag of getting naked to use his quirk...Why are the top three students second years? No seniors or juniors? That seems very odd. Why not have a variety? Have one second year and two seniors, etc. Then of course they're all quirky and awkward...Why? If they are the elites at UA have them be intimidating. Don't use their characters as gags because thats what they'll become GAGS!! A similar pattern the creator uses on all his empty characters. Ugh.   \\n\\n\r\nI cannot believe people think this show deserves an 8.66 or that season two deserves an 8.69. Do you realize that\u2019s a higher rating than *Yu Yu Hakusho, HXH (99), Tatami Galaxy, Berserk (90s), Neon Gen, Near all Jojo series, NHK, MSG, & Baccano. All far superior series whom MHA can\u2019t even touch. This season is the same rating as Death Note! People think this bland sap of crap is as good as Death note?!?! You think season 2 of it is better than Death note!?! Even Naruto is better than this and Naruto sucks! Naruto had a consistent training progress and performance. Naruto had stellar fighting animation from a team who researched and understood martial arts. There is none of that in MHA! Its sloppily put together in every way possible!\\n\\n\r\nAll the attention in this series is to one of the most insufferable leads of all time. Even Gon from HxH who is thought as too goodie goodie still broke moral convictions, worked hard, didn\u2019t complain, and accomplished dreams instead of waiting for a deus ex machina (All Might) to happen. And he didn't play god to every characters development! Gon is twelve and he is more emotionally mature than Deku!\\n\\n\r\nI will give the series credit for a decent art style, catchy music from the Openings, Endings, and OST. The series shows off creative powers\u2026However, there are dozens of shows that do this better - and why are you watching shows for such generic superficial reasons? The fighting animation is terrible, 'A guy punched another guy to victory instead of showing off strategic battle understanding, clever tactic, or killer animation.'. Demand more for your viewing experience. Time is short. Do not waste your time on generic cookie cutter short attention span entertainment. I can only name one character I liked, Inasa, and he was around for only five episodes. That is how trash this is! A towns worth of characters and only one is likable. How pathetic. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: MHA is a show with a majority of bad characters, nonsense world building, terrible fighting animation, bland character designs, poor villains, has no depth or challenging ideas in morality, ethics, or society, & takes no risks. You'd think some of these concepts would be heavily explored since it\u2019s a title *school anime about learning how to be a perfect hero. Alas, it\u2019s not and the ideas are generic black & white boring concepts an angst teen would write! Its a light novel written by a bad fan fiction writer!\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many better shows to enjoy, LOGH, FMAB, *YYH, DN, Monster, HxH, Tomorrows Joe, RK, Lupin the third, CB, GTO, Space Cobra, Neon Genesis, Fist of the North Star, Captain Harlock, Sailor Moon, MSG, Space Dandy, FLCL, One Punch man, etc. \\n\\n\r\nMHA deserves a one out of ten because its a show that further brings down anime. It keeps brining anime down to garbage. It must be stopped. \\n\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nTRASH\\n",

            "content": "I do not like Boku no Hero Academia. \r\nBoku no Hero Academia is probably the most popular anime of recent years and is widely regarded as a great series. But I\u2019ve never understood the hype. There are familiar characters with dull motivations and extremely boring humor. BnHA is pretty much 50 percent \"comedy\" comedy with BIG quotation marks and 50 percent fights. I'd like to explain why I think BnHA fails in both of these departments in this review.\r\nThe Fights \r\nI'll be comparing an anime with fantastic fights: Hunter x Hunter with those in Boku no Hero Academia in these segment so if you haven'tseen Hunter x Hunter, what are you doing? watch it. But the second part might not be as relevant to you if you for some reason haven't seen it\\n\\n\r\nThe fights in BnHA aren\u2019t good. There are no brains used in any of the fights. In the end, it\u2019s always the one that punched harder that\u2019s victorious in the end. There\u2019s this one fight in season 2 where Uraraka actually uses her smarts to try and win against Bakugo. Her plan succeeded, but she still lost because Bakugo used his power harder. I\u2019ve seen many comparisons between Boku no Hero Academia and Hunter x Hunter. I also don\u2019t really get these, because Hunter x Hunter is one of the best animes ever made. BnHA is not. Let\u2019s just compare the fights.\\n\\n\r\nFights in Hunter x Hunter are always extremely thought-out and mentally challenges our heroes. The fights always have a setup and a point either to prove how much stronger a character has become by doing something that they couldn\u2019t do before. Some fights can start whole character arcs. One fight that started an arc was when Gon first encountered Hisoka during the Hunter exam arc. While Gon was trying to steal his numbered plate Hisoka just knocked him to the ground in one punch. He then gave his plate to Gon either way and said: \u201cI\u2019ll let you keep it till\u2019 you can punch me like that\u201d. And then many episodes later when Gon lands his first Punch and finally lets Hisoka have his plate back is SO satisfying. And that\u2019s only because this fight had a long setup and gave the characters good motivation. The first fight between Hisoka and Gon is just one of many examples of great fights in Hunter x Hunter.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already talked a bit about the fights in BnHA so imma keep this shorter. I just want to make the point that the fights in BnHA are nearly the exact opposite of those in Hunter x Hunter. The fights are mindless and dull and the characters don't have real motivation to beat the shit out of each other more than that one of them is good and the other is bad. In most cases, some sort of motivation is revealed during the fight but not before to give the characters some motivation to fight in the first place. Often you don\u2019t even know who the villain is before the fight has started. But then they reveal something like \u201cI killed your parents\u201d or something in the like. There\u2019s one more thing that REALLY bugs me off about the BnHA fights. And that is those goddamn speeches in the middle of the fights that everyone has. Like when he stands there screaming some generic nonsense, JUST PUNCH HIM. In almost every fight Deku looks down at the ground talking silently. Then we get a shot of him clenching his fist, then looking up and starting to scream before getting some power boost. And the villain just stands there and listens to him talk about how All Might gave him his chance in life or whatever. Deku could be so beat that both of his arms could be broken and he barely could stand. But after holding a speech he magically beats the bad guy. Maybe Deku wasn\u2019t quirkless after all. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in both of these animes is actually quite amazing. That\u2019s the one thing I will give to BnHA, it\u2019s visually pleasing. Both have very good character designs that make the characters stand out and you can clearly understand at least a bit of the character just by looking at them. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy\\n\\n\r\nBnHA is one example of the most boring comedy in an anime that I\u2019ve ever watched. Between the dull fights, our other boring characters interact with each other. And they often lean on this pervert for comedic value. But it\u2019s just not funny. It really cannot get a smile out of me. I\u2019ve never liked the slapstick kind of comedy. I don't find it funny when people get hurt or get extreme nose bleeds because one of the female cast members are in a bikini. I find the friendly banter between the characters in Hunter x Hunter to be much more effective. Between the fights in this much better shonen are there most often interactions between our four main characters. And these scenes actually make us believe that they are friends and have an honest to god relationship. They fight with each other, joke and laugh things real friends do. \\n\r\nPeople always say that humor is subjective, and I beg to differ. Humor is not subjective, but what YOU find funny is. If you have ever watched an interview with a comedian then you can easily tell that all of them have plans and tactics on how to make you laugh. In the simplest form, you have to have a set-up and a pay off to make a joke that some people find funny. They either tell a story before the punchline or make a call-back to something they said before. This is where Boku no Hero Academias' comedy fails. There's no set-up and barely any payoff to any of the jokes (there are a few exceptions tho). The characters just make a funny face and scream loudly, that's comedy for you. The comedy is on Instagram-comedians level for god's sake. And just the fact half, if not more of the time is spent on this godawful comedy is mindboggling to me.   \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, writing this review has made me realize how much I like Hunter x Hunter but also how much I dislike Boku no Hero Academia. So if you wanna take something from this review, watch or rewatch Hunter x Hunter. :)  \\n",

            "content": "This season was just more of the same of the previous two except longer. We first get another training arc, where the students are training to improve their quirks. The training portion amounted to \u201cthe more you use it, the stronger it gets.\u201d, how exciting. The author must have realized how dull it was as it only lasted about half the episode and was never to be seen again for the rest of the season.  \r\nNext was another attack by the Shigaraki and goons, their goal this time is to kidnap Bakugo. We\u2019re also introduced to a new one dimensional villain called Muscular, whodebuts and is defeated by a 1000000% smash asspull from Deku the same episode. I also can\u2019t get over how stupid it is that the students need permission from their teacher to use their quirks despite being in a life or death situation (Even made more annoying is the fact that such a rule wasn\u2019t present in the first season when Shigaraki and friends first attacked). Anyway, the League of Villains succeed for once and kidnap Bakugou. Why? Because they want to recruit him. That\u2019s right, someone who chooses to enroll in one of the top hero school totally has his eyes set on becoming a villain apparently. Stupid shit like this is why the villains in this show can\u2019t be taken seriously (And it doesn\u2019t help that we still know next to nothing about them). We\u2019re again introduced to another new, bland villain named All for One, who is the villain counterpart to All Might. The two eventually engage in their last battle and All Might wins. \\n\\n\r\nWith the exception of the first fight between Deku vs Bakugo, the battles in this series are generally lackluster, and All Might vs All for One is no exception; there was no build-up, the fight itself was mostly talking about All Might\u2019s mentor (Who we still don\u2019t know enough to care about) and at most there were about 4 exchanges overall with explosions everywhere, how exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc of this season is again, an examination. This time they\u2019re going to take an exam in order to get their \u201cProvisional Hero Licenses\u201d, which allows them to use their quirks to save people and put down villains. The first portion of the exam consists of playing dodgeball, I shit you not, this is how they pick heroes who can be entrusted with saving lives and taking down villains. One Punch Man had a better examination and that was a freaking parody. Second part of the exam wasn\u2019t so bad until Todoroki gets into an utterly stupid quarrel with a newly introduced character named Inasa, and holy shit, this guy takes pettiness to a whole other level; Inasa apparently was suppose to enroll into U.A but instead chose to literally go school in the other side of the country just because he didn\u2019t like Todoroki, and it\u2019s not like Todoroki did anything to him, he just didn\u2019t like the vibe Todoroki gave of. Due to Inasa\u2019s actions both him and Todoroki fail the exam, but wait, there\u2019s actually another test that those who failed can take in three months to earn their licenses, consequences be damned.\\n\\n\r\nSo again, we get more training, more Shigaraki \"doing stuff\" and more exams. Most shonen have repetitive formulas but they are at least heading towards something, MHA\u2019s just going in circles from the looks of things, I mean, this season is almost over and we\u2019re getting yet again, another fight between Deku & Bakugo (Though if it\u2019s anything like the first one then it\u2019s might be worth looking forward to). The show doesn\u2019t even have anything to make up for it\u2019s lack of story; the world building is practically non-existent, the fights consist of either talking or spamming the same technique for majority of the battle, and most characters are incredibly shallow (Seriously, a lot of people claim the characters in the show are well developed and fleshed out but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, only Deku, Bakugo & Todoroki get anything worth noting). \\n\\n\r\nLong story short, the show gets worse each passing season with it's only redeeming quality being its animation at this point.\\n",

It's allsame in 3 seasons!\\n\r\nThe story improvement system always goes on : 'training , war with villans and regroup and the fall of the symbol of peace'.main idea: study hard and fight till you win by improving yourself.  Still does'nt change at 3 seasons....The anime was all clear like child shows. Theese are why Bnha is repetitive and bold. And tournament arcs are really unfair because characters' who has more supportive ability of course lose to a damage dealing charcter. How can you viewers get hyped to this?\\n\r\nSucceeding the main idea is not important. It's important to improve viewers view on a topic or an idea. If the show keeps going on a monotone path , the main idea and story will be less unique and effective. That won't be an improving anime , it just would be waste of producers effort and viewers time..\\n\\n\r\n -Art and animation:\\n\r\nThere was nothing that I can call beautiful because there were no detailed drawings and ambiance.\\n\r\nColor use in this show makes it more lively because every character had different type of hair and overly colorful costumes.\\n\r\nAnimation is fine , there were no gaps or misuses. Only the abrupt movements of characters make the action more powerful but exaggerated.\\n\\n\r\n -Characters:\\n\r\nEvery character has 1 point of view since the 1st season and the anime shows only one characteristics of the characters. (not Todoroki and lida) Characters are still all narrow viewed for 3 seasons. Deku wants to get stronger and save people... Purple guy wants tits... Bakugo always wants to be in the top(hero) with a true match... every character has only 1 feature and It does'nt even change in 3 seasons.0 character improvement. After the boss villan attack they tried to add 'depth' to characters by showing their rooms that they designed. (adding more meaningless variety of colors do the trick , right?) ffs-.-* And they wasted more than 3 episodes for 'character showcase' scenes. And why tf their quirks keep appear on the top every time we see the characters like the viewers are morons? And quirk explanation for every character takes more than a minute.\\n\r\nThey created variety of TeEN ChaRaCteRs which at least one of them relates to viewers by making the viewers feel closer to the character and the anime. It made this series more popular a lot easier and made this series overrated with this use.\\n\r\nTalking during fights and analyzing the fights lasts for too long mostly. It's scene time waste. They could use the screen time to improve characters.\\n\r\nFan service has always been a dissapointment in anime by lowering the characters view , characters action width and communitys' quality.\\n\\n\r\n -Sound and ambiance: \\n\r\nMusic makes act of characters and action scenes a lot more exaggerated. I really dislike that most of the animes have a moving music in a slow part/scene. Music should give a background effect and help creating the ambiance like Made in Abyss. Music should'nt be the main effect.Music should be like dust in the wind.\\n\r\nThere are 4-5 tracks are used too much that the music makes the anime repellent. There was nearly no ambience effects to make the scenes attractive and they did'nt add meaning to aesthetics. They always use the same music and effects when they show a new training place and when they fight. This makes the occurances 'cliche' and less effective.(every monotone uses makes anything more cliche and overdone)\\n\r\nSFX were coherent. They don't stand out much because of loud music mostly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLastly:\\n\r\n''The main idea may be superficial but It gets to its point with less flaws''(no).\\n\r\nIf the fiction does'nt have depth , it won't have flaws much. That makes it \\n\r\nrun of the mill. they shouldn't just train or fight the villains, there must be a psychological change, change on the hero system or world balance at least (not the fall of symbol of peace). An effective show must have improving story system and idea to create depth.\\n\r\nThis anime is'nt much different than American supernatural films. It feels like they got effected by Hollywood.\\n\\n\r\nI had the same view from the 1st season. I guess this won't change till the end.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Maybe there will be spoilers, maybe there won't. I'm writing this on the spot.\r\nI enjoy this show for the same reason I enjoy Fairy Tail. For every passing moment that the episode continues, I imagine the unspeakable atrocities that I would commit on this cast of boringass characters. I shit you not. I've been watching a decent bit of Fairy Tail and my imagination is the sole reason that I'm able to handle Natsu's shit.\r\nIf you like this anime, that's fine. If you think it's good, that's fine. If you think it's a 10/10 though? That's also fine. But when people start praising this heapingpile of absolute steaming feces as though it's some kind of shounen perfection, a masterpiece of never-seen-before levels of quality, I have to just step in and remind people that this is most definitely the first anime that they've ever seen. Also that the show isn't without its seethingly glaring flaws.\\n\\n\r\nI've said this before and I'll say it again. 90% of the side-characters are stale as fuck and could be thrown away without the show being affected in the slightest. Now I understand that side-characters aren't supposed to have huge roles in a story, but a well-written side character contributes a small but meaningful amount to whatever story they're a part of. MHA keeps on giving these worthless characters screen time, shoving them down our throats without actually making them do anything. Kirishima is one side-character that matters. There's probably another one. Throw away that perverted ball-headed dude. What's the point of that guy with the tail? Or electricity dude? Or literally any of the girls? (Whose character designs are appreciated but whose effect on the story is practically non-existent)\\n\\n\r\nAlso Bakugo. I can't stop complaining about this dude. He's like a worse-written version of Vegeta. Did you get that? A worse-written version of a character written by Akira Toriyama, a man whose writing is notorious for its myriad flaws. Unlike Vegeta's early hatred for Goku, which was justified by a history of classism that was an integral part of a long-dead society that Vegeta was once a part of, Bakugo's undying hatred of Midoriya is justified by, uh, the latter suddenly getting stronger? Can someone please explain to me? I'm sure this character dynamic means a lot to some people, and I'm interested to see the analyses of people who view this show more positively than I do, but for now I cannot fucking understand why Bakugo hates Deku so much. I could understand if Bakugo was angry and frustrated with himself, and fearful of Deku, someone he deems as weak, surpassing him. But so far in the anime (and the point I'm at in the manga), there hasn't been any hint of character development in Bakugo.\\n\\n\r\nTodoroki is the only truly great character in the entirety of the show. He has this unique backstory that adds to the world and setting the show takes place in, as well as a dynamic with his father that is sure to pay off later on in the show. The way that he acts makes sense to us because we\u2019ve witnessed his motivations, and we\u2019ve seen how other characters (mainly Deku) have affected change in him. Easily my favourite character. Iida is good too.\\n\\n\r\nI guess, because this is a review, I have to talk about something beyond the characters. The art is decent. The music is nothing to write home about. The story is adequately written, and it also helps that Horikoshi is a master of introducing new plot points, although it's a shame that she is master of little else. I think she's talented though, and she will hopefully go on to create better works once this abomination is cancelled because everyone on Earth magically regains their sense of taste and collectively throws this shit in the trash.\\n\\n\r\nNow back to the characters. I kind of like Deku, but he would have been higher on my list of favourite characters if it weren\u2019t for the greatest writing error in shounen manga history occurring so early on in the show. At first I thought Deku was going to have to compete quirkless in a world of superpowered freaks. I thought he was gonna have to overcome obstacles with his brilliant mind, and through sheer dedication and hard work. His place among heroes would have been similar to that of Batman's among the Justice League. But he just ended up inheriting the abilities of All Might, the world\u2019s strongest superhero. It\u2019s just way too painful to ignore such a massive missed opportunity. This could have literally changed the shounen manga/anime landscape. But when he gets powers, what is the point of the show? Can anybody tell me? If we're not watching a show to see a person overcome physical and social challenges, or to experience an interesting and dynamic cast, or to bask in the glory of its aesthetic decisions, then why are we watching it at all? At the end of the day, my main complaint towards \"My Hero Academia\" is that there is no reason for its existence as a piece of art, anime, manga, or otherwise. Had it not been Studio Bones that picked it up, it would have just been another throwaway show in a sea of new releases that never saw the light of a second season. Now, as I stated before, I'm not saying that you can't like the show. I'm not even saying that I don't like it when people like the show. I love talking with people whose view of certain anime is the polar opposite of mine. But that's only when they articulate their points well and actually understand why they like the damn thing. Most of the compliments and positive comments I see directed towards MHA are the same vapid, pointless comments that I see directed to literally every other anime. The only difference in this case is that there are more of them, which prompts me to talk about it. \\n\\n\r\nI think it's worth noting that my previous review of this show was a 6/10, way more positive than the 3 I'm giving it now. But that's always been the case with this particular work. The longer it goes on, and the more that I think about it, the less I enjoy it. At the very best, I can call this show, \"an anime about things.\"\\n\\n\r\nthe end",

            "content": "This is actually my very first review so I'll try to be proper in terms of critique.\r\n(Very Light Spoilers!!)\r\nBoku No Hero Academia is one of those animes that I actually consider as mediocre regarding on how generic it is but at the same time I hate it because of how it leaves out many things in terms of characters, plot etc. and that will be explained in this review\r\n\u22c6Story- 4\u22c6\r\nThe Plot of this season was based on the Licenses that they were supposed to be receiving through training in the woods and actually applying for the exam. Compared to Season 2, it wasn't doneextremely well considering that the beginning arc was rushed and went straight to the actual fight within 5 episodes or so, Compared to the U.A sports carnival Arc where they took the time in order to finish it and its end was enjoyable to experience. The Forest Training Arc was somewhat rushed and was not being able to completely finish due to the events that occurred but was later finished by the training they did prior to the exam so that's a plus. The (someone) retrieval mission, to be honest, was really unnecessary considering the character was formidable enough to defend himself (This was due to the fast pacing in the beginning). Besides that everything about the season was ok but didn't really reach up to standard.\\n\\n\r\n\u22c6Art- 8\u22c6\\n\\n\r\nThis part doesn't really need to be explained considering the modernised art style of the season was good but not the best of course so it gets a solid 8.\\n\\n\r\n\u22c6Sound- 7\u22c6\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia doesn't disappoint in its osts including the Op and Ed which were good but the repetitive tracks that are being used are why it gets a 7. It would've been best if it's sound was diversified.\\n\\n\r\n\u22c6Characters- 3\u22c6\\n\\n\r\nI know you guys would be screaming at me for saying this was probably the best part, but for me, this was the worst. An anime basing off 2-3 characters and saying that the rest of the characters are practically meme material is not what I'd consider the best characters. Bakogou's development was the main focus of this season and honestly considering the character he is from the 1st and 2nd season, I was surprised that this occurred and I feel like it'll get better later on. The main issue to BNHA is the characters mostly due to the lack of development. Midoriya is practically the most annoying MC I've ever seen because of how he's more of a crybaby towards things and that's what disappoints me a lot but the worst part is leaving out the majority of Class 1A, heck it's been 3 seasons and I don't know anything about the characters and they don't shine a lot and I got bored when they focused more on the MC's then the supports which makes this the worst anime for me in terms of its characters. It's generic, typical and boring at most points because of lack of screen time for the whole class (1B is seen a lot more and they get more attention TBH and I feel like they skipped they whole entire class for no reason.) I could go rant the whole time but I actually want to get to the end but you get the idea. Focusing on 2-3 characters doesn't justify why the whole part of character development is done well. You forgot the other characters and that's something most people tend to ignore.\\n\\n\r\n\u22c6Enjoyment- 4\u22c6\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend watching Boku No Hero Academia, well yes and no depending on how you like your Shounen animes but this was indeed the worst Shounen I've ever seen and I don't understand the amount of love it has besides the memes. I don't really have high hopes for the 4th Season because I feel like it'll do the same mistake and I'll still have the same perception of it but considering how the next arc is one of the bests (from most sources) it's a show to take into consideration of if you're starting to watch anime but if you're a full pledged weeb then this isn't the anime for you, it'll just bore you to death.\\n\\n\r\n\u22c6Overall- 3\u22c6 (Plot-wise, it's bad. The other factors doesn't contribute to the overall score)",

            "content": "After 12 episodes I can say this season is by far the worst. I thought the end of season two was the worst part but nah, it was only the tip of the iceberg phui. I dont want to spoiler at this point but to summarize it: the third seaon is almost one piece/fairy tail level. The first season started good, new, fresh and promising, but unfortunately, now it is getting annoying/boring.\r\nFor example, like how often the mc break his body parts. No one cares at this point. Sorry, one scene where the doc says, dont do it again boy or the next time yourarms are rip, is not enough.\\n\\n\r\nFor the love of god and anime what was this scene at the start, the swimming thing? Was that necessary? Does is help in any way. Imo no. \\n\\n\r\nBy far the forst scene was that one episode where they train in the forest. Blabla they have vacation but they have to do it with their class. A tycpical anime thing. ok. But was is necessary to animate the thing where the speaker tells everyones power and what he/she is training. For the love of god and anime was the money worth animating this 2-3min long thing for no reason.\\n\r\nAfter the 5th or 6th char I thought are they kidding me.\\n\\n\r\nSome ugly chars like the dude with engine in his legs, the thirsty mfer with balls on his head, or the stupid/annoying/brainless childhood friend from the mc or other chars that are no even thinking are at this point ok. The worst part of this show now are the fillers and some dump fights.\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler from here! First, the fight againt the muscle dude, that looks like bakus dad lol. What was he thinking. Ye ok, he was \"PLAYING\". Tells their plan, like does he ever stops to speak? No!\\n\r\nHe was ez winning but he wasnt paying attention so he lost. Yeah super good. Not. Btw \\n\r\nmidoriya broke his arm again.\\n\\n\r\nBut now the worst part of this season. The fight in episode 11-12. Now a super broken villian appeared and wipes everyone in a blink of an eye. Not even all might could do something in the beginning. The villian had a type air gun thing pushing him away. The villian could have ez kill all might. In the middle of the fight the villian said, now lets do serious or so, I thought he does a laser type air gun thing now or some crazy ability, but all we got is scrap arm. SCRAP ARM. Also now he has the idea to gettining closer to all might. WHY? This is like suicide. All might is the strongest in close range combat and what he does is cuddling, god I was so angry.\\n\\n\r\nBut it was all ok until they showed the stuff like his flame goes out. He has no power and stuff.\\n\r\nI thought they are doing you know. Making the show interesting. But now all might remebers, like the dude from seirei tsukai no world break and boom the most ridiculous fight ever. I am done. I was giving the show another chance from the end of season two thing. What took ten years but this is unbearable. I am done.\\n",

            "content": "I dropped MHA Season 3 midway so this'll just be my review up until that point. I don't plan on picking it up again.\r\nStory: 5/10. MHA brings up very interesting questions and themes but does nothing with them. The fast pace of the story is great for entertainment value, but it also causes the show to skim over its characters and themes. Certain arcs with potential are just glossed over in just 5-7 episodes, leaving us with forgettable moments and characters. \r\nThe pacing is also very inconsistent. Villain arcs are rather ok for the most part, but they're then usually followed up by a boringand long training arc that doesn't even flesh out the characters well. Even after 50 episodes, most of the characters are still the same one-dimensional brats they were in season 1, even the PROTAGONIST hasn't gone through any substantial development other than crying at his insecurities and then punching things really hard. \\n\\n\r\nWasted potential at its finest. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 9/10. Fantastic and consistent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10. It's amazing how people think MHA has a diverse and well-fleshed out cast; this cast is possibly one of the worst I've seen. Characterization in MHA means giving each character 1-2 generic personality traits and calling it a day; only 2-3 characters actually have some depth to them in the form of a backstory, but other than that most of the characters are bland.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the villains are absolute jokes. There is nothing remotely interesting or original about them, all they do is sit in a bar. Even one of the most hyped up antagonists was rather underwhelming during his big moment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  5/10. As I watched MHA, my perspective slowly went from \"Oh this is awesome!\" to \"...another training arc?\" to \"...what's the point of all of this?\" The animation is fluid and beautiful, fights are well done and the quirk power system is better balanced than most, but at the end of the day there is little to no growth in the characters and little to no development in the themes of the story. I eventually saw MHA as nothing more than eye-candy to be binged, and even then I ended up dropping it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10. Ok shounen, nothing outstanding but nothing abysmally bad. At the very least it's a fun watch, but something forgettable and overshadowed by shows that actually are ambitious in their storytelling and attempt to integrate their themes with the character development and plot progression.",

The last three episodes spoke for itself.\r\nStarting the show with a very weak start, most of the watchers have let their guard down only to be blown away by the superb-quality from the best episode so far in the series, which is fourth episode. Oh well, if you haven't catch up until the fourth episode, watch it immediately, and it will be the best thingyou will do all day. Shoutout to the Midoriya's voice-actor and especially Bones for making one of the best fighting-scene I've ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nThe important thing that should be mentioned is the mediocre Class B finally move-up from their comfort-zone to working-hard and slowly becoming a Hero they've always wanted to be. All characters have a great development equally, something that has always been missing in most of shonen-series. Almost all of the support-characters in shonen-series are usually overshadowed by the main characters, but Boku no Hero Academia change that perspective in spectacular way. The way of the story-writing feels a lot like Eiichiro Oda, a perfectionist who never wants to left a weakness in his story.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s still at 6th-episode, but Boku no Hero Academia already broke all of people's expectation.

            "content": "Have you ever liked an anime's characters so much you wished they got out of the dreadful story they are involved in?\r\nWell, BNHA is this case.\r\nWhy does a season 2 or a season 3 always get more praise than season 1? That's because people who already saw the awful plot already dropped the series and the only ones remaining are the ones who praise it a lot.\r\nBut why do i keep watching it even though i almost gave Season 1 a 5?  Well, because people told me Season 2 was a \"masterpiece\".  I decided to give it another chance and I was notdisappointed.  Midoriya's plot armor had disappeared for a time being and the anime focused on other great characters (such as Todoroki and Ochako).  \\n\\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I decided to give Season 3 a go.  Season 3 is the worst season of BNHA, and it's not hard to know why (spoilers ahead):\\n\\n\r\n1) Plot armor.  Midoriya once again defeats a strong enemy (who nobody cares for btw) using an asspull power-up.  All Might defeats the most powerful of all enemies by just talking and a Smash, ugh.\\n\\n\r\n2) Filler episodes.  They stretched the whole License Exam arc, one of the worst arcs out there. Playing dodgeball? Ugh.  Rescuing people? Ugh.  The worst of all filler episodes was the mystery episode.  Midoriya solved the case just himself, which takes me to the other point:\\n\\n\r\n3) Midoriya.  He is becoming the Kirito of BNHA.  He solves cases, always saves his classmates, girls love him, boys praise him.  even the teachers always speak about him \"he's the heart of the team\".  And what even bothers me most, is that Midoriya can't stop crying.  He has to cry 2 times each episode.  It doesn't feel emotional at all, it feels horribly forced.  When Bakugo cried, it felt real.  Midoriya is just crying and crying for everything.  He is the worst character in this series.\\n\\n\r\n4)Arcs and villians.  Have you noticed how we are moving in a full circle? That's because this story is not going anywhere.  We get a \"training arc\", then an \"exam arc\", then the villians appear out of nowhere with no special reason and we get the \"Villian team arc\".  Then, a bad guy (nobu, stain, All for one) appears and the pro heroes have to defeat him with the help of the students.  Then we go to the starting line.  I don't think that after 50+ episodes, some students have only figured this much of how to use their quirks.  For example, the acid girl now just uses her hands to shoot at larger distances.  Midoriya only figured that he has legs, Bakugo now shoots an explosive beam.  We are going nowhere if you think they are progressing.\\n\\n\\n\r\n5)Filler characters.  Each 2-3 episodes, we are introduced to great new characters. These characters are designed perfectly.  They are great, i am not kidding.  The guy who can manipulate his skin? Great! The gale guy? Amazing!  What's the problem?  They are only introduced with the sole purpose of giving one fight and never ever appearing again.  They even introduce us \"The Great Three\"; i am sure they will get disposed once this arc ends. \\n\r\n---------------\\n\\n\r\nBut not everything is bad about BNHA, I mean, i love its characters (except mineta, the tail guy and the sugar guy).  The animation is superb, the fights are amazing too.  The music is meh.  But I am seriously considering to stop watching this after too many Deku-focused episodes, too many filler and it's horrible writing.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I have been told \"Overhaul\" arc is super dark and i cannot miss it.  Maybe I can give S4 a go, but if it dissappoints me, I can assure you I won't hestitate in dropping this series.",

Rather, it is starting to look like the 2nd coming of Fairy Tail. \r\nStory:\r\nWe don't really have any plot or driving motion in the series anymore. The lack of build-up in former seasons is backfiring hard, and the pacing which is all over the place is not helping. The content itself is practically pure heroism for the sake of it, and heroes winning because they are the main characters. Really starting to look like it's made by Marvel. \r\nThe new arc is really bad. First part of the \"training\" ending in 5minutes without there being any content whatsoever. At least series like Yu Yu Hakusho --which did the same thing-- had different routes which people could choose within the forest. HxH did the same thing and it lasted 11 episodes and it was fantastic. Naruto did the same thing and introduced key plot elements and characters. In Hero Academia's case, there is no content behind it. All characters just use their trademark moves once. Literally nothing happens outside it. After a hard day of doing the said nothing, we get some manservice/fanservice, women and men bathing because apparently that's the point of this series now.\\n\\n\r\nI am afraid the word \"terrible\" is not even enough to describe the current writing. Fanservice fillers, romantic feelings used as a running gag. The main content is comedy. C o m e d y. Jokes that aren't funny at all. The pinnacle of the humor was a scene where dude ate cake while lifting weights. Thus far, the series has focused most on eating food. What type of a person writes FTS like this? This isn't shokugeki no souma... The series doesn't even look like it's based to a written story, more like seems to be some premade story macro which the author forgot to fill with content.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters are the reason why I am watching this show, they are being handled really poorly. Much like with the story, there is no development with the characters either. Unless we consider asspulled power control \"development\". The filler where they act out of character and look like clowns is really not serving any of them. Does Bones not know what Source Fillmaker is? We literally don't need soft-core fanservice, thank you very much. \\n\\n\r\nKacchan has been super annoying since the very beginning and looks like he is suffering the Sasuke-effect forever and always, much like that Bullet for my valentine song. It's so frustrating and unnecessary. Could they please develop him into a decent character already instead of making him look like the combination of Hulk and the main dude from Black Clover. So many of the rest of our heroes-in-training only radiate comedy, not characteristics. I don't like that very much.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains are the best and the worst part. Really simple-minded characters who have basically no reason to do anything they are doing. Giggling evily because they so evil and whenever they do anything it's practically keikaku doori tier meme. At least they bring some interesting factors to the series and look cool, some even badass. They are supposed to be the half of this show, after all what are heroes without villains... Yet at the same time they seem to only exists for the heroes. Like in episodes 3-4 \"yo, we came here now because lol iunno we wanna scare you.\" This is not how you write villains. No matter how you look at it, the boss villain had no reason to send anyone there. Keikaku doori once again I guess.    \\n\\n\r\nThe only character who gets thru any development is an angry kid who is mad at heroes.. hmmm. doesn't this sound familiar? Anyone remember the part where Sasuke and Naruto learned to control chakra with anti-gravity trees? Didn't we have this exact kid right there. In here, he is just so random it's almost as if the author thought he was cool in Naruto and wanted to put his own here.  He even says the same line \"like person like that exists\". Believing all ninjas, oh sorry, I mean heroes are selfish. smh\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\\n\r\nBones has been putting effort into it and never stopped. It's the same as before and that's exactly how it should be. Of course, the series could use approximately 20 times less of those comedic relief scenes. Some nice songs are present, but there really should be more. Many of them don't really shine,. Especially the battle OST is there in the shadows behind prioritized voice acting. The OP song is really acquired taste tho. I like how it seems better every time I hear it. Voice acting is obviously identical.. outside the out of character filler where they acted like bunch of clowns, of course.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment::\\n\\n\r\nI like this show. I have always liked this show, but damn if I don't wish it was better. There is practically nothing new (currently) for a person such as myself who has seen all BTS series already. I can safely say that Hero Academia is currently being as bad as shonen series ever are. This isn't what the characters deserve at all.\\n",

            "content": "After a great first season and a no less than fantastic second season My Hero Academia is back at it again with season 3, not even six months since season 2 ended. I wrote in my early review for season 2 that I was skeptical that it would be able to carry on being as well refined as season 1 was. Now that the second season is done there is no doubt that I was worried all for nothing. This is the exact thing I'm feeling heading in to the third season of Hero Acca. I'll just sit back and enjoy the ride, cause Ican already tell it'll be a good one. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Great (8)\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much that can be said about Hero Acca that hasn't been said already. The story is nothing really special in terms of its originality but it\u2019s in the sheer polish and perfection of the tropes and standard shounen elements that Hero Acca shines. Season 1 we had the very standard, but brilliantly phased, origin story of our main hero as well as most of the lovable supporting cast. Season 2 we got the best god damn tournament arc I've had the pleasure of beholding alongside the obligatory teacher-student-mastering-your-power-arc\u2122 but adding some great curveball such as a whole new main villain which overshadowed most other antagonists not only in the show itself but most of the shounen genre. Season 3 has thus far only begun, but by a handful of episodes in we've already set the groundwork for some of the best character interactions with the increased focus on Hero Class-B as well as the huge cast of newly introduced villains, some of which I hope can match Stain in either depth or impact. Sadly, it still gets points taken for lack of originality but since the show is clearly not going for being original at this point, I wouldn't say that its inherent lack of originality hurts the show as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Great (8)\\n\\n\r\nWith dynamic movements that really feel like they've got some weight behind them and fewer static panning shots than ever the general animation of Hero Acca remains as great as the previous season which itself was quite a leap up from the first season. I think that what truly makes Hero Acca look so nice is the lack of any major dips in animation quality generally found in most other anime. This consistency lets the viewer get deeper immersed in the show. Instead, Hero Acca has a tendency to suddenly spike in animation quality, seen many times during the previous seasons, especially season 2. I have no doubt in my mind that season 3 will deliver in that regard, partially confirmed by the fantastic fight scene in episode 4. It's really in the art department that Hero Acca suffers. Or rather, the background art and world that suffers. I've mentioned the lack of originality of this show multiple times already, but never is it as apparent as when looking at the background art of Hero Acca. It could be replaced with the background art of most other shows and the average viewer wouldn't even know something had changed. This is a critique of Hero Acca in general, and not just season 3. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Great (8)\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is great as ever, delivering deep, believable emotions despite the language barrier. Neither sound design or soundtrack is really worth mentioning though since they're in all honesty pretty forgettable. The fact that I can't really remember any of the background music reinforces that statement. It works well enough for setting the right tone for the scene, but it simply doesn't stick with you when you've finished the episode as some great soundtracks can. So, based on all of this how come sound still receives an 8? Simple. Because the OP and ED are kick ass, as usual. Rarely will a show keep me hooked from the very first second all the way until the screen fades to black. Not to mention the story that has been told continually through all the openings ever since the first season. I highly suggest you check out Mother's Basement's video on the topic. Hands down some of the best OPs and EDs out there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fantastic (9)\\n\\n\r\nIt's with its characters that Hero Acca always has shone brighter than most and the show shows no intent on giving up on developing its characters to a downright astounding point. If there\u2019s one thing that most shows fail to do it would be to develop a character. While simply giving a character a believable motivation and one or two personalizing traits might seem enough at times that would not be good enough for Hero Acca. Not even as an introduction to a character. I could bring up the best episode of the series so far, Deku vs Todoroki in the Tournament arc (fight me) as an example of absolutely stunning implementation of character development but since that discussion rightfully belongs to a season 2 review, I\u2019ll use a brand-new character as an example (light spoilers for ep 1-2 of season 3), Kouta Izumi who is probably the most interesting character of season 3 thus far. \\n\\n\r\nKouta has a very complex heritage to deal with, being the son of two heroes called Water Hose who both died fighting the villain Muscular when he was very young. Because of his youth at the time of his parents\u2019 passing he couldn\u2019t quite understand the why and how of it all. He felt that they left him alone. This has caused Kouta to feel a deep distain towards not only heroes but hero culture as a whole. Without hero culture, his parents might still be alive. The complex part of this comes from his pure love towards his parents blended with his rage and hatred towards all that they represented. He\u2019s too young to see that by spitting on hero culture, he doesn\u2019t just disregard his parents\u2019 ambitions and beliefs but also their love for him because there is no doubt that they did what they did every single day to keep others safe, to keep him safe. He has even gone as far as to set aside his quirk he inherited from them, thus disrespecting their very memory. The fact that he loved his parents more than anything while displaying such hate towards everything they stood for which for all intents and purposes hatred towards them directly. \\n\\n\r\nKoutas character reminds me of Todoroki and his until recently neglected quirk inherited from his father who he hated more than anything until Deku helped him realize his own person and who he intends to be and to step out of his father\u2019s shadow, but if I got started on that again I\u2019d be here all day. \\n\\n\r\nThe groundwork laid down by the previous seasons of Hero Acca guarantees that most of the cast is as developed as they could possibly ever need to be but with the introduction of brand new villains and a greater focus on Hero Class 1-B there is plenty of work to be done still. Only time will tell what happens but if the past is anything to go by I\u2019ve got nothing but excitement for this season. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Outstanding (10)\\n\\n\r\nI probably haven\u2019t enjoyed a show as intently as Hero Acca Season 3 since well\u2026 Season 2 probably. The excitement I feel every time I fire up another episode can only be matched by shows such as Gurren Lagann and Mob Psycho 100. My eyes are glued to the screen from start to finish. I can go from sporting the widest grin or laughing along with the characters to feeling real despair or wiping away tears from my cheeks within the margin of a few minutes, all in pure enjoyment. This show made its well-deserved way to my top 5 nearly by pure heart alone. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Fantastic (9)\\n\\n\r\nHero Acca Season 3 stays on the same path as its previous seasons to become a great classic shounen. From a stellar story filled to the brim with polished and extremely enjoyable clich\u00e9s to some of the most alive animation and fantastic openings and ending to hands down the most well-developed cast of its size I\u2019ve ever seen. I love every single thing about Hero Acca, and season 3 looks to be nothing if not more Hero Acca!\\n",

            "content": "I always considered mha for a mediocre enjoyable show. 60 episodes in and we had very little story progression and world building which is dissapoiting.\r\nSeason 3 started of with a typical generic school trip. Few attempts of comedy here and there that simply didn't land. Other than that some todoroki development and deku vs muscular build up were only things worth seeing first 3 episodes.\r\nCharacters training was much longer than it should have been. Wasted some time imo. Deku vs muscular fight was okay. The animation was great but again it was so generic and it lacked both creativity and choreography. No tactics used atall. It was just a flashy fight with 2 dudes punching each other with fists. I know, i know you are gonna say \"BuT MHa fIgHTs aRe ABouT StorY\" so is almost every fight in anime, that doesn't mean it should be mindless. On the plus side deku got some development. \\n\\n\r\nAm i the only one that noticed how repetitive mha is? \\n\r\nSeason 1 is basically characters training, villains invading\\n\r\nseason 2 is trounament arc, villains invading and finally season 3 is characters training and villains invading. There is nothing new. There is no bigger, deeper plot to get invested in to.\\n\r\nLike always bunch of dumb villains that lack motivation appeared and i simply didn't care for them. There was that tsundare girl, that discount dead pool guy, mindless musuclar who is just killing for the sake of killing, that discount stain guy that was like a lizard or something, dude with big lips and uhhh what was his name again? That dude that's obviously todorokis brother or something. It's so predictable. On the plus side one thing that mha does good is the character desgins. Despite them looking goofy at times. At least they are memorable even tho the characters themselves aren't.\\n\r\nLong story short students fight some villains and bakugo gets captured even tho bakugo clearly could have prevented it but he didn't because... he is a angry brat that wants to be acnkowladged.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is AFO vs All might fight... Again some good animation even tho there were some errors. We still don't know anything about AFO's motivation like with almost every vilalin in this show. He was supposed to be badass and his OST was supposed to be scary but it just wasn't. Not to mention his generic quirk... All might vs AFO was the peak of the season tho. It told the great story and it was good for all mights character. But we all knew all might was gonna win and he wins the most generic way possible. With final punch... The fight was dull from the actaul fighting perspective.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is just too safe. There is no suspenese, we just know good guys are gonna win. Even when bakugo was kidnapped he got retrieaved at the end. Everyone was just injured and they recovered. Even tho all might is my favorite character, his death would have made this show so much better. \\n\\n\r\nSecond arc was sooooooooo boring even tho it was filled with action. There was literally almost nothing big happening. There was a whole episode dedicated to rooms lmao. And again we get to the generic tournament arc with too many boring side cahracters that i don't care for. Mha is introducing too many, too fast. Side characters are very forgetable and the development is unievene. Even tho the cast is better than the terrible plot of this show it's still highly overrated. Too many bland characters with generic motivations and view points. Bakugo vs Deku was actaully good. I like bakugo more now even tho i still think his peronality is forced. Like why do you scream so much? I get that people had high expectations for you since birth but why so much? Tone it down ffs lmao. He is literally yelling at everyone around himself. It makes his personality unbelievable. The fight itself had the best choreography out of the 3. The animation was great too. \"The big 3\" was pretty overhyped. In temrs of character designs they are basically naruto, sasuke and sakura. Mirio is only one with potential out of the 3.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style this season is basic like always. All in all mha is enjoyable show with terrible plot. This season has very little story progression. The show itself doesn't stand out in any way.\\n\\n\r\nP.S people are giving mha too much credit for executing the generic tropes well. It doesn't do it THAT well. It's a overstatement.",

            "content": "The beloved shounen series is back again, adapting some of the manga\u2019s finest arcs. \r\nAlthough it starts with a slightly unnecessary, but well-handled recap episode, it gets right to the story afterwards, starting off with some cool set-up and character moments. Then, things get serious. \r\nSuddenly, villains are everywhere, putting everyone to a test. \r\nWhat is so loveable about shounen is the theme of not giving up and pushing to the limit, overcoming your obstacles no matter how great they are. Which BNHA exemplifies. On one side with the battles themselves. Especially the fight between Izuku and the physically superior Muscular will have you hyped,with its awesome visuals, set-up and epic sound. On the other side with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first arc of the season, multiple characters get a lot more time to shine, showing what they are made of. So we get to see them use their powers more and work together. Aside from that, class B also gets a spotlight on them after they were introduced in Season 2. Not forgetting to mention the cool villains, each of them unique and promising, with special mention here to Toga, Twice and Dabi. It\u2019s so great to see everyone getting moments of character. The large cast of BNHA has always been entertaining due to its diversity and organic feeling, mostly with all the interactions taking place between classmates. All of the characters are likeable and quirky, but they are also distinct and unique in their own way. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is on point again with its artstyle, cinematography and most appealing of all: the simply awesome fights. Studio Bones reminds us again what they are known for. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening, it took a little while to get used to. However, it still has some great visuals and a track that will be in the playlists of many fans, even if the two of them don\u2019t seem to mix together at first. The ending is loveable and cute, giving some nice time spent with everyone in manga panel style. However, let\u2019s not forget the epic music that plays at the moments it counts. You know, the moments that will stick out in our memories. \\n\\n\r\nThere were moments that made my heart race. I\u2019m enjoying the anime thoroughly, and will see it through towards the finale, expecting to see more of what we love about Boku no Hero Academia. \\n\\n",

            "content": "(Note: I wrote this review right after episode 9 of season 3 of BNHA, so if you want to read my thoughts on episode 10 and 11, go to the section that starts with \u201cEDIT.\u201d This isn\u2019t a traditional review of season 3, it is more of a retrospective for the entire series up to this point. This is not my full review, as it is too long, if you want a link to my full review, pm me.)\r\nConsidering the praise that Boku No Hero gets, a lot of the fans of the series usually include the clause that the reasons that BNHA is popular,is more so from the execution of its concepts and themes more so than the actually originality of it\u2019s premise or setting. I can agree to this notion, what BNHA excels at is the execution of its ideas, at least compared to its lackluster premise. But in many ways, this has only secured the anime as being mediocre instead of actively bad. There are many things that BNHA does right, but this never overcomes the myriad of both narrative and thematic problems that comes with the nature of it\u2019s story. What should also be said is that BNHA when compared to most other shounens, fails at basic narrative and thematic storytelling. This retrospective will contain spoilers for every season of BNHA, Naruto, The Law of Ueki, Madoka Box, HxH, FMAB, Shokugeki No Soma S1-S2, YYH, and Giant Robo: the Day the Earth Stood Still.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned in my previous review for BNHA Season 2, I feel like the character motivations of most of the characters are pretty decent if not good; I can still attest to this, the main draw of BNHA is its character. I still also agree with my assessment of the lack of personality traits that each character has. Under further consideration, I feel like the characters have more problems than just the dearth of legitimate personalities within the show. The most prevalent of the problems is the amount of characters that the audience is expected to care about, in class 1-A, there are 20 students and 6 teachers in total. This is the \u201cmain cast\u201d of characters, and as an audience, we are expected to care about every single one of them. Unfortunately, the amount of main characters reduce the amount of screen time any one character gets to a handful of minutes. In season two, Uraraka, Todoroki, Iida, Yaoyorozu, and Tokoyami all had character \u201carcs,\u201d but, calling the scene or two that each character got a character arc would in actuality be exaggerating the amount of development any one character got. \\n\\n\r\nUraraka\u2019s arc was maybe my favorite of the bunch, as the feeling of failure and disappointing those you love, is more or less a trancedential feeling that everyone has experienced at some point. The problem with her arc is that it felt more or less truncated because we really had no reason to really care about Uraraka winning the sports festival, she really never had the necessity to accept failure and the sports festival was a poor outlet for this arc as well. The sports festival may be an important event to the school and the economy of Japan, there really isn\u2019t that high of stakes for the actual students who attend UA. Although it may be a good opportunity for the students, the sports festival occurs every year, and it has very little bearing on the student\u2019s lives while attending UA. There was the empty threat that those who don\u2019t perform well at the sports festival might be moved class 1B, but knowing that they both cover the same course material, the actual changing of classes seems very stakeless. There was room for Uraraka\u2019s arc to potentially be amazing, her motivation to become a hero to help her parent\u2019s struggling financial state is compelling. But, the placement of the arc within the sports festival and the little amount of time we see Uraraka spend interacting with her parents, makes her arc one of the more lackluster of the bunch. It would have been much more intriguing had the audience got to see what Uraraka\u2019s home life is actually like, more or less, the audience only gets a monologue from Uraraka about her homelife; her monologue also doesn\u2019t go into enough detail to really sympathise with her struggle as much as an actual scene at her house would bring to the audience. I feel like aside from seeing Uraraka\u2019s home life, the other thing the anime/manga should have done was to make UA much more cutthroat than it comes across as in the show. A good example of what they could have done was to create a school setting more like the one from Shokugeki No Soma. Toutsuki Culinary Academy feels cutthroat, this is partially because of the personalities of the characters in the anime/manga, but the real cause of this feeling is that the threat of expulsion is always hanging above the heads of the characters. There is no arc within the first two seasons of Shokugeki No Soma where any of the characters feel secure in their position at the academy, and this is what BNHA needed to make Uraraka\u2019s arc compelling.\\n\\n\r\nTodoroki and Iida both suffer from similar problems that cause their arcs to be as lackluster as Uraraka\u2019s. The main problem that I have with their arcs is that any subtle development of the characters are quickly undercut by the writing. Todoroki\u2019s arc was perhaps the most fascinating from the second season, it had themes on abuse and identity that I could personally relate to. My family aren\u2019t abusive, but I was attracted to the themes of accepting one\u2019s own identity. Unfortunately, the lead up and pay off of Todoroki\u2019s arc undercut all of the dramatic setup of the premise. Ultimately, I believe in the intelligence of the audience of a story when it comes to understanding symbols and themes; Kohei Horikoshi, does not. My main problem with Todoroki\u2019s arc was the lack of subtlety in the resolution of the arc. What can be said, and what should be said, is that trauma is a deeply personal issue that when written about with fictional characters should be overcome through deep introspection and somber monologues; but, the resolution of Todoroki\u2019s arc was Deku screaming \u201cit\u2019s your power as well!\u201d while in a fight between the two of them towards the end of the sports festival. After the festival arc, Todoroki approaches Deku and says something akin to \u201cI\u2019m not totally over the trauma, but what you said to me really helped.\u201d I feel like this stole a potentially emotional realization from the character, and the lack or subtlety in the character writing of the arc caused me to have a sour taste in my mouth. \\n\\n\r\nIida\u2019s arc on the other hand struggles due to the awkward fitting nature of the arc to the character it\u2019s attached to; At the end of the sports festival, it is revealed that Iida\u2019s older brother, Ingenium, was hospitalized by Stain, this leads Iida to try to take revenge against the villain. The main problem is that up to this point, Iida has been a stoic character. Thus the portrayal of him giving in to his emotions feels more like a wrestling heel turn rather than a natural progression of his inherent character traits. I am fine with the idea of Iida giving into his emotions, but after Stain is defeated, he returns back to what he always was. Deku\u2019s virtue signalling yet again made the arc feel relatively week; the flow of the story telling at the point in the anime felt very off. I am no storytelling expert, but what I can say is that Deku and Todoroki saving Iida from Stain as they discuss the virtues or heroism, was perhaps the most boring way to resolve this arc. Iida pretty much reverts back to the character he always was, I would say he might actually be a worse character because of this arc if anything. I always saw Iida as the moral compass of the series, in season 1 and season 3 so far, this has been true. I felt like Kohei Horikoshi missed the chance to make a much better arc here; What could have happened was the family of students at UA could have been targeted by Stain in order to filter out students that can\u2019t handle the trauma that professional heroes have to deal with on an average basis. Deku\u2019s mom could have been targeted and either seriously injured or killed, and he could have been the one that went after Stain. This could have been a great chance to see what Deku would do if the villain he had to catch, harmed a family member. Iida could have been the moral compass in this arc for Deku, and this would have given the Deku (The main character of the series) more reason to become a hero than his stated goal throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nYaoyorozu and Tokoyami\u2019s arc both feel really truncated when we consider their inclusion in the actual series. I guess the one I would start off by discussing is Yaoyorozu\u2019s arc, mostly because it is non-existent but it\u2019s presence in the series has been used to counter my notion that the characters in BNHA seem flawless. Her arc was about gaining more confidence in her own abilities; but the audience were never given any reason to care about her confidence issues up to that point. I would also argue that there was no evidence that she had these issues up until the midterm exam arc where she has to beat Aizawa with Todoroki. In this arc, her confidence problems are introduced and resolved by the end of the episode, so considering it to be actual development would be hyperbolic to say the least; to the average viewer, she has always acted like she was at the end of the \u201carc.\u201d Yaoyorozu, like most characters in BNHA is a non-character, she may do things in the story but she doesn\u2019t really have any traits that she can call her own. Most of the side character\u2019s personalities blend together to make any if not all of their dialogue interchangeable. A good example of this unique trait that the side characters have in BNHA, Episode 8 in S3 gave to us the \u201cI want to save Bakugo too, but it\u2019s dangerous\u201d episode. In this episode, every character at some point says a line like that; there is not a unique reaction from any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nPeople have also argued to me that Tokoyami had a character arc in S2, and had plenty of room to develop. This argument stems from the fact that Tokoyami doesn\u2019t have full control over his shadow abilities. What I would argue against that however, is that isn\u2019t a character flaw nor is it a thematic idea that can be built off of; this is mostly because most people conflate character growth and character development, these ideas are similar but not the same. Character development is the progression of a character\u2019s personality. Character growth on the other hand is when a character\u2019s skills and abilities become more competent. Tokoyami doesn\u2019t really have any character flaws, even if he gains better control over his quirk, I doubt his personality would change in any meaningful way.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this is to say, is that the bigger cast of BNHA might be the biggest problem that the anime has; most characters don\u2019t have enough screen time to develop in any meaningful way. What I have noticed is that everyone says that BNHA is building up to a grander thematic narrative about the nature of heroism; I can agree that BNHA is about the circumstances and environment that create a hero. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think BNHA is actually saying anything about heroism. In my review on S2, I mentioned my myriad of problems with the Stain Arc, and I still hold to my thoughts on that particular arc. Stains arc was meant to justify the setting of the series, it was supposed to discuss the trivialization of heroism within the setting. Yet we are given very little reason to actually agree with his stance on heroism, the series is cognisant of the thematic flaws of having a story on heroism being set in a hero school, but it doesn\u2019t take any serious action to discuss its merits as a setting.\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019m writing this, we are 9 episodes into season 3 of BNHA. At this point, Deku is still the same character he has always been. At this point, the writing is the same quality it has always been. At this point the setting is as dull as it has always been. In many ways, this season so far has epitomizes the problems of BNHA as a whole much more so than the other two seasons have. From this point on, I\u2019m going to be drawing a lot of comparisons between BNHA and other shounen series.\\n\\n\r\nNaruto can be called the muse for BNHA, the influence that BNHA draws on from Naruto is clear as day; In many ways, it is the Naruto of the new anime generation. Naruto however, is actually really good and doesn\u2019t suffer from the same style of character writing that plagues BNHA. To prove my point, I would like to draw comparisons between the parallel characters in both series. First of all, I think there might be some merit in discussing the characters of Naruto and Deku on a thematic level and the quality of both character\u2019s development throughout their respective series. I would like to also emphasize that I am only 99 episodes into Naruto, so I haven\u2019t actually seen it to its conclusion; most of the conclusions I\u2019m about to draw is based off of my current knowledge of both series.\\n\\n\r\nWhen comparing Deku and Naruto, what should be mentioned first is the motivations of both characters. They both have similar motivations and I feel like discussing that quality may illuminate my problems with Deku as a character. At the beginning of Naruto, it is revealed to the audience that at some point Hidden Leaf village was attacked by a Nine Tailed Fox; this demon cost the lives of a huge proportion of the population of Hidden Leaf village, it also couldn\u2019t be defeated by normal means and had to be sealed in Naruto Uzumaki at the cost of his parent\u2019s life. Being parentless and having the Nine Tailed Fox sealed within him, he was ostracized since he was born. This lead him to become somewhat of a delinquent because of the lack of attention he received from his teachers and other authority figures. This caused him to want to become the Hokage, and this also satisfies his need for attention. At school, he is bullied and ostracized even more because he is a slow learner, his slow learning is caused by the Nine Tails and how it biologically messes with his body. But, being a part of squad 7 and going on various ninja missions slowly lead to him gaining more and more maturity as the series goes on, it also lead to him gaining more friends and overall gaining elements of his life that as a child he didn't have. Various characters like Jiraiya and Tsunade become parent figures to him, and Sasuke and Sakura fill in various gaps in his life.\\n\\n\r\nDeku on the other hand was bullied as a child because he was quirkless, this lead him to have a complex about this aspect of his life and as such he begins idolizing All Might and hero society based on how they protect the weak. This leads to him dedicating his life to become a hero. After displaying an act of heroism in front of All Might, All Might decides to give him his quirk and train him to become the world\u2019s greatest hero. So the main problem with Deku\u2019s character is how his motivations are very barebone, as a character, he doesn\u2019t have much going on. What makes Deku worse as a character is that he already has all of the qualities of a hero; so we don\u2019t really see Deku develop, we just see him becoming a better hero in terms of combat. This makes any conflict involving Deku really boring, and the potential drama regarding him is lackluster at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe character that Deku has the most in common with from Naruto is probably Rock Lee; but the key differences between both characters are important ones, and they shouldn\u2019t be overlooked when analysing both series. Rock Lee is a side character first and foremost, this is where he belongs as a character because aside from being lovable, he doesn\u2019t have many traits that could be built upon if he had his own story. Rock Lee was born with the inability to use genjutsu and ninjutsu, in school he was bullied for this; but, the society of Hidden Leaf village prioritizes ninjas and they are the most respected members of Hidden Leaf society. As such, he pushes himself to the limit to prove that he can become a ninja, so he pushes his body to its utmost limits to master taijutsu. He wasn\u2019t given his power, and when he is in a fight the dramatic weight that comes with his loss is much heavier than Deku\u2019s. Rock Lee has clear, defined, limits and these limits come to ahead when he fights Gaara only to get disheartened after he loses because it made it clear that it\u2019s impossible for him to overcome those who have the ability to use genjutsu and ninjutsu. After he recovers from his hospitalization, he goes back to train in order to someday become a fully fledged ninja. Deku is given one of the most powerful abilities in the series, but it felt very unearned. When we consider the dramatic weight that Deku remaining quirkless could have brought with it, the series could have given Deku more depth than what he has at the moment. Deku has a good foundation as a character, the execution of characterization in a few places was also fantastic, but Deku could have been better had certain choices regarding his power been made.\\n\r\nKota Izumi from season 3 also has a counterpart from Naruto; he is essentially a worse written Konohamaru. Yaoyorozu feels like a poorly executed Ino mirror. Aizawa is just a different version of Kakashi. Todoroki is essentially a toned down Sasuke. Uraraka\u2019s brand of uselessness is pretty much a mix between Hinata and Sakura. There is very  few aspects of BNHA that are actually original, and this is a problem because the story isn\u2019t well enough executed to overlook how derivative the story is. That being said there are aspects of the show that I do like. All Might has a legitimately great character arc. Unfortunately, these aspects are few and far between. \\n\\n\r\nWhen we examine the setting of BNHA, the first thing one may notice is how it normalizes fantasy. This comes with a myriad of benefits but the drawbacks that come with it\u2019s setting far outweighs the benefits. The population of the world is 80% super humans, but the world does not looks different in any way. The multitude of institutions that were created in a response to super powers are all very unoriginal and they all seem way too bureaucratic; the setting, more or less seems like a generic anime Japan rather than a realistic portrayal of a setting like the one in BNHA. Yet BNHA isn\u2019t fantastical enough to be compelling, the fantasy of BNHA is very subdued and overly regulated. In the mrbtongue video called \u201cTUN: Magic\u201d he makes the argument that what makes fantasy compelling is how it represents the in between of reality and imagination and the normalization process of most stories only weakens the overall quality of the fantasy setting. Although quirks aren\u2019t exactly magic, the normalization of the quirks and the realistic system for quirks zaps away all of the creativity either way. It says a lot when the most fantastical power the audience has seen thus far is Mr.Compress\u2019 ability to trap people in marbles. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting of BNHA is one of the weakest areas of the entire series, as such, I would like to compare the magic/power settings of FMAB and HxH to the power setting of BNHA. Since BNHA yearns to be realistic, a comparison between alchemy and quirks is merited. Alchemy from FMAB is probably the most grounded magic system in any shounen anime, it has hard rules that the characters have to abide by. \u201cHumankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost.\u201d Alchemy isn\u2019t a power that can create, it is inherently transformative in nature; Alchemy is also a rigid in nature, those who don\u2019t follow the rules or practices of alchemy usually get punished. This is how the Elric Brothers became deformed, since FMAB is a story about trauma and greed, a rigid magic system where those who use forbidden teachings or tries to against the laws of alchemy are punished, was inherently a good decision for the story. But on a minute to minute basis, alchemy feels pretty realistic within its setting because of the effort made to make it feel real within the setting. A great example of this is the alchemy circles, in order to perform alchemy, alchemy circles are necessary (unless you are the Elric Brothers). Edward Elric doesn\u2019t need to draw a alchemy circle before using alchemy, but he does have a prerequisite that most other alchemists have; he has to clap his hands together and then touch a surface before he can transform anything. This was a conscious choice by the mangaka because it connects to the themes of religion within the show since his hands clapped together look like an act of piety, and he never had to do this before he meet the Truth. This is an ironic power because he is an atheist. So from FMAB, we get a very rigid, realistic, and thematically relevant, magic system.    \\n\\n\r\nThis is what BNHA should have been like with its power/magic system, here and there we get glimpses of what could have been but these glimpses quickly come in conflict with how quirks actually work within the setting. 80% of humans in the setting of BNHA is born with a quirk, these quirks very somewhere between useful to useless abilities. These abilities more or less come with drawbacks as well. Since quirks are based on the biology of the person who uses them, it is similar to using a specific muscle or body part, overuse leads to great strain on the user. Mineta can only throw a small amount of his weird hair balls before his head starts bleeding, Kaminari isn\u2019t insulated to electricity and his head short circuits if he uses his power to much. In the S2 of BNHA, this is a pretty important plot point in the fight between Deku and Todoroki, Todoroki in that arc chose to not use his fire power because of his strained relationship with his dad. This ultimately leads to his body freezing up because he overuses his ice half. His power was intended to balance eachother out if he utilizes one half more so than the other. So far, I\u2019m pretty sure that the power system sounds pretty decent in BNHA; however, the system actually doesn\u2019t work that way. There are a myriad of heroes that don\u2019t have drawbacks when over using one's own abilities. A great example of this is Tokoyami, his ability is pretty much just magic, and unlike Todoroki, Mineta, and Kaminari, his power doesn\u2019t come with any physical strain. His power only has one drawback, and that drawback is that his power can become uncontrollable at night. Deku also doesn\u2019t have clear drawbacks with his power, I guess the one drawback is that you have to be moderately fit in order for the power to settle in your body. Kirishima also has no drawbacks for using his hardening ability. Tsuyu is just a frog. Mezo\u2019s healing and replication abilities don\u2019t seem to have any clear limits, nor does he have any real drawbacks for using his abilities like he does.\\n\\n\r\nBNHA\u2019s powers are too realistic to be inherently interesting, but not realistic enough to be immersive; So I want to take a brief aside to discuss HxH and how Nen works. I feel like HxH has one of the best magic systems in all of anime, it does a lot right, it scales, its intuitive, and it\u2019s flexible enough for anything to be possible. This matches the tone of HxH, it\u2019s a story about wonder and freedoms; There is a real sense of adventure in HxH that isn\u2019t present in a lot of other series. It captures this feeling with flying colors, and the magic system of the series is partially responsible for this. Nen, like spirit energy in YYH or chakra in Naruto, is a form of spiritual energy that can be used and refilled over durations of rest. In HxH, Nen can manifest in 6 different ways: Enhancer, emitter, transmuter, conjurer, manipulator, and specialization. Each way Nen can manifest is largely based off of a character\u2019s personality, and the amount of variety in each type of Nen is tremendous. What is also nice about HxH is seeing the characters improve their fighting techniques in various ways; It is also possible to learn techniques from multiple different nen trees at the cost of never mastering a specific tree. If this sounds very game like to you, I would agree, it does sound like a game. But I would argue that it is immensely more interesting than watching Deku just become stronger.\\n\\n\r\nThe power system in BNHA isn\u2019t it\u2019s biggest problem when it comes to the conveyance of fantasy, the powers themselves are very boring. I also have seen shows that have made very similar systems to quirks but succeeded where BNHA has failed. Two good examples of this would be The Law of Ueki and Medaka Box, they both have powers that serve a similar role within the plot and are about the same power level. \\n\\n\r\nThe Law of Ueki, like BNHA, is overall pretty lackluster; both series have similar problems but one area that The Law of Ueki excels at and BNHA fails at, is the concepts for the powers of the characters. What I mean is, BNHA has boring powers, and the mundanity of its powers comes at the cost of the entertainment value of the show. Let\u2019s compare and contrast the powers of BNHA to that of The Law of Ueki.  In BNHA, the main character\u2019s super power is super strength (and speed, it comes with the territory), in Ueki, Ueki has the ability to turn trash into trees (he also has angel powers later on). The side characters of BNHA have super speed, fire and ice powers, lots of them have super strength, the ability to make things float,  weird appendages, and so on and so forth. Let\u2019s now compare that to Ueki: Seiichro Sano has the ability to turn towels into steel so long as he holds his breath. Hideyoshi Sayo has the ability to turn sounds/voices into portraits that he can place on surfaces. Ai Mori has the ability to turn other people into a lover of glasses so long as she gets her opponents to make a cutesy pose. Rinko Jerrard can turn beads into bombs. The inherent level of intrigue between a fight with someone who has the power to turn trash into trees, and a man who can turn towels into steel so long as he holds his breath, is inherently more interesting than anything that has come out of BNHA. This makes BNHA rely on cheap gimmicks to make the fights \u201cinteresting,\u201d but many of these gimmicks are either forgotten about or the audience gets desensitized to the gimmick pretty fast. I have seen Deku break his bones so many times that it feels like it doesn\u2019t even matter when it happens anymore; So far, the second and third seasons made a big deal about him learning how to \u2018fight in a new way,\u2019 but the ham fisted way that he has leveled up so far makes his struggle feel cheapened. He learned how to go full-cowl after hearing about taiyaki in a microwave, and then he jumped around in a alleyway for like an hour. What this is to say, is that the threat of breaking bones in BNHA is around the same level of threat to the character as Yusuke (from YYH) using all of his spirit energy at once. Pair the empty threat of injury in the show with Recovery Girl\u2019s ability to heal injuries, we have a show with very poor direction when it comes to its action. This is made all the worse from the first scene of the first episode, where it is revealed that Deku will become the greatest hero of all time; since the goal of becoming the greatest hero of all time is the assumed end point of the show, we as an audience know that he won\u2019t die. \\n\r\nA show that inhabits a similar setting and similar powers, is Medaka Box. However, Medaka Box has great fight choreography. As such, I want to compare BNHA\u2019s best fight (in my opinion) in terms of choreography with various fights from Medaka Box. Although this might be a controversial opinion, BNHA\u2019s best fight is still probably the fight between Deku and Bakugo; there is a certain energy and interpersonal drama in this fight that isn\u2019t present in All Might vs. Nomu, Deku vs. Todoroki, Iida, Todoroki, and Deku vs. Stain, and Deku vs. Stronk Villain. I will get to my problems with those fights when I discuss the individual arcs and their merits. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, I like the motion/rhythm and the interpersonal drama of Deku vs. Bakugo in season 1 because it represents a bunch of feelings that hit close to home for me; change is a thing that can split friendships apart, rendering them irreparable because certain relationships can survive under very specific circumstances. This is the case with Deku and Bakugo; Although I will get to the specific details of their relationship later, I think a basic understanding of the character conflict is necessary. After Deku gets One For All, Bakugo loses his shit, this is more or less because he finds himself being surpassed by Deku; he sees his childhood \u2018friend\u2019 and he sees how Deku has developed, whereas he himself has been relatively stagnant since then. Deku on the other hand, has to prove to All Might that he is worthy of having One For All. Thus when they come into conflict during a practice simulation, it becomes a conflict between these two conflicting goals. Although the stakes aren\u2019t that high in comparison to any fight from the sports festival arc or really any other arc, the personal drama between the two is largely what makes this compelling. But in terms of choreography, this fight may be the best. The other fights in the series has largely been slug fests that stay relatively stationary, but in this scene we get to see Deku pull off martial arts grapples. The tight corners and the more interesting win condition for Deku (capturing the fake nuclear bomb) more interesting than had it been a straight up fight between the two characters. This also gave the audience a taste of Deku\u2019s intelligence, which at a later point he has been defined for; The show does this by having Deku analyze Bakugo\u2019s combat style as they are fighting, the resolution of the fight, where he uses One For All to destroy the upper floors of the building to give Uraraka the chance to get past Iida and take the fake nuclear bomb. In turn, he took a major blow from Bakugo. This breaks both of his arms, and at this point in the series, the audience hasn\u2019t been properly desensitized to his injuries, this was an intense fight and the resolution of the fight was fun but was also a good moment for characterization for Deku. It reinforces two traits of Deku, it reinforces his self-sacrificing nature, and it displays to the audience his intelligence.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat this fight reminded me of was a similar series of battles that came from Medaka Box S2. The second season of Medaka Box was dedicated to the conflict between the student council and the mysterious elite class. In the world of Medaka Box, there are three different kind of people: normals, specials, and abnormals. Abnormals themselves are split up into two different types, positives and negatives. Normals have no special abilities, specials are those born with talent but don\u2019t really have any attributes that can be considered supernatural, and abnormals have supernatural abilities and between positives and negatives these abilities can be a net positive ability (like supernatural reflexes) or negative abilities that usually come at a cost, like the ability for anything that is touched will rot away. The goal of the elite class is to create more specials and abnormals, it is revealed that the entire campus of the school is a testing ground for these experiments; the current plan that the elite class is going to sacrifice the entire school population to have the few that survive gain the abilities of specials and abnormals. This leads to the intervention of the student council. This leads the student council to infiltrate the elite class\u2019 hideout, the infiltration is intense; its set in a underground facility that seems like it is miles deep and the structure is labyrinthine in structure. \tAs they descend further into the underground facility, the fights and action gets more intense, the tension is palpable when watching this arc because the verticality of the series coincides with the party getting further from safety. Medaka Box uses a specific troupe in shounen anime to its utmost extent, it\u2019s the troupe where the party gets split up and each of them have to overcome obstacles/opponents that make them display their own unique talents and powers. Needless to say, all of the fights are great, I\u2019m not sure if any one fight is better than Deku vs. Bakugo, but the strength of the entire arc and the context surrounding each battle is better than the classroom scenes that surround the aforementioned battle in BNHA. But this season of Medaka Box made a big deal about verticality in it\u2019s cinematography, and that connects to it\u2019s themes on social structures and the idea of power, it is also represented in the majority of the fight scenes in this season; the biggest example of this is Kouki Akune vs. Itami Koga and Youka Naze, where the characters are breaking through floors and pulling off a mix of wrestling moves and kamen rider special attacks. The best I could say about BNHA\u2019s direction is that it doesn\u2019t always use arial swoops and not all of the trees are layered pngs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI guess I am being forgiving when I don\u2019t compare Jojo and Naruto to BNHA in terms of fight choreography; I know that a lot of people like to say that Deku is \u201cone of the smartest shonen protagonists, if not the smartest,\u201d I can say without a doubt in my mind, that he is about average intelligence when we compare him to actually smart characters. In BNHA, there is nothing near the level of Shikamaru vs. Temari, Naruto vs. Neji, or Squad 7 vs. Zabuza. In BNHA, there is nothing like any fight in Jojo. The powers of BNHA are too generic to really make any complex fight where intelligence is really necessary to win, the closest the show ever gets to being actually smart with it\u2019s fights is Deku, Todoroki, and Iida vs. Stain. But, even then, the fight choreography made the fight pretty boring. The hypest moment in the show so far has been All Might vs Nomu, and even then, the fight choreography was rather simple if not a little boring. I am aware of the upcoming fight between All Might and All For One, and that may take the place of the last hypest moment from the show. As I stated earlier, I like everything that has to do with All Might, and the resolution of his arc in the show may make me increase my score for the show up to this point. \\n\\n\r\nThe next part of my review is dedicated to examining every arc up to this point, this is to examine the themes on heroism in BNHA and to elaborate on my problems with the narrative up to this point (in the anime). \\n\\n\r\nThe UA Entrance Exam Arc: The entrance exam arc was a pretty good start to BNHA as a anime; It sets up the goals of the series and is probably the reason why many people believe that Deku is not only the hardest working shonen protagonist, but also the smartest. It\u2019s set up in the first scene of the show that Deku will become the greatest hero of all time, this leads me to believe that the show will be dedicated to showing Deku\u2019s development into the greatest hero of all time. Thus it can be assumed that the story\u2019s themes is about the environment and the circumstances that creates a hero. Cool premise, am I right? I have a bunch of problems with it though, the first and foremost problem is that Deku already is pretty much the embodiment of a hero from the get go. He attempts to save Bakugo in the first episode despite the likelihood that he would die in the process, and by the end of the entrance exam, he is voted into going to UA because he displays all of the character traits of a hero. I guess there is no way to make BNHA a show unless we have Deku get a quirk and have him get accepted into UA; so functionally, I guess this is how he gets in. He works out for a summer until he is given One For All by All Might. At this point in the show, I was thinking that perhaps Deku\u2019s understanding of heroism is superficial and that by attending UA, he will somehow become more heroic. At this point though, I was still a little mad that the show is set at a school. If we recall the premise of the show, it\u2019s roughly about the environment and circumstances that create heroes. BNHA\u2019s answer to this question is: Hero School. It is perhaps the most boring answer to that question, because it trivializes the concept of heroism to be something that can simply be learned at school. I then came to believe that maybe the story will acknowledge this fact, and maybe it will discuss the artifice of hero society. I mean, from the first episode, it came across as most heroes were superficial and did things for publicity, fame, or fortune; I mean even All Might isn\u2019t above the commoditization of heroes in this universe, I mean, there is All Might action figures and posters. When people want you to remember things, they usually say \u201cput a pin in that,\u201d but the fact that All Might is a sell out as well is such an important fact that I want all of you reading this to nail it to a wall with a railroad spike. \\n\\n\r\n\t2. UA Introduction and Villains\u2019 Invade UA Arc (aka everything else in Season 1): For the most part, I can say I enjoyed the rest of the first season of BNHA. I do have a load of problems with the series at this point, but, there isn\u2019t anything too egregious in this part of the series. The worst I can say about this section of the show is that the focus of Deku\u2019s journey to become a hero is slowly lost. The show at this point begins to focus more and more on side characters that I don\u2019t really care for; As I mentioned before, the show feels truncated when it comes to character development and focus because the anime wants to give attention to every character. This makes most of the characters in the series at this point seem more like gag characters or bait waifus/husbandos. At this moment, I was thinking that BNHA would be as superficial and romanticized in its depiction of heroism as it had lead on to be. This prediction held true, but at the moment, I was still optimistic. In this part of the series, we are also introduced to The League of Villains, I thought these guys were going to be relatively minor characters throughout the series, but this notion proved to be incorrect. The climax of season one also made me rock hard because of All Might vs. Nomu; BNHA put a carrot on a stick and was dangling it right in front of my face. It had yet to actually do anything with it\u2019s themes but rumors I heard on the internet was foreshadowing two things to me: One, there will be a tournament arc, and it will be cool. Two, there is a character called Stain, and his arc is all about the deconstruction of heroism. The series had me hooked at that moment, I was destined to watch every season of BNHA to come out at that point, and so far this has held true. \\n\\n\r\n3. The Sports Festival Arc: This arc was a massive disappointment to me, and there are a lot of contributing factors to this disappointment. I guess the biggest reason is that the sports festival arc contains to much content for it\u2019s short run time to really develop upon. BNHA really wants us to care about all of it\u2019s characters, as such, it tries to give each character in the show something to do in this arc. This could be seen as a good thing, but the fact that we have to be introduced to class 1B, have Uraraka\u2019s and Todoroki\u2019s arc, and set up Stain in 11 episodes is a lofty goal for any series. Pair all of that content up with the amount of characters that Kohei Horikoshi wants to give attention to, we have a arc that has horrible narrative focus. Uraraka gets like 3-5 scenes to both start and conclude her arc, a talented director could somehow make this work; but since this is an adaptation, the show more or less has to stick with the source material. \\n\\n\r\nEverything in this arc seems like it was seriously rushed, the most egregious example of this is Todoroki\u2019s arc. Todoroki\u2019s arc has a lot of strong parts to it, it gives us a very great backstory to Todoroki, and it goes a long way to set up certain setting details that I thought were going to be relevant later. In many ways, it also contextualizes Endeavor as a character to the audience and it reinforces the idea that heroism is dead in BNHA. That being said, the arc is so fraught with problems that the construction of the arc seems a bit misguided from the beginning. I think Kohei Horikoshi wanted to discuss trauma, but he has no experience writing about such topics, so it comes off across like he had no idea on what he was going to do with the character. I guess I should elaborate further on this problem; the main problem with Todoroki\u2019s arc is how Deku resolves Todoroki\u2019s trauma. As I stated earlier, trauma is a pervasive, it isn\u2019t a character flaw, and nor should it be treated as such. Kohei Horikoshi treats it as such, his development is very unnatural; it feels like he is a wrestler that pulled a heel turn. He is portrayed as a villain because of his trauma, but his motivations seem very reasonable, so I can\u2019t really side with Deku when he reforms Todoroki. The show treats Todoroki\u2019s trauma as a character flaw, something he could get over easily if he has some sort of realization. This steals a very introspective development arc from Todoroki, he could have been one of the greatest characters in BNHA if he was given the development required to properly make a recovery arc compelling. Instead, Kohei Horikoshi decided that the best way to resolve Todoroki\u2019s trauma was to have Deku yell at him for twenty or so minutes, contained in the most boring fight scene I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I should talk about the tournament arc, it wasn\u2019t that good overall. That is not to say that it didn\u2019t have it\u2019s moments but the structure of this arc is a bit lackluster. Like I stated before, the Sports Festival Arc loses narrative focus, since that\u2019s a lofty statement, so I guess I should elaborate on that. Deku doesn\u2019t really have any way to develop in this arc, his goal for this arc, more or less is to prove himself to the world. But this is a pretty uncompelling goal, and I don\u2019t like how the show portrays this vanity as a good thing. That was a pretty petty complaint, but I feel like Kohei Horikoshi would agree with me because this whole arc is dedicated to giving the side characters things to do. It was just kind of boring to see characters with no personality, doing things I couldn\u2019t give less of a fuck about. In actuality, who cares about Kirishima and TetsuTetsu? TetsuTetsu is more or less a gag character, it\u2019s pretty annoying how much time I remember was spent \u2018developing\u2019 his character. In actuality there is no depth to his character, so it feels rather misguided how much time has been spent in season 3 to him; but this is a trait that is pervasive throughout all the members of class 1b. I also feel like it\u2019s rather misguided to have more characters introduced when there was already too many characters in class 1a. To reinforce this fact, let me ask a few questions. What is the name of the character who has weird plant hair power? Is Bakugo a good character? Who actually cares about Mina vs Aoyama? Will Toru ever get any development? Will Sato, Koda, Jiro, Sero, Ojiro, Aoyama, Shoji, Mineta, Toru, Mina, or Asui ever do something of any importance? Of the students that I have deemed important, how much of that actually matters when it comes to the themes or the narrative of the story? Who actually cares about Yaoyorozu vs. Tokoyami? Has any character actually developed throughout the course of the series so far? Aside from in doujins, does Midnight have any fans? (aside from the ones who just like her appearance) For that matter, does any female or male characters (aside from Uraraka, Iida, Deku, Todoroki, AM, and Yaoyorozu) have any actual fans? Did anyone feel any tension for the characters in season 1 when they were in danger? As a continuation to that, did any of you feel any tension when the class was being attacked by villians in S3?\\n\\n\r\nThese questions were just the first thing that came to mind when thinking about the characters of BNHA; but these small/petty complaints and questions start building up. At times, I feel like there really wasn\u2019t any narrative coherence in this section of BNHA because it keeps jumping from character to character and each and everyone of them is boring. For that matter, every character\u2019s goal in BNHA is the same, every student wants to become the greatest hero ever; that really robs Deku of his most identifying feature. I guess that Deku is supposed to be a neutral audience stand in, and the fact that he is boring may be a good story telling technique; that being said, it most definitely doesn\u2019t work for me.  What also doesn\u2019t work for me is how Bakugo is supposed to be a foil for Deku, and the fact that they are both 1 dimensional pretty much makes this connection all the worse. In a better series, I wouldn\u2019t be thinking about why characters are popular or what their function in a series is. I would be immersed in the series, but this series does everything in its power to take me out of my immersion. \\n\\n\r\n4. Hero Killer/Stain Arc: This is most likely the most analyzed arc in all of BNHA, many people also herald it as one of the best arcs in shounen manga/anime. I have also heard innumerable think pieces on how Stain is one of the best villains in anime, and how the idea of Stain alone is a great concept. I would say Stain is a victim of three problems: The setting and the goal of this arc are at odds, the writing for Stain is pretty lackluster, and the thematic ideas behind Stain\u2019s character, despite being in the right place, are poorly written. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with my first problem with Stain\u2019s arc. The setting of BNHA is pretty unbelievable, this is only a problem when we consider that Stain is supposed to be the spark that influences others to start becoming villains.  As such, it would have behoved the series had the setting of BNHA been more gritty, less romanticized, and more polarizing.  It\u2019s not that there is a dearth of setting details that could have been used to help immerse the audience in the world of BNHA but all of the setting details are really misused; for example: due to Todoroki\u2019s backstory, we learn that many heroes choose partners that would directly lead to stronger children. We also learn that many heroes are treated like celebrities, and many of them have various endorsement details. Some heroes, like Mt.Lady come across as directly reckless because they like the attention it gets them. We as an audience even learn that heroes might be directly leading to crime based off of how hero culture embellishes villains, we know this because in towns that have lower hero activity, there is less crime. What would have really driven this narrative home was if the students at UA were less pure than they were. Another factor that could have helped this narrative would be if All Might and other characters we were supposed to think were icons of heroism were actually scumbags in real life. The only hero that comes across that way is Endeavor, and he was intentionally made to look like the biggest dick ever. But, all of these postulates are wrong, this isn\u2019t actually what this arc is about. The Stain Arc isn\u2019t about how the commoditization of heroes in BNHA lead to these destructive drawbacks. We know this because Stain idolizes All Might; now I want you to take the fact that I had all of you nail to the wall earlier, and take a look at it. All Might is as much of a sell out and or a commodity as much as any other hero if not more so. It is also implied that Mt.Lady was only being reckless because she is a relative newcomer to professional heroism. Also the audience isn\u2019t given much reason to believe hero culture is actually a bad thing, society in BNHA is as clean as it gets, and the amount of regulations on heroes that are present, pretty much assures that most heroes are under inspection by big brother at all times. The anime also tells us about a lot of problems in hero culture, but it doesn\u2019t show us anything of substance. So the audience doesn\u2019t really have a gauge to decide for ourselves if hero culture is good or bad, as far as we know, it is perfectly fine and should be protected. So if we think about it, what is Stain\u2019s arc really saying about heroism? \\n\\n\r\nThis leads into my second point about the writing of Stain, it isn\u2019t ever clear what he means when he idolizes All Might. Eventually it comes across as All Might is the best because he is stronk and he acts like a hero; Stain seems to make a deal about how most heroes are really weak and how that is a bad thing for heroism, but in reality that isn\u2019t really saying much about hero culture. It isn\u2019t really the deconstruction of heroism that I was lead on to believe. It\u2019s a very superficial commentary on heroism, and it is a terrible learning moment for every character involved in this arc, since it doesn\u2019t really give any character pause for introspection. I guess Iida has his moments to \u2018develop\u2019 but as I argued earlier, it isn\u2019t compelling because it is so unbelievable. But, when it comes to the actual dialogue of Stain, he basically talks in edge. I have been told that I should cut him some slack as a character when I analyze his intentions and his motivations, because he is a crazy person and that what he talks about only appeals to those who are already unstable. However, the last episode of season 2 proves this point to be mute because videos on  his narrative is spread around/ gone viral and is widely accepted as a valid viewpoint by the public. I think he was meant to be a compelling idea to both the audience and the characters of BNHA but in reality the end goal that he was meant to serve was greatly missed if that was the end goal for the character.\\n\\n\r\nI get why Stain was necessary for the plot, as I stated earlier, he was most likely created to course correct the plot of BNHA; it was meant to give the plot more narrative focus, it was also meant to raise the stakes of the plot. In many ways, it could be argued that Stain was introduced to correct the thematic ideas of BNHA: since BNHA is set in a hero school, this could have been a great opportunity to discuss the notion of heroism. But, the Stain Arc cheapens the idea of heroism more than anything else. I also know that I am right because the scumbag Endeavor and Mt. Lady become role model figures for Deku in S3; So the social darwinist position of might equals right is very much true in this series. Even though I am a ancap, but I hate this thematic position because of how much it demystifies the notion of heroism. BNHA does everything in its power to make heroes and heroism as lame as possible. Mother\u2019s Basement has argued that BNHA is thematically a capitalist story, but the anime/manga missed the opportunity to discuss the nature of commodity fetishism in this arc. Thus helping my belief that saying MB is wrong is like saying the sky is blue.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I still can\u2019t figure out what the Stain Arc is really trying to say about heroism. I think the reading that hero culture enables villainy is the best reading of this arc, but it kind of fails at the execution because of the writing. I could just be wildly off base, but I kinda doubt that.\\n\\n\r\n5. The Midterm Exam Arc: Nothing of note happens when in this arc, it just shows the students of 1a becoming more capable professional heroes and nothing else. This is probably where Uraraka\u2019s arc should have been placed because she never really had anything to prove during the Sports Festival Arc, the threat of failing the test is more high stakes to her character than doing only pretty well at the Sports Festival. Yaoyorozu\u2019s character arc is in this arc, it was pretty bad in terms of character development. But, seeing her work with Todoroki to beat Aizawa was pretty fun. This is also where Uraraka\u2019s love for Deku is revealed. \\n\\n\r\n6. The Training Camp Arc: This arc is pretty much a continuation of the Stain Arc, most of the events that transpired in that arc directly lead to the events of this arc. At this point, the story was doing two things that I really like. The first thing that I really like is the darker tone, it raised the stakes and the villains actually being successful in their mission made them feel less like the saturday morning cartoon villains that they felt like earlier. The second thing I liked was the writing, I would argue that it is still far from optimal, but we can tell that in between the Stain Arc and this arc, there has been a noticeable mitigation of edge. The edge has been replaced with legitimate intimidation and dark feel.  That being said, the show still hasn\u2019t taught Deku anything and Kota was a pretty terrible addition to the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo there was a lot that I liked from this arc, the best example of what I liked was the fight between Deku and Stronk Villain (I forgot his name). Even though I knew that Deku wouldn\u2019t die, the direction in this scene and the animation worked perfectly in tandem to reinforce the emotional response of helplessness and then lead to the sensation of overcoming a tough obstacle. That being said, I didn\u2019t like the events surrounding this particular fight nor did I like the choreography that much. But on a emotional level, it worked perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the fight earlier was in service to the development of maybe one of the worst characters of all time, Kota. This scene was supposed to display to the disillusioned Kota, the value of heroes. I think the main problem with Kota is that he is super generic, to the point where I was able to predict his backstory and the resolution of his arc, I was even able to verbatim quote what he would say. His character was so bland that I can\u2019t believe they actually included him; I think what makes Kota not work at all as a character is how he is a one shot character. I think he was just introduced as a means to get Deku to fight stronk dude and nothing else, he isn\u2019t really that likeable and he is pretty much the worst iteration of this archetype. If you want to watch a good iteration of this archetype, I would suggest watching Naruto, Konohamaru is a much more compelling version of this character because he parallels Naruto as a character, and the development that Konohamaru matches Naruto\u2019s because Naruto slowly becomes a mentor figure to him (a character, who like Naruto, doesn\u2019t have any parents). Kota\u2019s development pretty much is just a bland realization that heroes are necessary and that he should feel bad for punching Deku in the balls.  What this is to say, is that Kota is a bad character because he contributes very little to the themes of BNHA. This is true of most characters if not all of them, just remember my postulates on the characters of BNHA earlier. I am still not sure what the purpose of Deku or All Might really is, especially in the Stain Arc and this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe Setting of BNHA: One of the biggest flaws of BNHA is it\u2019s poor execution of many of its characters and it\u2019s themes, this is probably due to two reasons: One of them is the aforementioned amount of characters, but the problem I want to focus on at the moment is the setting of BNHA. Settings can be a powerful tool when utilized right. The setting of any iyashikei or slice of life relies heavily on the characterization that is personified because of the setting; the same is true of shonen series. HxH is about childhood wonder, so it relies heavily on the sense of wonder that comes with the setting. FMAB is a story about war and loss, thus it is set in a WW2 style setting. Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still is a deconstruction of classical characters; thus the setting has to work in two regards, the first of which is to recreate the classic feeling of the 70s Giant Robo series, and the second is to make it a setting where it is possible to have leagues of villains and giant robot fights, a setting where it is possible to have police officers with super powers. It executes this by having most buildings have a classic european design, the show also has a nostalgia inducing color palette. If I had to describe BNHA\u2019s color palette, I would use the adjectives sterile, and bland. On their own, these words aren\u2019t inherently bad; but when it comes to a series that sets out to have a specific, romantic tone to heroism, I think these attributes are not good. The colors of BNHA are neither subdued enough to feel nostalgic or reminiscent, but they aren\u2019t bright enough to be cartoonish or cheerful. It is in that sweet spot where almost no emotions can be evoked from the scenery in the show. Pair this with the very thin line work, and everything seems way too clean than it should be. A great example of this is the entirety of the UA Campus, the worst offender of this is the classroom which is as sterile and bland as it gets. There is nothing like building a tone based off of bland industrial rooms with no interesting aspects aside from how bland it is. The setting of BNHA should have been more similar to Kekkai Sensen, they both inhabit similar worlds, since in both settings\u2019 the populace is mainly super human. BNHA should have been dirtier, more crowded, vertical. They imply that those with great quirks tend to be near the top of the hierarchy in BNHA, but we really don\u2019t get a sense of the society in this world, nor do we get a sense of any outside world. I feel like if anything, BNHA seems like it is too self contained within Japan. This containment lead me to ask a million questions that I know won\u2019t be answered. For example: Why are almost all of the top heroes and most powerful villains in Japan? This question alone subsequently creates more questions, why is All Might the symbol of peace world wide if all he did was protect Japan? Why is UA in Japan? Are there people with more powerful quirks than One For All? What is society like in China, America, Britain\u2026 etc like now that there are superpowers?  I guess because Japan looks the same as it ever was, so would every other country. \\n\\n\r\nMrbtongue made a great video on Mass Effect 3 that includes the postulate that science fiction is a socratic seminar between the author and the hypothetical. Every science fiction/science fantasy work is the answer to a hypothetical situation. Using this reading, BNHA\u2019s setting is based off of the premise \u201csuppose that 80% of the population of the world was born with super powers, what would happen?\u201d BNHA answers the questions that come with this hypothesis in the laziest possible way: superpowers cause heroes and villains to become an industry of their own, institutions are made to regulate superpowers, the world is basically the same as it ever was. Perhaps BNHA\u2019s world is as boring as it is to have as much mass appeal as possible. I mean western superhero movies take place in modern, clean, cities, and they also have flimsy excuses for premises. BNHA is accessible if nothing else, it uses western comic iconography whilst being cliche enough to WSJ fans. It isn\u2019t smart enough to really answer any of my questions, so I feel like BNHA is only supposed to be appreciated on a surface level, the entire world and conflicts that take place within it is as superficial as it gets (even Stain, if not especially Stain). \\n\\n\r\nI guess I am not sure what else to add to my analysis of each completed arc so far; but I just remembered that I never talked about each fight. In many regards, my forgetting about writing on these fights speaks louder than any analysis that I could write on them. Most fights in this series are boring and uninventive, and the few fights that do something new usually have other elements that piss me off. I guess that is because shonen anime is notorious for having lots of character development scenes contained within fights; I\u2019m not about to start complaining about that necessarily, but I would have preferred it if some development scenes didn\u2019t revolve around fights. The most egregious example was Todoroki vs. Deku, and all of my problems with treating trauma as a character flaw and also resolving his issues in a fight by yelling at him.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the astote readers would have probably noticed a running theme in my analysis of BNHA so far. That theme is that Deku isn\u2019t really driving the plot anymore, his personality traits and his motivation hasn\u2019t been the main focus to the plot for a while, he has just felt more like the passenger in his own story. None of the conflicts from the second half of the first season onwards have been driven by Deku as a character, he is just kind of there doing his own thing, learning nothing. People might argue that he is becoming more heroic because he saved Kota, but we all know that he would have done that if he was replaced with his counterpart from the first episode of BNHA. \\n\\n\r\nThere is an argument that Deku\u2019s arc is that he is becoming more responsible as the show keeps going on. The examples I can think for this arc comes from the first episode and has continued up to this point; let me explain, in the first episode Deku ran up to a villain that he had no chance of beating to save Bakugo. This shows that his self sacrificing nature is a bad trait, because he keeps putting himself in danger. In his fight against Bakugo, Deku sacrifices both of his arms to secure the fake nuclear bomb. In his fight against Todoroki, Deku breaks both of his arms and all of his fingers to get through to Todoroki. When he saves Iida from Stain, he goes into the alley (and signals that he is in danger) and fights against a threat that has taken out countless heroes. In the third season, Deku goes against Stronk Boi in a 1v1 fight to save Kota, and in the current arc he relied on Todoroki, Iida, Yaoyorozu, and Kirishima to save Bakugo. But, my argument against this arc is two fold. The first problem with it is that we never got a sense that Deku would try to do things by himself, or that he was reckless/irresponsible to begin with, he has always been a team player and he has always been portrayed as in the right. He has always been rewarded if not enabled to be irresponsible, and we only get hints here and there that he might be over his head but he is never outright wrong in any of his actions. My second problem with this arc is that every single shounen series has a arc similar to this contained within it, if anything, the great majority of shonen protagonists have similar arcs and they are also usually more subtle than the one from BNHA. Naruto, Deisuke, Gon, Soma, Ueki, Yusuke, and Edward Elric, all have the same arc as Midoriya but they are all better than his. \\n\\n\r\nSo I\u2019ve roughly been complaining about BNHA for the past 10\u2019000 words, why does it matter what people think of this series? Well first and foremost, the \u201cnew big three,\u201d is BNHA, Boruto, and Black Clover, all three of them are Naruto fanfiction. Ten years into the future when no one longer cares about BNHA, I would argue that every series will basically be derivative copies of BNHA and the fans of BNHA will most likely complain about the newer series. So I just want to say that it is a cycle, and we have accepted that future series will be unoriginal; the fact that the main argument that many use as a defence of BNHA is \u201cit\u2019s unoriginal but it is well executed,\u201d only proves that as an anime community we have accepted mediocrity. It turns out Digibro was right all along, the main shows that are popular now of days are simply echoes of a better time for the medium and BNHA is the epitome of this.\\n",

            "content": "Before this, I would recommend reading my reviews of the first two seasons of Boku no Hero Academia. Many details that explain my opinion on this series in a broader sense are already covered there.\r\nThis season picks up where the previous season left off, with the students preparing to go to an inevitably doomed summer training camp. The plot takes a much darker tone this season, with The League of Villains newly-emboldened by Stain's actions in season 2, and full of fresh faces. The first arc of this season gives the new villains a chance to show off what they're made of, and set upthe league as a more immediate, tangible threat.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling too much, the following arc goes even further into developing The League of Villains, finally introducing their leader and revealing his true plan. It also sets up for a changing of the guard for both the heroes and the villains, building towards Deku and Shigaraki becoming arch-enemies in the vein of their mentors.\\n\\n\r\nWhile these two arcs excel due to their establishing a greater cast of villains and creating a sense of genuine threat, the following arc doesn't fare quite as well. The Provisional License Exam arc doesn't serve much purpose in the overarching plot other than to get the story from point A to point B. While there is some exploration of Todoroki's grudge against his father, this isn't anything we haven't already covered elsewhere. Ultimately, without it being as firmly rooted in the emotional journey of its characters, it has a lot less substance than the other arcs, and feels awkward and transitionary.\\n\\n\r\nThis is exacerbated by some uncharacteristically bad pacing for this series, with two filler episodes sandwiched into it along with some added scenes and dialogue, presumably included to make sure that the season ended at a good point rather than smack in the middle of another arc.\\n\\n\r\nWhile one of the two filler episodes (technically three, but the first was a start-of-season recap) follows a similar idea to season 2's surprisingly good filler episode, in covering events that happened offscreen to secondary 1-A characters, the other is a completely unnecessary waste of time that accomplishes little more than plugging the movie. And even the better of the two fails to repeat the same success of season 2's filler, partially because while the previous one came as a breather episode inbetween story arcs, this one directly interrupted the plot in progress. It also doesn't help that Tsuyu is a better character than Yaoyorozu (fight me, nerds).\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is also noticeably worse during filler, in particular for Uraraka and Bakugo. Uraraka gets a lot of screentime in additional scenes, but almost all of her dialogue in these scenes revolves around her uncertainty around her feelings for Deku, something we had already established and which didn't need repeating ad nauseam. Bakugo on the other hand plays up all his worst character traits in the movie-plugging filler episode, but where his recklessness in canon is usually due to his anger and frustration with Deku, here it's pure idiocy.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the exam is over, however, the quality immediately picks back up. And whatever disservice the filler may have done for Bakugo, it's easily forgotten after he gets some long overdue character development. While Bakugo was never a bad character, he wasn't a likeable one either. But Bakugo's character arc has been long in process - with his entire worldview being flipped on its head the moment Deku gained a quirk, Bakugo has been challenged with the thought that he's no longer superior to everyone around him - a belief that he had always taken for granted until then. This season finally takes this setup and brings it to a conclusion redeeming an oft-maligned character in the process.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while the quality of this season does take a noticeable dip during the provisional license exam, even then it isn't bad - just underwhelming in comparison. Outside of this arc, it matches (and in places exceeds) the benchmark the previous season set.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for any mistakes the series may make, it still manages to retain investment in both the ever-evolving setting and its quirky (pun not intended) ensemble cast, the latter in particular benefiting not only from more character arcs, drama, and development, but from increased downtime letting us see more of these characters outside of their roles in the plot, fleshing out more of their personalities and character dynamics.\\n\\n\r\nWith the series ending on a foreboding note, Hero Academia promises great things to come - but for now, Hero Academia 3 is an impressive, if uneven, entry in the series.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: One Piece, Naruto",

            "content": "Superhero stories feels like it\u2019s been populating the entertainment industry from these recent years. Marvel and DC successfully adapted many of these superhero tales with huge fanbases. The CW Network have aired shows with a large following like The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, and Legends of Tomorrow. My Hero Academia always reminds me that it has a place with its own set of superheroes and villains. With that in mind, I was pretty ecstatic about the return of My Hero Academia.\r\nThe third season does a bit of recapping at first to get viewers comfortable with its characters, story setting, and general concepts. As someone who hasbeen following both the anime and manga, I knew what was to expect as the series is structured with story arcs. From the first half of the show, we follow Class 1-A as the first semester at U.A has concluded. Known as the \u201cForest Training Camp Arc\u201d, it details the events of our young heroes participating in a training camp. They are supervised by a hero group known as the Pussycats but incidents happen that leads the arc into quite a chaos. It\u2019s no surprise either as My Hero Academia likes to build tension and make story with its characters. From the Training Camp arc, we are introduced to a character named Kota who has a distasteful view towards heroes. The show explores his reasons for this while also adapts how he begins to change after meeting certain people. Enter Deku. He is pretty much symbolic for what Kota detests because of his values and desire to become a hero. The arc details of what it really means of being a hero and opening his eyes to reality.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, it\u2019s also clear that the series has dangerous adversaries for the heroes to face. The League of Villains has been teased from season 2 and in this season, they make themselves known with malicious intentions. Their core members exposes the dangers our heroes faces but they also have a hidden agenda. That brings into the question of a guy named Katsuki Bakugo. You\u2019d remember him as the arrogant guy who always strives to be the best with a huge ego. From this season, you\u2019ll also see what it means to be a hero from his point of view. Nonetheless, I think there may be an overemphasis on the idea of making heroes. Every episode and arc dedicates an immense amount of time to such concepts that sometimes, I wonder if there\u2019s just too much. I say this because after a certain amount of episodes, the storytelling feels a bit redundant without much development. Heroism becomes too symbolic even in the case of All Might. On the contrary, one could also mention that All Might is a symbol of being a real hero. He represents courage, integrity, peace, and self-sacrifice. The apex of the show has him battle out against a powerful enemy from the past that draws out perhaps one of the most important episodes of the franchise. While still overemphasizing the idea of heroism, it\u2019s significant enough to prove what being a hero is all about.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the series still has its sense of humor. There exists many moments in the show that offers to delivery comedy ranging from Mineta\u2019s ridiculous perverted antics to an episode about checking out everyone\u2019s rooms. Bringing back to the main plot, the second half of the show features the hero license exams and internship arc together. It now transcends from young heroes to take their next step in following their dreams. New characters are introduced while familiar ones are bought back together to add to the drama. It also adds bits of tense rivalry between certain characters that may or may not be pleasing to remember. But I must say, preparing these heroes in such a way feels like the pacing could have been improved. I\u2019m not a big fan for the latter half of the show as most of those episodes didn\u2019t make much of an impact. Even in terms of personal enjoyment, I find myself losing interest when watching Deku, Bakugo, Momo, Todoroki, Enji, Tenya, Ochaco, or others compete to earn their spot. Some of the new characters like Mei did occasionally spark my interest but nonetheless felt underwhelming. What about the new characters like the ones from Shiketsu High School? To me, they\u2019re unique individually but lacks development and isn\u2019t well crafted enough for true appeal. I\u2019m not going to lie, it felt like the show sometimes has too many characters in a story arc at once and doesn\u2019t really bring out their true potentials.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, I guess you may be asking if character relationships develop further in this season. It definitely proves itself being able to capitalize on the complex relationship such as with Deku and Bakugo, Deku and All Might, or Deku and Koda. But for other characters like Ochaco, they really take a pitfall. There\u2019s obvious romance that blooms from her towards Deku but the season acts more like a ship tease with no true hope of sailing sail. Never say never though, right? Just not this season.\\n\\n\r\nComing back to this franchise definitely reminded of the Shounen Jump action I was looking for. A superhero action series like this isn\u2019t complete without its colorful character cast and their action roles. It offers all sort of characteristics where every hero or villain is unique. However, it may be noticable that some episodes dropped in quality compared to previous seasons. Yoshihiko Umakoshi worked on a variety of roles from previous seasons ranging from character designs, chief animation director, and key animation. In this season, he\u2019s absent as a role of animation director. That doesn\u2019t mean the third season fell apart though because in some of the more climatic episodes, there\u2019s definitely high quality animation. The explosiveness and energy of the fighting scenes from some of the more important episodes really are worth praising. There\u2019s also the dynamic character motions with emotional content that adds more value to many scenes this season. There\u2019s even environmental physics and other background animation that are worth paying attention to. To me, I think My Hero Academia Season 3 started off a bit slow but was able to work itself up again to bring these storybook characters to stardom. The familiarity of the soundtrack also brings together moments that you won\u2019t forget. \\n\\n\r\nAfter three seasons of My Hero Academia, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the momentum of this roller-coaster isn\u2019t going to stop for a good while. Superhero shows often portray characters as exactly what they are \u2013 a symbol of justice and peace. While My Hero Academia does continue to follow that concept, it has moments that truly capitalizes on the meaning of this ideology. With more episodes on the way in the future, I still have bright hopes for this franchise.",

            "content": "[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS for Hunter x Hunter, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, Naruto, and Boku no Hero Academia Seasons 1, 2, and 3]\r\nWhenever a show gets super popular here on my anime list dot com, a large group of anime viewers watch it and give it a rating. This rating is calculated with all the other user's ratings and creates an overall ranking system. The system MAL employs emphasizes an overall ranking that naturally lends itself to abuse by people who want their favorite show to be #1. This results in a lot of fluff being upvoted to near the top, and italso gives shallow people a means to push shows they don't like down the rankings. It emphasizes all the bad things about criticism, leads people to attack each other based on whether or not they gave their favorite show a good enough arbitrary number, and unfortunately can also lead people to have a lot of false expectations based on a misleading number.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to Boku no Hero Academia. a show that has drawn comparisons to Hunter x Hunter and taken the anime community by storm, while sporting 3 seasons with very high ratings in the MAL rankings. It is these comparisons to Hunter x Hunter and the bloated MAL ranking that gave me the impression that BNHA was going to push the shounen genre in a bold new direction, much like Hunter x Hunter did.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't. Boku no Hero Academia is an average superpower shounen that follows closely (extremely closely) in the steps of Naruto and Hunter x Hunter without really adding anything new to the genre. Normally I would watch something like this, shrug, and move on. But the MAL ranking raised my expectations, which led me to be disappointed. It's a rather odd predicament as I'm forced to find some middle ground between my expectations based off what I was told, and the reality of what Boku no Hero Academia actually is. It fails to live up to the gold standard Hunter x Hunter set, but should I really be comparing the two? Comparing anything to Hunter x Hunter is rather unfair, but if the community wants to make those comparisons I'll be happy to tear them down. let's begin!\\n\\n\r\n~Art/Animation~\\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019ll start off with the best part of the show: the art and animation. Everything is certainly drawn and animated well, and all the backgrounds appear to be drawn well.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t to say that I don\u2019t have serious gripes with the how the show chooses to present itself visually. You see, in most shows I would call good, a number of non-verbal techniques are used to tell the audience things about what they\u2019re seeing without telling them. Usually the staff find ways to let the audience know that the fight or confrontation they\u2019re witnessing is important, or they convey what feelings the combatants are experiencing via the camera, animation, body language, etc. This can be depicted with audio or visually but for something that\u2019s animated, visual usually works best. Stuff like this is NECESSARY during big fights to sell the significance and scope of what\u2019s happening.\\n\\n\r\nThe point of a big climactic fight is to create a duel of clashing ideologies of characters that come to a head in a dynamic battle that is SUPPOSED to be an emotional crescendo where everything is hashed out and everything they\u2019ve wanted to say and express comes out. This does not happen in the fight between Deku and Bakugo. It should have. Their rivalry is key to the structure of the series and it is supposed to carry a lot of emotional weight behind it. It\u2019s the BNHA equivalent of Naruto vs Sasuke. Yet watching what is supposed to be the climax to season 3, the dominant emotion I felt during it was boredom. It doesn\u2019t successfully convey any of the emotions of their jagged, unstable relationship and the fight itself doesn\u2019t really solve anything. In big fights like Gon vs Neferpitou and Naruto vs Sasuke, the characters actually talk to each other. They yell at each other, respond to the others\u2019 comments, and are driven emotionally and strategically by the actions of their opponents. This does not happen during the Deku-Bakugo fight. Deku spends the entire fight thinking about their relationship, while Bakugo has a few lines that don\u2019t connect emotionally due to how restrained the vocal delivery is. This is the most vulnerable we\u2019ve ever seen Bakugo and this is really the best direction they could accomplish? His body language doesn\u2019t change. His movements don\u2019t change. Neither do Midoriya\u2019s. This is a problem, as it implies that the emotions of the scene aren\u2019t changing their behavior. This is just another angsty fight for them.\\n\\n\r\nTo elaborate with an example (spoilers for Return of the Jedi): during Return of the Jedi, there is an excellent fight scene between Luke and Darth Vader. A part of the reason this fight works so well is that Luke\u2019s movements and body language change during the fight. At one point, Vader really gets under his skin by making some comments about Leia. While Luke does indicate this audibly (yelling), its his attacking style that changes the most. Suddenly, he\u2019s hammering Vader with really violent, angry strikes that indicate his emotional state has been changed and he can longer control his anger. It expresses the emotions of the fight in a subtle way that\u2019s engaging to the audience. This is also important because it indicates Vader is succeeding in trying to corrupt Luke by making him give in to his anger.\\n\\n\r\nNow think about how a scene that\u2019s also very important in BNHA season 3 handles it. Deku and Bakugo do not change their general fight movements and strategy during this fight at all. They also don\u2019t talk to each other much, making this a very awkward-feeling fight that doesn\u2019t convey much emotion and doesn\u2019t accomplish anything. The animation style doesn\u2019t change either. What Deku and Bakugo are feeling is established entirely through their inner thoughts or outright told to us. This is a big no-no when it comes to a visual medium.\\n\\n\r\nFor an example in the realm of anime, Naruto employed non-verbal storytelling extremely well during the fight between Rock Lee and Gaara. After Lee removes his weights, the animators employ a lot of speed blurs and very quick animation to indicate Lee\u2019s blinding speed. Rather than throwing Lee into a speed-line tunnel like most shows would, you see Lee\u2019s extremely blurred outline zip across the screen. They do tell us Lee\u2019s fast, but they support this by having him zip around while Gaara is moving like normal. This does an excellent job of establishing how ridiculously fast Lee is flying around by showing his speed relative to Gaara\u2019s normal movements. Having the camera pan around Gaara also helps sell this by conveying to the audience the same disorienting, overwhelmed feeling that Gaara is experiencing.\\n\\n\r\nThis is another thing the fight between Deku and Bakugo, and all the fights in BNHA, lack. The animators neglected to take advantage of the visual medium they were using to add a creative spin on the storytelling in fights. It\u2019s the same restrained animation during the fights and outside of them, which leaves the fights feeling flavorless and dull. There\u2019s no visual pop at all. No fun angles, no experimental animation styles, no interesting framing. Nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThere are ways to tell the audience things without using words, and BNHA has consistently displayed no capacity to employ aspects of non-verbal storytelling. It would rather tell you what characters are thinking and feeling rather than showing them. This is a sin in storytelling, and one of the first big no-no\u2019s you\u2019ll learn in any film school or lesson in storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a creative way to express its story and emotions visually, it would be difficult for me to say the animation department did a job here. Everything moves as it should, but that\u2019s the absolute minimum compliment you can give something that\u2019s animated . Animation/art 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~Music~\\n\\n\r\nThe score in this show is extremely bland. I can\u2019t think of a single track that sticks out, and its placement is equally bland. Music 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\\n\r\nI have a mountain of criticisms regarding the story. (Here\u2019s the key points if you wanna TLDR: villains are basically team rocket in that they always lose, no one ever dies so the plot never establishes a truly dangerous or threatening tone, the story is full of extremely safe and recycled storylines, and there are far too many characters focused on which bloat the run time and slows pacing to a crawl.)\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, one flaw that kept popping up in this season was how they attempted to keep developing ALL of Deku's classmates. This results in a plot that moves slow as molasses. The \"testing/graduation\" phase of Hunter x Hunter focused on 4 individuals mostly, allowing it to truck through the entire testing process within just 11 episodes. BNHA has trudged through this same process for going on for 3 seasons now. There is no need to keep track of how minor characters are training to develop their powers. It's excessive. Deku, Bakugou, Iida, Todoroki, Uraraka, Tsuyu, and maybe Tokoyami are the ONLY student characters who should be focused on at this point. That's it. AND THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP US UP TO DATE ON 20. You can keep SOME of the minor characters involved, but not every last one of them! That bogs down the pace and makes small arcs take an eternity!\\n\\n\r\nYou do not need to let the audience know every single thing that's happening to every character. It's excessive and takes too much time. Some things just aren't going to be relevant to the story down the road. Do I really need to be shown exactly how the tape guy is getting stronger? Is it going to become important? I doubt it. A single line of dialogue later would serve the same purpose. It's unnecessary, it bloats the run time, and in most cases takes up screen time that could be used to help the audience get to know the main characters better. This issue comes up constantly, starting with the opening recap that takes forever to re-establish the quirks of the heroes because there are WAY too many of them.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, people die a lot in Hunter x Hunter. And they die in Naruto, too! It's a good way to keep the viewer on their toes and to keep the universe the creators established feeling dangerous and threatening. Whenever I see an expendable character like Pixie Bob not die in a situation she probably should have died in, it annoys me because it reinforces the notion that none of the characters in BNHA can or will die. As such, I find it hard to feel invested when there's no threat of actual significant harm to any of the main characters. They all have blatant plot armor. Other examples included Best Jeanist surviving in episode 9 in what would have been a great opportunity to establish the overwhelming power of All for One by having him wipe out the number 4 hero; and All Might surviving the fight with All for One when again\u2026having AFO killing him would have been a great way to establish how powerful and threatening he is. Instead, All for One loses to a total asspull in which they wave off All Might\u2019s crippling injury because \u201cpeople give me strength\u201d bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of villains, they certainly fail to leave an impact. They tend to go on long tirades to make up for their lack of interesting backstories or motives, but that isn\u2019t their biggest problem. The biggest flaw here is that they never, ever win. How great would it have been for All Might to have died to establish All for One as an overwhelming villain? Killing the number one hero would've done it. Hell, killing Gran Torino or Best Jeanist would have done it. Just SOMEONE. That way I can believe at some point the villains in this show might actually succeed long-term. Turning Bakugo into a villain which might destabilize the wills of the heroes? They failed. Neutralizing anyone on the kill list during the forest raid? They failed. Accomplish anything during the raid in season one? They failed. Killing All Might when that is all All for One wished to do? He failed. The villains in this series are no better at their job than Team fucking Rocket. There\u2019s nothing to them, they always lose, and they aren\u2019t even entertaining. They exist purely to give the protagonists something to fight.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a lack of long-term consequences in this universe. What I mean by that is that any time a potential idea that could shake up the narrative is introduced, it\u2019s immediately waved off at the convenience of the plot. For example: how lame is it to have his mom take a hard stance against UA's irresponsible bullshit only for All Might to go on some heroic spiel and neutralize her concerns. This would have really made things interesting, as not being allowed to go to UA would have: 1, surprised me for the first time in the entire series and 2, would have been a grounding moment in Deku\u2019s development. He\u2019s basically completely disregarded his mother\u2019s feelings and anyone else\u2019s who might have cared about him by being reckless and throwing himself into danger with no disregard to his own safety. But it\u2019s immediately forgotten after All Might basically begs. Lazy.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good example of this is when Eraser said he thought about expelling the students but doesn\u2019t. Mainly because they should be expelled. This is where the concept of BNHA taking place in a school kind of hurts it. Once a student is expelled, obviously they're done there for good. But in, say, Hunter x Hunter, the Hunter exam is just that: a test. Anyone can take it however many times they want. That means that if characters take some drastic action that disqualifies them, all they would have to do is just re-apply the next year. The writers took advantage of this by doing exactly that to Killua, in the process establishing his homicidal nature and unbalanced emotional state. Point being, Hunter x Hunter set itself up for success by thinking 2 steps ahead. Also, they were willing to take chances like separating Killua from Gon in a year to establish an important character trait. That's excellent writing. BNHA's half-assed one foot in-one foot out approach to grounding its characters looks shoddy by comparison. If you\u2019re gonna expel them, do it. Don\u2019t pretend like you were going to and then wave it off because it\u2019s convenient. And don\u2019t pretend like the outcome of the exams matter if you\u2019re just going to let anyone who failed take a couple classes so they pass anyways. It\u2019s lazy.\\n\\n\r\nThat about sums it up. Story 3/10\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nI previously mentioned my issues with focusing on too many characters. But even the ones that are supposed to be focused on really haven\u2019t developed much at all. The best example of this I can think of is Deku and Uraraka.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"romance\" between Uraraka and Deku is one of the most pathetic and undercooked romances I've seen across all of film and TV. It's already hard enough to care considering how their relationship stays parked firmly in neutral and has been for 3 seasons now, but was it really impossible to give Uraraka a personality? She is easily the least fleshed out character of the main bunch and this half-assed romance crap is thrown in our face in almost every arc. They have done absolutely nothing to advance the relationship, so why does it keep coming back for no reason? At this point bringing it up again and again only reinforces the growing notion that Uraraka\u2019s only personality trait is liking Deku. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the villains, I already mentioned their problem: they never win and they have no interesting backstories or motives.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really grade for enjoyment. How much you enjoy something is determined by the product of your experiences in life and what you consider to be a quality production, which are different for every single person. As such, attempting to grade something inherently subjective with an objective grading metric is a paradox.  I will leave this score blank.\\n\\n\r\n~Conclusion~\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll put it bluntly: The key weakness BNHA suffers from is that it has no balls. It takes no chances, has no creativity, makes no sacrifices, and displays no ability to do anything new with the shounen genre in its 3 seasons of existence. But this may not necessarily be entirely its fault. After all, the reason I came into BNHA expecting something great was because it was burdened with unfair comparisons that were unlikely to be met.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I initially thought it was bad was because I was comparing it to Hunter x Hunter, and the reason I did that was because the high MAL ranking and constant comparisons to it in reviews raised my expectations beyond what was realistic to expect. Divorcing BNHA from those lofty comparisons and what I'm left is a totally average and acceptable shounen that has passable animation, average music, mediocre characters, and a bland story that lifts heavily from Naruto and Hunter x Hunter without adding anything of its own to what it borrows.\\n\\n\r\nBoku No Hero Academia Season 3 gets a 4/10.\\n",

            "content": "Hero Academia's poor character development has ruined an otherwise engaging story. \r\nIf you enjoyed the first 2 seasons in spite of a few absurd story arcs and silly character development, and you're willing to overlook poorly thought out character motivations for the sake of grand themes of heroism then you might be able to enjoy and even fully embrace season 3. I disliked the nonsensical villain motivations in Season 2 and I feel that their motivations seem to make even less sense in Season 3.\r\nSince Season 2, we have seen that most of Hero Academia's villains want to kill All Might because he happens tobe the so called \"symbol of peace\". Why would any villain want to kill the \"symbol of peace\"? According to Hero Academia, villains want to kill the symbol of peace because they want to deprive Japanese citizens of the hope that any hero can save them from any kind of danger at any moment in time. By the way, we don't really know if any country other than Japan actually exists in this fictional superhero and that just makes suspending one's disbelieve a little harder needs to be. \\n\\n\r\nHow exactly does a villain materially or emotionally benefit from depriving people of the hope that All Might or any other hero can save them at any point in time? How does killing All Might or any of the students of UA high satisfy a villain's emotional or physical needs? None of these important thematic questions are ever answered. The sad fact is that almost all of the villains have motives that conveniently push the plot forward and create some much needed suspense and tension. But in their attempt to kill All Might and UA students, the villains have sacrificed their physical well-being and their emotional needs. It makes no sense for villains to have motivations that don't personally benefit them in any imaginable way. \\n\\n\r\nIn real life or in stories that have realistic characters, villains have one of the following motivations; greed, curiosity, a lust for power, a desire for revenge, spiteful envy or a desire for dangerous fun. Is it possible to write villains who want to kill All Might or the students of UA High for realistic reasons? Of course it is, but it's generally easier to write villains who exist for the sole purpose of perpetuating a poorly conceived storyline. Made in Abyss and Kokkoku both have villains with interesting and unique motivations that actually make sense. You can check out my reviews for those two anime.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend watching the first seasons of both of those anime rather than watching the 3rd season of Hero Academia, unless you like Hero Academia's world building and you want to find out how the story's going to end. You can watch this shipwreck to the very end, but I'm jumping ship with what's left of my sanity. \\n\\n\r\nNow back to my review. The only one or two villains in Hero Academia have a somewhat realistic motivations and they're just minor characters who get as little screen time as possible. The villain I liked, fights for fun and his goals occasionally conflict with the goals of the Villain Vanguard. He's like a less interesting version of Bleach's Kenpachi. This is actually the least disappointing aspect of Season 3's storyline. \\n\\n\r\nTo get to the heart of the problem of villain motivations, we need to examine Hero Academia's most important villain: Stain. In Season 2, we were introduced to a villain called Stain. The extent to which you like Stain's character development will determine the extent to which you will enjoy watching Season 3. If you love Stain then you will love Season 3. If you hated Stain then you will hate Season 3. If you felt ambivalent about Stain's character then you will feel ambivalent about Season 3's storyline. \\n\\n\r\nVillain motivations is just one of the fundamental problems that plague Hero Academia's storyline, but I think the single biggest problem: is Stain's character development. First of all, Stain has no backstory in the anime nor does he have a backstory in the manga. Why exactly Stain set out to kill licensed heroes he thought were fake heroes with ill motives remains a mystery. Season 3 expects us to believe that lots of villains were inspired by Stain's actions, which makes no sense because that implies that lots of villains actually care about the heroic qualities of Japan's heroes. By definition, the word \"villain\" implies that one has a selfish and self-centered worldview. To truly be worthy of the title of \"villain\" one's priority should be one's personal well-being not someone else' heroic qualities. You cannot be a \"villain\" if you selflessly want to better society by purging it of incompetent and ill intentioned heroes. If you had Stain's motivation, then you would feel deeply insulted by the idea of being called a \"villain\" and you would never associate yourself with someone called a villain. Anyone who claims to be motivated by Stain's ideology would never to call themselves a villain or even allow themselves to be within spitting distance of anyone who happens to have villainous intentions. Horikoshi, Hero Academia's creator, has never described Stain as a misunderstood vigilante and that makes the fact that he inspires individuals who openly describe themselves as villains even more confusing. \\n\\n\r\nHorikoshi also does a piss poor job of convincing us, the viewers, that any so called villain who believes in Stain's incoherent ideology has an emotional makeup that makes even a lick of sense. Humans can have irrational motivations, but even irrational motives make some kind of sense to those who hold such motives. Terrorists and suicidal cult members, however bizarre their motivations may seem to the average person; can easily articulate or demonstrate the motives behind their actions. The same cannot be said for anyone of the villains in Hero Academia. \\n\\n\r\nThe other problems that plague Hero Academia's storyline and character development include; Deku's and other important heroes' increasingly powerful plot armor, the nonsensical rules that hero students are forced to abide by for the sake of maintaining some semblance of tension or drama in the story's overall plot, and the subtle but pernicious sexism that undermines some of the series best story arcs. \\n\\n\r\nSince Deku mastered the One for All quirk in Season 2, he has not encountered a villain or obstacle he could not physically or emotionally overcome. Not only does this plot point suck away all the drama and tension we enjoyed at the beginning of series, it also makes the overall plot a bit too easy to follow. \\n\\n\r\nAnd any hope we had for some dramatic tension later on in the story was crushed by the fact that Hero Academia's plot armor not only protects Deku from being killed, but also prevents him from experiencing any kind of emotional suffering. Since he mastered his quirk, he has not lost a single fight to a villain. If he lost a few fights to some villains once in a while, the story would be a lot more interesting and exciting. Deku's ever growing plot armor makes the story monotonous and predictable. \\n\\n\r\nNow it's time to get into what might be the most controversial part of my review: Hero Academia's pervasive and pointless sexism. There are 3 main problems with the way women are portrayed in Hero Academia. The first of which is the fact that no matter how hard superheroines work, they never achieve as much as their male counterparts even when they have superior quirks. Momo is a great example of this. Her quirk is incredibly powerful and she should be the number 1 student at UA high based on her grades and her masterful control her of work. But Horikoshi never let's her unleash her true potential. There are so many so many things she do with her powers that series never even hints at. She could spawn grenades, heat seeking missiles, ultrasonic guns, tear gas and any number of incredibly useful tools from her flesh. But Horikoshi paints her as a surprisingly unremarkable superheroine with the emotional weaknesses of a stereotypical Japanese girl. \\n\\n\r\nSince Season 2, Momo has not come any closer to being UA's best student despite her amazing potential. Like a lot of female characters in Hero Academia, she lacks self-confidence and believes that she cannot make important life decisions without the emotional support of a man. In Season 3, Momo is relegated to the role of a mildly interesting side character and it's up to the toughest male characters to almost singlehandedly save the day. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, women are consistently portrayed as being less motivated and less hard working than men for no other reason than the fact they are women. Even if we suppose that women in real-life Japan don't work as hard as men even when they are exceptionally talented, this series forces all it's female characters to never even attempt to push beyond the artificial physical and emotional limits they place upon themselves. It's fine if one female characters fits a certain gender stereotype, but a story in which all female characters suffer from the same female problems is not only less realistic, but also less fun to watch. The 1st episode of Season 3 portrays all the female characters as lazy fun lovers, but portrays men as hardworking and dedicated to their training as heroes. Someone will argue that female social pressure makes the ladies less motivated and a little more relaxed, but that makes no sense in the context of a dangerous and life-threatening school environment where students are attacked by powerful villains on a regular basis. The terrifying prospect of being killed by a villain should be enough motivation to keep any student on their toes regardless of their gender.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, too many female characters seem to lack self-confidence simply because their women. There are no men in Hero Academia who lack self-confidence and that's really suspicious. Even Mineta, one of the weakest quirk holders and arguably the least motivated male character, never experiences a crisis of confidence or  a moment of doubt. He never even considers quitting UA High. In this series women are less self-confident, regardless of how powerful their quirk is, simply because they're women. There is a difference between revealing gender stereotypes and reinforcing them. Hero Academia wholeheartedly indulges in gender stereotypes that weaken the impact of the story. If any of the male heroes questioned their abilities as heroes or decision makers, the story would be more interesting and engaging. What if Deku experienced a crisis in self-confidence? Wouldn't that be fun to watch? Or are all men immune to the emotional suffering that plagues female characters? The fact that men never hesitate or falter in this series, makes Hero Academia feel like a silly power fantasy written by a man for men. \\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you're convinced that Hero Academia's veneer of thematic depth makes it the greatest shonen anime ever written, at some point in Season 3 you're going to feel the crushing weight of all the story problems I've just described.",

            "content": "My hero academia came out at a perfect time. The very popular long running series Naruto ended, and superheroes were all the rage in western culture. Everyone was searching for the next series to quench the thirst. That\u2019s when the anime community was introduced to a long running super hero fighting anime, \u201cMy Hero Academia.\u201d. Horikoshi created the number one hero in the series to look like Captain America & Superman\u2019s love child. The number one hero has moves referencing American states which the protagonist uses. Clearly the show was shouting out at a western audience & it worked. The show brought in anime fans,superhero fans, American fans, and casual viewers. At one point, even I was liking the show. It was until after a few days of sitting on it that I started to realize the show was not something I could praise. I went back through my experience & noticed all its plot inconsistencies, poor characterization, bad story-telling, boring fights, weak villains, and its repetitive structure in every season. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing I\u2019ll point out is poor characterization because I rank that highly for my metric scale. Nearly every character in MHA is badly written. Considering this is a show about heroes the main thing you want to do is create relatable characters. Otherwise an audience won\u2019t feel emotional investment to care about their progression. It\u2019s why the western hero Spiderman is one of the most beloved heroes of all time. This is because despite his powers he has relatable problems humans go through. All the characters in MHA are cardboard cutouts of each other or knockoff versions of better characters from better series. They react the same and don't stand out unless the author demands it for an episode to poorly manipulate audience\u2019s emotions. \\n\\n\r\nExample\u2019s: 1a: Uraraka has an arc explaining how poor her family is to be forgotten about. The conflict isn\u2019t resolved or discussed again. It was introduced to be forgotten about. Also it wasn't hinted at beforehand, it was dropped out of nowhere. A better writer might have shown us hints beforehand or show Uraraka work on resolving said issue like getting a job. Have Uraraka work & balance school to show her dedication to solve the problem. \\n\r\n1b: Iida deals with the dilemma of revenge, which went against his previous moral\u2019s, to easily forgetting about it after a chat with a friend. This is never mentioned again and the emotional investment to his family was never hinted at. It was dropped out of nowhere. A good author might have shown hints, or have it take-longer for Iida to overcome the moral dilemma. Perhaps Iida starts to question hero society or his previous moral ideas. \\n\r\n1c: Momo has an arc showing her insecurities & has a panic attack. This behavior was never hinted previously. The audience is thrown off again. The \"insecurity\" is cured after a conversation & is forgotten about. \\n\r\n1d: Shoto has an arc describing family trauma but after a conversation mid battle is convinced to change by visiting his abusive mother and to work out issues with his abusive father. Although, Shoto\u2019s issues are sometimes mentioned this cheapens the character. Why should an audience be concerned if character\u2019s problems are solved through a chat? A good author would show Shoto slowly developing solutions on his own\u2026not have a lead play \u201cGod\u201d to solve everyone\u2019s issues. I will address the lead in a bit. \\n\r\n1e: Bakugou has an ongoing arc/gag of his wailing inferiority complex. It doesn't make sense as the one he feels inferior to is powerless whiny wimpy Izuku Midoriya. I can only assume its because Izuku is the main character but Bakugou doesn't know this. The motivations he has are to be a hero because he wants to be the best. Wow such rich motivation & not at all childish or cliche... The bullying he does as a child I thought would be do to having abusive parental figures. However, his family life is fairly good. So, the only excuse for him actively picking on the weak must be because he is a sociopath. Also for some reason the author thinks its a great idea to have him constantly opening up his feelings to the one he's abusing. When it makes no sense. Why would any bully confess personal insecurities to their victim? This reminds me of a Key & Peele skit titled 'School bully'. The only way I can see why Bakugou is a favorite amongst fans is because his commentary about the show is disturbingly meta...extra's fumigate, nothing makes sense, nobody is worth remembering, & Deku is the worst. - Yes that sums up the show nicely! \\n\\n\r\nThere are no realistic psychological dilemma's for any of the teens without it coming out of nowhere, used for audience manipulation, or being \"cured\" after a talk. Otherwise characters exist as literal unfunny gags. An author who uses manipulative sob tactics in characters without presenting hints, or indications, beforehand and does not execute the resolution properly is a terrible writer.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIzuku Midoriya/Deku is the worst shonen protagonist of all time. Deku is essentially a boy scout bore who is cringe worthy at best and extremely annoying at worst. In the beginning Deku claims being a hero is his number one goal yet idolizes a bully & never once trains. Once Deku learns he has no powers he essentially gives up. He never trains his body to achieve his goal another way, or to defend himself against bullies. All Deku did for fourteen years, according to the information from the first episode, was take notes of heroes, cry, & complain. Its until a deus ex machina happens where the number one hero, who happens to be the leads cherished idol, All Might, decides to select him as a student & give him free superpowers. It happens after All Might witnesses Deku attempt to \"save\" a bully from a monster - whom would have easily killed him if it wasn't for plot armor. And meanwhile, three able pro heroes stood by for no reason. If those three pro heroes reacted normally/logically/consistent with the story then Bakugou would have been fine. The author made them stand by for no reason. It was an attempt to make Deku look heroic when in fact he was reckless & wore heavy plot armor. So, after one event of recklessness/stupidity an event Deku caused, the number one hero picks Deku a random, lazy, timid, crybaby he just met to be a successor and give free ultimate power to. Why? Oh, it\u2019s because Deku reminded All Might of himself. All Might was given free powers as a human once too. So, All Might did it for the feels. Is this guy really the number one hero? Quite frankly that logic makes him sound like a complete idiot. We find out he has a huge battle scar from being reckless yet he picks the first reckless kid he sees...\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that someone like Deku was selected would make any hardworking person pissed. Deku gets unrealistic, undeserved, free, overpowered things for being reckless & dumb. The show could have gone in a better direction. Deku could have remained human to explore bigotry/racism in this universe of quirk vs non-quirk users & which species is worthy to the better qualities of life. However, the creator doesn\u2019t want to take on such complex issues and instead ignores them after human Deku gets powers. Perhaps Deku could have trained to be a hero despite what anyone said. It would have given a message of working hard for what you want. Instead, Deku gets everything handed to him through deus ex machina\u2019s, crying, & by events he causes. In season 2 another deus ex machina happens as magically its explained that Deku's quirk has a will of its own that can break him out of mind control quirks! So, whenever Deku is out his quirk can come in to save him. Talk about plot armor! What is inspiring about that?! What happens to Deku is luck, plot armor, & deus ex machina's for someone very undeserving whiny & *pathetic.  \\n\\n\r\nDeku after one year of *strength* training somehow learns advanced combat fighting abilities & easily goes toe to toe with Bakugou, Shinso, Shoto, & villains. How does strength training = precise combat knowledge and Deku suddenly losing previous timid behavior in fierce battles? Notes/Weight Lifting do not equal a black belt in martial arts. Why would all of a sudden his personality trait change randomly while fighting? Its because the author isn\u2019t consistent in his story telling. Suddenly you can watch a few UFC matches, take notes, and use those moves without practice in a heated battles against bullies you fear and murderous psychopaths?! Bakugou & other students trained longer than the lead. Suddenly one year is all it takes for Deku to catch up? An example: the toss Deku does against Bakugou season 1. I have experience in martial arts and that move is not \u201ceasy\u201d. If you tried it without practice or knowledge you\u2019d be flattened. Deku is 5\u20195 Bakugou is 5\u20197 thats at least 15 Ibs of difference. Considering Bakugou was wearing 6 Ibs gauntlets its an added 12 Ibs. Bakugou has trained more than a year, has more muscle mass, and has experience in those moves. It is not possible for someone with no experience/practice to use a moves like that in heated battle and succeed against someone very experienced. If you don\u2019t believe me then try to strength train for a year and use a move like that on an experienced fighter who is bigger, stronger, and taller than you. Then, in season 2 he does it to a kid who is 5'9 - thats at least 30 Ibs in difference!! You expect me to believe that?! Then, to give evidence of \"training\", Deku season 2 trains for a week during an internship & when he gets back is able to do acrobatic air moves like Bakugou. The creator obviously did no research into the significance of martial arts training. Those moves are difficult & take time. They take more than a week to achieve. Naruto had realism as far as hard work & training go. All those characters trained for years to preform martial arts moves. In Yu Yu Hakusho, Yusuke trained for six months with a master S class fighter. Deku trains for a week...Again why should I root for this whiny brat? Deku claims to be an underdog - yet he gets everything handed to him, has deus ex machinas, everyone loves him, has the number one hero up his ass, every girl wants him, has the number one quirk, is the chosen one, & learns moves faster than experienced fighters. This is all happening less than 60 episodes in! \\n\\n\r\nFor the exams to enter UA, Deku gets the highest amount of rescue points (73) for beating an off limit zero-point robot to save 1 person. Why? The robot was worth no points & Deku only saved one student. The plot changes consistency to benefit the lead thats why. Thus, there will be no tension and you can expect him to always win. There we\u2019re thousands of applicants who trained longer and harder than Deku. Why should/would Deku after one year of strength training beat them? Why was he the only one out of thousands to attack a zero point robot? If the plot was realistic someone would\u2019ve helped Uraraka knowing they\u2019d get a rescue point. Why should they reward students for destroying something they said was zero points, and who significantly injure themselves in the process? If that we\u2019re a real crisis it would very problematic. Deku would be on the ground broken bones/useless while more villains came in. Why should he get the most rescue points? Deku only saved 1 student that\u2019s the amount he should get. If Uraraka hadn't bitch slapped him he would've died! So again Deku is awarded for recklessness & plot changing its consistency much like how those three pros stood by. This happens every season! It means you can't take the rules set in this show seriously as the author changes them whenever it benefits the *horrible lead.\\n\\n\r\nDeku\u2019s fighting animation is terrible, 'Deku punched another guy to victory instead of showing off strategic battle understanding, clever tactic, or killer animation.'. Deku is one of the \"smartest\" students but never uses this so-called gift. Instead he endangers children, destroys his body over the feels, is reckless, & acts out on soft emotional trigger bait.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s awful that whenever other characters get a \"moment\" in the series they are forgotten about, played for comedy, used to down play the significance of abuse (Shoto), or later used for just having a \u2018crush\u2019 on Deku (Uraraka). They have no goals of there own unless Deku has something to say about it. Everything important to other characters development has to revolve around the *pathetic lead & its bullshit. \\n\\n\r\nDeku is a hero who is emotionally unstable, admires people who hate him, & gets things through deus ex machinas. If you re-watch the series you'll notice all of Bakugou's meta commentary is disturbingly spot on. Everyone acts like extra\u2019s, nobody is memorable, nothing makes sense, and Deku is the worst. Period. Now lets move forward.\\n\\n\r\n2a - Inconsistent/Idiotic plot. The exams set up for entering the #1 hero school in Japan are insanely stupid. The exam is to fight as many robots as possible under a time limit. The robots are worth points and after the time runs out the top scoring kids will be accepted. This is unbelievably uncreative, useless, & *moronic. Why don\u2019t they evaluate applicants *mental health or/& have *psy. tests. Thats what every police force does. If heroes are protecting the public and have very *dangerous quirks they should be evaluated. They should make sure these applicants with *dangerous powers are not sociopaths, psychopaths, manipulators, liars, or spies. Otherwise, who is to say villains, spies, etc. won't enter UA, do to these easy admission requirements, steal knowledge, & crush Japan!? The \"#1 hero school\" in Japan has no psychological tests, & no shown measures to prevent spies or villains from being admitted. As later we find out there is indeed an unknown spy(s) gathering information. Nice going, \"number one hero school\"/Plot.\\n\\n\r\n3a - The villains are awful- In season 2 students are punished for self-defense or saving people from a serial killer. Yet they saved/defended themselves season 1 during the USJ attack and weren't punished. Did the writer forget that? Oh wait, this time its being used as emotional manipulation to make us feel sympathy for the leads. Well I don't. The villains in MHA are the absolute worst. The villains are unsympathetic, boring, ugly, generic, & moronic. Why should I feel anything for a protagonist if the villain they face is pathetic? Shigaraki, one of the main villains, infiltrates the number one hero high school in broad daylight & acts surprised his mission fails. Firstly, he invading a national hero high school guarded by dozens of pro heroes & staff members who out class him and he's surprised things didn't work? If the show made sense students would have used phones or used quirks to alert others. If the show made sense the \u201cNumber one hero school\u201d would have cameras in facilities, security guards, & emergency buttons all over. If the show made sense some of those *adult *experienced villains would have killed or significantly injured students. Next, Shigaraki kidnaps a hero student which in turn reveals his location & gets his master thrown in jail. Again, what a dumb plan. Why is he obsessed with teenagers & not focusing on gathering experienced adults for his organization? Overall, Shigaraki does nothing to properly advance goals. I\u2019ve caught up with the manga & I'll warn you his actions only get progressively more stupid. Spoilers: He destroys a weapon that works to eliminates quirks for what reason? That weapon would prove very useful in defeating heroes which is what he wants to do...Next the creator thinks its a great idea to introduce these braindead Nomu monsters. I guess its an attempt to make the villains look better by comparison. Similar to how robots are thrown in next to our bland heroes. However, this only makes both groups feel lackluster as they rely on these things instead of their own strengths, or personalities. The other villains like Stain have no depth, sympathy, charm, charisma, or are even good looking. Why are all of them ugly? If these villains want absolute destruction of heroes, why are they so concerned with teenagers in high school? Why not go into the underground villain society, gather *adult *experienced members, or stress about the *thousands of trained *adult pros hunting them? Why is this ignored? It's ignored because this series makes no damn sense!\\n\\n\r\n4a- bad story telling- If this is a \"number 1\" hero school why aren\u2019t lessons, philosophies, *anti heroes, ideas, or moralities taught or talked about?! Why do they all think alike and act like robots!? Why do they only fight robots?! It\u2019s just, 'let\u2019s fight because you\u2019re bad.'. There is no meaning or understanding. There is no valid emotional buildup. It\u2019s just thrown out of nowhere and resolved the same. There is nothing creative, innovative, or new about the show. In fact why are some of these students admitted to this \"number 1\" hero school? Most of the students are complete idiots. I thought this was a \"2 percent acceptance rate\". I would understand if it was set in America but this is Japan. The series makes it a point to stress about the overwhelming importance of quirks. It states if you don't have one you're essentially useless & can never be a hero. Its begging to have a human come in like Space Cobra, Spike S, Space Dandy, Guts, Nic Brown, or Rock Lee to prove these racists wrong! Why tell us UA was accepting humans to have none be admitted? The creator could have used this information as an opportunity to place a human hero in his story. However, that would take significant attention away from his prized bitch Izuku. \\n\\n\r\nIn season two the majority focuses on a televised school sports festival which apparently has more viewership than the olympics. Yet two out of the three main events are fighting fodder robots, and playing chicken. Yes... I'm sure I'd love to spend time watching a bunch of bratty kids fight dumb robots and play chicken. The players are first year UA students. So already an audience knows these are inexperienced fighters. Here's how the writer should have done the event- Take the top five students out of sixteen district hero high schools to fight. The fights are five on five matches till one team is left. That winning team wins grand prize of money, fame, ranking, etc. and makes the school reputation & revenue go up. This would set up attention to seniors, juniors, etc. UA characters would watch these fights as the writer would introduce other characters because the ones we have SUCK. Skip all the robots, chicken games, and go straight to fights. There are stakes for school rep. student careers, etc. and it would make a hell of a lot more sense to tune in watching this! Have one, or more, of a fighter be a human and show 'em kicking ass. Show how far schools go to keep reputations. How status & popularity are apart of hero success and why its wrong. Show the class wanting to be in this top five selection and how it motivates them to train etc. All these are great elements that could have been added!\\n\\n\r\nIn season 3 we have a license exam. If students pass they get to be legal heroes. The setup for the exam is fighting to then saving staged victim citizens. WHERE ARE THE MENTAL EVALUATIONS?! Good god this incompetent. I mean this is where they are given freedom to fight criminals in public and you don't give students interviews, questions, psy. tests, etc.? It is common sense! Nearly every UA kid passes except Bakugou and Todoroki. However, they have a chance to pass by taking extra classes. So who cares about them failing as they can easily pass later. Why did every UA student pass? As far as I can tell some of them are very incompetent. What the writer could have done is have half fail the first test. Those that failed would have to wait a year to try again. That way we could get some necessary development for those lame bland characters. Having everyone pass feels illogical given we've seen how moronic most of the kids are. \\n\\n\r\nIn season 3 they introduce a few new characters. One character that comes to mind is Inasa. Inasa is a freshmen at SA - the rival school for UA. Inasa's power is wind manipulation, like Jin from YYH. Inasa is a loud eccentric character who gets overly excited about team spirit & hates rudeness. Inasa isn't arrogant, even though he has rights to be, as his quirk control is better than any student seen. Inasa believes herorism is being honorable & respecting others. When he sees others not living up to these ideals he disavows them. The character design is like Victor Krum from the harry potter series. I like this character as he has a central idea, isn't rude, and is mature enough to admit self-errors. Also he is one character who isn't manipulated by the *bitch Deku on how to 'change' or is 'inspired'. Inasa should be filled with pride but he is obsessed with bugs, making friends, and being polite. The other characters introduced are bland. Mirio, a top student, has a gag of getting naked to use his quirk...Why are the top three students second years? No seniors or juniors? That seems very odd. Why not have a variety? Have one second year and two seniors, etc. Then of course they're all quirky and awkward...Why? If they are the elites at UA have them be intimidating. Don't use their characters as gags because thats what they'll become GAGS!! A similar pattern the creator uses on all his empty characters. Ugh.   \\n\\n\r\nI cannot believe people think this show deserves an 8.66 or that season two deserves an 8.69. Do you realize that\u2019s a higher rating than *Yu Yu Hakusho, HXH (99), Tatami Galaxy, Berserk (90s), Neon Gen, Near all Jojo series, NHK, MSG, & Baccano. All far superior series whom MHA can\u2019t even touch. This season is the same rating as Death Note! People think this bland sap of crap is as good as Death note?!?! You think season 2 of it is better than Death note!?! Even Naruto is better than this and Naruto sucks! Naruto had a consistent training progress and performance. Naruto had stellar fighting animation from a team who researched and understood martial arts. There is none of that in MHA! Its sloppily put together in every way possible!\\n\\n\r\nAll the attention in this series is to one of the most insufferable leads of all time. Even Gon from HxH who is thought as too goodie goodie still broke moral convictions, worked hard, didn\u2019t complain, and accomplished dreams instead of waiting for a deus ex machina (All Might) to happen. And he didn't play god to every characters development! Gon is twelve and he is more emotionally mature than Deku!\\n\\n\r\nI will give the series credit for a decent art style, catchy music from the Openings, Endings, and OST. The series shows off creative powers\u2026However, there are dozens of shows that do this better - and why are you watching shows for such generic superficial reasons? The fighting animation is terrible, 'A guy punched another guy to victory instead of showing off strategic battle understanding, clever tactic, or killer animation.'. Demand more for your viewing experience. Time is short. Do not waste your time on generic cookie cutter short attention span entertainment. I can only name one character I liked, Inasa, and he was around for only five episodes. That is how trash this is! A towns worth of characters and only one is likable. How pathetic. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: MHA is a show with a majority of bad characters, nonsense world building, terrible fighting animation, bland character designs, poor villains, has no depth or challenging ideas in morality, ethics, or society, & takes no risks. You'd think some of these concepts would be heavily explored since it\u2019s a title *school anime about learning how to be a perfect hero. Alas, it\u2019s not and the ideas are generic black & white boring concepts an angst teen would write! Its a light novel written by a bad fan fiction writer!\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many better shows to enjoy, LOGH, FMAB, *YYH, DN, Monster, HxH, Tomorrows Joe, RK, Lupin the third, CB, GTO, Space Cobra, Neon Genesis, Fist of the North Star, Captain Harlock, Sailor Moon, MSG, Space Dandy, FLCL, One Punch man, etc. \\n\\n\r\nMHA deserves a one out of ten because its a show that further brings down anime. It keeps brining anime down to garbage. It must be stopped. \\n\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nTRASH\\n",

            "content": "I do not like Boku no Hero Academia. \r\nBoku no Hero Academia is probably the most popular anime of recent years and is widely regarded as a great series. But I\u2019ve never understood the hype. There are familiar characters with dull motivations and extremely boring humor. BnHA is pretty much 50 percent \"comedy\" comedy with BIG quotation marks and 50 percent fights. I'd like to explain why I think BnHA fails in both of these departments in this review.\r\nThe Fights \r\nI'll be comparing an anime with fantastic fights: Hunter x Hunter with those in Boku no Hero Academia in these segment so if you haven'tseen Hunter x Hunter, what are you doing? watch it. But the second part might not be as relevant to you if you for some reason haven't seen it\\n\\n\r\nThe fights in BnHA aren\u2019t good. There are no brains used in any of the fights. In the end, it\u2019s always the one that punched harder that\u2019s victorious in the end. There\u2019s this one fight in season 2 where Uraraka actually uses her smarts to try and win against Bakugo. Her plan succeeded, but she still lost because Bakugo used his power harder. I\u2019ve seen many comparisons between Boku no Hero Academia and Hunter x Hunter. I also don\u2019t really get these, because Hunter x Hunter is one of the best animes ever made. BnHA is not. Let\u2019s just compare the fights.\\n\\n\r\nFights in Hunter x Hunter are always extremely thought-out and mentally challenges our heroes. The fights always have a setup and a point either to prove how much stronger a character has become by doing something that they couldn\u2019t do before. Some fights can start whole character arcs. One fight that started an arc was when Gon first encountered Hisoka during the Hunter exam arc. While Gon was trying to steal his numbered plate Hisoka just knocked him to the ground in one punch. He then gave his plate to Gon either way and said: \u201cI\u2019ll let you keep it till\u2019 you can punch me like that\u201d. And then many episodes later when Gon lands his first Punch and finally lets Hisoka have his plate back is SO satisfying. And that\u2019s only because this fight had a long setup and gave the characters good motivation. The first fight between Hisoka and Gon is just one of many examples of great fights in Hunter x Hunter.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already talked a bit about the fights in BnHA so imma keep this shorter. I just want to make the point that the fights in BnHA are nearly the exact opposite of those in Hunter x Hunter. The fights are mindless and dull and the characters don't have real motivation to beat the shit out of each other more than that one of them is good and the other is bad. In most cases, some sort of motivation is revealed during the fight but not before to give the characters some motivation to fight in the first place. Often you don\u2019t even know who the villain is before the fight has started. But then they reveal something like \u201cI killed your parents\u201d or something in the like. There\u2019s one more thing that REALLY bugs me off about the BnHA fights. And that is those goddamn speeches in the middle of the fights that everyone has. Like when he stands there screaming some generic nonsense, JUST PUNCH HIM. In almost every fight Deku looks down at the ground talking silently. Then we get a shot of him clenching his fist, then looking up and starting to scream before getting some power boost. And the villain just stands there and listens to him talk about how All Might gave him his chance in life or whatever. Deku could be so beat that both of his arms could be broken and he barely could stand. But after holding a speech he magically beats the bad guy. Maybe Deku wasn\u2019t quirkless after all. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in both of these animes is actually quite amazing. That\u2019s the one thing I will give to BnHA, it\u2019s visually pleasing. Both have very good character designs that make the characters stand out and you can clearly understand at least a bit of the character just by looking at them. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy\\n\\n\r\nBnHA is one example of the most boring comedy in an anime that I\u2019ve ever watched. Between the dull fights, our other boring characters interact with each other. And they often lean on this pervert for comedic value. But it\u2019s just not funny. It really cannot get a smile out of me. I\u2019ve never liked the slapstick kind of comedy. I don't find it funny when people get hurt or get extreme nose bleeds because one of the female cast members are in a bikini. I find the friendly banter between the characters in Hunter x Hunter to be much more effective. Between the fights in this much better shonen are there most often interactions between our four main characters. And these scenes actually make us believe that they are friends and have an honest to god relationship. They fight with each other, joke and laugh things real friends do. \\n\r\nPeople always say that humor is subjective, and I beg to differ. Humor is not subjective, but what YOU find funny is. If you have ever watched an interview with a comedian then you can easily tell that all of them have plans and tactics on how to make you laugh. In the simplest form, you have to have a set-up and a pay off to make a joke that some people find funny. They either tell a story before the punchline or make a call-back to something they said before. This is where Boku no Hero Academias' comedy fails. There's no set-up and barely any payoff to any of the jokes (there are a few exceptions tho). The characters just make a funny face and scream loudly, that's comedy for you. The comedy is on Instagram-comedians level for god's sake. And just the fact half, if not more of the time is spent on this godawful comedy is mindboggling to me.   \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, writing this review has made me realize how much I like Hunter x Hunter but also how much I dislike Boku no Hero Academia. So if you wanna take something from this review, watch or rewatch Hunter x Hunter. :)  \\n",

            "content": "This season was just more of the same of the previous two except longer. We first get another training arc, where the students are training to improve their quirks. The training portion amounted to \u201cthe more you use it, the stronger it gets.\u201d, how exciting. The author must have realized how dull it was as it only lasted about half the episode and was never to be seen again for the rest of the season.  \r\nNext was another attack by the Shigaraki and goons, their goal this time is to kidnap Bakugo. We\u2019re also introduced to a new one dimensional villain called Muscular, whodebuts and is defeated by a 1000000% smash asspull from Deku the same episode. I also can\u2019t get over how stupid it is that the students need permission from their teacher to use their quirks despite being in a life or death situation (Even made more annoying is the fact that such a rule wasn\u2019t present in the first season when Shigaraki and friends first attacked). Anyway, the League of Villains succeed for once and kidnap Bakugou. Why? Because they want to recruit him. That\u2019s right, someone who chooses to enroll in one of the top hero school totally has his eyes set on becoming a villain apparently. Stupid shit like this is why the villains in this show can\u2019t be taken seriously (And it doesn\u2019t help that we still know next to nothing about them). We\u2019re again introduced to another new, bland villain named All for One, who is the villain counterpart to All Might. The two eventually engage in their last battle and All Might wins. \\n\\n\r\nWith the exception of the first fight between Deku vs Bakugo, the battles in this series are generally lackluster, and All Might vs All for One is no exception; there was no build-up, the fight itself was mostly talking about All Might\u2019s mentor (Who we still don\u2019t know enough to care about) and at most there were about 4 exchanges overall with explosions everywhere, how exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc of this season is again, an examination. This time they\u2019re going to take an exam in order to get their \u201cProvisional Hero Licenses\u201d, which allows them to use their quirks to save people and put down villains. The first portion of the exam consists of playing dodgeball, I shit you not, this is how they pick heroes who can be entrusted with saving lives and taking down villains. One Punch Man had a better examination and that was a freaking parody. Second part of the exam wasn\u2019t so bad until Todoroki gets into an utterly stupid quarrel with a newly introduced character named Inasa, and holy shit, this guy takes pettiness to a whole other level; Inasa apparently was suppose to enroll into U.A but instead chose to literally go school in the other side of the country just because he didn\u2019t like Todoroki, and it\u2019s not like Todoroki did anything to him, he just didn\u2019t like the vibe Todoroki gave of. Due to Inasa\u2019s actions both him and Todoroki fail the exam, but wait, there\u2019s actually another test that those who failed can take in three months to earn their licenses, consequences be damned.\\n\\n\r\nSo again, we get more training, more Shigaraki \"doing stuff\" and more exams. Most shonen have repetitive formulas but they are at least heading towards something, MHA\u2019s just going in circles from the looks of things, I mean, this season is almost over and we\u2019re getting yet again, another fight between Deku & Bakugo (Though if it\u2019s anything like the first one then it\u2019s might be worth looking forward to). The show doesn\u2019t even have anything to make up for it\u2019s lack of story; the world building is practically non-existent, the fights consist of either talking or spamming the same technique for majority of the battle, and most characters are incredibly shallow (Seriously, a lot of people claim the characters in the show are well developed and fleshed out but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, only Deku, Bakugo & Todoroki get anything worth noting). \\n\\n\r\nLong story short, the show gets worse each passing season with it's only redeeming quality being its animation at this point.\\n",

It's allsame in 3 seasons!\\n\r\nThe story improvement system always goes on : 'training , war with villans and regroup and the fall of the symbol of peace'.main idea: study hard and fight till you win by improving yourself.  Still does'nt change at 3 seasons....The anime was all clear like child shows. Theese are why Bnha is repetitive and bold. And tournament arcs are really unfair because characters' who has more supportive ability of course lose to a damage dealing charcter. How can you viewers get hyped to this?\\n\r\nSucceeding the main idea is not important. It's important to improve viewers view on a topic or an idea. If the show keeps going on a monotone path , the main idea and story will be less unique and effective. That won't be an improving anime , it just would be waste of producers effort and viewers time..\\n\\n\r\n -Art and animation:\\n\r\nThere was nothing that I can call beautiful because there were no detailed drawings and ambiance.\\n\r\nColor use in this show makes it more lively because every character had different type of hair and overly colorful costumes.\\n\r\nAnimation is fine , there were no gaps or misuses. Only the abrupt movements of characters make the action more powerful but exaggerated.\\n\\n\r\n -Characters:\\n\r\nEvery character has 1 point of view since the 1st season and the anime shows only one characteristics of the characters. (not Todoroki and lida) Characters are still all narrow viewed for 3 seasons. Deku wants to get stronger and save people... Purple guy wants tits... Bakugo always wants to be in the top(hero) with a true match... every character has only 1 feature and It does'nt even change in 3 seasons.0 character improvement. After the boss villan attack they tried to add 'depth' to characters by showing their rooms that they designed. (adding more meaningless variety of colors do the trick , right?) ffs-.-* And they wasted more than 3 episodes for 'character showcase' scenes. And why tf their quirks keep appear on the top every time we see the characters like the viewers are morons? And quirk explanation for every character takes more than a minute.\\n\r\nThey created variety of TeEN ChaRaCteRs which at least one of them relates to viewers by making the viewers feel closer to the character and the anime. It made this series more popular a lot easier and made this series overrated with this use.\\n\r\nTalking during fights and analyzing the fights lasts for too long mostly. It's scene time waste. They could use the screen time to improve characters.\\n\r\nFan service has always been a dissapointment in anime by lowering the characters view , characters action width and communitys' quality.\\n\\n\r\n -Sound and ambiance: \\n\r\nMusic makes act of characters and action scenes a lot more exaggerated. I really dislike that most of the animes have a moving music in a slow part/scene. Music should give a background effect and help creating the ambiance like Made in Abyss. Music should'nt be the main effect.Music should be like dust in the wind.\\n\r\nThere are 4-5 tracks are used too much that the music makes the anime repellent. There was nearly no ambience effects to make the scenes attractive and they did'nt add meaning to aesthetics. They always use the same music and effects when they show a new training place and when they fight. This makes the occurances 'cliche' and less effective.(every monotone uses makes anything more cliche and overdone)\\n\r\nSFX were coherent. They don't stand out much because of loud music mostly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLastly:\\n\r\n''The main idea may be superficial but It gets to its point with less flaws''(no).\\n\r\nIf the fiction does'nt have depth , it won't have flaws much. That makes it \\n\r\nrun of the mill. they shouldn't just train or fight the villains, there must be a psychological change, change on the hero system or world balance at least (not the fall of symbol of peace). An effective show must have improving story system and idea to create depth.\\n\r\nThis anime is'nt much different than American supernatural films. It feels like they got effected by Hollywood.\\n\\n\r\nI had the same view from the 1st season. I guess this won't change till the end.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Maybe there will be spoilers, maybe there won't. I'm writing this on the spot.\r\nI enjoy this show for the same reason I enjoy Fairy Tail. For every passing moment that the episode continues, I imagine the unspeakable atrocities that I would commit on this cast of boringass characters. I shit you not. I've been watching a decent bit of Fairy Tail and my imagination is the sole reason that I'm able to handle Natsu's shit.\r\nIf you like this anime, that's fine. If you think it's good, that's fine. If you think it's a 10/10 though? That's also fine. But when people start praising this heapingpile of absolute steaming feces as though it's some kind of shounen perfection, a masterpiece of never-seen-before levels of quality, I have to just step in and remind people that this is most definitely the first anime that they've ever seen. Also that the show isn't without its seethingly glaring flaws.\\n\\n\r\nI've said this before and I'll say it again. 90% of the side-characters are stale as fuck and could be thrown away without the show being affected in the slightest. Now I understand that side-characters aren't supposed to have huge roles in a story, but a well-written side character contributes a small but meaningful amount to whatever story they're a part of. MHA keeps on giving these worthless characters screen time, shoving them down our throats without actually making them do anything. Kirishima is one side-character that matters. There's probably another one. Throw away that perverted ball-headed dude. What's the point of that guy with the tail? Or electricity dude? Or literally any of the girls? (Whose character designs are appreciated but whose effect on the story is practically non-existent)\\n\\n\r\nAlso Bakugo. I can't stop complaining about this dude. He's like a worse-written version of Vegeta. Did you get that? A worse-written version of a character written by Akira Toriyama, a man whose writing is notorious for its myriad flaws. Unlike Vegeta's early hatred for Goku, which was justified by a history of classism that was an integral part of a long-dead society that Vegeta was once a part of, Bakugo's undying hatred of Midoriya is justified by, uh, the latter suddenly getting stronger? Can someone please explain to me? I'm sure this character dynamic means a lot to some people, and I'm interested to see the analyses of people who view this show more positively than I do, but for now I cannot fucking understand why Bakugo hates Deku so much. I could understand if Bakugo was angry and frustrated with himself, and fearful of Deku, someone he deems as weak, surpassing him. But so far in the anime (and the point I'm at in the manga), there hasn't been any hint of character development in Bakugo.\\n\\n\r\nTodoroki is the only truly great character in the entirety of the show. He has this unique backstory that adds to the world and setting the show takes place in, as well as a dynamic with his father that is sure to pay off later on in the show. The way that he acts makes sense to us because we\u2019ve witnessed his motivations, and we\u2019ve seen how other characters (mainly Deku) have affected change in him. Easily my favourite character. Iida is good too.\\n\\n\r\nI guess, because this is a review, I have to talk about something beyond the characters. The art is decent. The music is nothing to write home about. The story is adequately written, and it also helps that Horikoshi is a master of introducing new plot points, although it's a shame that she is master of little else. I think she's talented though, and she will hopefully go on to create better works once this abomination is cancelled because everyone on Earth magically regains their sense of taste and collectively throws this shit in the trash.\\n\\n\r\nNow back to the characters. I kind of like Deku, but he would have been higher on my list of favourite characters if it weren\u2019t for the greatest writing error in shounen manga history occurring so early on in the show. At first I thought Deku was going to have to compete quirkless in a world of superpowered freaks. I thought he was gonna have to overcome obstacles with his brilliant mind, and through sheer dedication and hard work. His place among heroes would have been similar to that of Batman's among the Justice League. But he just ended up inheriting the abilities of All Might, the world\u2019s strongest superhero. It\u2019s just way too painful to ignore such a massive missed opportunity. This could have literally changed the shounen manga/anime landscape. But when he gets powers, what is the point of the show? Can anybody tell me? If we're not watching a show to see a person overcome physical and social challenges, or to experience an interesting and dynamic cast, or to bask in the glory of its aesthetic decisions, then why are we watching it at all? At the end of the day, my main complaint towards \"My Hero Academia\" is that there is no reason for its existence as a piece of art, anime, manga, or otherwise. Had it not been Studio Bones that picked it up, it would have just been another throwaway show in a sea of new releases that never saw the light of a second season. Now, as I stated before, I'm not saying that you can't like the show. I'm not even saying that I don't like it when people like the show. I love talking with people whose view of certain anime is the polar opposite of mine. But that's only when they articulate their points well and actually understand why they like the damn thing. Most of the compliments and positive comments I see directed towards MHA are the same vapid, pointless comments that I see directed to literally every other anime. The only difference in this case is that there are more of them, which prompts me to talk about it. \\n\\n\r\nI think it's worth noting that my previous review of this show was a 6/10, way more positive than the 3 I'm giving it now. But that's always been the case with this particular work. The longer it goes on, and the more that I think about it, the less I enjoy it. At the very best, I can call this show, \"an anime about things.\"\\n\\n\r\nthe end",

            "content": "This is actually my very first review so I'll try to be proper in terms of critique.\r\n(Very Light Spoilers!!)\r\nBoku No Hero Academia is one of those animes that I actually consider as mediocre regarding on how generic it is but at the same time I hate it because of how it leaves out many things in terms of characters, plot etc. and that will be explained in this review\r\n\u22c6Story- 4\u22c6\r\nThe Plot of this season was based on the Licenses that they were supposed to be receiving through training in the woods and actually applying for the exam. Compared to Season 2, it wasn't doneextremely well considering that the beginning arc was rushed and went straight to the actual fight within 5 episodes or so, Compared to the U.A sports carnival Arc where they took the time in order to finish it and its end was enjoyable to experience. The Forest Training Arc was somewhat rushed and was not being able to completely finish due to the events that occurred but was later finished by the training they did prior to the exam so that's a plus. The (someone) retrieval mission, to be honest, was really unnecessary considering the character was formidable enough to defend himself (This was due to the fast pacing in the beginning). Besides that everything about the season was ok but didn't really reach up to standard.\\n\\n\r\n\u22c6Art- 8\u22c6\\n\\n\r\nThis part doesn't really need to be explained considering the modernised art style of the season was good but not the best of course so it gets a solid 8.\\n\\n\r\n\u22c6Sound- 7\u22c6\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia doesn't disappoint in its osts including the Op and Ed which were good but the repetitive tracks that are being used are why it gets a 7. It would've been best if it's sound was diversified.\\n\\n\r\n\u22c6Characters- 3\u22c6\\n\\n\r\nI know you guys would be screaming at me for saying this was probably the best part, but for me, this was the worst. An anime basing off 2-3 characters and saying that the rest of the characters are practically meme material is not what I'd consider the best characters. Bakogou's development was the main focus of this season and honestly considering the character he is from the 1st and 2nd season, I was surprised that this occurred and I feel like it'll get better later on. The main issue to BNHA is the characters mostly due to the lack of development. Midoriya is practically the most annoying MC I've ever seen because of how he's more of a crybaby towards things and that's what disappoints me a lot but the worst part is leaving out the majority of Class 1A, heck it's been 3 seasons and I don't know anything about the characters and they don't shine a lot and I got bored when they focused more on the MC's then the supports which makes this the worst anime for me in terms of its characters. It's generic, typical and boring at most points because of lack of screen time for the whole class (1B is seen a lot more and they get more attention TBH and I feel like they skipped they whole entire class for no reason.) I could go rant the whole time but I actually want to get to the end but you get the idea. Focusing on 2-3 characters doesn't justify why the whole part of character development is done well. You forgot the other characters and that's something most people tend to ignore.\\n\\n\r\n\u22c6Enjoyment- 4\u22c6\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend watching Boku No Hero Academia, well yes and no depending on how you like your Shounen animes but this was indeed the worst Shounen I've ever seen and I don't understand the amount of love it has besides the memes. I don't really have high hopes for the 4th Season because I feel like it'll do the same mistake and I'll still have the same perception of it but considering how the next arc is one of the bests (from most sources) it's a show to take into consideration of if you're starting to watch anime but if you're a full pledged weeb then this isn't the anime for you, it'll just bore you to death.\\n\\n\r\n\u22c6Overall- 3\u22c6 (Plot-wise, it's bad. The other factors doesn't contribute to the overall score)",

            "content": "After 12 episodes I can say this season is by far the worst. I thought the end of season two was the worst part but nah, it was only the tip of the iceberg phui. I dont want to spoiler at this point but to summarize it: the third seaon is almost one piece/fairy tail level. The first season started good, new, fresh and promising, but unfortunately, now it is getting annoying/boring.\r\nFor example, like how often the mc break his body parts. No one cares at this point. Sorry, one scene where the doc says, dont do it again boy or the next time yourarms are rip, is not enough.\\n\\n\r\nFor the love of god and anime what was this scene at the start, the swimming thing? Was that necessary? Does is help in any way. Imo no. \\n\\n\r\nBy far the forst scene was that one episode where they train in the forest. Blabla they have vacation but they have to do it with their class. A tycpical anime thing. ok. But was is necessary to animate the thing where the speaker tells everyones power and what he/she is training. For the love of god and anime was the money worth animating this 2-3min long thing for no reason.\\n\r\nAfter the 5th or 6th char I thought are they kidding me.\\n\\n\r\nSome ugly chars like the dude with engine in his legs, the thirsty mfer with balls on his head, or the stupid/annoying/brainless childhood friend from the mc or other chars that are no even thinking are at this point ok. The worst part of this show now are the fillers and some dump fights.\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler from here! First, the fight againt the muscle dude, that looks like bakus dad lol. What was he thinking. Ye ok, he was \"PLAYING\". Tells their plan, like does he ever stops to speak? No!\\n\r\nHe was ez winning but he wasnt paying attention so he lost. Yeah super good. Not. Btw \\n\r\nmidoriya broke his arm again.\\n\\n\r\nBut now the worst part of this season. The fight in episode 11-12. Now a super broken villian appeared and wipes everyone in a blink of an eye. Not even all might could do something in the beginning. The villian had a type air gun thing pushing him away. The villian could have ez kill all might. In the middle of the fight the villian said, now lets do serious or so, I thought he does a laser type air gun thing now or some crazy ability, but all we got is scrap arm. SCRAP ARM. Also now he has the idea to gettining closer to all might. WHY? This is like suicide. All might is the strongest in close range combat and what he does is cuddling, god I was so angry.\\n\\n\r\nBut it was all ok until they showed the stuff like his flame goes out. He has no power and stuff.\\n\r\nI thought they are doing you know. Making the show interesting. But now all might remebers, like the dude from seirei tsukai no world break and boom the most ridiculous fight ever. I am done. I was giving the show another chance from the end of season two thing. What took ten years but this is unbearable. I am done.\\n",

            "content": "I dropped MHA Season 3 midway so this'll just be my review up until that point. I don't plan on picking it up again.\r\nStory: 5/10. MHA brings up very interesting questions and themes but does nothing with them. The fast pace of the story is great for entertainment value, but it also causes the show to skim over its characters and themes. Certain arcs with potential are just glossed over in just 5-7 episodes, leaving us with forgettable moments and characters. \r\nThe pacing is also very inconsistent. Villain arcs are rather ok for the most part, but they're then usually followed up by a boringand long training arc that doesn't even flesh out the characters well. Even after 50 episodes, most of the characters are still the same one-dimensional brats they were in season 1, even the PROTAGONIST hasn't gone through any substantial development other than crying at his insecurities and then punching things really hard. \\n\\n\r\nWasted potential at its finest. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 9/10. Fantastic and consistent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10. It's amazing how people think MHA has a diverse and well-fleshed out cast; this cast is possibly one of the worst I've seen. Characterization in MHA means giving each character 1-2 generic personality traits and calling it a day; only 2-3 characters actually have some depth to them in the form of a backstory, but other than that most of the characters are bland.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the villains are absolute jokes. There is nothing remotely interesting or original about them, all they do is sit in a bar. Even one of the most hyped up antagonists was rather underwhelming during his big moment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  5/10. As I watched MHA, my perspective slowly went from \"Oh this is awesome!\" to \"...another training arc?\" to \"...what's the point of all of this?\" The animation is fluid and beautiful, fights are well done and the quirk power system is better balanced than most, but at the end of the day there is little to no growth in the characters and little to no development in the themes of the story. I eventually saw MHA as nothing more than eye-candy to be binged, and even then I ended up dropping it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10. Ok shounen, nothing outstanding but nothing abysmally bad. At the very least it's a fun watch, but something forgettable and overshadowed by shows that actually are ambitious in their storytelling and attempt to integrate their themes with the character development and plot progression.",

The last three episodes spoke for itself.\r\nStarting the show with a very weak start, most of the watchers have let their guard down only to be blown away by the superb-quality from the best episode so far in the series, which is fourth episode. Oh well, if you haven't catch up until the fourth episode, watch it immediately, and it will be the best thingyou will do all day. Shoutout to the Midoriya's voice-actor and especially Bones for making one of the best fighting-scene I've ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nThe important thing that should be mentioned is the mediocre Class B finally move-up from their comfort-zone to working-hard and slowly becoming a Hero they've always wanted to be. All characters have a great development equally, something that has always been missing in most of shonen-series. Almost all of the support-characters in shonen-series are usually overshadowed by the main characters, but Boku no Hero Academia change that perspective in spectacular way. The way of the story-writing feels a lot like Eiichiro Oda, a perfectionist who never wants to left a weakness in his story.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s still at 6th-episode, but Boku no Hero Academia already broke all of people's expectation.

            "content": "Have you ever liked an anime's characters so much you wished they got out of the dreadful story they are involved in?\r\nWell, BNHA is this case.\r\nWhy does a season 2 or a season 3 always get more praise than season 1? That's because people who already saw the awful plot already dropped the series and the only ones remaining are the ones who praise it a lot.\r\nBut why do i keep watching it even though i almost gave Season 1 a 5?  Well, because people told me Season 2 was a \"masterpiece\".  I decided to give it another chance and I was notdisappointed.  Midoriya's plot armor had disappeared for a time being and the anime focused on other great characters (such as Todoroki and Ochako).  \\n\\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I decided to give Season 3 a go.  Season 3 is the worst season of BNHA, and it's not hard to know why (spoilers ahead):\\n\\n\r\n1) Plot armor.  Midoriya once again defeats a strong enemy (who nobody cares for btw) using an asspull power-up.  All Might defeats the most powerful of all enemies by just talking and a Smash, ugh.\\n\\n\r\n2) Filler episodes.  They stretched the whole License Exam arc, one of the worst arcs out there. Playing dodgeball? Ugh.  Rescuing people? Ugh.  The worst of all filler episodes was the mystery episode.  Midoriya solved the case just himself, which takes me to the other point:\\n\\n\r\n3) Midoriya.  He is becoming the Kirito of BNHA.  He solves cases, always saves his classmates, girls love him, boys praise him.  even the teachers always speak about him \"he's the heart of the team\".  And what even bothers me most, is that Midoriya can't stop crying.  He has to cry 2 times each episode.  It doesn't feel emotional at all, it feels horribly forced.  When Bakugo cried, it felt real.  Midoriya is just crying and crying for everything.  He is the worst character in this series.\\n\\n\r\n4)Arcs and villians.  Have you noticed how we are moving in a full circle? That's because this story is not going anywhere.  We get a \"training arc\", then an \"exam arc\", then the villians appear out of nowhere with no special reason and we get the \"Villian team arc\".  Then, a bad guy (nobu, stain, All for one) appears and the pro heroes have to defeat him with the help of the students.  Then we go to the starting line.  I don't think that after 50+ episodes, some students have only figured this much of how to use their quirks.  For example, the acid girl now just uses her hands to shoot at larger distances.  Midoriya only figured that he has legs, Bakugo now shoots an explosive beam.  We are going nowhere if you think they are progressing.\\n\\n\\n\r\n5)Filler characters.  Each 2-3 episodes, we are introduced to great new characters. These characters are designed perfectly.  They are great, i am not kidding.  The guy who can manipulate his skin? Great! The gale guy? Amazing!  What's the problem?  They are only introduced with the sole purpose of giving one fight and never ever appearing again.  They even introduce us \"The Great Three\"; i am sure they will get disposed once this arc ends. \\n\r\n---------------\\n\\n\r\nBut not everything is bad about BNHA, I mean, i love its characters (except mineta, the tail guy and the sugar guy).  The animation is superb, the fights are amazing too.  The music is meh.  But I am seriously considering to stop watching this after too many Deku-focused episodes, too many filler and it's horrible writing.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I have been told \"Overhaul\" arc is super dark and i cannot miss it.  Maybe I can give S4 a go, but if it dissappoints me, I can assure you I won't hestitate in dropping this series.",

            "content": "This is a review for overall BNHA although a little bit focus on season 3\r\nBNHA is a Shounen series where superpowers , hardwork , talent , good vs bad and society are involved , and it is inspired from western superheroes as its base design.\r\nShounen done right, nuff said. the pacing is on point while not neglect the comedy / slice of life moment of Shounen series completely. might be a little bias , but I love Shounen but hate how Fillerto , Filler Tail destroyed it, where they could bother to create a brand new 1 cour arc and it was for nothing, noteven character development that matter to the plot , and this is not the case with BNHA.\\n\\n\r\nalmost every episode introduce something new , either plot advancement , new result , new progress or some slice of life moment (not that much , maybe 1 episode worth). did you hate how sasuke cry about his brother complex until the end of Naruto and doesn't even get a bit of progression? fear not. BNHA also introduce that kind of character but actually gives progression in just 3 - 4 episode.no prolonged issue that just slog the series.\\n\\n\r\nin Season 3 , they introduce new arc. it's your \"mini-faction war arc\" that always present in the Shounen. think like chasing sasuke arc. they introduce the villain early , and they start clashing since episode 4. most of the character has their own fight and it was packed greatly so you didn't exhaust yourself like other series that use 2 episodes to talk , 2 episodes to fight, 1 episode for flashback and 1 episode for conclusion. The Arc seems flow naturally , this happened and then the other thing happened, and they are connected briefly and within the timeline. they keep me excited for every episode because the plot keep moving as the episodes goes.\\n\\n\r\nIn short , if you love Shounen with superpower , protagonist that tried to be better , school, friendship ,  rival , and Shounen drama but hate filler from Naruto / Fairy Tail  then this series is for you.",

The 1st season was very well thought out and very enjoyable to watch, the 2nd season was mostly focused on the sports festival which many people did not enjoy. I personally thought that the 2nd season was pretty cool since there was so many action to it and many awesome fights. Now that we are on the 3rd season I think the story has evolved and gotten more intense,  there are many fightsthat have happened that have gotten fans excited for more episodes to come, especially people who have read the manga. This anime is so good that people who have read the manga are still very excited to watch the series come together, which I get some anime people are still excited, but it doesn't happen very often. This 3rd season I can tell is going to be one of my favorites as midoriya gets stronger, so does the fan base and the fight scenes as well.",

            "content": "While the show has some some potentially good things, these are not part of the story. The show is generic to the bones, the actual plot is a straight copy of any superhero/superpower show, but for some reason, for people this show is the pioneer of that subject. Almost every quirk is boring, and the actual interesting characters have them. The show started great on season 1, with good guide and direction. The soundtrack was amazing, and the animation was ok. But everything went down from that point, season 2 and season 3 came out and the good animation went somewhere else, they had alot of mistakes during scenes and apparently giving hype to a static scene is a good thing (It is to be honest, but in this case, it is a bit too much). Apparently starting with heavy fanservice was a good move. At least they kept the good sound engineering. The whole plot keeps being all over the place, with the introduction of characters that probably won't ever appear. \\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, in this show, prioritizing bad fights with the main characters is a good thing, because the most interesting fights and characters barely get any screen time (And they are few)\\n\r\nThe character development is confusing aswell. Everyone seems to be progressing a lot with their quirks and personalities, but Midoriya doesn't seem to be doing so well, while he has a strong will and all that kind of stuff, he barely gets any development and his actual story is nowhere. They focuse too much on Bakugo/Todoroki, leaving behind a potentially excelent main character. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good for the most part, but like i said, the animation is really dull. The direction is going, it's just like any other shounen out there. The character design feels empty, with only a few characters being interesting enough to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening/ending combo has always been my favorite part, season 2 to be honest my favorites (Both arcs), this season though, the music just feels... there? It's like its just there but it doesn't stand out from the other 3 openings/eds. The background music is also a strong point, building hype for each scene. Same could be said about voice acting, and sound engineering in general, its all in the right place, with fantastical voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say i enjoyed this, hence why i dropped it. Season 2 was horrible and this started with the left foot. Not my thing, please refrain from calling me a troll, if you are gonna report me, do it for something valid and not your \"you didn't like it, therefore i don't like you\".",

This anime is about struggle of midoriya kun to became no 1 hero and continuation of season 1 and 2. Base Story is outdated but presentation of story is amanzing. Thats the main reason for success of this anime. \r\n>Why you liked?\r\n This show relates to everyone who is watching. You feel the pressure, stress, joy through out whole episode. The momentum creators maintain in season 1 and 2are still continue. Story telling scheme is perfect. Story have potential to expend further. Protagonist is keep developing through out seasons as well as viewer's interest. Animators and story writers do impressive job thats why series is so good to watch. Music is good.\\n\\n\r\n>why you disliked?\\n\r\nThere is no good reasons to hate this anime. One thing is that main villains should have there own story to tell. They should be have a chance to prove how they are on right side in thier own mind. Sound and intros are not good of this seasons compare to forst two seasons. \\n\\n\r\n>conclusion \\n\r\nI give this series an Overall rating of 9.5 and this perticular season is 9. This show is most recommended by me. Story is fun and way of presentation is very impressive. Sound/music can be better for this season.\\n\\n\r\n>personal points\\n\r\nDedicate some episodes to villains also, where they show how they are like this? Whats there point of view? . Why they want to kill heroes?\\n\r\nCreate a mixutre of villian and hero or antivillain/hero will be good to watch.",

It does everything right and is an example for other Shounen series out there. That is why it gets a solid 8 for me.\r\nStory: 8 \r\nArt: The art style of MHA is really unique and it gets it justice because studio Bones is doing anamazing job adapting the source material. The fluid, natural fight scenes are so well done and are eye candy. For a tv anime it is up there  for best animation. The only problem I have is with the animated version of Shigaraki Tomura, in the manga he comes over as a more sinister character imo.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: I like the general OST and the voice acting is great just like season 1 and 2. The opening is good (not my favorite tho) and the ending is alright. They also added some new songs which I am very happy with. All by all it is good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in MHA are amazing, they are what got me invested in the show. The broad cast of characters, that are all amazing in their own suit and of course do we like the main group. They are all so likeable and especially Deku because he is a relatable character because he was a normal kid in the beginning (technically he wasn't normal because he didn't have a quirk but that isn't the point) that wanted to be a hero, he looked up to someone and that is something that  we all do. We strife to be like our ideal hero and that is what i like about MHA characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: I enjoyed season 1 quite a bit, I loved season 2 and I am currently really liking season 3. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 9\\n\r\n(like said above this review is subject to change as more episodes air)",

            "content": "\"I want to win like All Might. No matter what anyone says, that will never change!\" - Katsuki Bakugou\r\nWhat does it mean to be a \"hero\"? Is it someone who saves those in need? Someone who defeats all the bad guys? Someone who brings good things to the lives of others? All of these? Or maybe something entirely different? Maybe it's all a case of perspective. But what does it mean to be \"the Greatest Hero\"?\r\n---Boku no Hero Academia 3rd Season---\r\nStory: (9) - Art: (9) - Sound: (9.5) - Character: (10) - Enjoyment: (10)\r\nIntroduction: In July of 2014 a new series appeared on the pagesof Weekly Shounen Jump titled \"Boku no Hero Academia\" (Eng: My Hero Academia). A story about superheroes authored by mangaka Kouhei Horikoshi, it quickly rose in popularity and received an anime adaptation less than two years later in April 2016, animated by Studio Bones (FMA, Soul Eater, Noragami). Created in the middle of the western superhero age of media, it's no wonder that it also became a popular series in the West. As it stands currently, the third Season of BnHA is the most popular anime of 2018 on MAL. The following are my very personal and biased thoughts on this entry in the series.\\n\\n\r\n\"Next, it's your turn.\" - Toshinori Yagi\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the events of the 2nd Season, the students of Class 1-A are on their Summer vacation after taking their finals. What starts as a fairly standard Summer break quickly escalates into the most dangerous situation the students of U.A have been a part of yet. The events of the first half of this Season have consequences of utmost importance to the world and characters of the series. Not only Horikoshi introduces unique new villains in the story, but also keeps building on its concepts of heroism and villainy by making the series' protagonists and antagonists clash with fists and ideals. The fast pace of the Second Season is also present here, which keeps the action engaging up until the climax of the arc.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second half, things slow down substantially, and the story takes a backseat in favor of character building, but the writing is consistently good all the way through. Even though the show is light-hearted and comedic for most of the time, its humor doesn't ever get in the way of the narrative when portraying darker and more serious situations. It should be mentioned that, as with the previous Season, this one does contain filler. Episodes 1 (39) and 20 (58) are original stories not written by the original creator, and episode 17 (55) is mostly comprised of an original scenario. While not entirely bad, these episodes don't really have the amount of consistency and quality in its writing that comes from Horikoshi's.\\n\\n\r\nHeroAca's take on the hero society is still just as interesting as before, and with every arc Horikoshi develops its world-building even further. Though the series starts with a pretty cliche outlook of Heroes vs. Villains , with every passing episode the shades of gray become clearer and clearer. We get to see how the existence of quirks and heroes affected the masses, and made the villains do the things they have. What looked like an exciting prospect at first starts to rear its ugly head.\\n\\n\r\n\"The image of victory I have inside of me is you.\" - Izuku Midoriya\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nAs it is common with Studio Bones' productions, BnHA has consistently good animation, but you could say that the animation and art in this Season weren't *as* consistent as in the previous Season. This is due to the team behind the anime having been split up for most of the Season's production, with many of the staff's finest animators and storyboarders working on the movie that was released in August of this year. Still, the Bones' staff gave it their very best, and really made the anime look amazing when it counted.\\n\\n\r\n\"I wanted to try saying it just once! Plus Ultra!\" - Inasa Yoarashi\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe OST in HeroAca is an integral part of the action. It manages to convey the excitement and feelings that the characters are having. The new tracks composed once again by Yuki Hayashi are all delightful. The atmosphere that they create is nothing short of incredible. Though I will say that some of the older, more iconic tracks from previous seasons are kind of underutilized, and the placement of some tracks is questionable.\\n\\n\r\nThe actors' performances this Season are even better than in previous ones, if you can imagine. The old voices are very comfortable with their characters at this point, and the new voices fit their characters perfectly. A notable actor this season is Nobuhiko Okamoto, the voice of Bakugou. His performance elevates his character throughout the whole season, something that is incredible to see (and hear).\\n\\n\r\n\"No matter how much I beat you up, you were always stuck to my back like glue...!\" - Katsuki Bakugou\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where Horikoshi excels at. He manages to juggle his cast of 20+ recurring characters all with different personalities (some more developed than others) and are constantly sharing screentime, without making the narrative feel bogged down with too many faces. The dynamics that are set up between characters are ingenious, and dialogue can be hilarious or chilling. The new characters are all unique in personality and quirk, and all of them serve a purpose in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Izuku \"Deku\" Midoriya, continues on his long journey to become the greatest hero ever, and he goes through substantial development this season. But I'd argue S3 belongs to the deuteragonist, Katsuki Bakugou.\\n\\n\r\nBakugou has the most character progression in the story (although at first glance it may seem like he's one-note). He is ever-changing and complex, and understanding his complicated feelings and relationship with Deku is crucial to the enjoyment of HeroAca's emotional substance. Their interactions are the crux of this season's story (and arguably the entire series). They're two halves of the same coin, and this season shows them what they both need to do in order to become the heroes that they aspire to be. Being two different types of people (and future heroes), but complementing each other perfectly: the Symbol of Hope and the Image of Victory.\\n\\n\r\nHeroAca's themes of Legacy and its focus on the adventures of characters who are trying to live up to the previous generations' expectations and surpass them is very inspiring. It's a Next Generation story that doesn't completely show you what came before, and we get to see the struggles of the adults that protect the children who are training to take their place.\\n\\n\r\n\"Let's all work together and laugh together again!\" - Ochako Uraraka\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIt should be clear by now that I enjoy BnHA immensely. I admit I am biased towards it, but it has had a very meaningful presence in my life. To me, all of its aspects combined just make up a very good show. I'm someone who grew up watching superhero films, Spider-Man (2002) and Spider-Man 2 (2004) were my favorite movies back when I was 5/6 years old. Watching BnHA reminds me a lot of my childhood, and I love it for it. Experiencing it has actually improved my mental health, and that's something I can't ever repay. It has made me laugh, cry, and feel. And honestly, that's enough.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: It's great, watch it.",

Wrong again. All these parts can be secondary, but one thing just must be good. And it's the villains. The protaganists are boring by nature: they're either good and want to play by the rules, good, but don't want toplay by the rules, or, if the show's wrinting is a bit better than average, some of them are morally gray. And that's it. If a character is described as being a hero, he must follow these 3 categories. Villians, however, come in different forms and shapes. While the counterparts of the 2 hero archetypes are certenaly popular, there are much much more variations to them. But all that talk about villians is not even the main point. They can be interesting, or they can be shallow, but one thing they can never be. \\n\r\nWEAK. And that is what MHA villians are. Frankly, they're pathetic. Never once a threat to begin with, and now they're even weaker, to the point where the show itself refrains from even showing them in favor of the main cast just, you know, living their lives. The villians don't even look that bad design-wise, and from what we've seen they could've been interesting characters, or not. But I doubt they'll ever be scary. As of now, any single one of them can get their ass whooped by a high-schooler, essentially making them a laughing stock. The only ones who could pose any sort of threat (and not even big threat mind you) are currently out of comission. It feels at times as if the mangaka has written himself to a corner, where the main cast is already overpowered at the start of the story. The media always teaches us to root for the underdog, so I'm rooting for the bad guys. \\n\r\nAnd that's already the bad outlook for the show. Sure, the Batman villians have more fans than the hero himself, but for a diffirent reason: charisma. Here, I'm rooting for the villians because they're weak and because the protagonists are arrogant. This brings us to the next section \\n\\n\r\nSTORY AND CHARACTERS \\n\\n\r\nI've combined these two into one, because there's not much to talk about in terms of the story, and I don't mind. This being a shounen and all, my expectations were low and they're pretty much met. So the world is now a superhero society with 80% of the populus having some sort of a superpower, or as they call it a \"Quirk\". The MC didn't have one, but now he has it and with that newfound power he aims to be the best hero ever. And to reach that goal he... just enrolled in a hero academy. That's all there is to this story and as I said before, I didn't expect anything more. The characters are much more important. \\n\r\nThe characters might all be just repackaged archetypes from the previous shounen series for all I care, as long as they've been done properly. And like many things in MHA, this here is a hit or miss. \\n\r\nDeku -- the MC of the story and as it often is its most boring character. He wanted to be a hero really bad, but in this kind of society it's kind of no big deal. So even his most prominent motivation feels unimportant. His biggest character trait is his constant fanboyism over the greatest hero, All-Might. And everyone loves that one, so once again, even in the setting presented, Deku doesn't stand out. He's also said to be smart, but that's thrown out of the window as soon as the writer desires. But maybe other characters are better? \\n\r\nBakugo -- he's my least favorite character here, or anywhere, probably. He's always angry, always an asshole to anyone and always shouting for no reason. It feels like they've cut him from AoT and pasted right here for no reason. And no, before you ask, his personality is NOT a foil or a facade, becuase we've seen his entire backstory in flashbacks. He was always a douchebag with no redeeming qualities. Why is this a problem, you ask? Well even if his story arc is him becoming a better person (which at that point it better be), he can only become an average character. Not good, not even decent. His very ceiling as a character is average. \\n\r\nOh, and he embodies another problem I see with the show, questionable messages. Bakugo is an asshole bully, who everyone calls a Deku's friend, even though AT NO POINT in the story, the two acted like anyone but enemies. No teacher thought to himself \"hey, this guy bullies one of the students, maybe we shouldn't put them in the same class at least?\". No, they all laugh it off. And honestly, can you see anyone like him making any friends? I could, even the writers would show it to me. But nope, we're just told that him and the other character are now \"friends\". And that's not even the end of it. Instead of stopping trying to reason with this obviously abusive guy, Deku makes extra sure to try again and again, while also hurting Bakugo's fragile self esteem. Deku knows the consiquences, yet he does it anyway. It's stupid, no sane person would do that, and honestly, it smells of Stockholm Syndrome to me. So what's the message here? Having this syndrome is a good thing? But I digress, since there's a lot of characters to cover. Too many, in fact. \\n\r\nAll Might -- the strongest, most overpowered hero, also known as a symbol of peace. That's the only section including SPOILERS FOR THE 3RD SEASON UP TO EP 15 so you've been warned. I always thought he was gonna get killed off for dramatic effect and to rise the stakes, and to affect Deku's character growth. It was an obvious, but effective choice. Exept, they never do that. Even with everyone learning about his true form, he still beat the big bad, and he's still alive to babysit the MC. And with that the only possible dramatic tension is now gone. \\n\r\nEND OF SPOILERS\\n\r\nTodoroki -- the best character. Even the MC said it himself, he should've been the protagonist. Even if he's still kinda generic, he's got a decent backstory, and also character flaws. The latter is a rare sight in this show, so he can't help but stand out. That's all fine and good, but he embodies yet another questionable message of the show. Well, not he himself, but his father instead. It's revealed in the season 2, that his father is a domestic abuser, yet the show never calls it out. Todoroki hates him, of course, but the rest of the show never does anything with it, Endeavor is the same \"hero\" as everyone else. I can't tell if it's intentional or not yet, so I won't comment on it any further. \\n\r\nIida -- an upstanding class rep of the class 1-a. He's got a decent enough motivation in season 2, but I won't spend my time talking about him, since he just isn't interesting enough to me. The same can be said to the rest of the cast, so here's a quickfire review of some of them: \\n\r\nUroraka -- a generic love interest with a usless quirk. Had something going for her at the start of the season one, but now does absolutely nothing. \\n\r\nTokoyami --  even though he has a problem controlling his power, no actual flaws in his character can be found\\n\r\nAsui -- the frog girl. Once again, flawless as a character. \\n\r\nMineta -- being a total degenerate and a creep is okay, as long as you're on a winning side. My second least favorite character. \\n\r\nYaoyorozu -- has confidence problems that are never given much attention. Still a decent character. \\n\r\nShigaraki Tomura -- does nothing\\n\r\nKurogiri -- also uselss with a weakness obvious even to school kids. \\n\r\nDobi -- looks the coolest out of the entire cast, but does nothing. \\n\r\nEveryone else -- I don't even remember them. \\n\\n\r\nPRODUCTION \\n\\n\r\nI don't really care about the animation, but in case you're wondering, it's Bones, you know the drill. The fights are flashy, the colors -- vibrant. Class room scenes look like shit though. \\n\r\nMusic -- produced by Porno Grafitti, the openings are really good. I don't remember any other tracks from the show.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nSo why am I writing a preliminary review? I truly don't think anything about MHA will change. People seem to be enjoying it, so the writers never feel compelled to lift the status-quo. And they don't need to.\\n\r\nOverall, this is sadly turning out to be just another shounen, if not worse than the rest of the competition. MHA really needs to make its villians more of a threat, or at least make some new ones, if it can't even manage that much. So far the stakes are non-existent and the anime feels more like a superhero-themed Slice Of Life than anything else.",

            "content": "My Hero Academia\u2019s third season is quite an outstanding product. From vigorous animation to a captivating plot, Bones has done a careful job on this anime adaption.\r\nThe series continues immediately from the plot of where the second season wrapped up in September 2017. Episode 1 is unnecessary filler, but enjoyable for the character interaction and recap of the previous two seasons being handled profesionally. Immediately, we start with the Forest Training Camp Arc, introducing the League of Villains and the advancement of Class 1-A. Even some of Class 1-B advances, introducing new dilemmas for the characters. Every character has been fleshed out much as necessaryfor the plot to advance in a new point. Arcs are covered quite fast and paced well because of how much content is being adapted.\\n\r\nThis season has received a step up in animation and has absolutely gorgeous effects. Smoke, flames are animated vigorously and even the most simple character actions are filled with constant motion. The background, characters and effects are all colored and capture the \u201ccomic\u201d style of My Hero Academia properly. My Hero Academia has always brewed inspiration from superhero comics, within the characters and world, but the art is absolutely no exception to how good it clashes.\\n\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia 3rd Season\u2019s music is climatic and usually suits emotion of the majority moments. The voice acting in Japanese is incredibly fitting and captures character motives and emotion masterfully. While I have always enjoyed the English dub by Funimation, I must say it isn\u2019t nearly as good as the original Japanese audio, especially this time around. For example, Toga\u2019s voice actor in English, Leah Clark, doesn\u2019t quite capture the character\u2019s personality, and Justin Briner also does not capture the emotion that the Japanese voice actor presents. Yamashita Daiki, Deku\u2019s voice actor in Japanese, had my heart filled with inspiration from his presentation. While Justin Briner does portray a great English voice for Deku, he didn\u2019t quite capture the emotion that Yamashita did in Japanese. The characters in English just aren\u2019t as motivating as in Japanese. Opening song 4 (Odd Future by UVERworld) suits the emotion that is happening in the two arcs of the season\u2019s first cour, and meticulously animated.\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia 3rd Season is pushing the characters to their greater limits. The motivations behind each character and their actions will always introduce exciting plotlines and mostly introduces what is necessary for each character to be fleshed out and develop within the plot. Even the background characters and League of Villains seem to have this quality.\\n\r\nFrom everything about the pacing, character motives, sound and plot brought together is what keeps the anime enjoyable and not in a state of total boredom. Character development is constantly happening, even though some characters take quite some time to be in the spotlight. The risks, motivations and actions of each character are only giving advances to the plot left and right, fueling the total enjoyment of My Hero Academia. The action is animated with very much motion, but sometimes the music falls flat when trying to match, such as Deku powering back up from the ground in a certain fight scene. The background environments are drawn nicely but sometimes clashes weirdly with characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, My Hero Academia is a phenomenal series with intriguing characters, motivations and plot that brings the characters together in various interesting ways. This season is truly a step up from the previous, introducing more interesting characters, great art, phenomenal voice acting, brilliant new stories, and overall, an amazing anime. It is My Hero Academia, a show worth appreciating for it\u2019s simplicities and complexities both. Studio Bones really put a lot of effort into this season, and if you have enjoyed the previous two seasons, this one is more than likely right for you as well.",

            "content": "My Hero Academia has done something that sets it apart from all other anime in the Shonen arena. The episodes excel in every category. It is written well in that there are good reasons provided for why characters act the way they do. Fight episodes contain engaging animations as well as purposeful dialog. The animation style itself is also enjoyable. They take advantage of crisper animations while retaining the anime feel. \r\nMy one concern is that the writers made the My Hero Academia universe large enough to keep the series going for years to come! Right now it seems pretty focused on one main villain(and I don't expect it will be a show like Bleach that will open up entirely new words that come out of no-where to add seasons worth of content). I hope the show doesn't end when the known villains are taken out.\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoy this show, it's definitely worth a watch. It has fun and compelling characters, and interesting narrative, and can even get really intense, at times. There are also a good amount of cute and funny moments to give a breather from serious topics, so it's definitely not a depressing anime. I'd compare it to Steven Universe in its coming-of-age+magical powers story along with One Punch Man's themes and the like moods that either show bring to the table, portrayed through a shonen anime style. With great animation quality and excellent pacing, this show has quickly made itself one of my top favorite shows that's currently airing. It might not be for everyone, but I urge you to give it a chance.",

            "content": "Damn\r\nThat's one way to describe Boko No Hero Academia and just how amazing this show is. The show is another Shonen show in a unique world that is introduced to us in such beautiful way. The characters are good and the  their reasons are good as well. The show has been good last 2 seasons and is seeming to catch up to itself in the newer episodes of this season.  The season started out rough but came back with a Detroit Smash and there is some awesome reasons for that\r\n1st and most important ENJOYMENT:\r\nIf you can't enjoy a anime no matter how amazingthe art, sound, characters, and setting it ain't worth mentioning it. Boku No Hero Academia(BNHA for short) just kills with the enjoyment factor. I can see why we love Shonen stories so much and why they are so popular in the anime world. The anime's we have seen on our Saturday cartoons or otherwise have probably been a Shonen for the most of us. Why? Because we love heroes and who doesn't they just are so fun to watch. This show plays on this in the most direct way in a society of heroes, where a group of kids are trying their best to enter the society to defeat crime and stop any chance for evil or corruption to over take their Hero Society. The kids have things behind them and things ahead of them that they want to accomplish and fix. The enjoyment you get from seeing characters go all the way out to get to there goal and be brought down and try to get up and just being a hero is just a joy you gotta love.\\n\\n\r\n2.Story\\n\r\nI kinda explained that but this season specially and if you haven't watched the  show technically\\n\r\n\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1 {!!!!!

Stain becomes a pathway for villains ether just looking for an organization or agreeing with Stain point of View that All Might is the only real hero. The season story starts of kinda eeeeh... Its pretty much a filler before they go to the camp with little to no story development (its not a slice of life or Gintama thats episodic as hell). Then they come back with a curve ball and take your All Might away. It moves to a more tense environment and  allows you to get to know more about class B and their characters but also lets you see where some of the class  A characters got better and how they have matured more. Yes I saw some reviews say the story hasn't developed and this season is not moving forward, but I have to disagree as it allowed Tomura's promise at end of happy season 2 end on a dark note.\\n\r\nNot only that is allowed for the League of Villains to change the direction everyone had planned for themselves. It really getting tense.\\n\\n\r\nOkay enough of that 3rd Characters\\n\r\nThe characters have not in these first 8 episodes changed dramatically and nobody is expecting that, because if they did then this isn't the same show and is a fake. Starting with class B we are introduced to a host of characters and seen that they are not just others, but are characters who are willing to put down their lives for people and are just like the heroes from class A. They come out not in a deep fashion but enough for us to understand that they are who they are and that there is a lot more to know about them. Other then that the pussycats don't really have deep development but it makes senses because their position, but they still are important to the story and the kids. We can see how Aizawa sensai is still human, but also why he is a pro-teacher at UA and  a hero. We see grape head is still scared and not sure about his quirk and how Momo has become less cowardly and can think on her feet. Deku feels losing someone he could save and at the same time trying to show what a hero is to a kid and becoming more of a man then a child. Also we see the hero side of Kacchan (and if you haven't go to the season you gotta see) \"Dont come deku\". Tokoyami and dark shadow not much but there is some development. There is a hint to almost all the characters in class A moving forward or changing because of the run in with villains and the various experiences each had. Though its too early to tell how much they really have developed because there still is 16 episodes this season. \\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\r\nGood as always and lots of effort put into many scenes though action scenes seem to take most of the budget which is fine with me \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Yup \ud83d\udc4c\\n\\n\r\nover all 9/10 because of the wacky start but its \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c and \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\\n\\n",

With its 3rd season now over, is BNHA (a.k.a. Naruto meets MCU meets Harry Potter), living up to its plus-ultra hype? Briefly, this season at least, not so much. It is with no question a step back from the great previous season, but not to the point that we should raise the alarms and lose hope on it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot and story development:\\n\\n\\n\r\nFirst season introduced us the world and characters. Deku inherits a quirk from his idol All Might and is accepted at UA, the most prestigious hero school in Japan. The second -along with Deku- developed some side-characters within a fascinating tournament arc; the same within a dark, serious villain arc; it showed us Deku training to control his quirk in Master Yoda-trains-Luke fashion; it gave us more school classes and exams here and there to understand the meaning of being a hero, and set the stage for a future clash among our heroes and gathering villains. Now the third one is still more or less doing the same as the second, but things are starting to get somewhat messy. \\n\\n\r\nContrary to S2, the important arc came first and the not-so-important arc came after. Not a very smart move to build tension I\u2019d say. And the quality contrast this time was sharp. The first one was so great that it made the second pale in comparison. If BNHA was a straight long-runner this wouldn\u2019t have felt much a problem, because the \u201cmeh\u201d arc would have been \u201csandwiched\u201d by another more substantial one working as the other side of the bread. \\n\\n\r\nThe show starts weak with a recap + unnecessary fanservice-ish episode to remember the audience what has been shown so far and where are we standing that could just have been a separate special rather than part of the series. I don\u2019t really think the intention was to showcase the swimming skills of our male cast honestly, but who cares, it\u2019s just one episode and that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t crucify FMAB for having a recap episode right in the middle of the show. If you didn\u2019t mind that, I see no reason why you should mind now. Also no episode aside the special ones is useless. No episode feels disposable. Even the dorms episode provided a lot of fun showing our cast making a best-decorated room contest and having fun doing that.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc, the forest camp training arc, showcases our students training to enhance their quirks and the League of Villains interrupting these school activities once again, this time to scare the class, make them feel unsafe in this dangerous world they truly live in, and to kidnap Bakugou to make him one of theirs. \\n\\n\r\nThis arc was just fantastic. Probably the most immersive experience I\u2019ve had with the series so far. Sense of danger was real and it was interesting to see how the kids came up with clever ways to escape safe from the threat putting into practice all they\u2019ve learnt and developing teamwork. And it was interesting to see how the differences in the meaning of being not only a hero -but also a human being- among all the members of the class clashed each other when they were facing a complex situation like the kidnapping of one of them when knowing where they could find him and rescue him, in a world where making use of quirks non being a professional is a considered a crime. Who is the real hero, the one who chooses to follow the rules doing nothing while knowing he could do something?  Or the one that thinks for himself in order to do what he considers the right thing for someone in need?\\n\\n\r\nIt also gave Deku an opportunity to wow the audience in an epic and emotionally intense fight against a strong villain. While it\u2019s true that the circumstances surrounding this fight seemed rather forced (the Kouta kid was just a tool-character; it was just put in the narrative to make a one-time impact in the main character and to give him a chance to shine) and you could arguably say that Deku won with a dumb asspull (does anyone know where that additional 999.900% came from?), it was still a good moment to show Deku\u2019s hero virtues and quirk-control progression.  Asspull or not, I didn\u2019t care much. At this point, one asspull more, one asspull less, is not going to make any difference in the shounen realm. And you can still say that he managed this because he was been training a hell lot. This was still an inspirational and exciting moment that meant a lot to the protagonist and that\u2019s all that matters.\\n\\n\r\nIt was also the arc where we could finally see some real participation from Class B and to know more about them and how they have taken the critical events regarding UA so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion of the arc; the fight between All Might and AFO, it was both great and underwhelming at the same time. Great because it was a killer moment where All Might makes his last act in society as a hero and says goodbye to his hero career, with the whole citizenship still cheering for him to save them once again even after discovering his true physical aspect, teaching everyone that you don\u2019t need to be super muscled and have an imposing figure to be a hero. Along Bakugou\u2019s rescue by his friends, the absolute highlight of the season. \\n\\n\r\nBut at the same time, it felt underwhelming, because it was just too short and because it quickly killed all the intrigue surrounding the big boss coming from S2. He is defeated in a single episode in the middle of the season and all its big attention is quickly lost when it is followed by an arc that wants us to forget everything about it for a while.  However, it wasn\u2019t really much of a trouble when the great part of it closed the arc in such an emotionally intense way.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc, the provisional licenses exam arc, was more less the same tournament arc in S2 just with more schools now. This was an exam that- if passed \u2013 it would give our students permission to work as heroes without the supervision of a professional hero. Of course, everyone was going to pass, even the ones that didn\u2019t! Because in case you failed, you could still assist to an extracurricular course to receive training and get the license anyway, so there was never a true stake here, which kind of ruined the whole purpose of the exam.\\n\\n\r\nThis second arc was somewhat boring and felt longer than it needed to be. It threw away all the tension built in the first one. It felt underwhelming to see such a dull arc that we had already seen before right after the most compelling first one. Dragon Ball also had tournament arcs for relief in between tension-packed arcs. It worked well because they were breaks inside a bigger story. This time, this arc is the big story. In a 25 episode show, 12 of them are half. In a 100 episode show, it\u2019s only an eighth. These are other of the downsides of the seasonal approach. Weak arcs feel more dragging than what they actually are when you see the big picture of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI think it would have been much better if the provisional license exam arc would have come first and the forest camp arc (clearly more interesting and relevant) -finishing with Bakugou\u2019s rescue and the confrontation between All Might and AFO- would have come after. Narratively speaking it would have worked much better. Tension would have gone upwards rather than downwards throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, while boring, that didn\u2019t mean it was useless. It still did a good job when it comes to the main thread of the show: heroes in training and their personal growth in their path to become them and understand its meaning. Each arc has served this purpose; there is none that feels useless or disposable.  Each one so far has been useful to make them grow, to overcome their fears, their weaknesses, and to understand and think by themselves what makes someone a true hero regardless of what society tells them to think. I think every single arc so far has done a good job in regard to this, and this one was no exception.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, school segments are still enjoyable. They allow showing characters in their daily lives and routines when they are not involved in a dangerous fight, which this gives more life and naturalism to the show. They make them more relatable. It makes things more diverse and fun to watch. I would really get tired fast if everything was confrontations and explosions the whole time. Some have complained that these school moments ruin tension. Well, this is a show about teens attending a school after all, so it\u2019s not like you shouldn\u2019t expect a lot of classes and training, the same way nobody ever complained about classes and Quidditch matches scenes that didn\u2019t have anything to do with Voldemort in Harry Potter. It can\u2019t be battles all the time. You need more realism. You need moments to have lighter fun.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, now that All Might is gone as the main hero there\u2019s an opportunity now for more interesting things to happen. All Might was the pillar of society that now has to put their faith in someone they have never liked that much. The League of Villains can also take advantage from this fact. There\u2019s a lot of potential in this situation that I hope can be leveraged somewhere in the coming seasons. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d say the biggest issue with characters is that the show is now simply introducing too many given the relative run. The cast was already too large to begin with and now they added even more with the other dudes from the other schools and some other secondary villains. We already had 20 students in Class A, 20 in B, like 5 teachers per class. The main and minor villans. More villains. A set of professional heroes. The families. Now the other schools\u2019 guys. And so on. This means\u2026there won\u2019t be much screen-time for everyone, good guys and bad guys. However, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s at least at the same time caring in not abandoning them. Other shounens just forget them in the middle, or simply choose to reduce many of the side-characters as part of the backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nYes, some of them will get more attention, but it\u2019s nothing that you can\u2019t expect from every traditional non-ensemble piece production. In every story there is a main character, secondary and tertiary ones. Nonetheless, I still feel the show manages to integrate all of them organically in the storyline. You see dialogues from everyone in the classroom or training or examination scenes. Nobody feels that is \u201cjust there\u201d meaning nothing to the show, even if they are only there for comic relief and joke moments like the purple balls small perverted dude (I still have to remember the names from everyone!). But at the end of the day, everyone will be contributing their tiny grain of sand to convey and enjoyable ride. \\n\\n\r\nYou can really tell BNHA is taking care of its large cast. The show is doing well in giving every one of its characters their fair time to shine, unlike others where only the main ones get the whole attention, despite knowing that some of them will play a more important role in the story. You can criticize the way BNHA is attempting to do this, that it may look forced within the arcs, but at least is doing so and that is always a welcome, and it isn\u2019t forgetting about 50% of its main cast for 50% of the whole damm show.\\n\\n\r\nThis has also helped in the thematic department giving more variety and perspectives in the discussion of the role and meaning of being a hero, the clear DNA of the show. Characters also learn from themselves and from the rest in their journey. Everyone has their own ways and motives, and it\u2019s rich to see how their views clash when faced to complex situations. It\u2019s interesting to see how the discussion around what a hero should do and what he should not in the midst of all these dangerous incidents and examinations makes all the characters have second thoughts on the matter.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d also like to point that shows like BNHA benefit from having and integrating a huge likable cast. There\u2019s a character for everyone to feel connected to or identified with. Watching how their relationships grow, how their personalities clash and how they have fun altogether is always a pleasure and delight to see.\\n\\n\r\nWhile every side-character was given a moment to shine, in varying degrees, this time it was really (and finally) Katsuki \u201cKacchan\u201d Bakugo\u2019s turn to progress in the story, the same way Todoroki and Tenya got their big moments in the previous season. His character finally stops from being just the hot-headed-but-adorable-dude running joke, is given some real fleshing and we finally get to see what he has to say and how he really feels about Deku\u2019s steady progress which he sees as a threat to his superiority.  He can\u2019t understand how this once quirkless and weak childhood \u201cfriend\u201d has been getting stronger and more skilled so fast in such a short time and why it was him the one who gained the admiration from All Might, the hero they both idolized, and not himself. And we finally see some true development of shounen\u2019s new emblematic rivalry where the two parts come to terms in the context of a fight. It\u2019s undoubtedly not only one of the highlight of the season, but the series as a whole, resembling past rivalry-clashes like Naruto-Sasuke in Naruto and Goku-Vegeta during the Buu arc in DBZ, given how long-awaited it was and all the emotion and intensity that it carried through. Bakugo for once reveals himself as an insecure and accepts that he can\u2019t have everything under his control and always win as he had always convinced himself he could do. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character that finally was given a minute to say some things in this season was no other than Deku\u2019s lovely mom. As of now, the show almost had relegated as \u201cjust the sweet and protective mommy\u201d stereotypical role, supporting his son in everything he wanted to achieve. Turns out that was not exactly the case. Turns out she was not so pleased with everything his son had to live through since he started attending UA and the way the school had been handling the critical and dangerous situations its students had to confront, from breaking his bones multiple times to facing a life-or-death threat from a villain assaulting the school activities, claiming that it would have been better for his son to have remained quirkless and admiring heroes from the outside, which made her relationship with his son more interesting. It was a nice, touching family moment where we could see how their relationship evolved to a new level and how Deku interiorizes in his quest to become a hero his own mother\u2019s feelings about it. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about quirkless, some argue that it would have been more interesting for the show that Deku had remained in his original state where he was an extraordinary boy (yes, because in a world where 80% of the population has a quirk, the 20% remaining are the extraordinary ones!), because that would have meant that he would have had to resort to other more interesting ways to prove people that he could also become a hero. UA could admit quirkless people after all, so it was never an impediment.  But as the boy had always firmly believed, being a hero is more than just having a superpower. And even people with superpowers can\u2019t qualify as such. There\u2019s more in a hero than just the special ability one has and how can one master it to put it to society\u2019s benefit. Heroes are defined by their attitudes, values, self-sacrificing spirit and morals, and not so much by the power they were born with. And he could still defend this idea even now that he does have a quirk that will grant him a great responsibility towards society, since society still is relying so much on professional quirksome heroes. He already did it when without a quirk he tried to save Bakugo from the mud villain in S1 even knowing the danger he was facing doing that, and is now doing it too with a quirk when he is willing to go as far as he can -even compromising his own body- to save a boy from being killed by a beastly and merciless human. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the fact that Deku already is a noble boy who displays these hero virtues since the beginning of his life -which makes All Might see him as his worthy successor- doesn\u2019t imply the character is rendered boring and there is no room for the character to grow on a personal level; now that he\u2019s inherited one-for-all and has accepted the \u201csymbol of peace\u201d torch from All Might, it will be interesting to see how he will deal with this great responsibility towards society , becoming the new number 1 hero everyone will rely on, that already is awaiting for him. Will he be able to bear all that charge in his shoulders? Besides, despite having a clear notion of what being a hero means, this is more about how he overcomes obstacles and learns from real life experiences in his path to be recognized by everyone as the greatest hero. What\u2019s going on for him is to know how he did this. That\u2019s the driver of the show. He already has the values, focus of the show it\u2019s in how he will put them into practice to achieve his goal.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVillains:\\n\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d say the real main problem of the series so far, which has been hinted since the beginning but now in this season became more evident, is that the villain side of the story is just all over the place and has been totally confusing. In this season you just don\u2019t know who to pay attention to anymore. In S1 you thought it was Shigaraki. In S2, nope, it is Stain\u2026 but he was captured within the same season, so it\u2019s not about him anymore, but rather about Shigaraki and this mysterious big boss that gives instructions from the shadows that All Might refers as AFO. Now in S3 is about Shigaraki again and this other villains that were inspired by Stain\u2019s cause to gather, but no, now it\u2019s about AFO which surprised everyone coming into the stage. But this biggest enemy of the show was defeated in an episode. That was all? So I guess he was not that big to begin with. So I guess Shigaraki again, who else? \\n\\n\r\nHowever, to an extent, I don\u2019t see this as something completely bad. This is not a world with only one villain; there are many of them. The good news is that this is a series and not a movie where a clear focus in one villain should be put because it\u2019s a single storyline. Spiderman 3 tried to innovate introducing multiple villains in its storyline and miserably failed because of the movie nature. But BNHA, being a series, doesn\u2019t run that risk. In fact, I like how it is trying to escape the \u201cone villain at the time\u201d mold, present in most shounens, this is no show where an enemy defines an arc, this is overarching and we still have a lot to see. All the show needs in regard to its villain side is just more\u2026order. I don\u2019t mind multiple villains at once, but I do mind that their presence should feel better structured and better integrated into the storyline, something in which the show just has to improve upon.\\n\\n\r\nTheir motivations have been also weak. When you think of a villain motive, you generally think of something like thirst of power, world domination, world destruction, having revenge for something someone else did them in their past, trying to make his worldview to prevail in a clash of ideologies with the main character, or simply \u2013as a famous superhero movie stated- \u201cto see the world burn\u201d. In sum, to obtain a personal benefit. But it seems like in this world, villains are bad because of the existence of All Might. Without him they have no reason to exist. They don\u2019t really want to see the world burn. They just want them to think and feel that they are not safe, so they need to get rid of All Might, the embodiment of peace and social safety, to get that. That\u2019s what bothers Shigaraki. Shigaraki doesn\u2019t really want to cause destruction or physical pain to people. He just wants to see everyone locked in their homes because of the fear of danger. In what sense does that exactly benefits him? We still don\u2019t know. Maybe we will know somewhere in the future, but I think that after 60 episodes it\u2019s more than enough time to actually do something relevant with your antagonists. \\n\\n\r\nStain had the potential to be a more interesting villain because he had more convincing motives, rebelling against professional heroes that act unselfishly expecting big economic compensation and personal glory for their heroic acts rather than truly wanting to help people, but the show opted to put him aside. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to come back further in the show, but being the more interesting villain so far, and one that could truly shake the society paradigms of what it means to be a hero in the hero world, I hope so. Just having inspired (for unknown reasons so far) other villains (that we still don\u2019t know much about) to come together joining the League, is not enough. \\n\\n\r\nTo worsen things, Shigaraki and his squad not only have been a little interesting with little believable motivations gang so far, they have also showed themselves as incredibly dumb.  Did they really think a student that enrolled in a hero school was going to happily be willing to join them, just because his rude and aggressive behavior is more expected from a villain rather than a hero? Or because he does everything for personal glory and not so much for the rest? They dumbly try to drag him to the dark side when they got nothing to offer him and resorted to nothing to emotionally manipulate him. At least they should have better informed themselves about him and his weaknesses to take advantage from those and convince him, the same way Dark Lord Sidious did with Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars. Villains here had no reasons to believe nor any real means to convince Bakugo to become part of their team.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, animation and sound:\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat feels lacking in an action-packed show like BNHA is a more remarkable OST. In all honesty, the tracks have been so far forgettable. Aside from the powerful \u201cYou Say Run\u201d, there\u2019s no single track that had stuck in my mind that I can remember and play there. They\u2019ve failed to match the intensity of the action scenes. But I don\u2019t care that much really. In fact, if something is capable to convey emotions without the help of memorable music then I\u2019d say it\u2019s nothing short of outstanding, and BNHA has proven to do it. Great music is always just a plus, not a must. The presence adds, but the absence doesn\u2019t subtract. Finally, both opening of this season, \u201cOdd Future\u201d and \u201cMake my Story\u201d are amazing catchy tunes, especially the latter for which I have become totally obsessed with this last week.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is good also, nothing to complain. They suit the characters and they even do in the dubbed version. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation are inconsistent throughout the episodes. You could clearly tell there was an uneven distribution of budget among them. More action-packed episodes were obviously going to be a priority over the more calmed classroom or indoors ones, but that is no excuse for somewhat poorly drawn faces, body-shapes and bad contrasts among characters and backgrounds. I wouldn\u2019t mind this if BNHA was a straight long-runner. But it is not. Moreover, this is Bones we are talking about. They should be more careful like they have proven in the past. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, when it comes to action they never fail to deliver, you can really tell these guys know what they do. Nothing to complain here and everything to praise. The vibrant, flashy and stimulating colors perfectly suit the highly energetic vibe of the show, paying homage to western superhero comics. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are cool. They all feel unique unlike most of the generic seasonals where everyone has the same face except by hair and eye colors. There\u2019s a distinctive feel on everyone. I know you can say the same for many other shows but this doesn\u2019t mean this isn\u2019t something to be recognized here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis was just a mild step back from S2, mainly due to the poor villain buildup, the sharp contrast among the two main arcs of the season where the second felt like an involution and longer than needed, and the excess of introduced characters that are accumulating in a room where there won\u2019t be much space for everyone, but that was all. It doesn\u2019t mean the show is doomed. It doesn\u2019t mean there is no room for improvement. If you didn\u2019t for example have major problems with the weak Greed Island arc coming right in between two heavyweight arcs in Hunter x Hunter then I don\u2019t know why you should have them now here. It was just a weak arc among many and that was it. It is not going to lower down the show the same way any other boring arc in other shounen anime didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nThings are still in a building phase, the stage is still being mounted. People want a climax when this is still development. The problem is that this development has been rather bumpy. It\u2019s like it knows where it wants to get but doesn\u2019t really know the way to get there, like a lost driver in a city he\u2019s never been before. It knows its destination, but just needs some orientation. \\n\\n\r\nThe good news is that the show isn\u2019t over yet, so there\u2019s opportunity for recovery and for it to pull its socks up again. Like that school student that becomes overconfident after nailing the first test, stops studying hard for the next one, performs weak in it, learns from his mistakes and studies hard again for the following ones. It is still on a right path. It\u2019s still entertaining, engaging; personally it's been a long time since I've watched something where I was truly and genuinely interested in watching how the whole story keeps developing and unfolding. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s also good that it is never trying to be something that it\u2019s not; it doesn\u2019t fall to pretentiousness\u2019s temptation to be something else, different, just to look cooler than the rest, staying true to itself.\\n\\n\r\nIt just needs to be better polished and\u2026disciplined. And there\u2019s no reason to think it can\u2019t.",

            "content": "Ya know. I don't think words do this show justice. There's something so special about My Hero Academia for me that it's almost intangible. This season has been incredible. So many amazing moments. Being a manga reader gives you a sort of special insight into how things will go sure, but seeing it animated and acted and with all the music and everything is a whole different experience in my eyes. Going into this season, knowing what would happen, I knew it was going to be great given the material, but I think I might have dominated Bones a bit on just how good it'dbe. Cause this season raised the bar and then some. Really elevated the whole thing. The manga was already a high bar but they some how went beyond that, I think Studio Bones is the real embodiment of Plus Ultra!! They deserve a lot of worthwhile praise and then some.\\n\\n\r\nNow getting into the nitty gritty, this season had it all for me. The Training Camp Arc was such a gut punch, the villains attacking head on like that was crazy to see again. The League is such a cool threat, not an all powerful menace from the jump like we see tons of other shonen villains whom pop up in other series. That whole arc was awesome, it had so much craziness. Deku vs Muscular is one of the top fights of the year no doubt. That moment had me choking up ngl. Deku is such a good boy. Then even after that when Bakugo gets taken away it's such a powerful moment because it hits so close for all our heroes. It was such a gut punch as I said. Them all trying to save him but coming up short was so sad and you could feel their anguish in it.\\n\\n\r\nNext arc being the Hideout Raid Arc was even crazier somehow. Like nuts. Getting the obvious out of the way, All For One. The man. The big dog himself. Master as Shigaraki has called him for so long now. Finally stepping into the light once again. And boy what a showcase it was. That fight with All Might, fantastic all around I bawled like a child throughout most of it tbh. It was everything. Such a high point for the series. It was everything. Talk of the town and then some everywhere you looked I think. One of the best anime moments this year no doubt.  Rest of the arc was crazy good too. All the lead up to the fight was great. The Bakugo Rescue Squad was a sight and funny as hell in their get ups too. It was such a great arc. \\n\\n\r\nNow the Hero License Exam Arc might not be as crazy as either of those last two. But it was a chance to let the audience catch their breath some after all that madness and all the big shifts the story has just taken. So I respect it for that. The arc itself might not be anything too special, but it had a good share of awesome moments. The introduction of other schools and their students was great. Shiketsu with Inasa, Shishikura, and \"Camie\" we're all awesome and had great moments. The big showdown so to speak between Todoroki and Inasa was cool as hell. The whole test set up was meh but the actual arc was Damn fun and a needed lighter touch considering all we'd been through in the season thus far. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly think everything about this season worked so well and especially worked so well together. Seeing the Big 3 at the end made my heart flutter. The finale was so cool seeing Mirio go full power on them just to show how much they still have to learn to become pros. Mirio is an absolute beast. The dude is a prodigy. Love how they show they his quirk is nothing special but it's how he uses it that elevates him. Awesome stuff. This season has been such a blast to see. Some of my favorite material finally being adapted to perfection and then some. Just a damn good time. Love, love, love this show! Another each score and another AOTY contender.\\n\\n\r\n10/10. Go Beyond!!! Plus Ultra!!!!",

            "content": "Boku no Hero Academia is back with another season and this season probably has some of the biggest shifts in it's plot and characters yet!\r\nSpoilers ahead!\r\nBoku no Hero Academia 3 leaves us right after the second season with.....MOAR TRAINING AND EXAMS...yaaaaaaaa\r\nNo but seriously Deku and the gang goes through the typical superhero training and exams but within all this comes one of the most pinnacle major shifts into the plot and this review will go into spoiler territory with...All for One vs. All Might and what it means by the end for Deku.\r\nThe All for One vs. All Might fight finally shows us the BiggerBad of the entire series, All for One and what he is capable of as well as being the diametric opposite of One for All as well as knowing more about Tomura Shigaraki in the process as well. By all means this fight is the pinnacle for this season in LA's view, as it's the major changing point of Boku no Hero Academia in general, as the resulting situation and what it leads to is both the hero side needing to quickly learn their junior heroes as fast as possible in keeping with All Might's legacy *cough* Deku while the villains are spreading more and more because LA will be spoiling, All Might retires which is why this changes everything, from Boku no Hero Academia's setting and it's beliefs on it's heroes and villains taken to even more extremes and spreading like wildfire as a result of the shake up of the hero system by toppling over with their Number 1# Hero being taken down but not out from the literal stains that Stain smeared over All Might's reputation to the fight against All for One awakening new villains while growing the ones already lurking out of the darkness.\\n\\n\r\nWith the entire major scope of Boku no Hero Academia 3 of All for One vs. All Might, well what does this mean for Deku?, well Deku grows as a character both in his determination and beliefs of being a better hero whilst trying to stay in the law this time AND evolving his fighting style to better suit him, honing all his skills and better becoming a hero AND keeping All Might's reputation on the line as a result. Deku grows immensely in this season and that is a no brainer due to the major events that occurs in this season, not just All for One vs. All Might, from solidifying his beliefs as a hero and to be the best to changing his fighting style are great examples, but he also grows through his turbulent rivalry with Bakugo reaching it's apex with this season as well. So in speaking of Bakugo, Bakugo has some personal problems going on with him mainly involving Deku for obvious reasons, which comes into the prospects of him having something of a superiority inferiority complex towards Deku and HIS beliefs of justice grown from All Might as a result thus clashing of Deku and Bakugo being inevitable.  \\n\\n\r\nSo with this season being more or less the same in terms of plot mainly of the hero exams and training arcs and this isn't for the norm for Boku no Hero Academia and this is one nitpick many people would say about this season but again LA will say that at least it's what happens in between or around these exams and training arcs that grows it's huge cast as result. Now Boku no Hero Academia's 3rd Season does do well in it's approach of developing it's ensemble cast VERY well once again, due to it's plot structure on a wider scale and looking into many of it's characters simultaneously while working on Deku as the narrative focus. Some major focuses besides Deku within both the hero exam and training camp arcs, Todoroki once again more development this season like he does but this time instead of him opening up his powers through his parental issues as a result this season however looks more in his introspective look at Todoroki almost having the same personality as his father Endevour which manifests itself with one of the newer heroes in the cast, Inasa Yoarashi bringing this out of Todoroki, it's definitely not the same as Todoroki's development from his 2nd Season but this outlook was interesting to say the least and brought on another great battle in the process. Other characters who gets some form of screentime were the League of Evil most notably Himiko Toga voiced by Misato Fukuen and she is something of a wild card for LA for Boku no Hero Academia in LA's faovuirtes as well. Once again LA's favorite character in the ensemble cast are Uraraka and Momo Yaoyorozu but Himiko is definitely interesting to be probably in LA's top 3 for her involvement this season...as much of a playful psycho she is.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done once again by Bones, well they have the consistency down even in it's more bombastically insane fights ESPECIALLY with the All for One vs. All Might fight but in general this has Bones' animation all over it, from it's distinct and eyecatchy character designs, amazingly detailed and outright crazily fluid and impactful battles whilst still being comedic and serious when it calls for it. Bones has the consistency down and under the banner of stunningly great animation to boot...\\n\\n\r\nVoice work, well LA will be here all day if LA talks about the huge cast of characters so LA will keep this short, Kenta Miyake was great as All Might, Nobuhiko Okamoto as Bakugo gets some leverage with amount of adrenaline and somewhat drama Bakugo goes through and Daiki Yamashita as Deku was typical as he's been voicing the character for so long, but like Nobuhikio Okamoto got some leverage with the drama and craziness that ensues this season. To say the least, we have a HUGE cast of character so with that LA will at least bring up Ayane Sakura as Uraraka who gets less screentime than usual as she really doesn't get much screentime or little developments here and there but Ayane Sakura was fine nonetheless even with Uraraka's crush on Deku growing even more which means...Ayane's lovestruck and deredere opening up and on the other side, Misato Fukuen as Himiko was like the controlled pyscho yandere which Misato has something of a niche in and she once again nailed it as Himiko...yeah if this season did something with the long list it already achieved then LA has some obvious liking to Himiko because of this season to say the least what with her itching LA's psychotically playful villains archetype and Himiko with Misato Fukuen voicing her works it quite well *ahem* All for One voiced by Akio Ootsuka had the right cadence to be that smotherly smarmy evil business type and he does GREAT as All for One as a result like damn both he was at times frightening for a character who had no face (no seriously). Overall, the voice cast was widely diverse in personality and many of the characters new and old were great in their role like they should be.\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia's 3rd Season vastly improved from it's 2nd Season both improving of it's ideals of being a hero AND a villain and what this means to society as a whole, while massively working on Deku, All Might and Bakugo which had been hinted at multiple times in previous seasons finally coming to something of a resolution in this season, getting to know the League of Villains and their beliefs that clash with Deku, All Might's and the like and let's not to mention the All for One vs. All Might fight being a major turning point for the series and only riles the franchise into new peaks to say the least, from the beliefs of a hero, to the rise of villains and what all this means to society and how they deal with it. Boku no Hero Academia 3 was great to say the least, LA was entrenched in it's lore, it's world and LA didn't see many of it's huge plot twists coming, it's fights were generally amazing and hugely impactful to the plot, interesting and unique characters (both heroes and villains) that don't get left behind and instead evolve with Deku and it's main core cast *cough* well cept Mineta for obvious reasons -sigh- *cough*. Boku no Hero Academia 3 was just crazy bouts of fun and interesting turn of events that it's to be expected that with how LA feels about this season, this season like Boku no Hero Academia in general, LA is favourable to it with how it improves on many of it's fronts that it already improved as well in it's second season and with that yes, Boku no Hero Academia's 3rd Season might be one of LA's favourite animes of the year by the time LA writes this review at the time...and with a 4th season announced, LA will be happy enough to plunge back in and LA will honestly would want to watch more because it's 3rd Season gave us the major turning point of the series, LA would like to see it's repercussions and how it's character deal with it and much more of it's secrets that it hasn't revealed yet...\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia 3 is was it's peak but can it go even further beyond....plus ultra?...LA hopes soo...",

            "content": "STORY - 8\r\nART - 9\r\nSOUND - 9\r\nCHARACTER - 9\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\r\nPlus Ultra, the Latin phrase we've come to love ever since the epic final showdown on the first season of Boku no Hero Academia. Meaning to go further beyond, it encapsulates the very definition of what Season 3 is all about.\r\nHow far can the society of Heroes vs Villains run for without causing major destruction? What does it take to ensure protection, stability, and peace among a changing world full of Quirks? The story wrestles these questions solidly and seeks just how much can heroism triumph against those who wants to crumble society. Upon thevillains' ambush, justice treads over a dangerous tightrope. When more menacing personalities and powers arrive on the doorstep, the suspenseful atmosphere becomes a trigger that sends out a wave of harsh realities towards both students and pro heroes alike. This has now turned into a stage to protect. As new insights are revealed within the evolving villainy allegiances, characters step outside of their comfort zone to battle against destruction. Emotions whirl around, strategies and moves are formed to ensure the best way out, and heroic resolutions truly shine to guard society from the flames. All these mayhems not only add to just be bursting with tense goosebumps or powerful excitements, there's also the influential message of the symbolical justice passing down onto the next generation. Ultimately, they're the next ones who have to fight. And to transition with this succeeding group of heroes, additional focus is given to more hero schools out there. A showcase of developmental progresses and relationships are shown within the students of Class 1A as they face against other students. Their growth ever since the beginning feels very tangible now and it's this aspect that answers why they are deserving to become society's future heroes. They will continue to go further beyond.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing up after a great production during the second season, this season carries on with nuclear excitement. Shockwaves after shockwaves of intensity are sent through the audiovisual works produced by Bones. With their maintained consistency, the enjoyment hardly ever stagnated, leaving a solid set of episodes behind. And the proofs are found right on the battlefield. Among the powers of Quirks lie a combat zone full of the smokes and ashes caused by destruction. The animation takes precedent when it comes to focus over a wide array of moves. Not only does this help to give all sorts of lively forms, it also gives them motion on a heightened level. Seeing the characters move about a dynamic battlefield with energies and dangers everywhere enliven the action. This is further reinforced by other visual techniques such as camera shakes and character expressions, particularly the ones evoked by the villains. Their expressions are the embodiment of society's crumblers, the ones who threaten the heroes with heavy influence. In a way, it does give this season more of an emotional weight compared to previous seasons. Facing off against their foes, those they have to beat, will definitely raise the stakes. It's during these times where the voice actors express their skillful talents. They've accomplished a way to tell a powerful story, eliciting a sense of raging strength to never give up. And it doesn't just stop there. All the potent feelings didn't just come from the character's voice. Because in the background, bolstering soundtracks boost this season off with a hype that goes further beyond the horizon.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3 of Boku no Hero Academia is a strength that maximizes what it's like to have a heroic identity. To watch them pit against many tough threats and situations, there's really no other reason than a straightforward one as to why I kept on watching them. It's simple. They are also my heroes.",

They tried to offset that by making it so he has trouble using it at first but of course he overcomeshis own limitations so each time I just rolled my eyes because just like with any other shounen anime the limitations are only temporary. \\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime but at the same time it's not bad and I like it, it's just nothing special really.",

            "content": "When I watch the previous seasons of Boku No Hero Academia I always ask myself \"How on earth are they going to top this season?\" anxiously awaiting the next season that they release and I'm never dissapointed & that's only a rare gem you can find with a few select series. A series that manages to do what the previous season did, but better. This season already has my favourite episode of any BNHA episode to date and i'm sure a few reading this can already guess what episode that may be.\r\nStory (10/10): The story is pretty straight forward and easy to follow. Students jointhe U.A to become heroes and they go through multiple different training courses to achieve that dream. The thing that captivates me the most about the story is that they never fall off pace. The pacing is adapted perfectly and you can see the studio hasnt lost track on where they're trying to take the story in retrospect of what they're trying to adapt from the manga in each episode and always manage to include even the smallest details from the manga. The story is easily a perfect 10/10 for me. The story doesn't lose focus of where it's trying to go and that's honestly one of the most important aspects of any anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): Well this is pretty self-explanatory.. Studio Bones is animating it. The art in this show is phenomenal and has an incredible amount of detail scattered through the entire anime. I think this anime was made for Bones to adapt, because honestly the studio is well known for always putting so much art detail into the animes they create and it's noted here exteremely well. It's honestly sometimes hard to go back to other animes and watch the animation after coming out of a BNHA episode because its THAT well-animated and detailed you find it hard to adjust to sub-par animation from other adaptions. 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): When you have soundtracks implemented into the anime, you want it to capture the moment. You want the OST to be able to make you feel what exactly is happening in those important scenes & make you feel what the characters are feeling, right? Well this season does one of the best jobs out of any anime I've watched in doing exactly that. I'm always in a rollercoaster of emotions when OST's from this anime play, becaase they do such a perfect job of capturing the moment and mood setting it's hard not to feel for the scenes that take place. Any soundtrack that manages to capture their audience and pull them in with emotions nails it. 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10) - I think this is one of the best aspects about BNHA even though I love practically everything about this anime and this particular season so far. Character development is such a cruical key part of any anime in order to move the story forward. You'd think with that amount of characters BNHA normally has including Class A it would be hard to devlop all the character traits in a little amount of time, but they put so much consideration even into the supporting characters and that gains my respect. Animes these days just focus on the MC's development and they've done an outstanding job with Deku's character and they've made his development more realistic than any other shounen anime's MC development, but they've really focused on not just the MC's development and focused on everyone as a whole and that's something i commend this season for doing also. We're only 8 epiosdes in as i write this review, but can already tell you that theres much more character development ready to come. 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall (10/10) - I'll put these two sections into two as it'll make it much easier for me. What I love about this season is that they take what Season 1 & 2 did and make it better. Season 1 & 2 are by no means bad at all and they're great in their own rights, but so far I've had the most fun with this season and I think this season is greatly worth a shot. It has if not some of the most important arc's in the entire show so far and to me it's definatly worth the watch if you've watched the first two seasons or only watched some of BNHA and want to reconsider getting into it. YES 100%!\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed reading my review as much as I enjoyed creating it! i'm a little new to reviewing yeah! Have a lovely day and again, thank you for reading!",

            "content": "WOW! Time to write my first actual review.\r\nCurrently, Boku no Hero Academia has the potential to be one of the greatest Shounen series of all time, along with my all-time-great: Hunter x Hunter.\r\nHowever I know for a FACT that it is too early to put this title along with the likes of HXH or FMA:B, but it still holds up as one the best currently airing anime.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nWhile not so much actual *plot* has been happening throughout this season (and the series in general), the story is still compelling and filled with emotion. Though the overarching plot has been sort of... dull.\r\nHold up! Before youwrite off this review, what I mean by that is the story only is just beginning. Let's rehash on what's ACTUALLY happened so far. 1. Deku meets All Might and starts training. 2. Villains invade UA. 3. Students Fight in a TOURNAMENT ARC (WOOHOO), also as a method of development. 4. Villains invade Hosu City, and fail. 5. More training at camp. 6. Villains invade camp and fail, but this time they're a tiny bit more successful. Notice a pattern? Yeah me too. Basically, its A: Students train, then B: Villains invade. Rinse and repeat 3 times. And the villains fail all 3 attempts. \\n\r\nThen FINALLY, the story decides to take a turn when All For One shows up and decides to spice it up. And without spoiling anything, this is the reason why I decided to give the story a 8/10 instead of 7/10. \\n\r\nMHA has always been about the clash of ideals. In every conflict, every character is fighting for the sake of their own beliefs. Bakugo vs Midoriya, All Might vs Nomu (Ok, that one's an exception), Midoriya vs Todoroki, Stain vs Students. Every fight tells a unique story and I firmly believe that is what drives the plot. The overarching story doesn't matter (for now at least) because of the strong connection that we have built with the characters in this series. And all credit is due to the masterful storytelling of each character, done by the main man Horikoshi and Studio Bones. Because of the emotional connection I have with each and every one of my favorite characters on this show, I give the story a strong 8/10. Mostly because of the lack of *actual content* but is strongly redeemed by it's character focused narratives.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm not usually one to complain about animation and art. I mean, I've sat through 800 episodes of One Piece, which is not particularly known because of it's animation (quite the opposite really). However trust me when I say this: Studio Bones have stepped it up this season with episode 11 being THE MOST memorable episode in the series (so far), largely due to the quality of animation. The fights, as you'd expect, feel fluid and dynamic, with every punch or injury feeling gritty and real. \\n\r\nBesides some awkward expressions of characters on some frames, the episodes are all well animated and drawn. But then again, I'm not really one to care that much for such things, so this might not be an accurate review of this section.\\n\r\nProps to Bones anyways.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:I KEEP MY IDEALS/10\\n\r\nMusic (OST and OP/ED)-\\n\r\nThis is an absolute 10/10 for me. I have blasted the opening to this season at least 3 times a day since it started growing on me.  I listen to it while driving, while doing homework, and just when I'm chilling in my room. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. I haven't paid much attention to the ending though. One of these days I might give it a try. \\n\r\nAnyways, THE OSTs this season ARE AMAZING AF. It's a wonder how they've been pulling off hype scene after hype scene without using the legendary track of \"You Say Run\". Every OST they've produced so far gets the blood pumping and makes you emotional to the core. I've cried at least 3 times this season, largely due to the music.\\n\r\nVoice Acting- Japan have the finest voice actors in za whole warudo. Of course there aren't any complaints here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10/10\\n\r\nI truly believe this is the whole selling point of MHA, since every story and conflict involves solely around this series' characters and their development. While not a lot of characters have been shed the spotlight this season, other than the ones that we ACTUALLY care about (let's be honest, does anyone care about sugar rush dude, Aoyama, Cero, or Ojiro?). The interactions between the classmates of class 1-A is what truly makes this series great. And overall, the cast it VERY strong. Most of what I want to say has already been said in the story section, since I REALLY do believe that the core of MHA's story IS in its characters (so far).\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 12/10\\n\r\nI've laughed, cried, and jumped out of my seat while knocking over my bowl of cereal. ALL IN THE SAME EPISODE. It's needless to say that this is just a pure and fun show. Even if you're not particularly into Shounen or fighting anime, it's still very entertaining to watch. Every Saturday I look forward to watching it either with a friend, or huddled up in my room with a bowl of chips. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime might just be the one to break the barrier between the mainstream audience and the traditional anime audience. More than ever, I've witnessed countless people get into anime because of this particular series. Some of my friends who have had the firm belief that anime is for weebs and nerds, have begun watching this show THEMSELVES. And that really makes me happy since anime is finally getting the appreciation it deserves, through this AMAZING series. \\n\r\nI gave this a 9/10, not because of any problems I see with it, but rather the potential that I believe it can achieve. Three years ago, when I first saw this series airing, I did not see it would grow to be the Shounen super power it is today. The story still has a ways to go before it reaches the climax, but so far, it is still an astounding series. There is a high probability that I might return to this review and give it a 10/10, after this season ends. But we'll see.\\n",

I haven\u2019t watched too many shonen shows and my first ever anime to watch from start to finish was Sword Art Online. That\u2019s right everyone!! I\u2019m a fucking degenerate!! However, even with my limited experience, I can still stand tall and exclaim: I DON\u2019T CARE! This show is BADASS!\r\n MHA brings a cast of unique individuals with their own dreams and ambitions, the animation is fluid and bright, the story is unique and has a clear-cut ending, we follow a smart young lad whoisn\u2019t the best at everything he does\u2026 but gosh dang does he try. Let\u2019s jump into the tags!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nBoom! (DIEEE!!) It\u2019s instant, we know exactly what we\u2019re looking for, the space between seasons isn't confusing and it pick itself up right where it left off perfectly. You can root for the heros, but the villains are definitely on to something (the usual dynamic nowadays). \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nOOOH That\u2019s some nice animation!, OOOH! Look at the colors! OOOH! Everyone is iconic! No two (relevant) characters are the same!  OoOoOoOHH! Look at that punch! OUCH! Look at his hands! OOMMGG THOSE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS! \\n\\n\r\nSeriously though, the art is amazing, everything is nice and everything is smooth, even with thousands of things flying around everywhere you know EXACTLY where to look. And when everything calms down you can expect to see Aoyama looking right at you (kind of like an easter egg)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI\u2019m not even going to say anything, the awesome soundtrack and unique quirk sounds will just drown me out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nWhile I love the characters and all their uniqueness, some quirks are just fundamentally better than others. Sometimes it looks as if some are kind of equal, but for the most part, it\u2019s just the Big 3\\n\r\n-Todoroki\\n\r\n-Bakugo\\n\r\n-Midoria\\n\r\nAnd everyone else is just a joke (quirkwise) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nLove it didn\u2019t you see my 10 out of 10?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nAll in all, this is an amazing show and I believe that everyone should watch it. \\n",

            "content": "Boku no Hero (almost) single-handedly redeems shonen today. The few things that that I dislike about BnH are more things that I dislike about shonen anime in general. \r\nIt runs a dynamic storyline. Each arc is sized perfectly (not overdrawn). Each episode parallels smoking a cigar over a cigarette: In other words, individual episodes of marathon anime (~CIGARETTES~) don't have the same velocity and enjoyment as the powerful, individual episodes of BnH (~CIGARS~). Halfway through the third season and I'm more addicted now than I was in the beginning. \r\nAlso, this show really nails the openings (title sequences). I mean it really fucking nails them.They're not just some collage scenes from upcoming episodes. They're a packed one minute thirty second appetizers that somehow manage to serve up the spice of the show without spoiling - they build appetite. When I think of some of the most enjoyable openings I have watched, this places amongst them. In comparison, OPs from Naruto or Cowboy Bebop are more iconic. \\n\\n\r\nOne mistake many shonen make is that they are overly apparent about the persona of characters. Just for a quick example, Bleach: it's obvious who that Aizen is a cunt and Ichigo is this high school hero. Obviously they're geared towards kids, but nowadays many older teens are still hooked onto shonen, so they (we) need a bit more psychological stimulation. However, too much psychological questioning would definitely make an anime lose its shonen status, like Fate/Stay Night. This is where BnH fosters balance: it delve just deep enough into the psychological aspect without losing its extremely-fun-to-watch episodes. \\n\\n\r\nHero-Killer Stain, who [spoiler] died in the previous season, perfectly sets up the psychological element for the entire show - the viewers wonder whether or not the heros are all that great or not. \"To truly accomplish anything... one needs will and conviction. Those without it... the weak ones.. They'll be weeded out. It's only natural. That's why you're about to die.\"\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero is definitely worth the watch. Eat up your shonen pride and just enjoy it. No one's judging.",

            "content": "My Hero Academia is a show that has a very interesting way of melding Western superhero culture (think Marvel/DC) with shounen & high school elements from the anime world. As I mentioned in a review I did for season 1, this show's ability to take inspiration from outside the anime world might be why it feels more refreshing than I thought it would.\r\nMHA has come a long way indeed since season 1, where I nearly dropped the series because I felt a bit overwhelmed at the size of the cast and saw nothing special. If season 1 was an introduction to the setting and Deku/AllMight, season 2 was a proper introduction to all the students of class 1A and began to explore their motivations and backstories. Now, in season 3, we got to see a continuation of that, and more rapid maturation of the characters through adversity.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS BELOW\\n\\n\r\nFor the record, I think season 3 was the best one yet. HOWEVER, I simply don't understand why the apex of the season's storyline, and basically the entire show up to this point, occurred on S3 E11 (in case you don't remember, this was when we got to hear \"UNITED STATES OF SMASH!\"). That REALLY should have been the last, or second to last episode for maximum impact. \\n\\n\r\nSeeing that happen so early made the rest of the season (which was mostly filler anyway) feel so weak in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the backwards structure of season 3, I feel that the story has definitely become less formulaic since season 1 with the whole idea of All For One and the removal of All Might's power. I think there are a lot of interesting directions the show can go as we head into season 4, and I look forward to more unique elements in this category.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure if the art has improved or not, but I'm still impressed at the quality of the character designs and the excellent animation. I have no complaints whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nSound was a bit more average to me, as I didn't hear anything particularly special in the OST or intro/endings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development took another step up in this season, and introduction of new characters was frequent enough to be interesting but not too much as to be overwhelming. Some of the filler content towards the end, like the dorm room episode actually added an interesting edge to our understanding of class 1A.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment of the show fluctuated quite a bit, but as a whole it was strong and I rarely found it difficult to convince myself to go through another episode. It was primarily the second half of season 3 that caused issues, as the events following the battle with All For One seemed less interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, the first half of MHA S3 was by the best arc of this show thus far, and even though the content tapers off near the end of the season it was a very solid run and I will definitely be looking forward to S4.",

            "content": "Boku no Hero Academia 3rd Season Review\r\nStory (9/10) Great\r\nMore Specifically (9.25/10) Great\r\nThe pacing and the story for this season of Boku no Hero Academia I felt was great, everything by Studio Bones was adapted either nigh perfectly or was a better execution of a scene than it's manga counter part which is was is ideal. My only nitpick is the filler that they tried to inject into the season, I did not care for the episodes as I felt it was just fluff that honestly was not needed. One can say \"oh it didn't hurt the overall season though\" and to that I say \"Ididn't hurt the overall season FOR YOU\" for me if didn't make overall season better then leave it out. There was enough manga content to adapt for them not to have to put in said episodes regardless if it was a small amount or not I didn't like it, it wasn't required. It felt like they just wanted to reach that 25 episode count and put them in there. The filler wasn't horrible like I said I just felt it wasn't needed which is why I even ended up skipping what ever the most recent one was in the season. The only other thing from a story standpoint that I didn't necessarily like was the dialogue during the muscular fight scene which was controversial when that part came out in the manga and the mangaka even apologized for said scene saying something along the lines of \"he could have written the dialogue in that scene better\" which I thought he would have attempted to tell Studio Bones to change it but didn't oh well his decision and he's holding his L for it maturing and moving on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (10/10) Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nStudio Bones has proven themselves time and time again that they know how to put in the work when it comes to adapting a series and making sure it looks as good and authentic to it's manga counterpart as possible and the animation is probably going to be a huge factor on if I become an anime only watcher from here on out. They do an outstanding job oftenly outdoing what was adapted which like I said is ideal.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) Masterpiece\\n\\n\r\nI watch my Boku No Hero in sub so that's what this is section is referring to when it comes to the voice acting which I felt every character voice fit and the voice actors did a great job especially Deku's JP VA during the muscular fight. The music was on point and opening and ending songs I never skipped.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nMore Specifically (9.25/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Boku No Hero Academia are great, a decent amount of them we get further characterization and development from. With a series that has a lot of characters to focus on contentiously can be a very high maintenance effort to make sure that no character is left behind too much. Right now when it comes to that obviously some get far more shine than others and some are starting to hit the back burner to some degree but that's to be expected when you have a roster of characters of that amount that you try to keep into the spot light all somewhat equally. Right now I think the mangaka Kouhei is doing a great job. On the flip side where it's at right now is also dangerous because each character's character development (or lack there of) is on some sort of slope whether it's going upwards or downwards and if it continues to be handled the way it's handle characters will definitely be left behind which sometimes is to be expected but not an excuse. Because if you once started off giving basically all of them attention this can alienate a reader/watcher if their favorite character you once focus on is no longer in the spot light they used to be in this can cause fans to leave the series which isn't something I assume he wants.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) Great\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this season greatly and like I said multiple times in this review it's has outdone it's manga counterpart which is ideal, that's something you always want. The only thing like I said bothered me was the filler because I personally felt it was not required but injected in because they wanted to reach that 25 episode count and if that's the main reason that's not a good reason to me. I didn't care to much for the final arc in the season it wasn't too interesting or that entertaining to me personally and I did fall off for about 3 weeks behind because of it but that's not the anime's fault since I wasn't really feeling the arc in the manga when I was reading it also. Other than that overall I still greatly enjoyed watching the 3rd season more than any season before it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10) Great\\n\r\nMore Specifically (9.50/10) Great+\\n\\n\r\nThis is the best season of Boku No Hero Academia thus far and hopefully the next season keeps the pace, hype and quality that this one brought. Studio Bones did a great job and now has me considering if I should go continue reading the manga like I was doing (since the second the last's episode's first half is where I stopped reading in the the manga about a year ago) or if I should just wait for their superior version because that's where I'm at with Attack on Titan and that's not a bad thing at all it's ideal.",

But Horikoshi's able to turn such a simple concept into something so different, so entertaining, so unique. And it's all thanks to its great characters.\r\nArt 10/10: This is on a personal preference. I personally like the art and I think it's great. Also the characters all have memorable designs. They're the type that's hard to forget once you see their appearances/costumes. Also, the girls are cute.\r\nSound 10/10: The OSTs this seasonmannnn!!! Lit AF!!! Also the ED \"Long Happy Philia\" is my fav one so far from bnha.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: Bnha has a vast variety of distinctive, memorable, and unique characters, and they're the main reason I like this series so much. I don't even need a plot, just two great characters interacting with each others is enough. Makes you wonder what would happen if Uraraka interacts with Shigaraki, or Aoyama interacts with Dabi, or Shinsou and Monoma...etc. Just put two characters in a room and a plot will generate by itself. I didn't give it a 10/10 because of Mineta, the little grape fuck. Horikoshi added him for comedy but I think that's unnecessary. Aoyama and Monoma are enough comedy. We don't need Mineta. Plus, his actions are creepy and borderline sexual assault. Please, get him out of the picture.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: I've never liked a series so much before. This season is better than season 1 and 2, enjoyment wise. I've forgotten how many times I've cried while watching it (let me count, OFA vs AFO, Izuku vs Muscular......). The last anime that drove me to tears was Anohana, and that's a romance anime. For me to cry over a shounen anime is like Bakugo not cursing for a day. Impossible. But bnha is able to do it. That just shows how invested I'm in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: Cannot wait for the next season. In the mean time, Imma go read some fanfictions now...",

Before the festival meant the battles were student vs student, which don't get me wrong were great (Izuku, Todoroki was probably my favourite fight of 2017), but now we start to get villians involved. I won't go into details, but there are some fights now were lives are on the line, and it gets even more intense\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\n- The battles are some of the most well animated fight scenes I've ever experienced, the Bones Studio have outdone themselves again\\n\r\n- Each of the quirks, regardless of what they are all look sublime and so cool (and there are couple new ones to enjoy this season)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 11\\n\r\n- Maybe my favourite thing about the MHA series are the soundtracks, they always know the right song to play before an important scene, sorry to bring it up again, but when \"You say run' played in the background to the Izuku and Todoroki fight i S2 it gave me goosbumps, and they have managed to exactly the same in the season as well\\n\r\n-The final battle of the arc and the final song were perfect, chilling, and set the mood for maybe my favourite fight of the series so far\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\n- As we all know MHA has a very vast array of different heros in all shapes and sizes, but in comparison not to many different villians (other than a whole lot of Nomus)\\n\r\n- Well this season we get a whole motley crew of new villians to enjoy, and although we don't know too much about them yet I am already intrigued, as they all have very, shall we say.... interesting personalities\\n\r\n- We also start to finally get a little glimpse into what made Tomura Shigaraki the certifiable nutcase that he is\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\n- This is shaping up to be my favourite anime of the year so far\\n\r\n- The combination of the beautiful artwork, intense battle scenes, and just sublime music sent shivers down my spines on a number of episodes\\n\r\n- I'm so excited to see where the story is heading, because at lot happens in this 12 episode period\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.5\\n\r\n- The only reason I haven't given it a 10 so far is because its not finished, but I'm confident the second half will be great as well\\n\r\n-But based on recent history, MHA seems to just be getting better and better so well done guys and keep up the great work!\\n",

            "content": "This is a review of the whole BNHA series so far.\r\nLets get something straight here: I really don't enjoy superhero movies or comics. It's really not my thing. \r\nYet. Marathoning this show was probably the most fun and and exasperating task ever.\r\nAs so many reviews have stated before this one, this show isn't innovative in any way whatsoever. It's a show about superheroes. Another show about evil fighting good. We have all seen that before. It is what it is. How many more shows can be made without them all looking the same? There was an actual TV show called Heroes. HEROES. Let's please berealistic here now. Every single thing that could have been possibly made on superheroes was made. There might be variations, but it's basically all the same.\\n\\n\r\nBoku No Hero Academia is still that. It is still the same thing. Evil fighting good. Good fighting evil. A bunch of heroes trying to get together to fight another group of villains. We have all seen that before. The third season is better. It actually has some cool action scenes. But with this show, I still needed to understand the hype.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season was very bland. I tried watching the first season when it first came out and dropped it after only two episodes. The main characters are annoying, both Midoriya and Bakugo. We have all seen these hero tropes before. We have all seen charismatic characters like All Might, and we have all seen secondary characters like Uraraka. So, the characters aren't so compelling. The main character of this show is another 'I have no talents but I have a will of stone'', and the co protagonist is 'I WILL BECOME STRONBER THAN YOU'. Seriously, it felt like I was watching KHR all over again. But- holy shit- these characters make me laugh hard. They make fun of themselves, and they seriously don't care about it.\\n\\n\r\nStill. This isn't new either. So why is it so much fun to watch a bunch of teenagers making fun of themselves and their superpowers/quirks? Maybe because it's one of the most redeeming qualities of this show. Some things you just gotta make fun of. Like, there is a guy that is able to shoot a laser beam from his pelvis as he is thrusting. ACTUALLY. You guys have no idea how ridiculous it is and then watch him save people with the same laser beam. And another character that can detach his hair/balls (please just trust me on this) making them attach to things. You can take it as you want, but for some this can really make you laugh.\\n\\n\r\nI keep on looking forward to the next great hero with a funny quirk, mostly because it is entertaining to see how they actually manage to use it (or make fun of it). This is not a spoiler- but one of the greatest things about this show is how they can take a pretty cool quirk/power and give it to a complete idiot, like for example Monoma from the second season.\\n\\n\r\nSo really, this show doesn't bring anything new to the table. Leave all your expectations aside, and go into it just to laugh. I truly believe that if a show leaves you with something then it's done it's jobe. I don't think this show was meant to do anything new or innovative that hasnt already been done, but just make people laugh. Maybe some might find some more enjoyment in the more dramatic scenes, but for me personally, they don't come through as much as the funny scenes.\\n\\n\r\nNow, because I can't wait for the fourth season, I'm going to go read the manga. Byeeee\\n",

            "content": "My Hero Academia is becoming more and more popular over the years. This season has been considered as the best one until now by a lot of people, and we will see if this consideration is well deserved or not. What we can't deny is that My Hero Academia is a great shonen, arguably the best of its generation, and a series with a lot of qualities and strengths, espacially this season. But having a lot of qualities and being a great shonen doesn't make you perfect or excellent either. My Hero Academia has issues and faults that we can't ignore just because of itsqualities and potential, and we will see through this analysis of the third season what prevents it to be excellent.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue of My Hero Academia is definitely its storyline and its narrative. It is extremely repetitive (since season one) and always the same thing. We have a school-arc, followed by a vilain-invasion-arc, followed by a school-tournament-arc, followed by a vilain-invasion-arc, followed by a school-tournament-arc... Basically, the narrative is reproduced again and again without a lot of differencies between each arcs and each seasons. The issues are always the same, the main plot doesn't evolve since season one, and so the characters in the spotlight are always the same too. This season of My Hero Academia lacks some kind of originality, because of the repetitive narrative, but also because of the fights and the characters. Despite this, the storyline and the plots stay interesting in some ways and exciting to watch. It is not annoying or bad, just lacks freshness. This season is divided into two parts (like the second one) : first part where vilains invade the training camp, and second part where Izuku and his class participate on another exam to be licensed. The first part is definitely the best part of the season and arguibly the best arc of the series until now. There's a lot of action in this season, but also a lot of suprising things and interesting characters introduced. The arc is dynamic and entertaining, in which we can see a lot of characters highlighted (put in the spotlight) and having their lighting moments (like Kendo and Tetsutetsu from Class B). The second part is less interesting and more generic, but not bad so far.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia biggest quality is definitely its characters. They are well written and nicely, smartly developped. Like Todoroki or Tenya is season two, some characters got a very good development and evolution in this season. Even non-main characters like Kirishima and Tsuyu have been deepened in this season. The relationships between the characters are also very good and fascinating to follow because of how smartly and realistically they are done. A lot of characters have been exploited, but what is really amazing in My Hero Academia is how the characters are realistic and relatable. They are not clich\u00e9 nor stereotyped, unlike a lot of characters we can see in shonen and nekketsu. It is probably what makes them appealing and likeable. The mangaka obviousely know how to write characters and how to make them lovely. We can see also a lot of characters with a lot of potential this season and this is what makes us so hyped and positive for the future. Among all the characters of the whole series, there are many of them who have a lot of potential and could be very interesting in some ways. From heroes, to vilains, to students or simple humans. Overall, the casting of My Hero Academia is amazing and this is why it deserves a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of My Hero Academia is excellent. Not outstanding or breathtaking, but still excellent and super clean. The choreographies are neat and technically very well animated, the animation is overall extremely consistant, solid and lasting. Unlike a lot of action shows, My Hero Academia isn't nicely animated and clean only when there is a fight or in action scenes. It is consistant and clean through the whole season (series) and never disappointing. This is another area where My Hera Academia couldn't be criticized (negatively) because it is really satisfying, deft and worthy.\\n\r\nBesides the animation, the art and the graphism are pretty average, but the design of the characters (chara design) is original and creative.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia's soundtrack is not really good, inventive or impressive. Most tracks are monotone, lack originality and are pretty simple. There is absolutely no risk taking and this soundtrack has no identity (like basically the soundrack of the whole series). We have some relaxing tracks, some dynamic tracks and some scary tracks, but that's it. There is a lack of beauty and particularity in this soundtrack. There's no specifity. But overall the soundrack is not bad, not even close. Some of them are super entertaining and the quality overall is above average.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I enjoyed the first part a bit more than the second one, but the second one also excited me, pleased me and amused me. Both parts were good and entertaining. I loved to see all the new characters, that I found very interesting and likeable. This season didn't disappoint me and is by far my favorite until now. The fights weren't impressive or amazing, but I liked them because of their simplicity (even if sometimes I found some of them annoying). After episode 21, the season became a bit boring to me because of the umpteenth confrontation between Bakugo and Izuku, that I found extremely redundant, repetitive and annoying, but it wasn't bad either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8/10",

Last time (basically a few minutes ago), I reviewed Yu Yu Hakusho. But now, I'm gonna review BNHA Season 3!\r\nOnce again, Boku no Hero still is as great as it usually is. I'd say the fights in this look SO GOOD! The animation is probably the greatest compliment I can give here. It's improved a lot, and it gives the show a very distinct look.\r\nThe story is also quite good. It's mostlyabout Deku \"knowing what he has to do now\" and it satisfies my shounen heart. I like the whole \"Deku is going his own path\" thing and it makes it a whole lot cooler rather than the typical \"successor follows the predecessor\" thingy. Oh, and it's also fun to see your favourite characters grow and develop. Hell, a character in this show I used to hate ended up being my favourite in this show!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, BNHA deserves a Jackass's Blessing. Hope you all enjoyed this review. It was a bit too short I admit, but the next review will be quite long. \\n\\n\r\nMilesss\\n",

            "content": "I'm still not entirely sure how it happened, but I was extremely invested in the third season of Boku no Hero Academia. I marathoned the season in approximately two days, and many of the story movements, even those which I knew were coming, caused an emotional response in me. Reading over my reviews of the first two seasons now feels slightly alien: although I can understand the criticisms they don't feel as though they're coming from me.\r\nLet's use Deku as an example. Back in Season 1 I called him annoying, on the basis that his character actions were repetitive. Objectively, I still consider him oneof the weaker - certainly less interesting - characters on the show. He doesn't have much in the way of character flaws. His weaknesses are mainly related to the natural limitations of his quirk and the fact that he has not had it for long. Now I think that he's the only appropriate main character this series could have had, and his moments of heroism and self-sacrifice get taken to sufficient extents that they're still entertaining. There are some interesting story turns with him this season too.\\n\\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, a lot of the main characters are three-dimensional and develop well. All Might is a truly great character, and the best moment of this season revolves around him - there's no doubt that you know what I mean if you've seen it. Bakugo is great too. His character is full of weaknesses: he's short-tempered, competitive to a fault, overly proud, bad at expressing his emotions, and wary of others. Those flaws make his actions feel more human, and when they're balanced out by his strengths - confidence, decisiveness, skill, and surprising heroism - they give his character a lot of complexity. This season in particular gives him a lot of focus in comparison to the last one, and a lot of those moments are among the highlights.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, a lot of the minor characters remain one-note. That list does grow shorter with each passing season, but it still represents something like half of class A1 and the majority of the remaining characters. Mineta is an easy example. He just barely escapes being the standard over the top pervert character and only that. To use another example at random, there's Denki. There just really isn't much going on with that guy. Same goes for Ahsido. I don't think I could tell you anything about her personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe purpose of these characters isn't really related to their characterization. They're mainly there for their quirks. In arcs like the Sports Festival last season and the Provisional License Exam this time, we get to see how they use their abilities to solve the problems at hand and how those abilities interact with the other students' powers. This is something the series absolutely excels at. The powers themselves are highly developed, they play off one another in interesting ways, and there are a lot of different scenarios in which one power or another suddenly becomes more useful. It's a lot of fun to see the A1 students learn to work together and apply their quirks in creative ways. One thing I really picked up on was that characters like Bakugo and Todoroki, who seem unstoppable in combat situations, are suddenly far less capable when it comes to a task like rescuing people. Part of the reason for that is that their quirks simply aren't as well-suited to that. It goes without saying that the production values are immaculate and the fight scenes in particular are exceptionally well-crafted.\\n\\n\r\nNow, it does have to be said that we've seen a lot of these dynamics before. It's still easy to draw comparisons between this and something like Naruto, for instance, and some of the humor in particular is rampantly cliche. There are things like the Japanese bathing and male/female interaction-based jokes that we've all seen a hundred times before. There's also an annoying character whose only thing is that he hates class A1 and is ultra-competitive toward them. He just feels like a waste of time. Thematically, it doesn't really deviate that much from other Shonen anime, so if that's a genre you don't like then BnHA isn't for you and won't change your mind.\\n\\n\r\nI still don't like Ochako. There's very little going on with her except that she's in love with Deku. The show dedicates screen time to her thinking about that even during action sequences, and to me, it just feels kind of tiresome.\\n\\n\r\nComplaints like that are vanishingly minor, though. A few minutes worth of time with mildly grating characters was a small price to pay for the amount of enjoyment I derived from this. BnHA has decisively improved with each season, so at this rate it transcend this site's rating scale within a couple of seasons.",

            "content": "We can at least agree that the age of the so-called \u201cBig Three\u201d is way past us at this point, One Piece is still going on just as fantastic and strong, but the other two have long been in the afterlife. For a while now, countless fresh new shounen shows were striving to replace the old highly praised shows as the leading next-generation version (or just what Naruto tries to called its sequel; Boruto).\r\nIt's undeniable at this point that the Boku no Hero Academia is at the pinnacle of its growth, with two successful seasons, popular Manga, new upcoming games, feature movies, and I cankeep on going for long, this show is definitely a highlight for the new generation of anime. Boku no Hero Academia 3rd Season continue the trend of its two previous seasons on being a seasonal show that doesn't fall short on delivering quality entertainment in all sorts of aspects, much like what Shingeki no Kyojin got us used to, crisp animation and phenomenal audio work were always a nice guy with open welcoming hands, doing a shounen feature justice for once.\\n\\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\\n\r\nAnother season, another adventure. There is a lot to go through here, but let's just say, this season, in particular, was the most diverse in terms of story arcs, we get a field trip, an exam, an epic duel and more, what else could you ask for? This season managed to cover up the change of story in a great way, and yes, there was a great change in that respect, past this season, the world of Boku no Hero Academia is never the same, having villains cause much more pressure than before forced heroes all over the world to put into consideration plans they never accounted for. The heroes in training never thought the world could be this cruel.\\n\r\nOne major flaw that bothered me was how linear and simplistic this season was, not entirely true for all arcs, but I could call on at least one that suffered the most from so much happening at the same time that it becomes a complete shitfest of an uninteresting mess.\\n\r\nSeason two's tournament arc was spectacular, it made you appreciate how well and constructed the flow of events are in the story, but the tournament arc of this season was in compared to the previous one, very poorly written, it was all rushed and lazy that it felt like a filler arc.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (8.7/10):\\n\r\nUnlike any other show, Boku no Hero Academia has a different feel to its animation, it's pretty average on parts that don't require any heavy animation works, like dialogue centered moments, flashbacks... But the battles, the battle speak for an entirely different manner. There is something to it, something that makes your muscles respond to whatever is being shown, Midoriya could be throwing one of his epic punches, and all your muscles would be mimicking it unintentionally, it all sounds very dynamic and bound to the limitless freedom of camera movements with the odd 3D-like angles.\\n\r\nI kid you not when I say that a simple animation can put so much weight and emotions on each frame even if it was the most ordinary thing in combat, like a single punch, all it requires is moving a hand from point A to point B, and yet, Boku no Hero Academia pulls it off with the use of some unknown black magic that it smashes every bit of doubt and uncertainty.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\\n\r\nThere hasn't been a single opening theme song that isn't included in the infamous \u201cplay this in my funeral\u201d playlist on youtube, they are everywhere.\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia 3rd Season makes a return with its amazing opening theme song picks, a couple of them this time around as well that remained as faithful to the quality we're used to.\\n\r\nIf I had to choose, I'd say that this season was the greatest in terms of voice acting and soundtrack blending. One of the most emotional and epically intense moments of the series happens to take place here, and if the animation doesn't do the trick for you, the music, voice acting and everything related to audio can alone give you an experience out of this world that even a blind person would appreciate.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is house of a ridiculously huge character cast looking at the length of the series (as far as basic seasonal shows go), but, the good thing here is they are handled in an efficient way that gives to everyone a considerable amount of focus and care. Midoriya and Bakugo's relationship goes through a drastic phase, it was anticipated for the longest time now, but the way it all turned up to be was what made it special, we're ages passed the emo days of the likes of Sasuke Uchiha, this series that made everyone doubt it at the end, going as far as calling it a ripoff of other big shows is finally having it's glorious 180 turns on those people.\\n\r\nA lot of new side characters make their debuts as well with well-established backstories and roles, talking here about both supporting characters and villains.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.0/10):\\n\r\nNow, I enjoy my Boku no Hero Academia, and I always have, and I'd calmly even say that this was the season that made the series closer to me, undoubtedly my favorite season as for now.\\n\r\nA lot of turnarounds happened, but they were all for a good reason, and only made the show better. I'm still having problems with the exam arc though.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (8.2/10):\\n\r\nAlready a fan of the previous two seasons? Why not hop in right away then? I can at least assurte you that action-wise, this show cuts the cake easily over the previous ones. It's way more serious, emotional, and developed, and on a bigger budget as well. Just like always, mildly family friendly with some few fan service, of course, there's also mild nudity towards the end, a character that makes his debuts seem to have problems keeping on his when fighting, so you'll have to see some butt on this one.",

My Hero Academia (MHA) season 3 continues to build off the shoulders of season one and two to remain consistently great enough to shrug off that occasional filler or recap episode which themselves are not altogether terrible either.\r\nIf there is any word to describe MHA series in general, it's polished. There is nothing too new about MHA's story or characters, but it's done so well that those issues become a minor niggle.  There are a good number of fights this season that was amazing, and the general cast development is praiseworthy as well.\r\nIf MHA keepsat its pace, it might be the 2nd long-running shounen to earn the distinctive ten from me. That said that this season was outstanding and I have no problem recommending people to watch this show, although really if the stellar work of season 2 didn't convince you I don't know what will.",

            "content": "My Hero Academia has risen in popularity since it has aired in spring 2016 and is now one of the most popular shounen anime. Season 3 of the series starts right of where the previous one left, with at first giving a recap of the previous seasons. The season is divided in three arcs, starting with the forest training arc. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nLike the previous seasons, the story of My Hero Academia isn't very complicated. There are heroes and villains who fight each other for their ideals of society. Class 1-A is still working hard to become pro heroes, which can especially be seen in theforest training arc and the provisional hero license arc. The series focusses more on its characters, with their different ideals and traits in order to tell the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation is very much like the previous seasons. The animation of the different fights is done very well. There are also a lot of different colours used for the characters and attacks. The only real downside is that the background sometimes lacks a lot of details.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia uses many of the same soundtracks as the previous seasons (which are overall very good) with a few new ones added in the mix. The opening songs of the new season are pretty good as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia pretty much tells it story with its characters. There are a lot of different characters with their own ideals, traits and personalities. You have Midoriya who is the example of a young boy wanting to be a hero, Bakugo and Todoroki who are his rivals and aim to be the number one hero. All Might, the example of how a hero should be and his counterpart All For One. Shota, in the forest training arc, who despises both heroes and villains for his own reasons. As well as villains who want to follow Stain's ideology and those who don't. I would say the peak of the character interactions would be in the second arc, because everyone there is fighting for their own ideals and a lot of the story is also told through the fighting and character interactions there. The third arc is somewhat worse at this in my opinion, because the fights developed the characters less.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall My Hero Academia season 3 was very enjoyable which for the most part was thanks to some of the exciting fights and character interactions. This season also had a lot of comedy, which have caused a lot of laughs. On a score of 1 to 10 the first arc and third arc would be an 8 and the second arc a 9, because of the exciting battles and character interactions, as previously mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia season 3 was a very solid season of the anime, developing the characters more, bringing new exciting fights to the table and offering a lot of new humour. I would say this season would be somewhat worse than season 2 though, because more of the fights in season 2 offered character development and the fights were also somewhat more exciting on average. However, this season did a very good job overall.",

            "content": "This is my first review ever. It's spoiler-free. It's also more useful for those who haven't read the manga because I haven't read it either.\r\nAnyway, I just couldn't hold back my thoughts after watching episode 11. BNHA has outdone itself. It has definitely come a long way and step by step it has reinvented itself. At the beginning of season 3, I was a bit skeptical. I thought the storylines would be repetitive, but boy was I wrong. Even though throughout the first  5-6 episodes I got some flashbacks to both seasons 1 and 2, I felt that the repetitive elements weren't approached ina boring and typical way. On the contrary, they were presented in a fresh and interesting way. Beyond episode 6, the show gets better and better then it reaches an unprecedented heights. I can't emphasizes enough how pleasantly surprised I am.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI think we've all known since the end of season 2 where the story was going. Even though some events could be predicted, the story and events are unfolding magnificently. You feel very invested and you feel closer to the characters. In the span of 11 episodes, I laughed out loud, I was shocked beyond words, I was terrified at some points and I truly wept at other points. For a show to draw so many emotions out of people is a great success.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis season I felt more invested in some characters than before. The character development for some characters is simply great. At this point you can further understand the motives and actions of more characters. Even though some origin stories were somewhat cliche, you can totally understand why most characters are behaving in certain ways. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI haven't felt bored once while watching it. I was on the edge of my seat while watching most episodes. The season so far has been crazy, heartbreaking, groundbreaking and heartwarming. On top of that, the fight scenes got even better. All in all, it has been a hell of a journey so far.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you find my review helpful.",

            "content": "I wish I had more to add for this review based on the ones I did for the first two seasons, however honestly not much has changed from the second. While the second was definitely my favorite, this season was great in it's own right. The work done in the summer camp was a great way to introduce and flesh out not only the hero classes, but also the villains as well.\r\nCharacterization of the villains is an often forgotten about story marker in anime (In my opinion at least), which doesn't always amount to sympathy either. Even some of the underlings have their own motivations,desires, and reasons for doing what they're doing. Some are influenced by Stain, while others simply live for chaos (a bit cliche, but I like some variety). Even then, the arc with All for One and All Might was about characterizing both of them and All for One's protege, not just All Might himself. Even Bakugo got some decent screentime that really fleshed out his frustrations with Deku, better than the previous two season.\\n\\n\r\nThis season felt a bit more like going through the motions than Season 2. While S2 still had arcs, the arcs for this season felt a little more disjointed for me. Even then, the characters made really nice progression and the sense of dread at All Mights waning strength and Deku's attempt to step into the role is palpable. Overall it felt more like a commercial for Season 4 but I'm on board.\\n\\n\r\nSide Note: I did feel the Uraraka sideplot of her crush on Deku was only put in so that they didn't have to really talk about it for a while. I'm not sure if I wanted that only because I really like the side interactions characters have outside of class or work.",

It's not going to make you have these deep emotional connections to characters you'll find relatable. It's just fun. It's the kind of anime that anime snobs will turn up their noses at, but you can binge watch and walk away from it at the end without thinking you wasted your time (well, not anymorethan binge-watching any other show makes you think you wasted your time).",

            "content": "GET ON WITH IT ALREADY!!!!!!!!\r\nEesh, anyone else getting that \"Hunter x Hunter veering too far into unnecessary and extraneous arcs that threaten to lose the show in obscurity\" vibe on this one? \r\nIf you liked how Hunter x Hunter wen't on FOREVER with that horrid ant-garbage arc then you might really like this season. If, instead, you like it when a show builds on the previous season while introducing valuable minor arcs without losing sight of the main narrative, be prepared for annoyance!\r\nUnderstand that this could very well be a case of too much time in-between seasons; I may need to start over entirely onceseason 4 is done to give this one a better shot. The same happened with Food Wars, by the time season 3 came out it was pretty hard to get into, but re-watching the series boosted my appreciation for it. However, I can't shake the feeling here that the awesome pacing and development of the first season was the pinnacle of this series. Everything since has been slower, smaller, and increasingly unsatisfying. \\n\\n\r\nWe are three seasons in and Deku still allows himself to be called Deku and get walked all over by Bakugo - something I've never understood throughout the entire show. At this point itss ruined my suspension of disbelief comptetely. Bakugo is a tool with a personality and motivation so tediously contrived that its just aggravating to suffer through. Looking for Midoriya and Uraraka to get anywhere? Forget it, obviously spending a million episodes on some sort-of-important test is what you should be interested in. Remember the overarching story and almost interesting villains that REALLY need some screen time to keep people caring? Apparently the writers didn't. Remember how the entire last season was some kind of diversion preparing for the next stage but was actually intense? Well this season you get a bunch of teens trying to get their 'drivers permits' by going through a tedious mash-up with other students that goes FAR too long and doesn't even have a heavy cost to failing. The entire season is uninteresting filler that expects you to take the UHA equivalent of sitting and writing a test that sort of matters REALLY SERIOUSLY. The next time you get stuck behind a student driver, start blasting the My Hero Academia OP and you've basically got season 3. Also is it just me or are the OP's getting significantly worse?\\n\\n\r\nOf course, right at the end you get a tease of some actual story, what a waste. Its been done for months and I just can't bring myself to care about watching the last few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nArt is fine but seems simpler than previous seasons, music and sound are on par with what you'd expect, the story is in transition so its hard to rate, the characters are at their blandest and hardly develop if at all, its just stretching my ability to care. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The third season of Boku no Hero Academia..\r\nWOW!!! Just incredible you know, I'm not even that hardcore of a fan, but this season really did just have my mind blown. \r\nStory - 9\r\nWe are yet again presented with the mystery of the whole Boku No Hero Academia universe as we are purged to ponder on what are the intentions of the enemy and what are their desires. Yet we are propelled into situations with the characters where there is no return and victory is not possible, but it's necessary. The story will leave you heart wrenched at places and leaving you in bittersweet tenderness. That'sjust the magic of My Hero Academia. It has brought common realistic human desires and morals into a fantasy world where everyone has superpowers, and superpowers aren't extraordinary anymore. As we plunge deeper into the series, we are tied to the flow of the story and the pacing is near on point. The frequent change of perspectives of both hero and villain perspective rids the show of unnecessary and boring moments keeping us glued to the LCD screen of our display and with our earphones trying to dig into our brains from being in our ears for too long. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nI don't really have a comment. The art just seems to be improving little by little with each season in the terms of its quality. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe season 3 with a change of sound director brought a new sound to the whole series. Each composer has their own \"sound\" and so did Boku No Hero Academia season 3. It's still just an absolutely amazing track and brought out key moments in the series, but I'm think I'm still stuck with the euphoria of the season 1 and season 2 tracks that I just don't realize how good it is. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the season shines brilliantly. The characters gain a huge amount of depth throughout the third season as now they are forced to fight for life and death not just for themselves but for the sake of others in do or die situations. Seeing how far the characters have traveled is just heart warming and really will hit you in the feels. These are characters you've grown to care about over the last two seasons. They even make you feel for asshole in the class. This show really just delivered perfect characters with this season and I couldn't have asked for a greater dynamic with characters in an anime. They nailed everything. Hands down round of applause. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely mind boggling. I loved the show every bit. Combined with melodrama and moments of tears. This show is an emotional rollercoaster that will hit you in the corner of your heart and make you speechless. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.4/10\\n\\n\r\nThat's as high as I'll ever go for an anime. If season 4 is even better than this, I might be forced to give it a 10/10 overall. What an outstanding feat. Don't listen to the hate. If you have a dream, go for it!",

            "content": "To understand my thoughts better, you might want to check my reviews of the previous seasons. This way you get context for some of the things I say.\r\nI'm also going to copy what mother's basement said in his video. He made very good points, so I'll feature them.\r\nThe next season of my hero academia finished, and this show just keeps on getting better. I started watching my hero academia when the second season finished. I found the first season to be good, but it was really the second season that got me to be interested in what the show was going to go. So nowthat the third season has finished, I can finally say that one of the more lacking characters in the show has been saved.\\n\\n\r\nBakugo, from the start isn't presented as a good character. He bullies Izuku and drags down his dreams. But to me, felt like a very good character in the first season. You could see how terrified he was that he wasn't as good as he might have thought. \\n\r\nBut in the second season I felt that he didn't develop as much as in the first one. I didn't get why he seemed so mad all the time. But I think I figured it out now.\\n\\n\r\nIt's one episode the comes to mind when I think of bakugo in the third season. In the of the later episodes, how do I say this while not spoiling anything, you get to another perspective of bakugo. We learn why Bakugo might have done the things he did. And if you go back in earlier episodes, you can see it clearly. We see how they develop bakugos insecurities that I saw in the first season. How his powerful quirk is making him feel like he should be more than he is. He feels responsible for things he shouldn't. \\n\r\nBakugo shows a lot of humanity in this season. \\n\r\nThis is probably my favorite part of this season, or the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nBut I had some problems though. Most of the arcs felt very forgettable in this season. \\n\r\nMy favorite part about the second was how much it packed into so few arcs. It had a tournament arc and then a stain arc (and a small arc at the end). I found it very fascinating how they did so much with those arcs.\\n\r\nBut sadly, my hero academia season 3 adds more arcs which made them less memorable in my opinion. It's hard for me to remember what actually heppened in the show without looking it up. I remember the first arc (cause it's the first one, which usually is memorable) and the last few episodes (the fight with the most impact, you know which one it is if you have seen it, was also very good and memorable, but I didn't find the rest of the arc to be as memorable). The rest wasn't very interesting IMO. I know they did good things in them, like developing Yuuga a little. But i feel like they could have done it in a more memorable way. but that's just my opinion\\n\\n\r\nSo to wrap everything up, I think my hero academia season 3 has gotten better since the second season. It isn't perfect, but it shows how you use a shows premise to make something very memorable. \\n\\n\r\na 9- from me",

            "content": "I started watching MHA long before its fanbase blew up, and by the time Season 1 was over, I was entirely skeptical about how it would turn out as a whole down the road. I didn't want a copy of Naruto, like AT ALL. There are quite a few people who compare MHA to Naruto, and I can understand why since both anime have similar premises under their belts. Fortunately with MHA, it does many things right that Naruto didn't, so much that even the creator of Naruto praises it, and here's why...\r\nEver since the first season, MHA knew what it wanted to be: asuperhero anime. If it's gonna be a superhero anime, then I want to see some superhero-type shit. The problem I've always had with Naruto Shippuden is its own identity crisis with most of it lying under the ridiculous amount of fillers it has. If you're gonna make an action anime about ninjas, then I want you to get to the point and show me some ninja action shit. I don't want to see a 30-minute episode about Naruto trying to remove Kakashi's mask. Hell, MHA even got its own fillers right because the characters weren't engaging in pointless crap that did nothing for them. The fillers provided lessons and hands-on experiences for characters to help them grow, even if the only two fillers in this series so far won't ever be referenced again. \\n\\n\r\nStill, what makes MHA such a fascinating anime to watch is the fact that there is little to no drag throughout its entirety. It constantly pushes itself to bring entertainment and intensity without making you wait for something to happen. It simply gets straight to the point and it keeps you interested. MHA is intense, funny, epic, and just purely entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3 brought back pretty much everything we should already be familiar with in this anime, yet, with every episode, it strives to go bigger. It constantly adds more and more hype to each scene, but again, the anime doesn't make you wait 10 episodes for a teased battle. It gets straight into the shit. Season 3 had a monumental start with our heroes going on a field trip and being attacked by villains, and the whole event had me on the edge of my seat. From there, I knew I was in for an adventure. It's like this anime is not even trying to be good because, while its story is quite simple, it manages to stay interesting. The characters are also still great like they've always been and even side characters get a lot of shining moments. Also, Bakugou finally gets the true character development I've been waiting for.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that I've always loved about MHA is it's use of substance over style in fight scenes. MHA does not have the flashiest battles, with only quick snippets of fights containing high-quality animation, but they have the strongest heart and emotion. The strong voice acting and killer soundtrack in literally every battle give me massive goosebumps. The exaggerated impact of every attack from characters make them all the more satisfying when they hit. Most importantly, 1 on 1 battles don't last several episodes. Again, they are quick and to the point.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to describe MHA in two words, they would be \"action-packed\". This anime is simply loaded. Even though its third season remains to be simple like it always has been, it still remains to be exciting and constantly entertaining. I didn't want to make this a long, complex review because if you've stuck with MHA for this long, you should expect what made you love it from day one.\\n\\n\r\nBest Moment:\\n\r\nMidoriya vs. Bakugou 2",

            "content": "My hero academia was the most anticipated anime of the year. MHA surpassed my expectations once again. If you enjoyed the first two season then it's unlikely that you would dislike this season. Expect lots of action and character development in this show. The new characters and fight scenes were the highlights of this anime. This anime is perfect for both the casual and veteran anime watcher. Every week MHA always had you on your seat and begging for the next twenty-minute episode the moment it finished. MHA surpasses most shounen anime by having great pacing, realistic and relatable characters, and the antagonists being veryinteresting and not one dimensional. My only problem with MHA would have to be Bakugo. Like I never understood why he's such a liked character. If you met a person who acted like Bakugo you would hate him. Bakugo is one of the only characters who aren't realist or relatable. Other than that MHA is an anime I would recommend to everyone including nonanime fans.       \\n\\n\r\nStory: The two arcs that MHA covers in the twenty-five episodes, have amazing pacing and theme. First, as I mentioned, MHA does an amazing job on pacing which many shounen anime lacks (cough cough one piece and naruto still great anime even with bad pacing). The number of episodes of both arcs was perfect not much to add. Second is the theme. We can fight over the main theme but I believe that the main theme is Heros vs Villans or to what extent is a hero considered a hero. After the Stain mini-arc, this theme became extremely apparent. To elaborate more, are people like endeavor even heroes? Can the villains justify their actions? These are targeted heavily during this season. I would rate the story very good (eight out of ten). \\n\\n\r\nArt: Bones is a legendary studio that did an amazing job on the art and animation. It won't be a surprise if MHA wins the best animation in the next Crunchyroll awards. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Anyone who rates the sound lower than a nine is wrong. the openings and endings of all seasons have mostly been outstanding. the OST of MHA is also outstanding. OST's like you say run, I am here, Mind of evil, darkness dominates the heart, and many more creates emotion and fear into the scenes. Which makes the show even better. The sound is definitely one of the better things about MHA. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were great. The new characters really made the show great. Like I discussed in my opening the characters (except Bakugo) are very realistic and relatable. If Bakugo wasn't in MHA then I would have rated Character a ten out of ten. I'll explain three characters in depth just to elaborate on why I believe the characters were amazing.\\n\r\nOchaco Uraraka- I was surprised this season by the crazy development Uraraka got. Before the season started I believed she was just going to be another love interest for the main protagonist but boy was I wrong. In the last arc, she makes the conclusion that she likes Deku but wants to focus on being the best hero she can be. I loved this because this didn't follow the typical shounen formula \\n\r\nHimiko Toga- Toga made this season very interesting by adding someone crazy who likes Deku. (Best girl fight me) Toga creates this unexpected aspect to the story where you have no idea what she's going to do next. \\n\r\nInasa Yoarashi- Yoarashi was an interesting character because he brought a new perspective to the story. Shoto hates his dad and wants to surpass him in any way he can. The unique perspective Inasa gave was that he thought endeavor and shoto looked the same. This realization gave Shoto huge character development that he needed to surpass his dad in a way that didn't require him to act like his dad.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I don't need to add too much to this one other than I enjoyed season three very much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you're looking for a shounen or highschool anime then this is the show for you. non-anime fan and anime veteran, this show is still enjoyable no matter what and I highly recommend it plus ultra. \\n\\n\r\nThanks so much for reading the whole thing. Hopefully, this review was helpful.   \\n",

            "content": "I'd hate to say that this series' staggering number of critics had the last laugh in the end. Well, they won't have it this season, that's for sure. But I had a number of issues with this season compared to the previous ones that have me worried that they will have that last laugh in the forseeable future.\r\nFirst let me just knock out the carry-over attributes of this season right away. The story and characters- provided you actually ARE a fan of BNHA in the first place- are still as excellent as ever. It does nothing new, but does everything well (I hope I'm thefirst one to say that phrase because it's really catchy). The voice acting is also really good and the art and animation is superb when it needs to be. The main issues with this season pertain to the actual execution of this excellent story by the studio Bones. As such the bulk of this review will split down the middle and cover the shows two halves- its cours- individually and with a couple of minor spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nFirst Cour- 10/10, Perfect: This first half of the show really isn't all that bad. In fact, it's the best this anime series has ever done. There really isn't anything to say about this cour since it was done so darn well.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing to note about this cour is that it ends off on one of the fan-favorite arcs of the series and one of the most important in the actual context of the world of the series. Not since One Piece have I ever seen a fictional society actually influenced on such a fundamental level by the actions taken by individual characters. The consequences of what occur here will carry over into the next half of this season, the bulk of the fourth season, and probably stick all the way to the end of the ongoing manga. It's THAT important!\\n\\n\r\nNow if only the second cour was that simple...\\n\\n\r\nSecond Cour- 7/10, Hm...: This is where it gets fishy. It is natural to expect that the very next arc after the one in the first cour wouldn't be able to top that previous arc at all. Still, the arc that takes up most of this cour is a very solid and enjoyable one.\\n\\n\r\nIF BONES DIDN'T SCREW IT UP.\\n\\n\r\nRemember back in the old days when it took an entire cour for Planet Namek to blow up \"in five minutes\"? Well we get a couple of prickling sensations of those old days here.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off the pacing was pretty slow. The main arc of this cour was not really that long in the manga, and yet Bones decided to stretch it out. They even put filler in! In fact, I actually SKIPPED episode 20, since I had known ahead of time that it was a full filler episode. I mean, at least most of the other filler is seemlessly worked into the current arc, which does happen IN ADDITION to episode 20, but in the end, filler is filler. It's made to pad out the show so that the manga can pull ahead or so they can end the season off on a multiple of 5 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, it does get better in the arc's aftermath. We FINALLY get the payoff of Bakugo's character arc that took all of two seasons to buildup, and also get introduced to the next set of newcomers who will play major roles in the next season, and who will inevitably be put on the chopping block like everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10: Although I really liked it, this was my least favorite season of the anime so far. With the presence of the filler episodes, OVAs, the feature film, and the videogame, the series has definitely become quite the cash cow, which sets the stages for it to be brutally butchered beyond redemption.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully mangaka Horikoshi cares enough about it- as if it were his own child- to know when to end it off at the right time (I have no clue what's going on in that man's head but I can at least hope). But as far as Bones with the anime adaptation is concerned, I'm worried. I might be overthinking it and season 4 will still be pretty darn good, but it really isn't that likely considering what Shounen Jump's other juggernauts have been subject to over the years.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless this season is still very, very good and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the previous two.",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT\r\nAfter a great first season and an absolutely stellar second season, My Hero Academia delivers yet again albeit with a few minor bumps\r\nSTORY 9: It might be a shounen but it is so wonderfully executed that it manages to keep things fresh and original. The first half of the season is a 10, some great villains and fight in the training arc and capped off with the superb All Might V All for One showdown. Honestly no negatives at all. The secong half is a bit of a let down after that high but i look at it like a necessary evil to progressthe story and while not great, it certainly isn't boring. The world of My Hero Aca is becoming bigger too and we are starting to see some big loSses for the heroes while the villains make gains.\\n\\n\r\nART 10: It's Bones so of course its great. The fights are animated very well and that almost dance like sequence in the Bakugo V Deku fight was a standout for me\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8: Nice OP's and i think its the first time i've actually noticed the background music. Top notch\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 9: Deku is starting to grow up a bit and Bakugo continues to fascinate. Villains personalities stand out particularly All for One, Dabi, Toga and Twice. Also got a nice intro to the big 3 heading into the next season.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9: I want to give it a 10 because in some ways i think its the best season to date but the Hero License arc just brings it down a tad. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 9: This series gets better and better. While the 2nd half of the season may not be the best i have to give this a 9 because the first half was just that good. The only negative i have is the world still feels small although its better with regard to previous season but this will change so i'm not too bothered by it. The next arc will be lit.",

And it's a shounen series.\r\nIt's about superhero, and a kid who wants to be number 1 hero.\r\nMy opinion, this season is far more interesting than the last one. It has more plot and character development. \r\nBut, just like last season, the first half are more interesting than the second half. In this season, the first half is about the villains attack (you remember the villain attack from season 1? Yes, it's similiar), and the second half is about superheroschool sol and... it kind of boring, if i would say.\\n\\n\r\nBut, you will not much mind it because of the animation and the ost. Yes, its amazing.\\n\\n\r\nI think the staff did a great job to this one.

It, along with Attack on Titan, have undoubtedly been the hottest things in the anime world over the last several years. And with popularity comes opinions. \r\nThere are plenty of fans that will decry this series as overrated or at least overhyped. To be honest, I was sort of in that camp before this season. I liked, but did not love, season 1 or 2. It was a fun series but nothing about it popped off the screen to me. I wouldwatch an episode and usually not think about it until the next week. \\n\\n\r\nThis changed in season 3. The fights reached new levels of hype. Multiple characters interesting or fun enough to establish themselves as favorites throughout anime community. The music and voice acting were incredible across the board. The big moments felt... well, big. And more visceral. Everything about the third season was a step ahead of the first two.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, while some may consider this blasphemous, season 3 approached Hunter x Hunter (2011)-levels of battle shounen fun and euphoria for me. If an anime can give me goosebumps, it's doing something right, and this season of MHA was one of the few do accomplish this feat. It quickly became one of those shows I looked forward to each and every week. \\n\\n\r\nReally the only thing keeping me from scoring this a 10 was the 2nd half couldn't replicate the excellence of the 1st. Other that, it gave me about everything I could ask for from this genre.",

            "content": "This review is solely for the licensing exam arc and particularly for the first part.(No mentioning of second + further parts of the arc. It will contain MAJOR spoilers for the first part)\r\nThe first arc of this season, the camp training to the final battle between All Might and All for One, was amazing. The episodes flowed smoothly, many characters had time to be shown growth, and the story overall left an impact in the world with All Might's decision after the battle with All for One. However, the episodes that come after this culmination is a disaster. \r\nIn a battle, there are ones thatwant to show off powers and others that actually have meaning; whether it be character growth or moving the plot along. Neither traits were shown in the FIRST part of the licensing exam arc which is why it should be skipped. \\n\\n\r\nThis arc felt that it focused on some characters while no one really grew as a person. They showed off their moves and won the battle. That's it. There were 5 main battles: Todoroki, Momo's group, Bakugou's group, Midoriya's group, and Aoyama's group.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[spoiler]For Todoroki, he showed that he can produce fire and ice at the same time but his battle ended in 3-4 minutes with no character growth and had irrelevant filler antagonists. (Only fans of this character cares because he's sooooo cooooool)\\n\\n\r\nFor momo's group which felt like the longest battle, the only one who seemed to have fought is momo. Jirou fought but was following momo's orders at the end.  The frog and the parasite guy did nothing. Momo could have grown a little with her mindset driven by Midoriya's actions taken in the previous arc, but her battle didn't make much sense. The supreme all girl high school wanted to entrap four yuuei students while their team had approximately eight to ten people. The rules state that in order for one person to pass, they must take down two people. So why entrap the strongest students from the area only to allow two people to pass? (Just because they know yuuei's powers doesn't mean sht. If you know someone's strength and it's strong af, would you run or fight?) Even if they meant to keep trapping other people who would come along, as more people pass, the less support the rest of the girls would get. Trapping isn't really the key to winning this part of the exam. Also when the coolers start to turn on, Momo's idea of not creating a \"lighter\" because the sprinklers would go off, is stupid. Create an umbrella or yet, just break the sprinklers with your hands so that you don't have to waste your limited \"energy\". This was one of the WORST excuses in the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn the last scene of the battle, the elite school girl traps momo in the room and doesn't run. Instead she decides to get points off of momo. But even if she did win the fight, she would still be short on points to pass the exam and three other yuuei students would be on her tail. In conclusion, the enemy's \"smart\" leader wasn't so smart after all. (Could I also mention again that the frog and parasite did nothing. Don't they feel bad for relying on others to pass entirely.)\\n\\n\r\nFor bakugou's battle, I liked how kaminari was the center of the battle instead of bakugou. However, why was the enemy there in the first place? He had more than 10 people lying around, all who were vulnerable. Couldn't he have passed the exam right away?\\n\\n\r\nMidoriya's battle went alright. Their plan wasn't awful like momo's and it went well. They stayed in the main area (where you should be) and defeated others.\\n\\n\r\nAoyama's battle could be said that Aoyama grew as a character. He went from a coward to a bit courageous by shooting his beam to attract enemies in order to allow his friends to pass. Sure. But what confused me was when we get a glimpse of his past, we learned how... he was different? His lines states the following: \"Papa Maman, Why am I different from everyone else?\" \"The shape of my dreams\" \"I always wanted to be equal\"\\n\\n\r\nWhat? What does he mean? As the viewer, I don't understand. Even Iida says this, \"Aoyama, I don't know what you want to be equal with, because I don't know what you're measuring yourself up against...\"\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it will be explained later on. But for now, it's an enigma which doesn't make sense. So why not skip this first part of the exam and make it a bit more conclusive?\\n\\n\r\nShindou was a one shot character that was introduced and used his power to split the class apart. Aside from that, he didn't get a chance to do anything yet. Hopefully he can get a bit more screen time later.\\n\\n\r\nThe wind guy is introduced then put to the side. Again, I see no point in having this first part of the exam when you can skip to the next part of the exam from the beginning. If so, the strong wind guy can knock people out IN FRONT OF the class 1A's student to show off his strength. This way, we can see how the class is affected by his supreme strength. (Also to mention that his powers are still not known to any of class 1A's students yet. So why the more not?)\\n\\n\r\nUsing this information, if every character (That we are supposed to care) passed this part of the exam, why include it? Their skills can still be shown off in the next part of the exam and the same would have happened, except more. If the next part decides to put in more character growth, we would not only would see their growths but their new and improved powers, which would make the show more compelling. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I want to mention the whole first part of the exam from the rule's perspective. A student will get six balls, and have to defeat two students by hitting all three of their targets on their body. The targets have to be exposed at all times. My first problem is that this exam is the least relevant fight to what a true hero has to do in all of MHA. We've seen students have to fight robots, fight other students, and go through obstacle courses quickly. These are events which might occur as a hero but throwing a limited number of balls at people? What relevance has this to do with being a hero? \\n\\n\r\nGoing a bit off topic, the author has made a few mistakes in this series. I'm pretty sure he didn't like the hoodie that Midoriya wore so he kept it off on the character all the time. Midoriya has also yelled out \"a million percent smash!\" which wasn't really a thing. (The author claims that it's Midoriya's spirit which is bs since he never does it again i.e. it was a mistake) But not all author's are perfect and that's fine. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, when the transforming girl took off her jacket which had the targets on, it perplexed me. Are you allowed to do that? Why doesn't every student who saw her mimic that? All they aren't allowed to do was to hide it underneath their body/clothes so why not take their clothes off and put it somewhere safe? Again, this is probably because the author wanted the comedic moment which actually harmed the premise of the exam.[/spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I didn't see any huge character growth but one could say that \"this part of the exam was to show off the classes powers\" or \"the second part is where it gets better\". My response to those statements are, why not just skip this entire part and move on to the second part? No relevant character failed the exam yet, no one grew largely as a character, and showing off their new moves in the next part wouldn't be so bad.",

            "content": "Seeing as season 3 is coming to an end I'd like to express what I feel, ok so yes I did say that it's not original in the past that other shounens have done the things shown but differently but hey Boku No Hero Academia was pretty enjoyable especially season 3, I would love it if the fights were a bit longer tho because I mean if the studio has potential to make the manga come to life making it look so beautiful then I would love it if the fights were longer it would be so much more enjoyable if it was a tadbit longer now moving on to the characters gotta say Deku is becoming a bit more lovable and less of a cry cry baby although he does cry every once in a while but not as much, in season 3 especially he has shown us his manly parts \ud83d\ude02.\\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation is plus ultra the quality of the animation never dips or drops below your expectations instead they go beyond your expectations which is pretty dope also they added a bit of filler but it's not bad filler it's decent filler, the thing with filler is how you handle it and they did it pretty good not so long like 5 episodes of filler instead it was just 1 episode and it was brilliantly done compared to other animes they tend to not use much brains or put much work in fillers but Boku No Hero Academia puts a bit more work into fillers which is also enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound and OST oh gosh the person working on the soundtrack is legit godly not as godly as Sawano Hiroyuki but they are awesome I do hope Sawano Hiroyuki will one day work on Boku No Hero Academia Soundtrack in the future, but nevertheless the current person who is working on it is pretty amazing during fights, during a hype moment, during a sad moment they never fail to deliver a amazing piece of work to make it fit so d*mn well.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are the most appealing factors of this anime series as I said Deku character was amazing during season 3 but I'd give the gold medal to Bakugou he won me over especially his Japanese Voice Actor the guy is LEGENDARY for those of you who are familiar with the magical index series remember Accelerator yup well Accelerator is basically voiced by the same guy, I know some people hate Bakugou mainly because he was a bully but let's be honest I get that you hate him for that but his character is one of the best why well he can grow this way and become a better person character development he has room to grow as a human, besides people if someone is acting rude to you then you would avoid that person yet Deku kept following Bakugou that's kinda weird it's like Deku is a masochistic lol\ud83d\ude02 but the logical thing would be ok this perosn clearly doesn't like me I'll keep my distance but nope, but all in all their relationship is complicated asf even more so than Naruto and Sasuke.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall I liked season 3 a lot more than season 1, season 2 was pretty awesome as well it's like the series keeps getting better and better with each season or every season outclasses the previous one, anyway most people will enjoy season 3 a lot just wish the fights was a bit longer not dragged out but longer and when they was in the license arc wish each character or the main ones had one individual battle etc Deku Vs somone for 1 episode, Todoriki Vs someone for 1, Bakugou Vs someone for 1 episode.\\n\r\nAnyway this is long I'll end it here",

My bias won't let me drop this season from a 10/10. A more critical overview of it the show probably lands at an 8/10 due to the fact that after the training camp and rescue arc the provisional license arc is arguably the weakest in the show thus far as well as the manga. That's not a knock against the arc I really enjoy what this arc does and if in my opinion the weakestarc lands brings the show down to an 9/10 (averaged cause the training camp/rescue arc is easily 10/10) then the show is still damn good.",

            "content": "I feel this was a solid season. It introduced us to a lot of aspects about the world that were fun. A lot of quirks that were interesting to see in action, and characters that I hope are expanded upon later. It does get sloppy in the overall planning and character motivations departments that completely take you out of what is happening. \r\nThe first half of the season is very strong. It answers some great questions about the world and introduces some great character arcs for the main character to have achieved. Him actually saving someone and being fulfilled by it is a cozy littlearc that also bled into the character he was saving in very uplifting ways. The expansion on the MC's mother was very welcome. She acts very much like a mother and the iteration between All Might and her was very emotionally satisfying. Every character that is expanded upon acts in very real and emotionally relateable ways. This leads into one of the most detours of the series where it greatly explains a lot about All Might and the arch nemesis that the previous seasons where debating. The climax is very emotional. You will most likely know how it ends, but it is one of the best shonen moments because of how the character of All Might was built up for so long.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems start to arise in the second half. Not entirely because of how it is built, but the major character motivations and results. A lot of it stems from not following the very first line it lays down in the series about no one being equal. For example, it feels it has to always get every single character from the class to the same point. It undermines what it wants to do about showing some of these characters fail. A lot of deus ex machina or saved by the bell types of scenarios that save characters who failed from their failures or character flaws. So when you know every single character is going to get to a certain point then there is no tension, especially after the first arc in this season. Because of the first arc and then leading into the second half everything feels so flat. The second season for instance had a competition, and the stakes there did not feel flat compared to the second half of that season. No one is in any real danger and it is very clear that this is not the only chance they will be able to complete this task. The MC, though continues to be a very great voice in the competition though. He shows leadership skills and learns more about independence versus cooperation in relation to becoming a hero. \\n\\n\r\nThe most underwhelming character arcs in the second part of the season are with another very powerful user who has a vendetta against a student from the main class. The teenager from another school hates him and his family for very petty reasons. Like his father not giving an autograph. Basically a few of these petty actions. This hatred is so pathetic and it is not humored in that way so it comes off very self important. They do this when one of the people he hates could easily be hated because the father is literally explained to be a wife beating, eugenics supporter, who buys his wife to impregnate her for his own selfish purposes. He is already pretty evil and it still focuses on such a petty thing he has done. In addition, the relationship between this father and son is so fleshed out from what was introduced before. The son is basically a eugenics project and it never really expands upon what that means. His actual feelings are not really touched on at all through the season. Also, the father is never really touched on about his eugenics or actions and it still accepted as a hero and not in a way where it takes a look at the hierarchy in place from a cynical point of view. They are basically saying that yeah what he did was bad and hoping you forget about it for now until they come up with something. Its very sloppy. \\n\\n\r\nThe main Comic relief character, Minoru, is still very annoying and creepy. He is a creep and his fixation of women is not funny as much as it is dangerous. It plays it like a joke, but he is just accepted anyway which does not make much sense. He is such a boring character too. He does not do much and does not add to anything besides just being an excuse to focus on underage girls which makes his appearance even more creepy from the point of a viewer. \\n\\n\r\nI love romance, but the main romance in this series, that was introduced is so lazy. Obviously we know who will eventually end up with some romance, but it does not escalate their relationship in any way. It does not show them hanging out alone together or expanding up their relationship. This is kind of minor though because the girl has a crush and those tend to be pretty surface based. But it introduces that the MC is interested in her too in the first season so for him to basically forget about it, unless necessary, makes it seem like it is very one sided. What is annoying is it takes so long for this girl to even realize her infatuation with the MC that it just becomes an annoyance rather than an escalation. What it does right is it shows that she is attracted to the MC's qualities and appearance in addition to his actions promoting his growth. I get what it wants to go for, but it stumbles on how they grow to like each other. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing is the focus on the two rivals towards the end. Their fights make the focus something completely adjacent to what it actually is and makes it seem resolved. The MC loves his rival so much and the rival hates him because he is insecure about someone who was once quirkless looking at him as though he was better. The problem arises when the rival is treated as though he was simply born a better person. His anger stems from his own pride being undermined, but then it throws in how he was kidnapped from earlier in the season. It is a mess of a final confrontation because it has no clear point that it gets confusing. The MC finally stands up for himself, but it is to help his rival rather than stand up for him, but he is also standing up for him, and the rival feels like he isnt good enough, but he knows he is good enough. It gets really confusing when all this is compounded and contradictory. It should focus on why the rivals views are wrong and their mutual respect at the end or something akin to that. \\n\\n\r\nthis may seem negative, but I still did have fun. I hope they explore some of the themes that they introduced in the beginning like hierarchical structures, eugenics, and other fascist themes, but it seems to be going down a more generic route. It is still fresh, and an enjoyable watch.",

It's got everything a superhero anime needs - cool designs, over the top action beautifully animated by Studio Bones and a protagonist slowly learning how to become the strongest hero. A shounen show with some of the tropes and definitely all of the strengths. \r\nIt does unfortunately have some of the anime worlds', or should I say manga worlds' weaknesses - such as a pervy character being played off for fun and sometimespretty still frames during dialogue. A character will seem very simple, then infodumps will be made during a battle which works in a manga but feels a bit stilted when you constantly go from adrenaline pumping power fests to down-to-earth chilling scenes of horror-imagery. There's also a questionable choice of sakuga-moment (seemingly perfect flow in animation, which is rare as it will drain the budget) which I felt could have been used in THE big showdown of the season.\\n\r\nSeason 3 is also the weakest one so far in terms of story, as it becomes a bit unfocused.\\n\\n\r\nBy the miracle of great voice acting, music and last but NOT least, beautiful animation I forgive each and every one of those faults. I enjoyed the frikkin helooza out of this show. It is a mix of the Japanese medium and the American-style superhero stories. Whilst season 2 had the strongest episodes so far, this one has truly developed into an ensemble show where you wanted to see all the characters grow beyond their limits and seeing that new episode available was enough to get my blood pumping.\\n\\n\r\nPlus Ultra!",

Even more characters got more spotlights, it introduced a fresh new array of heroes and even fresher new array of villains and antagonists. The new villains are absolutely incredible. Not 1 villain is the same and that goes for the rest of the heroes. Every character is unique and has their own flair and artistic style. Stellar fights, great creation on the \"anime powers\" and some of the most unexpected emotional scenes in all of anime. It is now competing for #1 with Hunter x Hunter inmy opinion. I am a huge huge fan of all of the new villains and heroes and I love the main cast even so much more in this season as it shows that everyone has a different, emotional side to them no matter what is it.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime will become one of the best anime's of all time and I can't wait to see whats next. Go beyond, plus ultra!",

Unlike annoying pair Sasuke and Sakura or every character from Black Clover, I dislike none of MHA characters, in fact I do like lots of them.\r\nStory: 9\r\nGreat story, Emotional sometimes, Funny most of the time, Exciting from time to time. Deku made me believe that he is a true hero by heart. \r\nArt: 7\r\nLike how the creator design each one uniquely\r\nSound: 8 \r\nGreat. \r\nCharacter: 10\r\nNo annoying characters to me so far, some may look uselessat first but thanks to the creator, he put afford into each one of them. There is no Sasuke, Sakura, or Asta here. I can praise each one of the character all day but let's just go straight to my top 4!\\n\r\n1. Kacchan: Oh my young Bakugo!, the more I watch him, the more I obsess with him. What a unique character, a top class student delinquent. 10 10 10 for my boy!!!\\n\r\n2. Deku: This boy always find his way to move my emotion. What an optimistic and a strong heart boy\\n\r\n3. All Might: \"I'm here!\" and his SMILE at all time is a 10 10 10!!\\n\r\n4. Aoyama Yuuga: I wish he appears more often. He is a character that always brighten up the scene. His smiley face is my fav. He made me laugh by doing nothing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nI really do enjoy the show and wander why have I postponed it til now. A while back, I tried to decide between Black clover and MHA, but I went for Black Clover, and I made the wrong choice. MHA is another level of Anime. I finished all 3 seasons in 5 days.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The third season of Boku No Hero Academia was kind of a bummer. \r\nI don't remember if I felt this way about previous seasons, but this time around the pacing was awful. I think the show is too ambitious and not enough happens per season. \r\nDuring the training camp arc, their focus was just all over the place. Like that arc had some amazing fights in it... but there are too many characters. Taking the time to zero in on each of their quirks and to show their growth/fighting just really bogged down the series for me. Like the chaos that broke out with thevillains descending on the camp? In real time that fight was probably less than an hour long but it was SO MANY EPISODES and not enough actually happened per episode!!! The highlight of that arc was Midoriya's fight with Muscular because it definitely still had his emotions during the fight, but there were less cut scenes with him being deep in thought and more action instead. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough this won't happen, I think the series would benefit from axing 3/4 of the characters. Focus on the main students (Midoriya, Todoroki, Bakugo, Uraraka, & Iida) ...I'd even settle for just the first three to be honest)), a few of the pro heroes/villains and the story would be infinitely better. \\n\\n\r\nAll Might's fight against All For One was great and definitely a really good arc within the season. I didn't even mind the exposition of his students as they watched in horror. The repercussions and fall out of All Might exhausting his power and stepping down as the Symbol of Peace was really great too. I was interested in seeing what would happen with Midoriya because of it this season... but literally nothing happened. BUZZKILL. This is where the season stopped being good. Everything after that went downhill SIGNIFICANTLY. \\n\\n\r\nI was really disappointed and at most times bored. Like yes, of course as a lover of slice of life, shoujo and characters being happy, I loved the idea of the students living in dorms and seeing what their life is like there! Really, I enjoyed that... but it just felt like a distraction from the story. Like more mud to trudge through to get to the meat of the season. I felt it a bit anxiety inducing that the story wasn't moving fast enough, like the episodes were just ticking by and really nothing was happening. \\n\\n\r\nAny fighting that took place was too slow and FULL OF EXPOSITION. Midoriya vs Bakugo was such a letdown. It was mostly just cut shots of them being overcome with emotion and flowery words. (I watch a ton of romance anime, I'm not saying emotions/emotional scenes are bad, but I am ONLY watching BNHA for its action and it being a hero series!!!) This could've been the true highlight of the season! I mean, c'mon we've been waiting for this fight for THREE SEASONS. \\n\\n\r\nI also don't find it believable that despite the way that Bakugo has TRULY tormented Midoriya over the years, treated him like absolute garbage and even inspired his hero name Deku ('Nothing' ) that Midoriya STILL CALLS HIM KA-CHAN? I'M SORRY, THAT IS CRAZY TO ME. I kept seeing reactions to that one scene where Bakugo gives him that backhanded compliment about him making One for All his own power on twitter and everyone's like OH MY GOD, HOW CUTE!!! THAT'S SO GREAT OF BAKUGO!! This kid does the bare minimum. Don't get me wrong, I like Bakugo because he's a ruthless fighter and I think he can be funny... but he's still a jerk. I don't understand how Midoriya has a sense of loyalty to him and considers him a friend. Also, if Midoriya really went all out, he could've won that fight - that bugged me too.\\n\\n\r\n***Also Mineta needs to be removed immediately and the fact that he got his provisional license despite cowering in fear for the majority of the exam INFURIATED ME. Completely unrealistic. Please kill him off - he's not funny at all he's just disgusting.***\\n\\n\r\nI love Shoto Todoroki the most, though. I think his character is truly great and his character design is lovely. His conflicting emotions, personality and overall growth is one of the best parts of the series. I wish they'd do a spinoff of just him, his relationship with his father, Endeavor, and overcoming his own demons. I find him more compelling than Midoriya even though he was mostly in the background of this season. \\n\\n\r\nI have not yet read the manga, but I wonder if the pacing is faster. I think I'll check it out this fall and if it's less bulky, I might switch to it exclusively. \\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like this season more, truly I did. But the second half of the season just seemed a bit ridiculous to me. Even in the season finale when it ended, I was like... 'that's it?'. I'm not sure if I'll watch the fourth season. Positives for the third season of Boku No Hero Academia include: the art was fantastic, the voice acting was great, I really liked the characters and also getting a glimpse into their personal lives this season, and the big fights were pretty great (particularly Midoriya vs Muscular). Worth checking out if you're invested in these characters and like how the story has been progressing.",
