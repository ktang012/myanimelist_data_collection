            "content": "I\u2019m not sure why I picked Just Because! But anyway it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. \r\nThe series at its core is a character-centric; which mean that no matter how the characters became; whether they're reach their goals or not, it is became a part of and affecting the story. There\u2019s no big overarching plot to draw the viewers in actually. It\u2019s pretty much about these five Student, and how their lives will play out over the next few months. The story essentially played out by the struggling of this character facing the transition to adulthood and also the problem they get wheninteracting with each other.\\n\\n\r\nIt sounds like typical slice of life but certainly it doesn\u2019t. What makes show a little bit different in my eyes is how 'calm' the presentation is handled. Anime or most of high school anime in general tend to be bogged down by gimmicks, but it did not happen here. The mood is very calm and smooth, the pacing is deliberately slow, most of the characters are quiet and soft-spoken, making the show to be quite atmospheric. Of course being different doesn\u2019t equal to being better, but at least it is nice that every now and then you could watch some drama where you can just sit back and relax and not getting pumped up by bizarre presentation.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, since the story may sound quite alright at best, thankfully it did deliver (even more) on its focus which is the characters. Although, I have heard many peoples complain about the characters of this series because they seems had no personalities but certainly I am not one of these people. I personally think that the characters in this series is fantastic with each of them has their own motives and justify reason to do what they acts. \\n\r\nObviously in this series Komiya might be the clearest who has a motives for what she did; she just want to save her club; and doing anything to do so. Haruto always feels left behind. Everyone\u2019s talking about entrance exams and going to college. They have their futures ahead of them. On the other hand, everything has already been decided for him, since he\u2019ll need to work and he feels powerless. Hazuki\u2019s college won\u2019t have a band. At best, it has a band appreciation club. So for now, there are no plans to continue playing the trumpet once she graduates from high school. She failed to reach nationals in high school, so She feels it might be the best just try to graduate as soon as she can, and living normal life by join her family business. Mio is struggling with her college entrance exam and she can\u2019t denied the fact that Haruto confessed to Hazuki and she likes Haruto. Eita doesn\u2019t has any problem with his academics since he got a recommendation but then again he likes Mio, but Mio likes someone else, so he just trying his best to catch her attention. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless It is safe to say that the characters is quite interesting in their own way and had some setup to be fully developed till the end of the series. Although it is worth to mention they don\u2019t have loud, tropey, tsundere or \u2018genky\u2019 characters. So the series  might not very \u2018lively\u2019 if you are the type to like some banter or comedy because there\u2019s hardly any . But these character traits are not executed in such an overblown way that you end up thinking you\u2019re interacting with zombies.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the visuals, it is worth to mention that the anime really likes to show its characters face exclusively and most of the time you can tell how the character\u2019s feel or whether they\u2019re lying or not which I think is quite interesting. As for the other thing in visual, the show does suffer from production issues.. a lot. The animation isn\u2019t very quite standard of today. The characters perspective looks wrong and the backgrounds aren\u2019t that amazing considering how many these guys are hanging out. Luckily enough, the anime doesn\u2019t have the type of story that really demands any sort of visual fidelity and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard or nor I did the studio behind this anime has much record on its names. \\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, I like the Opening, \u201cOver and Over\u201d by Yanagi Nagi who also sung for \u2018Oregairu\u2019  I think her song and voiced very suited with school drama and this one is no different. The ending is another story because I tend to skip it so I may miss something there. The soundtrack is good albeit not memorable enough to catch your attention but it does serve is purpose. The acting is too plain and uninteresting for my taste but at the very least I don\u2019t hate it. All In all the sound does it best to complement the story but none of it will blow you away (Maybe the opening though but I guess that just me). \\n\\n\r\nThe very length of the series, which is just 12 episodes, also aids the story, as it is long enough to explore these characters to a point and not so long as to need more than what was presented. This made the anime simple and casual, giving the content of what was presented a bit more impact, without anything being stretched out for too long. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I wouldn\u2019t go as far as say the anime is unique; In fact, one could say that the story is a remarkably common one. However at the very least the series stays clear of many of the annoyances of romance stories and not throwing in all kinds of situations solely intended to add drama and spice things up. Added with the fact that the series keeping up with the sense of realism (which I think done a great job) but never feels to depressing considering how the series ended. \\n\\n\r\nIn this respect, I suppose I just appreciate Just Because!\u2019s sharper focus. It\u2019s far less ambitious, and far less grand in scope, but it did many many things correctly and easily became one of my favorite romance anime in recent years. \\n\\n\r\nYes, the ending overall is quite pandering and certainly flashback are needed for the romance part. But we can't have all the nice things can we?",

            "content": "Senior year of high school is like a train station. \r\nPick a train to decide your future. You can\u2019t say for sure what lies at your destination, but you know for certain it will take you away from your school and friends you made there. This is the theme that Just Because puts forward with its story of seniors deciding their futures and many train station scenes. However, it does not have the intimacy necessary for these themes to be believable.\r\nSlice of life shows live or die on how intimate they are. And no, I do not mean romance. I mean the show's connection tothe audience. Without that crucial connection, you might as well be watching bugs run around for all it matters. A lack of intimacy is what prevents Just Because from being engaging. \\n\\n\r\nI have no doubt that the show has subtle character interactions that allow the viewer to make their own interpretations, but when it\u2019s so hard to give a damn about any of them it\u2019s impossible to feel engaged to anything happening on screen. \\n\\n\r\n[Story: 4/10]\\n\r\nAfter elementary school, you typically fall apart from your classmates. The story of Just Because is those kids coming back together in high school and meeting up again. Eita Izumi left his town after elementary school but now that he has transferred back to his friends' town he is reconnecting with them. \\n\r\nThe story is as basic as it needs to be for the slice-of-life and romance genres. We've seen this structure many times over, and it is not at all improved upon in this show. It follows 5 high school students through their everyday lives. They study to get into universities, hone their talents, and try to get dates. The show jumps around at such an inconsistent pace between the 5 characters that it's hard to get a grip on who they are and what motivates them, beyond a shallow description. Characters walk around or sit about with bored looking expressions on their faces, forcing the viewer to mimic their feelings. \\n\r\nJust Because wouldn't be the first show I recommend to someone interested in a realistic young adult romance. I wish I could say that the characters make up for what the show lacks in story, but they don\u2019t. In the first few episodes, the story moves at a snail's pace, giving us a few small details about the central characters but also long drawn out scenes to establish atmosphere. Eventually, the pacing gets better. Once all of the characters are clearly established the final half of the show is made up of somewhat entertaining if overwrought melodrama over little petty moments. Moments like going on certain characters going out on dates then the effects it has on the third wheel who's in love with one of the two on the date (trying to keep it spoiler free, sorry to be vague). \\n\\n\r\nI'd say I was disappointed by the ending, but it really is consistent with expectations the show instills in its audience. It's a bleak and quiet moment that puts forth the theme one last time 'there's beauty in simplicity', but it felt so undeserved to me. It felt like a contradiction to the build-up in the previous episodes and I couldn't help but think \"Why couldn't this have happened six episodes ago?\". Very little of the melodrama experienced throughout the prior episodes felt necessary by the end. \\n\\n\r\n[Character: 5/10]\\n\r\nJust Because aims to create realistic characters, yet it fails to develop them enough to even be believable. Sure, very boring people like these characters could exist in the real world, but who would want to subject themselves to watching their bland lives? \\n\\n\r\nSome of them are sort of likable (if you can tolerate their personalities) but I didn\u2019t care for any of them individually. The only time I was ever interested in the characters was when they were with one another. Whether it be their arguments, them making fond memories, or considering their futures. I just couldn\u2019t get myself to care about them while they stare off into space trying to seem deep. We get it Just Because! Your characters are sooooo tragic!! They're going to college, wow! Maybe you can tell us something else about them\u2026 like who they are as people beyond the fact that they\u2019re going to college next year. For example; Haruto plays baseball and likes a girl, great, who is he though? Why does he like her? Is there anything more to his life than baseball and a crush? All signs say no. \\n\\n\r\nThis sentiment could be applied to any of the leads. I found them to be very one-sided and it destroyed the potential for Just Because to be an intimate slice of life. The show only takes it's characters half way to becoming good, then it stops leaving us half-baked hollow shells (filled with awkward silences and depression). In the end, I just couldn\u2019t see the characters as the real people that they were intended to be. There was not enough believability. Even Komiya, the character I liked the most for her outgoing personality, had very little going on besides her camera and crush.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes me the saddest about the characters is that they were nearly good. We're able to get in the headspace of a character and tell if they concealing their emotions, and sometimes if they're lying through the abundance of close-up shots and a very consistent tone. However, the art is pretty bad so those close-ups are ugly and the tone so depressing that it seems to only want to pointlessly wear down your spirit. With a better writer and director, they could have had the believability to compliment their likable personalities. \\n\\n\r\nAt least I can say I got into each of the characters' headspaces and became depressed just like they were. But that headspace was totally vacant of interesting details!! I can relate to the IDEA of high schoolers who are struggling to decide their futures at the crossroads of their lives, but no amount of relatable ideas will get me invested in these cardboard cutouts.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 4/10]\\n\r\nPine Jam dropped the ball on this one. Their last show Gamers didn\u2019t look nearly as rough as this. It\u2019s plagued with weak character art and poor animation. I\u2019m not sure if it was just a simple budget issue or if they couldn\u2019t handle a project as intimate as this, but it to put it bluntly; it\u2019s harsh on the eyes. If you want to make a quiet coming of age story then you need close-ups to get the audience into the character\u2019s headspace. That's not to say that Just Because doesn\u2019t try to close-ups, but when it does they\u2019re so ugly you'll wish the camera would zoom back out.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds look nice if a bit gray. I can praise how the mellow colors of the characters and backgrounds blend together. It makes the characters feel just as melancholy as the cold winter town, but keep in mind the show strives to make you feel this depressing atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nWhat weighs down the visuals the most is the lackluster directing. Most scenes have very boring camera angles, usually pulled far back from the characters making them feel very disconnected from the viewer. Rarely does the director create intimate moments that connect the viewer to a character, they usually feel like random extras in a greater story that has yet to materialize. Even during the scenes in the characters' homes, there is very little detail to show who those characters are. Their rooms are devoid of defining details. So many opportunities to create believable characters were missed, it's sad really, to see a director waste such great potential. \\n\r\nThere\u2019s a bit of CGI usage during the later episodes to no doubt to cut down on the budget (most notably that awkward and overlong first-person bicycling scene).\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 5/10]\\n\r\nThe opening song is quite good but it sounds very similar to Oregairu\u2019s. Which shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise considering they\u2019re both performed by Nagi Yanagi. I would feel more inclined to score it higher if it didn\u2019t feel like a simple rehashing of an op from a better show in the same genre. \\n\r\nMost scenes have music playing which is nice to keep the show from becoming entirely empty during the simpler scenes. Typically it's orchestral music with a piano at the core. It highlights the mundanity of life by being so basic and plain, but yeah that plainness is boring as hell so... If that thematic consistency sounds appealing to you then maybe it will add something to your experience with it. I think it does a decent job of establishing tone, but I couldn't care less about how it actually sounds because there have been so many fantastic soundtracks of its kind in this year alone. This one's just passable. \\n\r\nThe voices are just as monotonous as you\u2019d expect. I'd love to say this isn't a waste of acting talent, but I honestly can't tell if any of them are talent because they're all forced to perform the same subdued style which gives them little opportunity to give the character some individuality/distinction. Excluding Haruto, his voice actor had a few scenes that allowed us to see his talent, but sadly he was just one of the ensemble cast. And due to the overbearing melancholy tone of the show, he was rarely able to be his peppy self.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 3/10]\\n\r\nIt\u2019s so disappointing that the comedy in Just Because is bad because in the creator\u2019s previous work \u201cThe Pet Girl of Sakurasou\u201d the humor was spot on and made me laugh a lot. There was plenty of good drama in Sakurasou which managed to come across fairly well in Just Because, if only it wasn\u2019t so damn boring.\\n\\n\r\nIts attempts at comedy are dreadful. Typically when jokes are said there is very little feedback and sometimes you can\u2019t tell if it was a joke or just confused writing. The show also uses the social media application Line to show messages between characters. The messages are usually dressed to look like humor with emoticons and such, but the messages are so nondescript that it could be anyone who is texting, they don't at all add to the characters or relatability.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I'm so tough on Just Because is that it has taken on a challenge. If Just Because strived to be just another one of the trashy romcoms that we get every season then I would treat it like trash and just move. \\n\r\nHowever, Just Because has a chooses to be realistic and mundane. I don't believe the creator understood just how difficult it would be to make a compelling viewing experience with such a barren presentation. Instead of aiming to be great it settled on mediocrity, which may have made for a passable show if it was just another harem romcom, but it makes this one feel incredibly underdone. No part of Just Because! is deserving of the exclamation point at the end of its title.\\n\\n\r\nBoredom \u2260 Good\\n\\n\r\n[Overall Score: 4.2/10]\\n\r\nIf you want a standard (and forgettable) high school drama/romance then Just Because has what you\u2019re looking for. That is, as long as you can live with the alienating direction, subpar character art, and a crushingly depressing tone. The humor is cringe-inducing and never funny, but at least the melodrama in the second half is moderately entertaining. \\n\r\nThere can be beauty in simplicity, but nothing in Just Because is beautiful and everything is bland. While it has the bones of a good slice of life show, it fails to come together in an engaging way.",

            "content": "High school can be quite an experience for most young people these days. I remember a time during my high school years when everything seems to feel different. It\u2019s almost like setting foot into a new world with new opportunities. Friends, activities, relationships. It\u2019s a place beyond just about learning but for people to build a future. While it isn\u2019t like college for career building, it definitely gives the chance for opportunities, even for relationships. For Eita Izumi, he comes back from his hometown after 4 years as he reunites with his middle school friends.\r\nAs an original anime, Just Because felt like a breath offresh air despite the simplistic premise. It\u2019s also made by Hajime Kamoshida, the brainchild behind Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. To me, this show stood out as a coming age of story about characters climbing the stairs to adolescence. It\u2019s a time period for characters to develop and grow up to be more than teenagers. At the heart of the show, we have Eita Izumi alongside a group of classmates. The first few episodes gave me the impression of a melancholic story that\u2019s filled with realistic themes that people can connect with. Beyond just the setting, the characters feel real and can be relatable. This is seen through the example of childhood friends Eita, Haruto, and Mio. As the story progresses, we see the relationship dynamics between the trio that will get viewers invested into the storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show like this to work, it had to make its characters feel they belong there. Luckily, Just Because pulls off the right stops through its characters of diverse personalities. Each of the main characters feel different ranging from Mio\u2019s timid personality to Ena\u2019s enthusiasm. It\u2019s what can draw viewers in as we see how they behave around certain characters. Indeed, character chemistry is an important aspect of this show. It connects between characters visually, dramatically, and meaningfully. Romance is slowly paced and not expressed like a shoujo but rather in a melancholic style. To me, this show focuses on relationships through character building. It emphasizes on establishing character personalities first while giving them the chance to shine through them. Ena is a prime example in the show as her character interaction with Eita is often noticeable because of how different she is from him. Some people may interpret the show\u2019s character relationship dynamics as part of destiny, like certain characters are destined to be with one another. However, that\u2019s not truly the case as expectations can be different after realizing the person they want to be with isn\u2019t what they would expect. Honestly, I think this show sells its ideas pretty well to express that.\\n\\n\r\nTo make things run better, the show never forgets about its themes such as adolescence. Every character has a goal for the future and although there\u2019s a feeling of uncertainty, they strive to work towards that. Whether it\u2019s becoming a photographer, be part of a band, or just to go to college, it\u2019s inspiring and realistic. Think about the time when you were in high school and had that feeling of what you wanted to do in life. Relating to this anime doesn\u2019t feel so different, now does it? At the same time, the storytelling continues to build relationships between the main characters. While it feels like a ship tease at times, the show never exaggerates or oversteps its boundaries. The drama is mostly lighthearted and doesn\u2019t force it down viewers\u2019 throats. It keeps its pace steady while getting its point across, like the way it should be. In several ways, the drama of this show is realistic enough to relate and easy to get attached to. There are some awkward segments between certain characters but the timing usually feels right. The downside about the drama is that it occasionally feels formulaic and repetitive. Not to mention, character relationships feel a bit predictable as to who will likely get who in the end. Still, it doesn\u2019t hold the anime back. The characters are all very self-aware and realize what it means to be a high school student. Haruto is a good example as we see his life as a baseball player. The way he adapts to build his future becomes evident like a journey of life discovery. This also expands to other characters such as Mio and Ena. It\u2019s like their chance to climb the stairs to adulthood and high school is one of the biggest steps they have to cross over.\\n\\n\r\nOriginal anime like Just Because doesn\u2019t suffer from adaptation standards but there\u2019s an instinct to recognize if the amount of episode is suited enough. For 12 episodes, it honestly felt just right to sell its story without going over. The first half of the show does a well job at establishing characters like their personalities and roles. The remainder half builds on them through relationships, discoveries, and characterization. It\u2019s like a life journey these characters take for their future and stories like this can be inspirational to viewers. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Pine Jam, this show is expressive at crafting its visual elements. The key visual itself gives an atmospheric feel with characters being at a train station. Besides Eita and Mio, the others are going on about their daily lives like moving with their future. By raw quality though, Just Because\u2019s biggest selling point is the character expressions. It fortifies their personalities and expresses attitude that connects with their personalities. It\u2019s important to realize that human expressions often depict what a person feels at every moment. This anime does a clever job at capitalizing that to make them feel real. On the other hand, I can\u2019t say the character designs are too impressive. Most of the main characters look too normal while the female cast doesn\u2019t stand out much dynamically. Photography is also a part of the show itself and some of the photos taken by Ena doesn\u2019t really make memorable impressions. Still, I think the show hits mark overall. Every character feels very alive and moves the story together.\\n\\n\r\nFor soundtrack and music, it\u2019s clear that Just Because needed a melancholic style to make it work. Thankfully, this is accomplished thanks to the music director for its creative themes. It\u2019s lighthearted, slow paced, and consistent to make every segment work. Both the theme songs has a very realistic tone and lyrics that matches with the style of the show. Character voice mannerism is also important to convey character personalities and it hits the mark just right. The dialogues makes the characters sound believable and that\u2019s what it\u2019s important.\\n\\n\r\nFour years of high school really can really be quite an experience. For some people, it can feel like a quest to start a new life. For others, it may be like living a world of hell. Then, there are people who think high school may just be part of their journey to adulthood and there\u2019s much more ahead. The characters in this show embarks on that journey and takes the viewers with them. For that reason, Just Because is worth watching as it explores high school relationships, making memories, and discovering what life really means.",

            "content": "*Minimum Spoiler Nostalgic Review*\r\nTL;DR: Love Pentagon between high school teenagers trying to figure out their future while keeping their emotional spillage in check. Also... Just Because. \r\n[Story: 7/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 5/10, Sound: 9/10, Enjoyment: 8/10]\r\n\"It's all in the past\" - Eita Izumi\r\nJust Because is an original anime by Hajime Kamoshida, the genius behind Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. However, just because at a first glance it may seem like this is a generic story about confused intertwined love relationships between group of friends trying to get through high school, the adaptation feels way to close to reality. For those that finished high schoolor those finishing up high school, it will definitely bring back memories of your teen years. This anime shines in the tear-jerking nostalgia department and just because of that, it outshines from the rest of the generic love stories in the ever popular genres of slice of life combined with romance and school. From it's use of orchestra music to piano accompanied backdrops whilst looking back at your past, despite it's suboptimal animation standard given it's by the studio Pine Jam, this under the radar anime is definitely worth the watch. \\n\\n\r\n\"I've only given valentine cards to my dad and my two brothers every year\" - Hazuki Morikawa \\n\\n\r\nJust because the story is generic doesn't mean it can't be interesting. The story in a nutshell is about the transfer student Eita Izumi, who moves back again and attends the same high school all of his friends from middle school goes to as well. Reuniting with them once again reignites all the unresolved love and drama they had between each other plus coupled with the new friends they make in high school further alleviates this love triangle to an all out love pentagon between each other. The story for this anime is simple but its the character interactions that gives its complexity. At it's core, the plot is linear driven however flashbacks from middle school days are used to explain why each character behaves at certain situations. It takes two episodes to get used to the rhythm of the anime but given what a stellar first episode was and how the anime continue to build up with the different characters trying to figure out their feelings for one another while trying to finish high school and graduate, really makes it worthwhile to watch. Who doesn't love riding the nostalgia train.   \\n\\n\r\n\"Can I ask him out on a date?\" - Ena Komiya\\n\\n\r\nJust because the characters appear mundane at first does not mean they do not possess complexity. The fun part about this anime are the characters. At its core the five major characters are: Eita Mizumi (the transfer student with a crush on Natsume), Haruto Soma (best friend of Eita with a crush on Morikawa), Natusme Mio (old friends from middle school with crush on Haruto), Morikawa Hazuki (band chick too shy to confess), & Ena Komiya (CANON camera chick too eager to confess to Eita). This complex love pentagon really drives this show. This anime takes its time developing each of the characters and giving them enough time and backstory to justify their importance and reason for the love they have for the other. Not to mention because each character acts as a foil for the other and how unique each of their personalities are, you really start to identify yourself with one of these characters. Soon enough you will be cheering on for your favourite ship while reminiscing about your old high school ship. Like I said, all aboard the nostalgia train. \\n\\n\r\n\"If you tell him I'll kill you\u201d - Natsume Mio \\n\\n\r\nJust because the animation is subpar doesn't mean the music has to be subpar. Given the fact that the studio adapting this anime is Pine Jam, a rather small studio not really known for their outstanding animation standards, they've done not too shabby of a job adapting this original anime. There were a few scenes that weren't blended well and seemed a bit choppy however, the overall pencil drawn characters gave it a nice cozy feel to the anime. It's funny how despite each of the major characters being completely unique to one another, they were drawn pretty similar to one another. It could be that it serves as a metaphor for life how we may think we are completely different from our friend sitting next to us in class but we are more similar than we think in the hardship and struggle we go through in our adolescence and teenage years with school and love. Aside from the animation what really sells this anime is the music. From the first episode and onwards the quality of the music never drops. From the usage of trumpets and drums to build the tension up to calm relaxing piano medley to reminisce about the past, this show knew how to use it all. Not to mention the OP and ED songs are both amazing to listen to on their own. It really stands out as a complete OST to listen to on its own. Lastly, the seiyuus for this show did a great job in giving life to these characters. Kudos to them. \\n\\n\r\n\"No one likes getting rejected\" - Haruto Soma.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Just Because was a simple anime with a generic premise that surpassed expectations it set for itself. It was not only a great coming of age story dealing with high school love and struggle of school to figure out your future, it served its purpose as a nostalgic ride to let viewers reminisce about their past. As the story progressed you start identifying yourself with the characters in the anime and though it was a slice of life anime featuring a love pentagon, it wasn't a cookie cutter romantic plot that made itself predictable from the start. Plus, who ends up with who in the end will really surprise the viewers. For that reason alone and just because how many puns you can make while watching this anime, I would highly recommend to everyone, not just fans of this genre, to give this anime a watch. Let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite ship and your favourite quote from the anime!  \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!\\n",

            "content": "(No spoilers contained in this review!)\r\nWhen I first read over the synopsis for Just Because I couldn't wait to get my hands on the episodes. As a young adult not so recently out of high school myself, I wanted to torture myself by relieving the anxieties and emotions that run high during the last few months of senior year. And so as the story progressed, I couldn't help but feel disappointed in what was presented to me.\r\nPerhaps it was my own fault for having such high hopes for the anime, but what could've been a compelling story full of heartbreak, fear for the future, andnew hope, felt like a watered down version with ironically little depth. The story focused on a select few students, which was fine at first. That's where all the juicy bits of drama will go down, right? This is where friendships will break apart for the sake of final exams! This is where the long-standing relationship will feel the strain of their romantic clock ticking away until they have to part ways! But instead, what I found in that small group of friends was yet another cliched love triangle. (And let's be honest, we all knew where THAT was going).\\n\\n\r\nI found myself having to force myself to continue, although I did manage to get through all 12 hellishly boring episodes while all the while hoping for something, anything, to HAPPEN. I'm no stranger to slice of life anime, I know they aren't supposed to be action-packed or anything but jesus, in an anime about a bunch of teenagers having to leave behind their friends and find a place for themselves in society I was expecting a few tears at the very least.\\n\\n\r\nJust Because had so much potential and instead, it fell flat. The emotions never went deep enough, the drama never felt dramatic enough, it was almost like the characters just drifted through the story instead of it actually happening to them. Because of this, Just Because is currently sitting with a score of 3 on my list.",

            "content": "I'm a big fan of the romance/drama type of slice of life, which is why I was fairly happy to stumble upon Just Because! in this season. Mood and setting of the anime are quite fitting for winter, so you'll be likely to identify when watching this right now.\r\nStory\r\nThe anime starts off with a transfer student coming back to Tokyo for his last half year of high school, after his father was transferred back from Fukuoka. He's soon reunited with his long lost best friend from middle school and is finding himself confronted with some unresolved things from the past. As the story continues, thecharacters have to face the reality of graduation and resolving  their plans for the future, while love and disappointments are quite hard to handle too. \\n\r\nThis seems quite uninteresting at first -you know, just your typical life of life story- but the characters get interesting and after two episodes I was hooked.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art, well, nothing all too special, but the natural colors and realistic settings (if you were in Tokyo (Enoshima) before, you'll recognize some parts) are comforting and easy to watch. The story is set in winter and the colors are therefore not too saturated. I like the character design because it's not too 'sparkly', the characters have their own trademarks and don't look all the same. Another thing that I found to be interesting was the format of dialogue via messaging, as the characters use a lot of LINE.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIt's super refreshing to hear some new voices, especially Izumi and Natsume's seiyuu sound super good and I hope they'll get more jobs soon! The BGM is subtle and there are some nice pieces from time to time too, I'd say it underlines the plot when it has to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nVery diverse cast and character development is expected (Episode 5). I like how the characters have their families introduced as well, their motives are clear and you get attached to them very easily. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThe theme of this anime and the general undertone are quite melancholic and emotional. It displays the different notions of adulthood and difficulty of being honest with your feelings, as sometimes you'll just don't know what is best for yourself in this moment. Will you be able to keep up with the people you love when you tell them you do, even though their precious friends and you might lose them? Or would you rather shut all those feelings uptight in your heart and deny they're even there? Do you even want to know? If you ever were confronted with those questions, have a look at this anime. I think it might carry a very soothing subliminal message.",

            "content": "~WARNING: EXPECT MINOR SPOILERS~\r\n(A 6 to me means that this anime is slightly above average at where I am currently watrching)\r\nWhat keeps me watching this anime, along with the reason why I decided to write this review is that it reminded me of one truly important fact, one I hope resonates with you in the future:\r\nTHERE IS BEAUTY IN SIMPLICITY.\r\nAs this review is being made while this show is in progress, most of what I say is subject to change at my discretion. As the name of the anime implies, I truly did watch this anime \"Just Because.\" (You can shoot me later for that).Interestingly enough, I will begin by saying I'm actually enjoying the anime for what it is so far, though I hope to see improvements in both pacing and detail as time goes on.\\n\\n\r\nStory ~5~\\n\\n\r\nAs of episode 3, the story from my perspective is average. A handful of students who are about to graduate slowly change as one of their childhood friends moves back after four years. As this is a slice of life, I got what I expected in the first few episodes: Reunions, re-connections, and changes in relations and communication relative to each character. Nothing particularly stands out story-wise, though I believe that is fine in a \"Slice-of-life\", especially this early on.\\n\\n\r\nArt ~7~\\n\\n\r\nMost people seem to be on-or-off with the art, which is understandable because of how much the art shifts in detail between scenes. Throughout the first episode alone, I was taken aback at the stunning background art melding with the animations. The fluidity between 2d and 3d movement impressed me, and I could hardly make out when they genuinely used CG during certain scenes. \\n\\n\r\nDespite their successes detailing art and animation, the anime has the drawback of decreasing character detail during faster animations, such as in the baseball scene in episode 1. As for the characters looking \"Plain\", I see nothing wrong in a realistic anime with realistic designs, regardless of blandness, especially with the beautiful background scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound ~9~\\n\\n\r\nWELL HELLO THERE. I will say now I am HEAVILY biased towards the orchestral/piano side of music, otherwise I may have given the sound more of a 6-7 score. Allow me the pleasure of saying that the tonality of each piece fits into each scene perfectly so far, most especially in the climax of the baseball \"duel\" at the end of episode 1. The joys of reconnecting and success in one scene, along with the subtle peaceful string instruments and slightly awkward beats during piano pieces help make each scene come alive. In anime, a media form where emotion can be conveyed through more than just its characters, music can become a \"make-or-break\" factor. I can confidently say that this anime certainly does NOT break.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ~5~\\n\\n\r\n*sigh* Well hello there. Welcome to single scenes that establish every character and the awkwardness of not being at a point where any true conflict has occurred to allow any true emotional development. At this point, I have no choice but to give the characters a 5 simply because the anime hasn't developed enough to show me any depth behind many of the main characters besides their given personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ~6~\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to explain for those of you who don't understand why I could give a slice of life in its early boring stages a 6/10 (which IS good), allow me to restate: There is Beauty in Simplicity. That's truly what this anime is: Simple. That's what I truly expect out of any slice-of-life anime I watch. The music, art, and potential of this anime impresses me, as did 3-gatsu no Lion; one of my favorite anime to this day. I truly understood it during the second half of episode one: allow me to warn you:\\n\\n\r\n~SPOILERS~\\n\\n\r\nDuring the second half of episode one, the MC finds one of his old friends from their baseball club. Their dynamic after four years is awkward and stoic. The school baseball team has recently failed their attempt at winning nationals and his friend wants to hit one home run as both revenge and as a \"prayer\". The MC (Who hasn't played for years) pitches for the friend, and the band members watching play a beautifully empowering piece in the background. Eventually, all the other main characters watch as the piece slows to a beautiful string orchestral piece as we see a slowed down home run, after which the MC's friend runs and hugs him, laughs, and proceeds to leave to confess to a girl he likes.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS SCENE CONVEYS SO MUCH. The reunion and re connection between close friends, the attachment and encouragement a shared hobby gives between characters, the joy of mutual success, the awe of simply watching as the scene truly comes to life in its climax. That emotion paints a picture describing what I'm talking about. That's the beauty in simplicity.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: ~6~\\n\r\nThe reason my overall is so low is because the anime hasn't given me enough to truly know whether or not it is \"good\". So far, I'm enjoying the ride, and have probably ranted long enough. As the anime continues, I hope for the pace to quicken, drama to occur, and ships to both sail and sink, all set to beautiful music pieces.",

            "content": "An original anime that have a lot of potential to be great but ends so disappointing.\r\n[Story: 3/10]\r\nThe story is slow (and with bad pacing) in most of episodes, mostly in the episodes 1-4 and 9-11. Sometimes some scenes are out of place, for example the baseball scenes with the adults in the middle. \r\n[Character: 3/10]\r\nBesides Komiya and maybe Haruto, all the characters feels boring, lack of personality and are one-sided. Komiya and his outgoing personality makes great moments for the anime, more that most of the main cast. Haruto in some scenes is good, in others not so much. Eita is boring character unless heis with Komiya.\\n\r\nTheir moments with Natsume feels awkward and out of place. Morikawa lacks of personality until the last episodes. I like the friend of Morikawa, Yoriko. Finally, Nastume, a character that is so jealous and indecisive that feels annoying and as a plot device in much episodes. The worst part is that the anime is pro-Natsume and anti-Komiya.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 6/10]\\n\\n\r\nI like the animation despite some episodes (ex. 5) have bad animated scenes. \\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 5/10]\\n\\n\r\nI have no problems with the soundrack. In my opinion, is not bad neither good. The opening is forgettable anyway.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 4/10]\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the only moments with decent comedy are Eita/Ena and Haruto. The scenes with Natsume makes me angry, she is jealous because Eita is with Komiya when she have some feelings for Haruto (because of an erase, really? ). I like the scenes with Yoriko, Haruto (sometimes) and Komiya, they are worth of watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\r\nJust Because! is bad. If Eita have ended up with Ena, it will receive a 6 or maybe 7 of my part but nope, a generic ending with the main girl that did nothing in the entire show. Poor Komiya.  4/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Please note that there are spoilers below. This is primarily due to the fact that my main points cannot be conveyed without explaining specific events in the story. Sections with spoilers will be marked.\r\nNow when I first watched this anime I was attracted to its warm and calm atmosphere, something that is rarely seen in anime filled up with comedic scenes and the like. I liked the protagonist who was not like another blithering idiot that romance/sol/high school anime usually focus on. It was fine, and I liked it so much I regarded it on par with the other big two of this season (inuyashikiand ancient magus bride) The OP sounded great, and the anime had a lot going for it.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately this was overshadowed by major issues, in particular the ideas that this anime seeks to promote. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 3\\n\r\nThe story is generic and involves the usual anime-tropes seen in the genres this show is in. It does not deviate from what we would expect and the ending is extremely predictable. Often J do not focus much on  a show's ending as I believe in the process of story-telling more than the ending itself. However this show does not offer anything out of the ordinary and what was originally calm and soothing becomes boring. However that's not entirely why the story gets such a low score. As this is a romance-drama anime, its story is largely intertwined with its characters. Therefore, if the anime has bad characters who make bad decisions there will be a bad story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art is average. There are some awkward expressions but otherwise it is fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nHaving listened to Yanagi Nagi and Jun Maeda's Owari no Hoshi no Love Song the anime opening didn't fall short. It provided an appropriate atmosphere for the show (calm and soothing) and I liked it. The ending was less impressive, but more or less alright.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1 (Minor spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's main and most damning problem is its cast of characters who feel more like cardboard cutouts. They're the kind of characters who talk and let the viewer know directly what their goals are but never actually demonstrate their intent, which is an extremely lazy way of building a character. The characters never pursue what they want and feel very much like cardboard cutouts. They don't blush, don't spend time together, don't actively pursue their goals. This will be further elaborated in the next section, enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3 \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters is only symptomatic of a larger problem here: The main message of the anime, or the values it holds. Allow me to explain how the problem with the characters is related to this.\\n\\n\r\nMAJOR SPOILERS HERE\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the anime I have come to learn that Natsume is a quiet studious girl and she likes Eita, and she was the ex-president. That's all. There is nothing else about her personality that is known to us and her thoughts and feelings are never revealed to us.  An example: She liked Soma and eventually reconsiders this, but we never really understand why exactly she did that. Some might argue that it was probably because Eita has been helping her out, but it's all just speculation and no direct confirmation. This would have been a nitpick if it were an insignificant plot device but it's not an insignificant plot device. It is something that has to be told to the viewer to get them invested in the main girl. To make matters worse it's not even safe to assume that she simply had a crush on Soma and wasn't serious from the start. There are just so many possibilities as to why she had given up on Soma and why she liked him in the first place. After all, she had been crushing on him for several years now and we know nothing of how she feels. She seems very fickle when it comes to this. And that's just one point.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume and Eita's \"friendship\" (if you could call it that) is weak and all Natsume did was put her studies first. Rita questions her as to whether she was using it as an excuse but was shut down immediately. Perhaps the original intent was to create tension between the main characters. But they were never close in the first place and all it did was  show me how distant the two are. She had no intention to pursue her crush (soma at that time) and when she suddenly switched to Eita i always get reminded of someone picking food off a menu. There's no indication whatsoever that she likes someone even if she says she does, she doesn't smile, she doesn't blush, she doesn't go out of her way to do something (the same applies for Morikawa, but at least she never actually said she liked soma, it was more of accepting -- or postponing -- his confession)\\n\r\nAll in all, Natsume feels like a cardboard cutout. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have a more well-made character, who unfortunately is shoved to the side. Komiya.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why people adore and support Komiya with Eita is that unlike Natsume, she knows what she wants and actively pursues it even though she has lots to lose. She actively shows us that she likes Eita and isn't fickle with her feelings. This is seen in the final episode when Eita graduates. She doesn't give up when things get tough; she's tenacious. She's everything Natsume is not. And most importantly, she actually has chemistry with eita. They joke, they talk, they help one another out. On the other hand Natsume never spared a thought for Eita and there was zero to no interaction.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I realised what the main message of the show was: that love is determined by fate. Komiya fought but lost because it was fate. Natsume won because it was fate. Rita chose Natsume not because of her personality but because \"I've liked her for a ling time\". (I quoted Eita). I chose her because I feel it is meant to be, not because of how wonderful she is, not how she makes me feel, not how much she cares about me. I find this idea very distasteful and seeing Komiya lose out was very heartbreaking. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who say it's realistic, maybe it is in portraying how we make bad choices in choosing romantic partners. Otherwise, it's not. Natsume's character is extreme in how fickle and non-chalant she is, as with Morikawa and even Eita to a certain extent. \\n\\n\r\nMy opinion? This anime is not realistic. It is NOT a realistic portrayal of how people act in real life and it is NOT realistic in how people get rewarded for nothing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nThis was a major letdown.\\n",

I would recommend that you watch the anime if you have free time but don't expect a masterpiece.\r\nThe story itself was basic and not very interesting. It was cliche and nothing new so I would rate it a 3. When I first watched it, I was confused. The story felt as though it could be summarised in one sentence.\r\nThe art was great but there were some moments where it was mediocre, especially some of the running scenes. \r\nI enjoyed theopening song: it was relaxing to listen to so that's one thing that's good about the show. The ending song was also decent.\\n\\n\r\n The characters were all cliche. The 'quiet girl', the 'loud girl', the 'basic girl', the 'basic boy' and the 'sports guy'. \\n\\n\r\nI felt as though the anime was a waste of time so I didn't really enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would rate this anime a 4. It was definitely not a masterpiece in my opinion but it was something at least...\\n",

Watch a third and you're in for the long run.\r\nStOrY 8/10\r\nThe story is slow as first and moves similar to a train. Once you are at a cruise, you feel very comfortable. You watch the scenery just fly by while losing yourself in your own thoughts. After 3 episodes, you will find yourself thinking about what will happen with the love triangles, relationships, and school lives of the characters.\r\nArT 7/10\r\nThe artwork reminds me of certain old movies but it is very suitable for this kind of storytelling. Sometimes can convey a moodof depression or just normalcy. As if nothing extraordinary is going to happen. I think it allows you to focus more on the emotions being laid out to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nOh and the lighting detail is very charming. I can't ignore that. I love the art.\\n\\n\r\nSoUnD 7/10\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I was so engrossed in the visuals and story that I didn't notice the soundtrack. Some shows actually do a bad job with synchronizing what's happening or transitions in scenes. You won't experience that here. More often than not, there isn't any music. Just the natural environment. It does its job and that's what matters- to set the mood.\\n\\n\r\nChArAcTeR 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters do seem boring or bland at first. But they all have somewhere they want to go and are hung up in some way with their own feelings and inexperience. Izumi might be the most interesting to watch because he doesn't say much but his actions do all the work. He's very likable. I feel like they could express themselves a little more but I'm pretty satisfied with what I'm getting.\\n\\n\r\nEnJoYmEnT 7/10\\n\r\nIt's a slice of life/romance. The comedy is scarce but the drama is ever building. I'm 6 episodes in and the cliffhanger is REALLY good.. I'm enjoying what I'm seeing and I can't comment more on that. If you don't have patience, pass on this one.\\n\\n\r\nVeRdIcT 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't finished airing but going in with little expectation and knowing it was a slow show that requires two episodes to get into, I am very happy with what I've seen so far. I'm definitely looking forward to next week.\\n\\n\r\nTip: Watch 3 episodes at a time if you can. ;]",

            "content": "In all honesty, the series tries very hard to portrayed youth as well romance, but it failed greatly. \r\nI\u2019m romance seeker myself, I love to experience either pure vanilla or train wreck hardship romance story.  But then again the series itself is neither of those two, it mixed all aspect together that i can pretty much say chimera was born. Sadly the potential is wasted and the current story is not even worth much. While this series is original, the premises itself wasn\u2019t original. Let\u2019s venture more. \r\nStory\r\nIt start with bang and such, on how fate and red strings could bring back all friendstogether to experience the love all new again. Eita Izumi, come back to his hometown high schools due to his father work, meeting back his old friends Souma Haruto, as well Natsume, Mio his one side love. To mix it up, come a new junior, Komiya Ena, whom faced with crisis that her photography club might be disbanded. This story is about how all of them crossed each other path and life, and they face their own hardship along the way. So where this could goes wrong?\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is already complex, the same old concept three square love problems is almost common, nothing new, at least make it more unique. Spice it up with uninteresting characters and some bland character that I felt really sorry as I don\u2019t even notice their presence. The development is not even worth praise. Straightforwardly, it\u2019s boring. That\u2019s my feeling all through of the episodes. \\n\r\nThe story pace is rather slow, and the interaction between character is just almost nowhere. The interaction between characters doesn\u2019t feel even alive. It tries to be both happy and sad but what I just see is a cycle of same problems. Unsolved, and running away. This is fine if it just a couple episodes, but this problem actually stand until the very end. If you want the character to be unlikeable, then its fine, but the problem is the one who is bringing down the whole story is the main cast. Please be alert that it should be only one or 2 in the series, not all the cast to thrash out. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nFor goodness sake, this is the most annoying aspect of the series. They are so bland and childish, way beyond what teens actually do. I\u2019m just a high school student a few years ago, and to be honest I can say that it just outrageous. I know everyone move in their own pace, we might be young but we\u2019re not that dumb. While it might be bad to some level, I actually like some of them, it just the way it portrayed ruin the characters for good sake. Eita Izumi, the only character that I do respect for his loyalty to his love, how he sees the reality, and while might seem like dead inside, he still help people in needs. In this case, I actually do like him. Now come next the best pal, Souma, Haruto with his own love story. Needlessly to say, his character is bland, boring, not really the best pal actually and stoic. As the story progress, his whole interaction is not really leaving any presence at all. Lastly is our main heroine, Natsume, Mio who is indecisive beyond help without a little push. It\u2019s okay to be a little indecisive but her indecisive and running away is just annoying. Where exactly the unique and interesting traits? Kindness? Lovely? We can fall in love with anyone, but at least spare from this torture. Eventually, you will get hurt alone in a side corner of a caf\u00e9. The junior, Komiya Ena actually more interesting, she\u2019s at very least kind, and high spirit to achieve her own goal and dreams. She is more realistic and actually feels alive. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Music\\n\r\nThe animation is just so-so, if you actually noticed, sometimes the character faces actually looks little bit weird. But it is fair enough and not really that bad for me to say. As for music, I actually love it, it\u2019s inspiring, interesting with the vivid colors and catchy to be honest. Other than that, there are no more worthwhile points to be pointed out. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nI had my share of fun, but the series is not really good, the premise itself is interesting but the actual story wasn\u2019t. The flaws can be read like open books, and the development is truly pathetic if I\u2019ve to say. I do enjoy some moments but the unpleasant one is many more than what I actually enjoy. It could go further but sadly that path is just a loop hole as of now. \\n",

            "content": "Just Because! is a relatively slow-paced anime which focuses on a group of students in their last year of high school, approaching the end of their school days. Along with that, they must make important decisions for their future, as well as for the each person likes.\r\nAll characters develop at different speeds when they come to realize their feelings.  That's what this anime clearly showed. Each of the characters thought in their own way to come to have the courage to be together with the person they like. This anime is pretty distinctive in that aspect, which was what i liked.\r\nAlong with the romance,you've got all the characters' futures to be decided. Some of them don't know, some of them already decided and others don't care as long as they get a decent job. The fact that they used the last year of high school  is particularly effective in presenting the amount of pressure on all of them as they also have to consider what to do to make a move on the person they love. I guess that's why a lot of anime series use this time to create some drama.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the art, it fitted well with the melancholic mood of the anime throughout. But their were times when it was not at its best, the movements looked pretty forced at times too. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters...\\n\r\nIzumi, Eita:\\n\r\nNice character, I can relate to him a lot. The effort he puts in when helping out Natsume is incredible. Interesting that his future is kind of already planned, unlike the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume, Mio:\\n\r\nDebatable here. A lot of people hate her, I understand that. Some of her actions were ridiculous and stupid but for me it got cancelled out when she realized her real feelings towards the end of the series. Very slow development but it was interesting to see her change bit by bit.\\n\\n\r\nKomiya, Ena:\\n\r\nMVP. Does a lot for Izumi all the he way until the end. Direct and honest character who always knows what she's doing. Her determination to achieve her goals  is amazing, easily likable character. \\n\\n\r\nSoma, Haruto:\\n\r\nBest friend of Izumi, he gives advice to Izumi and gets advice from him too. Their friendship is emphasized throughout the series, even if they didn't meet for quite some time. His face expressions were really funny.\\n\\n\r\nMorikawa, Hazuki:\\n\r\nA character who cares a lot for her family and others' feelings. The way she responded to Haruto towards the end was a bit odd for me but since it involved her future I guess it was the right choice. Liked the hairstyle change.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the story was predictable, but I guess wanting more original ideas is a bit too much. I enjoyed a lot of Haruto's scenes because of his face expressions, and i also liked Komiya's efforts to get closer to Izumi. Overall, I was planning to give this a 8 but since it ended with my ship coming true I'll give an 9.\\n",

It's either one.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nIzumi is a boy that is moving back to his home town from Tokyo and from that moment on he starts to interact with old friend Souma which he met when he was walking around his new school. From that point, he starts to interact with the other people knew and interacting with new people that interact with his old friends aka Souma and Natsume. The story tries to make it feel as realistic as possible and don't try to over dramatic it's characters and the story itself. But at thesame time, the plot is almost like not there or sometimes its everywhere. When you watch the first few episodes, there is almost no story at all. You don't know what's happening beside Izumi is moving back to his home town. The story doesn't really explain much either. I assume they're trying to be realistic and let you see how the characters develops overtime by interacting but I'll explain that later. The story do start to pick up around episode 6-7 but I feel like that's already too late when the series only have like 12 episodes. It's like a story that has no story. That's why you'll either hate it or love it. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not to be praised about but it's not terrible either. The characters sometimes feel flat to the point that there is not much depth into it. The art just feels flat but it's not like terrible either. I just wish they added more depth into the drawing which could raise the score up for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is the best part for this series. The Ending song is really good personally and the Opening is pretty nice to listen to. The ost itself isn't really that great but I guess it fits some part of the story. I guess the OST is a bit bland. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI won't go too much in depth for this because it can spoil some stuff in the anime. The character development in this anime is just so PAINFULLY slow. It's so painfully slow that it's almost like there isn't any development at all. The show is trying to make the character and story realistic as possible but it fell short. There is barely any backstory for each characters.. You will barely know the characters backstory which literally makes the character development so slow. The idea of realism for each characters is executed so badly when the PLOT relies on the character development to make the plot itself. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm trying to enjoy the series as much as I can. I had watched tons of Anime so much to the point I got nothing left to watch. I watched so many Anime that I gotten to the point I'm too lazy to add it on my MAL list. The series is just so painfully slow but episode 7 did start to get a bit interesting for me to keep watching till the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nA plot with almost no plot. Realism executed so poorly. If you want to watch something to fill your over post depression of a series you watch or just bored then I guess you should watch this anime. If you love strong character development, strong plot, meaningful plot, or even something you truly want to enjoy then I will say stay away from this series.",

As you can see story wise the anime is pretty vanilla wich is not a bad thing but certanly doesn't help to make it more interesting.\r\nThe art is ok, but the color scheme is pretty bland giving the anime an even more uninteresting look. Also the animation is pretty unsubstantial from a moment to another you are with agrounded style of animation an then the show decides to go full on spocon. Sound is good, but nothing to write home about. The characters are more of the same generic slice of life tropes you've seen a million times, with, once again, uninspired designs. Another thing to notice is that the humor is bad, it's all reaction base humor with jokes that never land.\\n\r\nThe enoyment of this series is almost non-existant it is mediocrity at it's best.\\n\\n\r\nOverall don't watch it unless you want to stack another anime or you REALLY like this genre.",

            "content": "What can I say, this anime is a visual masterpiece. I really think that no other anime comes close to depicting the mundane details of the characters' daily lives and facial expressions to such an extent. I can't recommend any similar anime to Just Because as the show is just so unique and different; Tsuki Ga Kirei isn't even close except for its romance genre.\r\nAnd the stakes here are high. An original anime series with a myriad of sponsors betting on this show - multinational corporations Canon and Odakyu to name a few. So for all the controversy surrounding the supposed 'delays', this anime isnothing short of impressive. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nIn a world that's increasingly more uncertain the innocence of the story really provides a tiny bit of escapism for viewers. The depiction of everyday life, use of LINE, and the relationships among the main characters are particularly noteworthy. Episodes are barely melodramatic, aside from certain climatic exchanges that mainly serve to provide a direction for the overall story. Yes the premise might be cliche -\\n\r\nHigh school, typical confessions, 2 guys & 3 girls - a recipe for a predictable story line. However, what is so remarkable is how the story unfolds and its execution. Furthermore there are some scenes that might appear redundant but they are critical to the progression of the story such as the baseball games in the first half of the show and the exchange between Haruto and his mum. The overall pacing is just nice, some episodes might feel slower as if nothing has been achieved. Yet it sets a perfect foundation for what is to come next. I just wished that the show was longer.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI'll say it again: Visual Masterpiece. The drawings of the monorail stations, baseball games, exchanges on the bridge, the buses and the bus stops are stunning. More attention is paid to the facial expressions as well (not just the colour of their eyes). Yet for all the complaints regarding the use of CGI, inconsistency in the animation quality, it is highly laudable for a television anime to produce art of such quality. The producers are relying so much on these minute details and it isn't hard to see why they've nailed the slice of life genre perfectly. The overall art creates a mood that is in overall so relaxing and calming and makes you wish to be back in Japan again.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe ED is notable and the lyrics are fitting for the story and mode. Furthermore, they're performed by the voice actresses! I personally prefer it to the OP. Well, the voice actors of the various characters perfectly match the roles. They speak with intonations that really depict what the character is like. For example, the voice actor of Eita really draws out the dullness of his character the producers desire to depict. Transitions, footsteps and also the Trumpet - Pretty good!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nDon't want to dive so much or I'll spoil the story. Thus far, I feel that Komiya is mainly used as a tool to progress the story. Her character is by far unique and the most interesting among the rest. I also like how they showed the personal developments of Natsume and Morikawa throughout the series. The bond between Eita and Haruto as well as the entire group also makes the show noteworthy. The only downside was that Inui Yoriko was neglected, serving as the character to help sail the ship for the main cast (I wish the show was Longer)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI need not say more.\\n\r\nHowever, viewers should note that the supposed delays have nothing to do with the producers or the directors. I've been following @JustBecause_JP on twitter and the local broadcast appears to be on schedule every week on the various Japanese Channels. Furthermore, episodes are produced few months in advanced and the supposed one week break in the middle of the season was meant to give the local viewers a tour of the local Kanagawa sites that are featured remarkably on the anime. Hence, all the accusations against the director and the quality of various scenes are basically unfounded and largely bias.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I felt somewhat compelled on making a review for this just because (lol). Its a pretty lengthy review which WILL contain some spoilers so I'd advise you to read with caution. \r\nIf I were to be asked \"Was there much progression between Mio Natsume (the girl MC likes since middle school) and Eita Izumi once they rejoiced?\" well my answer would simply be there was HARDLY ANY. Most of the time we were stuck with hearing Mio complain and make excuses to our main protagonist for why she hasn't made any progress in confessing to his friend Haruto. At that point it was playing catand mouse, nobody wants to make a move and confess their feelings for the one they liked (between Natsume and Eita). \\n\\n\r\nFor several episodes we are rewarded to some nice touching moments of another girl named Komiya relationship with Eita. Without going too much into details, Komiya goes out of her way to assist Izumi for his exam while at this time \"the witch\" Mio is practically non-existent. Throughout all these episodes, the only time we see \"the witch\" Mio was when she catches the two hanging out for the first time (which probably fueled her rage to the maximum) or too busy being very concerned with Haruto & Morikawa. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished the show, I felt more satisfied with the Eita's friend shipping than his own. Haruto/Morikawa relationship blossoming was more healthy and understandable. It didn't feel anywhere as bad as the official ship between Natsume and Eita which was forced and rushed. Whenever Mio & Eita interactions were shown, it mainly displayed how jealous and b*tchy she truly was. It's not as if there was an episode or two showing Mio & Eita hanging out with each other and getting any closer than they were before which if that happened, I probably wouldn't have nearly as much of a frustration over this relationship. \\n\\n\r\nI hope that my review will help prepare others for what's to come in this anime. I mainly liked Just Because for Haruto/Morikawa moments along with Komiya's refreshing energetic personality. I would give this anime a rating of 6 out of 10 at the moment though a quick look over at this anime at a later time may cause me to change it.",

            "content": "I wish MAL would put a more detailed rating for anime and manga because I'm the guy that thinks it's necessary to have \".5\" in ratings, like: \"6.5,7.5,8.5...\", sometimes I don't feel that an anime it's not good enough for a \"7\" but not that bad for an average \"6\". Anyways, let's get to the review, shall we?.\r\nDisclaimer: This is a Spoiler-free review, please forgive me if you find difficult to understand some parts, as English is not my first language and this is the second review that I write (feel free to read my first review on the anime \"Blend S\").\r\nJust Because !: Acollection of intimate moments, but without fuss\\n\\n\r\nWhen I decided to follow Just Because! I said I would do it because yes, without more. After watching his 12 episodes, I'm left with the experience of an anime that with little it says much. That manages to catch, without being really a portent in any area.\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of this anime is how it presents a common story in a normal, almost boring and yet captures you. It depends completely on the characters, that no matter what they become, whether they reach their goals or not, they put you into their life. Like most slice of life, the story of Just Because! it is simply the daily life of five students, and how they will spend their last months in High school.\\n\\n\r\nIt is that stage of transition, just when school ends and you face the unknown, the future, when you become an adult. It makes sense that many of the most important scenes of Just Because! occur in a train station, because all these guys are about to take one to their future.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a 100% objective point of view, the lives of these guys, except for specific moments, are quite boring. But is not real life like that? And maybe that's where the charm of this series lies. His characters are not particularly interesting, except for Komiya. They have nothing special and none has any real problems. Maybe that's why for many this series has nothing to say.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, there is something that gives value to this original anime from Pine Jam.\\n\\n\r\nIt is that amalgam of normality with classic tropes, which are slightly subverted and then fall back into them. Maybe it's that calm environment and its deliberately slow pace. Without being a work of art, this anime manages to entertain and keep you interested, despite using the familiar resource of a love triangle. Although it started being a geometric figure with more edges.\\n\\n\r\nWeaknesses and strengths of Just Because!\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Just Because! introduces us to a mysterious exchange student ... which is not. Eita Izumi is not unknown to the rest of the protagonists, on the contrary. Four years ago he studied with most of his castmates, but a move took him away from them. Eventually he lost contact, but he did not forget the girl he liked or his best friend back then. His return acts as a catalyst in everyone's lives, and a very successful \"duel\" scene on a baseball diamond with his best friend puts the plot in motion.\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on undoing the love polygon that I mentioned a few lines back and at the same time, decide the direction their lives will take in a few months. Eita struggles to clarify her feelings about Mio Hatsume, an old schoolmate who in turn used to be in love with her best friend, Haruto Souma. In turn, Haruto is interested in timid Hazuki Morikawa, who played in the school band. In the formula is also Ena Komiya, a girl one year below the future graduates, who falls in love with Eita after photographing him while he is facing in an improvised duel of batter and pitcher with Haruto.\\n\\n\r\nThe rhythm of the first episodes is inconsistent and it seems that the story is not going anywhere, which affects the experience. However, in the last episodes it takes speed. In the case of the characters, they are all nice, but none stands out too much. Komiya is probably the best character in the series and yet the series does not show enough of her - or of the others - to understand her motivations. Despite this, they manage to drag us to their inner world, however superficial it might be. For some this may seem a weakness, but for those of us exhausted to see exaggerated personalities in the anime, or one-dimensional characters created around a single edge -like the classic tsunderes- it is actually refreshing to see normal people. However boring they may seem.\\n\\n\r\nAs for art, it is probably the thinnest point of the series. The character design is simply weak. Once again, with the exception of Komiya there is no really outstanding character, neither among the main nor the secondary ones. This contributes to the feeling that it is a mundane story, with nothing extraordinary. As for the animation, it only has two really good moments, and both are about the baseball field. The construction of these scenes of the first and last episode served to make a thematic closure in Just Because! which is appreciated for its symmetry.\\n\\n\r\nMusic, on the other hand, is the element of the highest quality without being overwhelmingly good. The opening \"Over and Over\", interpreted by yanagi Nagi helps convey the feeling of melancholy that permeates the work. However, I prefer the incidental music of Just Because !. The debutante Fukusawa Erika does a great job in giving atmosphere to the story, something that can be seen in the most emotional scenes of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the performances, except for specific moments can be very monotonous. The greatest example of this is Eita himself, who despite being the protagonist, is perhaps the least energetic of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended ... but not for everyone\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, I have to say that I would recommend Just Because !, but not for all public. In essence it is an anime with a typical story and that does not stand out particularly in anything. It does not have a brilliant technical execution, on the contrary, it has more than one pothole. And yet, it has its appeal. The fact that he deliberately tries to be mundane and common gives him a realism not so common in anime. Also, avoid becoming trapped in many romantic dramas, to add frankly exaggerated or melodramatic conflicts to maintain interest.\\n\\n\r\nAvoid curling the curl in love relationships and when it seems that you will make a turn of this style, take the logical, normal route. In that sense, his characters seem to be more mature than normal for his age ... except for some scene of jealousy. They make rational, but boring decisions for those who seek pure and simple entertainment. As someone who has seen a lot of anime in his life, the boring Just Because! In fact it is refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nObviously it is not the best school romance of the year, that honor is for Tsuki ga Kirei, a very superior series. But as a way to pass the time, I found it more than adequate. It is not an ambitious anime and it will certainly pass to oblivion, but it does not cease to be reasonably entertaining for me. Although his final scene was somewhat anticlimactic, my \"Ship\" arrived at safe harbor and I am satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough someone should teach Eita how to change the wallpaper of his phone.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nJust Because! It is an anime without a great message, story, characters or animation. Nothing stands out in excess, however, its apparent mediocrity is refreshing. It will soon be forgotten, but it fulfills its purpose.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating\\n\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019m not sure why I picked Just Because! But anyway it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. \r\nThe series at its core is a character-centric; which mean that no matter how the characters became; whether they're reach their goals or not, it is became a part of and affecting the story. There\u2019s no big overarching plot to draw the viewers in actually. It\u2019s pretty much about these five Student, and how their lives will play out over the next few months. The story essentially played out by the struggling of this character facing the transition to adulthood and also the problem they get wheninteracting with each other.\\n\\n\r\nIt sounds like typical slice of life but certainly it doesn\u2019t. What makes show a little bit different in my eyes is how 'calm' the presentation is handled. Anime or most of high school anime in general tend to be bogged down by gimmicks, but it did not happen here. The mood is very calm and smooth, the pacing is deliberately slow, most of the characters are quiet and soft-spoken, making the show to be quite atmospheric. Of course being different doesn\u2019t equal to being better, but at least it is nice that every now and then you could watch some drama where you can just sit back and relax and not getting pumped up by bizarre presentation.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, since the story may sound quite alright at best, thankfully it did deliver (even more) on its focus which is the characters. Although, I have heard many peoples complain about the characters of this series because they seems had no personalities but certainly I am not one of these people. I personally think that the characters in this series is fantastic with each of them has their own motives and justify reason to do what they acts. \\n\r\nObviously in this series Komiya might be the clearest who has a motives for what she did; she just want to save her club; and doing anything to do so. Haruto always feels left behind. Everyone\u2019s talking about entrance exams and going to college. They have their futures ahead of them. On the other hand, everything has already been decided for him, since he\u2019ll need to work and he feels powerless. Hazuki\u2019s college won\u2019t have a band. At best, it has a band appreciation club. So for now, there are no plans to continue playing the trumpet once she graduates from high school. She failed to reach nationals in high school, so She feels it might be the best just try to graduate as soon as she can, and living normal life by join her family business. Mio is struggling with her college entrance exam and she can\u2019t denied the fact that Haruto confessed to Hazuki and she likes Haruto. Eita doesn\u2019t has any problem with his academics since he got a recommendation but then again he likes Mio, but Mio likes someone else, so he just trying his best to catch her attention. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless It is safe to say that the characters is quite interesting in their own way and had some setup to be fully developed till the end of the series. Although it is worth to mention they don\u2019t have loud, tropey, tsundere or \u2018genky\u2019 characters. So the series  might not very \u2018lively\u2019 if you are the type to like some banter or comedy because there\u2019s hardly any . But these character traits are not executed in such an overblown way that you end up thinking you\u2019re interacting with zombies.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the visuals, it is worth to mention that the anime really likes to show its characters face exclusively and most of the time you can tell how the character\u2019s feel or whether they\u2019re lying or not which I think is quite interesting. As for the other thing in visual, the show does suffer from production issues.. a lot. The animation isn\u2019t very quite standard of today. The characters perspective looks wrong and the backgrounds aren\u2019t that amazing considering how many these guys are hanging out. Luckily enough, the anime doesn\u2019t have the type of story that really demands any sort of visual fidelity and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard or nor I did the studio behind this anime has much record on its names. \\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, I like the Opening, \u201cOver and Over\u201d by Yanagi Nagi who also sung for \u2018Oregairu\u2019  I think her song and voiced very suited with school drama and this one is no different. The ending is another story because I tend to skip it so I may miss something there. The soundtrack is good albeit not memorable enough to catch your attention but it does serve is purpose. The acting is too plain and uninteresting for my taste but at the very least I don\u2019t hate it. All In all the sound does it best to complement the story but none of it will blow you away (Maybe the opening though but I guess that just me). \\n\\n\r\nThe very length of the series, which is just 12 episodes, also aids the story, as it is long enough to explore these characters to a point and not so long as to need more than what was presented. This made the anime simple and casual, giving the content of what was presented a bit more impact, without anything being stretched out for too long. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I wouldn\u2019t go as far as say the anime is unique; In fact, one could say that the story is a remarkably common one. However at the very least the series stays clear of many of the annoyances of romance stories and not throwing in all kinds of situations solely intended to add drama and spice things up. Added with the fact that the series keeping up with the sense of realism (which I think done a great job) but never feels to depressing considering how the series ended. \\n\\n\r\nIn this respect, I suppose I just appreciate Just Because!\u2019s sharper focus. It\u2019s far less ambitious, and far less grand in scope, but it did many many things correctly and easily became one of my favorite romance anime in recent years. \\n\\n\r\nYes, the ending overall is quite pandering and certainly flashback are needed for the romance part. But we can't have all the nice things can we?",

            "content": "Senior year of high school is like a train station. \r\nPick a train to decide your future. You can\u2019t say for sure what lies at your destination, but you know for certain it will take you away from your school and friends you made there. This is the theme that Just Because puts forward with its story of seniors deciding their futures and many train station scenes. However, it does not have the intimacy necessary for these themes to be believable.\r\nSlice of life shows live or die on how intimate they are. And no, I do not mean romance. I mean the show's connection tothe audience. Without that crucial connection, you might as well be watching bugs run around for all it matters. A lack of intimacy is what prevents Just Because from being engaging. \\n\\n\r\nI have no doubt that the show has subtle character interactions that allow the viewer to make their own interpretations, but when it\u2019s so hard to give a damn about any of them it\u2019s impossible to feel engaged to anything happening on screen. \\n\\n\r\n[Story: 4/10]\\n\r\nAfter elementary school, you typically fall apart from your classmates. The story of Just Because is those kids coming back together in high school and meeting up again. Eita Izumi left his town after elementary school but now that he has transferred back to his friends' town he is reconnecting with them. \\n\r\nThe story is as basic as it needs to be for the slice-of-life and romance genres. We've seen this structure many times over, and it is not at all improved upon in this show. It follows 5 high school students through their everyday lives. They study to get into universities, hone their talents, and try to get dates. The show jumps around at such an inconsistent pace between the 5 characters that it's hard to get a grip on who they are and what motivates them, beyond a shallow description. Characters walk around or sit about with bored looking expressions on their faces, forcing the viewer to mimic their feelings. \\n\r\nJust Because wouldn't be the first show I recommend to someone interested in a realistic young adult romance. I wish I could say that the characters make up for what the show lacks in story, but they don\u2019t. In the first few episodes, the story moves at a snail's pace, giving us a few small details about the central characters but also long drawn out scenes to establish atmosphere. Eventually, the pacing gets better. Once all of the characters are clearly established the final half of the show is made up of somewhat entertaining if overwrought melodrama over little petty moments. Moments like going on certain characters going out on dates then the effects it has on the third wheel who's in love with one of the two on the date (trying to keep it spoiler free, sorry to be vague). \\n\\n\r\nI'd say I was disappointed by the ending, but it really is consistent with expectations the show instills in its audience. It's a bleak and quiet moment that puts forth the theme one last time 'there's beauty in simplicity', but it felt so undeserved to me. It felt like a contradiction to the build-up in the previous episodes and I couldn't help but think \"Why couldn't this have happened six episodes ago?\". Very little of the melodrama experienced throughout the prior episodes felt necessary by the end. \\n\\n\r\n[Character: 5/10]\\n\r\nJust Because aims to create realistic characters, yet it fails to develop them enough to even be believable. Sure, very boring people like these characters could exist in the real world, but who would want to subject themselves to watching their bland lives? \\n\\n\r\nSome of them are sort of likable (if you can tolerate their personalities) but I didn\u2019t care for any of them individually. The only time I was ever interested in the characters was when they were with one another. Whether it be their arguments, them making fond memories, or considering their futures. I just couldn\u2019t get myself to care about them while they stare off into space trying to seem deep. We get it Just Because! Your characters are sooooo tragic!! They're going to college, wow! Maybe you can tell us something else about them\u2026 like who they are as people beyond the fact that they\u2019re going to college next year. For example; Haruto plays baseball and likes a girl, great, who is he though? Why does he like her? Is there anything more to his life than baseball and a crush? All signs say no. \\n\\n\r\nThis sentiment could be applied to any of the leads. I found them to be very one-sided and it destroyed the potential for Just Because to be an intimate slice of life. The show only takes it's characters half way to becoming good, then it stops leaving us half-baked hollow shells (filled with awkward silences and depression). In the end, I just couldn\u2019t see the characters as the real people that they were intended to be. There was not enough believability. Even Komiya, the character I liked the most for her outgoing personality, had very little going on besides her camera and crush.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes me the saddest about the characters is that they were nearly good. We're able to get in the headspace of a character and tell if they concealing their emotions, and sometimes if they're lying through the abundance of close-up shots and a very consistent tone. However, the art is pretty bad so those close-ups are ugly and the tone so depressing that it seems to only want to pointlessly wear down your spirit. With a better writer and director, they could have had the believability to compliment their likable personalities. \\n\\n\r\nAt least I can say I got into each of the characters' headspaces and became depressed just like they were. But that headspace was totally vacant of interesting details!! I can relate to the IDEA of high schoolers who are struggling to decide their futures at the crossroads of their lives, but no amount of relatable ideas will get me invested in these cardboard cutouts.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 4/10]\\n\r\nPine Jam dropped the ball on this one. Their last show Gamers didn\u2019t look nearly as rough as this. It\u2019s plagued with weak character art and poor animation. I\u2019m not sure if it was just a simple budget issue or if they couldn\u2019t handle a project as intimate as this, but it to put it bluntly; it\u2019s harsh on the eyes. If you want to make a quiet coming of age story then you need close-ups to get the audience into the character\u2019s headspace. That's not to say that Just Because doesn\u2019t try to close-ups, but when it does they\u2019re so ugly you'll wish the camera would zoom back out.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds look nice if a bit gray. I can praise how the mellow colors of the characters and backgrounds blend together. It makes the characters feel just as melancholy as the cold winter town, but keep in mind the show strives to make you feel this depressing atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nWhat weighs down the visuals the most is the lackluster directing. Most scenes have very boring camera angles, usually pulled far back from the characters making them feel very disconnected from the viewer. Rarely does the director create intimate moments that connect the viewer to a character, they usually feel like random extras in a greater story that has yet to materialize. Even during the scenes in the characters' homes, there is very little detail to show who those characters are. Their rooms are devoid of defining details. So many opportunities to create believable characters were missed, it's sad really, to see a director waste such great potential. \\n\r\nThere\u2019s a bit of CGI usage during the later episodes to no doubt to cut down on the budget (most notably that awkward and overlong first-person bicycling scene).\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 5/10]\\n\r\nThe opening song is quite good but it sounds very similar to Oregairu\u2019s. Which shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise considering they\u2019re both performed by Nagi Yanagi. I would feel more inclined to score it higher if it didn\u2019t feel like a simple rehashing of an op from a better show in the same genre. \\n\r\nMost scenes have music playing which is nice to keep the show from becoming entirely empty during the simpler scenes. Typically it's orchestral music with a piano at the core. It highlights the mundanity of life by being so basic and plain, but yeah that plainness is boring as hell so... If that thematic consistency sounds appealing to you then maybe it will add something to your experience with it. I think it does a decent job of establishing tone, but I couldn't care less about how it actually sounds because there have been so many fantastic soundtracks of its kind in this year alone. This one's just passable. \\n\r\nThe voices are just as monotonous as you\u2019d expect. I'd love to say this isn't a waste of acting talent, but I honestly can't tell if any of them are talent because they're all forced to perform the same subdued style which gives them little opportunity to give the character some individuality/distinction. Excluding Haruto, his voice actor had a few scenes that allowed us to see his talent, but sadly he was just one of the ensemble cast. And due to the overbearing melancholy tone of the show, he was rarely able to be his peppy self.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 3/10]\\n\r\nIt\u2019s so disappointing that the comedy in Just Because is bad because in the creator\u2019s previous work \u201cThe Pet Girl of Sakurasou\u201d the humor was spot on and made me laugh a lot. There was plenty of good drama in Sakurasou which managed to come across fairly well in Just Because, if only it wasn\u2019t so damn boring.\\n\\n\r\nIts attempts at comedy are dreadful. Typically when jokes are said there is very little feedback and sometimes you can\u2019t tell if it was a joke or just confused writing. The show also uses the social media application Line to show messages between characters. The messages are usually dressed to look like humor with emoticons and such, but the messages are so nondescript that it could be anyone who is texting, they don't at all add to the characters or relatability.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I'm so tough on Just Because is that it has taken on a challenge. If Just Because strived to be just another one of the trashy romcoms that we get every season then I would treat it like trash and just move. \\n\r\nHowever, Just Because has a chooses to be realistic and mundane. I don't believe the creator understood just how difficult it would be to make a compelling viewing experience with such a barren presentation. Instead of aiming to be great it settled on mediocrity, which may have made for a passable show if it was just another harem romcom, but it makes this one feel incredibly underdone. No part of Just Because! is deserving of the exclamation point at the end of its title.\\n\\n\r\nBoredom \u2260 Good\\n\\n\r\n[Overall Score: 4.2/10]\\n\r\nIf you want a standard (and forgettable) high school drama/romance then Just Because has what you\u2019re looking for. That is, as long as you can live with the alienating direction, subpar character art, and a crushingly depressing tone. The humor is cringe-inducing and never funny, but at least the melodrama in the second half is moderately entertaining. \\n\r\nThere can be beauty in simplicity, but nothing in Just Because is beautiful and everything is bland. While it has the bones of a good slice of life show, it fails to come together in an engaging way.",

            "content": "High school can be quite an experience for most young people these days. I remember a time during my high school years when everything seems to feel different. It\u2019s almost like setting foot into a new world with new opportunities. Friends, activities, relationships. It\u2019s a place beyond just about learning but for people to build a future. While it isn\u2019t like college for career building, it definitely gives the chance for opportunities, even for relationships. For Eita Izumi, he comes back from his hometown after 4 years as he reunites with his middle school friends.\r\nAs an original anime, Just Because felt like a breath offresh air despite the simplistic premise. It\u2019s also made by Hajime Kamoshida, the brainchild behind Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. To me, this show stood out as a coming age of story about characters climbing the stairs to adolescence. It\u2019s a time period for characters to develop and grow up to be more than teenagers. At the heart of the show, we have Eita Izumi alongside a group of classmates. The first few episodes gave me the impression of a melancholic story that\u2019s filled with realistic themes that people can connect with. Beyond just the setting, the characters feel real and can be relatable. This is seen through the example of childhood friends Eita, Haruto, and Mio. As the story progresses, we see the relationship dynamics between the trio that will get viewers invested into the storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show like this to work, it had to make its characters feel they belong there. Luckily, Just Because pulls off the right stops through its characters of diverse personalities. Each of the main characters feel different ranging from Mio\u2019s timid personality to Ena\u2019s enthusiasm. It\u2019s what can draw viewers in as we see how they behave around certain characters. Indeed, character chemistry is an important aspect of this show. It connects between characters visually, dramatically, and meaningfully. Romance is slowly paced and not expressed like a shoujo but rather in a melancholic style. To me, this show focuses on relationships through character building. It emphasizes on establishing character personalities first while giving them the chance to shine through them. Ena is a prime example in the show as her character interaction with Eita is often noticeable because of how different she is from him. Some people may interpret the show\u2019s character relationship dynamics as part of destiny, like certain characters are destined to be with one another. However, that\u2019s not truly the case as expectations can be different after realizing the person they want to be with isn\u2019t what they would expect. Honestly, I think this show sells its ideas pretty well to express that.\\n\\n\r\nTo make things run better, the show never forgets about its themes such as adolescence. Every character has a goal for the future and although there\u2019s a feeling of uncertainty, they strive to work towards that. Whether it\u2019s becoming a photographer, be part of a band, or just to go to college, it\u2019s inspiring and realistic. Think about the time when you were in high school and had that feeling of what you wanted to do in life. Relating to this anime doesn\u2019t feel so different, now does it? At the same time, the storytelling continues to build relationships between the main characters. While it feels like a ship tease at times, the show never exaggerates or oversteps its boundaries. The drama is mostly lighthearted and doesn\u2019t force it down viewers\u2019 throats. It keeps its pace steady while getting its point across, like the way it should be. In several ways, the drama of this show is realistic enough to relate and easy to get attached to. There are some awkward segments between certain characters but the timing usually feels right. The downside about the drama is that it occasionally feels formulaic and repetitive. Not to mention, character relationships feel a bit predictable as to who will likely get who in the end. Still, it doesn\u2019t hold the anime back. The characters are all very self-aware and realize what it means to be a high school student. Haruto is a good example as we see his life as a baseball player. The way he adapts to build his future becomes evident like a journey of life discovery. This also expands to other characters such as Mio and Ena. It\u2019s like their chance to climb the stairs to adulthood and high school is one of the biggest steps they have to cross over.\\n\\n\r\nOriginal anime like Just Because doesn\u2019t suffer from adaptation standards but there\u2019s an instinct to recognize if the amount of episode is suited enough. For 12 episodes, it honestly felt just right to sell its story without going over. The first half of the show does a well job at establishing characters like their personalities and roles. The remainder half builds on them through relationships, discoveries, and characterization. It\u2019s like a life journey these characters take for their future and stories like this can be inspirational to viewers. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Pine Jam, this show is expressive at crafting its visual elements. The key visual itself gives an atmospheric feel with characters being at a train station. Besides Eita and Mio, the others are going on about their daily lives like moving with their future. By raw quality though, Just Because\u2019s biggest selling point is the character expressions. It fortifies their personalities and expresses attitude that connects with their personalities. It\u2019s important to realize that human expressions often depict what a person feels at every moment. This anime does a clever job at capitalizing that to make them feel real. On the other hand, I can\u2019t say the character designs are too impressive. Most of the main characters look too normal while the female cast doesn\u2019t stand out much dynamically. Photography is also a part of the show itself and some of the photos taken by Ena doesn\u2019t really make memorable impressions. Still, I think the show hits mark overall. Every character feels very alive and moves the story together.\\n\\n\r\nFor soundtrack and music, it\u2019s clear that Just Because needed a melancholic style to make it work. Thankfully, this is accomplished thanks to the music director for its creative themes. It\u2019s lighthearted, slow paced, and consistent to make every segment work. Both the theme songs has a very realistic tone and lyrics that matches with the style of the show. Character voice mannerism is also important to convey character personalities and it hits the mark just right. The dialogues makes the characters sound believable and that\u2019s what it\u2019s important.\\n\\n\r\nFour years of high school really can really be quite an experience. For some people, it can feel like a quest to start a new life. For others, it may be like living a world of hell. Then, there are people who think high school may just be part of their journey to adulthood and there\u2019s much more ahead. The characters in this show embarks on that journey and takes the viewers with them. For that reason, Just Because is worth watching as it explores high school relationships, making memories, and discovering what life really means.",

            "content": "*Minimum Spoiler Nostalgic Review*\r\nTL;DR: Love Pentagon between high school teenagers trying to figure out their future while keeping their emotional spillage in check. Also... Just Because. \r\n[Story: 7/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 5/10, Sound: 9/10, Enjoyment: 8/10]\r\n\"It's all in the past\" - Eita Izumi\r\nJust Because is an original anime by Hajime Kamoshida, the genius behind Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. However, just because at a first glance it may seem like this is a generic story about confused intertwined love relationships between group of friends trying to get through high school, the adaptation feels way to close to reality. For those that finished high schoolor those finishing up high school, it will definitely bring back memories of your teen years. This anime shines in the tear-jerking nostalgia department and just because of that, it outshines from the rest of the generic love stories in the ever popular genres of slice of life combined with romance and school. From it's use of orchestra music to piano accompanied backdrops whilst looking back at your past, despite it's suboptimal animation standard given it's by the studio Pine Jam, this under the radar anime is definitely worth the watch. \\n\\n\r\n\"I've only given valentine cards to my dad and my two brothers every year\" - Hazuki Morikawa \\n\\n\r\nJust because the story is generic doesn't mean it can't be interesting. The story in a nutshell is about the transfer student Eita Izumi, who moves back again and attends the same high school all of his friends from middle school goes to as well. Reuniting with them once again reignites all the unresolved love and drama they had between each other plus coupled with the new friends they make in high school further alleviates this love triangle to an all out love pentagon between each other. The story for this anime is simple but its the character interactions that gives its complexity. At it's core, the plot is linear driven however flashbacks from middle school days are used to explain why each character behaves at certain situations. It takes two episodes to get used to the rhythm of the anime but given what a stellar first episode was and how the anime continue to build up with the different characters trying to figure out their feelings for one another while trying to finish high school and graduate, really makes it worthwhile to watch. Who doesn't love riding the nostalgia train.   \\n\\n\r\n\"Can I ask him out on a date?\" - Ena Komiya\\n\\n\r\nJust because the characters appear mundane at first does not mean they do not possess complexity. The fun part about this anime are the characters. At its core the five major characters are: Eita Mizumi (the transfer student with a crush on Natsume), Haruto Soma (best friend of Eita with a crush on Morikawa), Natusme Mio (old friends from middle school with crush on Haruto), Morikawa Hazuki (band chick too shy to confess), & Ena Komiya (CANON camera chick too eager to confess to Eita). This complex love pentagon really drives this show. This anime takes its time developing each of the characters and giving them enough time and backstory to justify their importance and reason for the love they have for the other. Not to mention because each character acts as a foil for the other and how unique each of their personalities are, you really start to identify yourself with one of these characters. Soon enough you will be cheering on for your favourite ship while reminiscing about your old high school ship. Like I said, all aboard the nostalgia train. \\n\\n\r\n\"If you tell him I'll kill you\u201d - Natsume Mio \\n\\n\r\nJust because the animation is subpar doesn't mean the music has to be subpar. Given the fact that the studio adapting this anime is Pine Jam, a rather small studio not really known for their outstanding animation standards, they've done not too shabby of a job adapting this original anime. There were a few scenes that weren't blended well and seemed a bit choppy however, the overall pencil drawn characters gave it a nice cozy feel to the anime. It's funny how despite each of the major characters being completely unique to one another, they were drawn pretty similar to one another. It could be that it serves as a metaphor for life how we may think we are completely different from our friend sitting next to us in class but we are more similar than we think in the hardship and struggle we go through in our adolescence and teenage years with school and love. Aside from the animation what really sells this anime is the music. From the first episode and onwards the quality of the music never drops. From the usage of trumpets and drums to build the tension up to calm relaxing piano medley to reminisce about the past, this show knew how to use it all. Not to mention the OP and ED songs are both amazing to listen to on their own. It really stands out as a complete OST to listen to on its own. Lastly, the seiyuus for this show did a great job in giving life to these characters. Kudos to them. \\n\\n\r\n\"No one likes getting rejected\" - Haruto Soma.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Just Because was a simple anime with a generic premise that surpassed expectations it set for itself. It was not only a great coming of age story dealing with high school love and struggle of school to figure out your future, it served its purpose as a nostalgic ride to let viewers reminisce about their past. As the story progressed you start identifying yourself with the characters in the anime and though it was a slice of life anime featuring a love pentagon, it wasn't a cookie cutter romantic plot that made itself predictable from the start. Plus, who ends up with who in the end will really surprise the viewers. For that reason alone and just because how many puns you can make while watching this anime, I would highly recommend to everyone, not just fans of this genre, to give this anime a watch. Let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite ship and your favourite quote from the anime!  \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!\\n",

            "content": "(No spoilers contained in this review!)\r\nWhen I first read over the synopsis for Just Because I couldn't wait to get my hands on the episodes. As a young adult not so recently out of high school myself, I wanted to torture myself by relieving the anxieties and emotions that run high during the last few months of senior year. And so as the story progressed, I couldn't help but feel disappointed in what was presented to me.\r\nPerhaps it was my own fault for having such high hopes for the anime, but what could've been a compelling story full of heartbreak, fear for the future, andnew hope, felt like a watered down version with ironically little depth. The story focused on a select few students, which was fine at first. That's where all the juicy bits of drama will go down, right? This is where friendships will break apart for the sake of final exams! This is where the long-standing relationship will feel the strain of their romantic clock ticking away until they have to part ways! But instead, what I found in that small group of friends was yet another cliched love triangle. (And let's be honest, we all knew where THAT was going).\\n\\n\r\nI found myself having to force myself to continue, although I did manage to get through all 12 hellishly boring episodes while all the while hoping for something, anything, to HAPPEN. I'm no stranger to slice of life anime, I know they aren't supposed to be action-packed or anything but jesus, in an anime about a bunch of teenagers having to leave behind their friends and find a place for themselves in society I was expecting a few tears at the very least.\\n\\n\r\nJust Because had so much potential and instead, it fell flat. The emotions never went deep enough, the drama never felt dramatic enough, it was almost like the characters just drifted through the story instead of it actually happening to them. Because of this, Just Because is currently sitting with a score of 3 on my list.",

            "content": "I'm a big fan of the romance/drama type of slice of life, which is why I was fairly happy to stumble upon Just Because! in this season. Mood and setting of the anime are quite fitting for winter, so you'll be likely to identify when watching this right now.\r\nStory\r\nThe anime starts off with a transfer student coming back to Tokyo for his last half year of high school, after his father was transferred back from Fukuoka. He's soon reunited with his long lost best friend from middle school and is finding himself confronted with some unresolved things from the past. As the story continues, thecharacters have to face the reality of graduation and resolving  their plans for the future, while love and disappointments are quite hard to handle too. \\n\r\nThis seems quite uninteresting at first -you know, just your typical life of life story- but the characters get interesting and after two episodes I was hooked.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art, well, nothing all too special, but the natural colors and realistic settings (if you were in Tokyo (Enoshima) before, you'll recognize some parts) are comforting and easy to watch. The story is set in winter and the colors are therefore not too saturated. I like the character design because it's not too 'sparkly', the characters have their own trademarks and don't look all the same. Another thing that I found to be interesting was the format of dialogue via messaging, as the characters use a lot of LINE.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIt's super refreshing to hear some new voices, especially Izumi and Natsume's seiyuu sound super good and I hope they'll get more jobs soon! The BGM is subtle and there are some nice pieces from time to time too, I'd say it underlines the plot when it has to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nVery diverse cast and character development is expected (Episode 5). I like how the characters have their families introduced as well, their motives are clear and you get attached to them very easily. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThe theme of this anime and the general undertone are quite melancholic and emotional. It displays the different notions of adulthood and difficulty of being honest with your feelings, as sometimes you'll just don't know what is best for yourself in this moment. Will you be able to keep up with the people you love when you tell them you do, even though their precious friends and you might lose them? Or would you rather shut all those feelings uptight in your heart and deny they're even there? Do you even want to know? If you ever were confronted with those questions, have a look at this anime. I think it might carry a very soothing subliminal message.",

            "content": "~WARNING: EXPECT MINOR SPOILERS~\r\n(A 6 to me means that this anime is slightly above average at where I am currently watrching)\r\nWhat keeps me watching this anime, along with the reason why I decided to write this review is that it reminded me of one truly important fact, one I hope resonates with you in the future:\r\nTHERE IS BEAUTY IN SIMPLICITY.\r\nAs this review is being made while this show is in progress, most of what I say is subject to change at my discretion. As the name of the anime implies, I truly did watch this anime \"Just Because.\" (You can shoot me later for that).Interestingly enough, I will begin by saying I'm actually enjoying the anime for what it is so far, though I hope to see improvements in both pacing and detail as time goes on.\\n\\n\r\nStory ~5~\\n\\n\r\nAs of episode 3, the story from my perspective is average. A handful of students who are about to graduate slowly change as one of their childhood friends moves back after four years. As this is a slice of life, I got what I expected in the first few episodes: Reunions, re-connections, and changes in relations and communication relative to each character. Nothing particularly stands out story-wise, though I believe that is fine in a \"Slice-of-life\", especially this early on.\\n\\n\r\nArt ~7~\\n\\n\r\nMost people seem to be on-or-off with the art, which is understandable because of how much the art shifts in detail between scenes. Throughout the first episode alone, I was taken aback at the stunning background art melding with the animations. The fluidity between 2d and 3d movement impressed me, and I could hardly make out when they genuinely used CG during certain scenes. \\n\\n\r\nDespite their successes detailing art and animation, the anime has the drawback of decreasing character detail during faster animations, such as in the baseball scene in episode 1. As for the characters looking \"Plain\", I see nothing wrong in a realistic anime with realistic designs, regardless of blandness, especially with the beautiful background scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound ~9~\\n\\n\r\nWELL HELLO THERE. I will say now I am HEAVILY biased towards the orchestral/piano side of music, otherwise I may have given the sound more of a 6-7 score. Allow me the pleasure of saying that the tonality of each piece fits into each scene perfectly so far, most especially in the climax of the baseball \"duel\" at the end of episode 1. The joys of reconnecting and success in one scene, along with the subtle peaceful string instruments and slightly awkward beats during piano pieces help make each scene come alive. In anime, a media form where emotion can be conveyed through more than just its characters, music can become a \"make-or-break\" factor. I can confidently say that this anime certainly does NOT break.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ~5~\\n\\n\r\n*sigh* Well hello there. Welcome to single scenes that establish every character and the awkwardness of not being at a point where any true conflict has occurred to allow any true emotional development. At this point, I have no choice but to give the characters a 5 simply because the anime hasn't developed enough to show me any depth behind many of the main characters besides their given personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ~6~\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to explain for those of you who don't understand why I could give a slice of life in its early boring stages a 6/10 (which IS good), allow me to restate: There is Beauty in Simplicity. That's truly what this anime is: Simple. That's what I truly expect out of any slice-of-life anime I watch. The music, art, and potential of this anime impresses me, as did 3-gatsu no Lion; one of my favorite anime to this day. I truly understood it during the second half of episode one: allow me to warn you:\\n\\n\r\n~SPOILERS~\\n\\n\r\nDuring the second half of episode one, the MC finds one of his old friends from their baseball club. Their dynamic after four years is awkward and stoic. The school baseball team has recently failed their attempt at winning nationals and his friend wants to hit one home run as both revenge and as a \"prayer\". The MC (Who hasn't played for years) pitches for the friend, and the band members watching play a beautifully empowering piece in the background. Eventually, all the other main characters watch as the piece slows to a beautiful string orchestral piece as we see a slowed down home run, after which the MC's friend runs and hugs him, laughs, and proceeds to leave to confess to a girl he likes.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS SCENE CONVEYS SO MUCH. The reunion and re connection between close friends, the attachment and encouragement a shared hobby gives between characters, the joy of mutual success, the awe of simply watching as the scene truly comes to life in its climax. That emotion paints a picture describing what I'm talking about. That's the beauty in simplicity.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: ~6~\\n\r\nThe reason my overall is so low is because the anime hasn't given me enough to truly know whether or not it is \"good\". So far, I'm enjoying the ride, and have probably ranted long enough. As the anime continues, I hope for the pace to quicken, drama to occur, and ships to both sail and sink, all set to beautiful music pieces.",

            "content": "An original anime that have a lot of potential to be great but ends so disappointing.\r\n[Story: 3/10]\r\nThe story is slow (and with bad pacing) in most of episodes, mostly in the episodes 1-4 and 9-11. Sometimes some scenes are out of place, for example the baseball scenes with the adults in the middle. \r\n[Character: 3/10]\r\nBesides Komiya and maybe Haruto, all the characters feels boring, lack of personality and are one-sided. Komiya and his outgoing personality makes great moments for the anime, more that most of the main cast. Haruto in some scenes is good, in others not so much. Eita is boring character unless heis with Komiya.\\n\r\nTheir moments with Natsume feels awkward and out of place. Morikawa lacks of personality until the last episodes. I like the friend of Morikawa, Yoriko. Finally, Nastume, a character that is so jealous and indecisive that feels annoying and as a plot device in much episodes. The worst part is that the anime is pro-Natsume and anti-Komiya.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 6/10]\\n\\n\r\nI like the animation despite some episodes (ex. 5) have bad animated scenes. \\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 5/10]\\n\\n\r\nI have no problems with the soundrack. In my opinion, is not bad neither good. The opening is forgettable anyway.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 4/10]\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the only moments with decent comedy are Eita/Ena and Haruto. The scenes with Natsume makes me angry, she is jealous because Eita is with Komiya when she have some feelings for Haruto (because of an erase, really? ). I like the scenes with Yoriko, Haruto (sometimes) and Komiya, they are worth of watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\r\nJust Because! is bad. If Eita have ended up with Ena, it will receive a 6 or maybe 7 of my part but nope, a generic ending with the main girl that did nothing in the entire show. Poor Komiya.  4/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Please note that there are spoilers below. This is primarily due to the fact that my main points cannot be conveyed without explaining specific events in the story. Sections with spoilers will be marked.\r\nNow when I first watched this anime I was attracted to its warm and calm atmosphere, something that is rarely seen in anime filled up with comedic scenes and the like. I liked the protagonist who was not like another blithering idiot that romance/sol/high school anime usually focus on. It was fine, and I liked it so much I regarded it on par with the other big two of this season (inuyashikiand ancient magus bride) The OP sounded great, and the anime had a lot going for it.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately this was overshadowed by major issues, in particular the ideas that this anime seeks to promote. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 3\\n\r\nThe story is generic and involves the usual anime-tropes seen in the genres this show is in. It does not deviate from what we would expect and the ending is extremely predictable. Often J do not focus much on  a show's ending as I believe in the process of story-telling more than the ending itself. However this show does not offer anything out of the ordinary and what was originally calm and soothing becomes boring. However that's not entirely why the story gets such a low score. As this is a romance-drama anime, its story is largely intertwined with its characters. Therefore, if the anime has bad characters who make bad decisions there will be a bad story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art is average. There are some awkward expressions but otherwise it is fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nHaving listened to Yanagi Nagi and Jun Maeda's Owari no Hoshi no Love Song the anime opening didn't fall short. It provided an appropriate atmosphere for the show (calm and soothing) and I liked it. The ending was less impressive, but more or less alright.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1 (Minor spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's main and most damning problem is its cast of characters who feel more like cardboard cutouts. They're the kind of characters who talk and let the viewer know directly what their goals are but never actually demonstrate their intent, which is an extremely lazy way of building a character. The characters never pursue what they want and feel very much like cardboard cutouts. They don't blush, don't spend time together, don't actively pursue their goals. This will be further elaborated in the next section, enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3 \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters is only symptomatic of a larger problem here: The main message of the anime, or the values it holds. Allow me to explain how the problem with the characters is related to this.\\n\\n\r\nMAJOR SPOILERS HERE\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the anime I have come to learn that Natsume is a quiet studious girl and she likes Eita, and she was the ex-president. That's all. There is nothing else about her personality that is known to us and her thoughts and feelings are never revealed to us.  An example: She liked Soma and eventually reconsiders this, but we never really understand why exactly she did that. Some might argue that it was probably because Eita has been helping her out, but it's all just speculation and no direct confirmation. This would have been a nitpick if it were an insignificant plot device but it's not an insignificant plot device. It is something that has to be told to the viewer to get them invested in the main girl. To make matters worse it's not even safe to assume that she simply had a crush on Soma and wasn't serious from the start. There are just so many possibilities as to why she had given up on Soma and why she liked him in the first place. After all, she had been crushing on him for several years now and we know nothing of how she feels. She seems very fickle when it comes to this. And that's just one point.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume and Eita's \"friendship\" (if you could call it that) is weak and all Natsume did was put her studies first. Rita questions her as to whether she was using it as an excuse but was shut down immediately. Perhaps the original intent was to create tension between the main characters. But they were never close in the first place and all it did was  show me how distant the two are. She had no intention to pursue her crush (soma at that time) and when she suddenly switched to Eita i always get reminded of someone picking food off a menu. There's no indication whatsoever that she likes someone even if she says she does, she doesn't smile, she doesn't blush, she doesn't go out of her way to do something (the same applies for Morikawa, but at least she never actually said she liked soma, it was more of accepting -- or postponing -- his confession)\\n\r\nAll in all, Natsume feels like a cardboard cutout. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have a more well-made character, who unfortunately is shoved to the side. Komiya.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why people adore and support Komiya with Eita is that unlike Natsume, she knows what she wants and actively pursues it even though she has lots to lose. She actively shows us that she likes Eita and isn't fickle with her feelings. This is seen in the final episode when Eita graduates. She doesn't give up when things get tough; she's tenacious. She's everything Natsume is not. And most importantly, she actually has chemistry with eita. They joke, they talk, they help one another out. On the other hand Natsume never spared a thought for Eita and there was zero to no interaction.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I realised what the main message of the show was: that love is determined by fate. Komiya fought but lost because it was fate. Natsume won because it was fate. Rita chose Natsume not because of her personality but because \"I've liked her for a ling time\". (I quoted Eita). I chose her because I feel it is meant to be, not because of how wonderful she is, not how she makes me feel, not how much she cares about me. I find this idea very distasteful and seeing Komiya lose out was very heartbreaking. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who say it's realistic, maybe it is in portraying how we make bad choices in choosing romantic partners. Otherwise, it's not. Natsume's character is extreme in how fickle and non-chalant she is, as with Morikawa and even Eita to a certain extent. \\n\\n\r\nMy opinion? This anime is not realistic. It is NOT a realistic portrayal of how people act in real life and it is NOT realistic in how people get rewarded for nothing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nThis was a major letdown.\\n",

The ending song was also decent.\\n\\n\r\n The characters were all cliche.

            "content": "This show requires at least two episodes to find if it's your flavor. Watch a third and you're in for the long run.\r\nStOrY 8/10\r\nThe story is slow as first and moves similar to a train. Once you are at a cruise, you feel very comfortable. You watch the scenery just fly by while losing yourself in your own thoughts. After 3 episodes, you will find yourself thinking about what will happen with the love triangles, relationships, and school lives of the characters.\r\nArT 7/10\r\nThe artwork reminds me of certain old movies but it is very suitable for this kind of storytelling. Sometimes can convey a moodof depression or just normalcy. As if nothing extraordinary is going to happen. I think it allows you to focus more on the emotions being laid out to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nOh and the lighting detail is very charming. I can't ignore that. I love the art.\\n\\n\r\nSoUnD 7/10\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I was so engrossed in the visuals and story that I didn't notice the soundtrack. Some shows actually do a bad job with synchronizing what's happening or transitions in scenes. You won't experience that here. More often than not, there isn't any music. Just the natural environment. It does its job and that's what matters- to set the mood.\\n\\n\r\nChArAcTeR 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters do seem boring or bland at first. But they all have somewhere they want to go and are hung up in some way with their own feelings and inexperience. Izumi might be the most interesting to watch because he doesn't say much but his actions do all the work. He's very likable. I feel like they could express themselves a little more but I'm pretty satisfied with what I'm getting.\\n\\n\r\nEnJoYmEnT 7/10\\n\r\nIt's a slice of life/romance. The comedy is scarce but the drama is ever building. I'm 6 episodes in and the cliffhanger is REALLY good.. I'm enjoying what I'm seeing and I can't comment more on that. If you don't have patience, pass on this one.\\n\\n\r\nVeRdIcT 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't finished airing but going in with little expectation and knowing it was a slow show that requires two episodes to get into, I am very happy with what I've seen so far. I'm definitely looking forward to next week.\\n\\n\r\nTip: Watch 3 episodes at a time if you can. ;]",

            "content": "In all honesty, the series tries very hard to portrayed youth as well romance, but it failed greatly. \r\nI\u2019m romance seeker myself, I love to experience either pure vanilla or train wreck hardship romance story.  But then again the series itself is neither of those two, it mixed all aspect together that i can pretty much say chimera was born. Sadly the potential is wasted and the current story is not even worth much. While this series is original, the premises itself wasn\u2019t original. Let\u2019s venture more. \r\nStory\r\nIt start with bang and such, on how fate and red strings could bring back all friendstogether to experience the love all new again. Eita Izumi, come back to his hometown high schools due to his father work, meeting back his old friends Souma Haruto, as well Natsume, Mio his one side love. To mix it up, come a new junior, Komiya Ena, whom faced with crisis that her photography club might be disbanded. This story is about how all of them crossed each other path and life, and they face their own hardship along the way. So where this could goes wrong?\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is already complex, the same old concept three square love problems is almost common, nothing new, at least make it more unique. Spice it up with uninteresting characters and some bland character that I felt really sorry as I don\u2019t even notice their presence. The development is not even worth praise. Straightforwardly, it\u2019s boring. That\u2019s my feeling all through of the episodes. \\n\r\nThe story pace is rather slow, and the interaction between character is just almost nowhere. The interaction between characters doesn\u2019t feel even alive. It tries to be both happy and sad but what I just see is a cycle of same problems. Unsolved, and running away. This is fine if it just a couple episodes, but this problem actually stand until the very end. If you want the character to be unlikeable, then its fine, but the problem is the one who is bringing down the whole story is the main cast. Please be alert that it should be only one or 2 in the series, not all the cast to thrash out. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nFor goodness sake, this is the most annoying aspect of the series. They are so bland and childish, way beyond what teens actually do. I\u2019m just a high school student a few years ago, and to be honest I can say that it just outrageous. I know everyone move in their own pace, we might be young but we\u2019re not that dumb. While it might be bad to some level, I actually like some of them, it just the way it portrayed ruin the characters for good sake. Eita Izumi, the only character that I do respect for his loyalty to his love, how he sees the reality, and while might seem like dead inside, he still help people in needs. In this case, I actually do like him. Now come next the best pal, Souma, Haruto with his own love story. Needlessly to say, his character is bland, boring, not really the best pal actually and stoic. As the story progress, his whole interaction is not really leaving any presence at all. Lastly is our main heroine, Natsume, Mio who is indecisive beyond help without a little push. It\u2019s okay to be a little indecisive but her indecisive and running away is just annoying. Where exactly the unique and interesting traits? Kindness? Lovely? We can fall in love with anyone, but at least spare from this torture. Eventually, you will get hurt alone in a side corner of a caf\u00e9. The junior, Komiya Ena actually more interesting, she\u2019s at very least kind, and high spirit to achieve her own goal and dreams. She is more realistic and actually feels alive. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Music\\n\r\nThe animation is just so-so, if you actually noticed, sometimes the character faces actually looks little bit weird. But it is fair enough and not really that bad for me to say. As for music, I actually love it, it\u2019s inspiring, interesting with the vivid colors and catchy to be honest. Other than that, there are no more worthwhile points to be pointed out. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nI had my share of fun, but the series is not really good, the premise itself is interesting but the actual story wasn\u2019t. The flaws can be read like open books, and the development is truly pathetic if I\u2019ve to say. I do enjoy some moments but the unpleasant one is many more than what I actually enjoy. It could go further but sadly that path is just a loop hole as of now. \\n",

            "content": "Just Because! is a relatively slow-paced anime which focuses on a group of students in their last year of high school, approaching the end of their school days. Along with that, they must make important decisions for their future, as well as for the each person likes.\r\nAll characters develop at different speeds when they come to realize their feelings.  That's what this anime clearly showed. Each of the characters thought in their own way to come to have the courage to be together with the person they like. This anime is pretty distinctive in that aspect, which was what i liked.\r\nAlong with the romance,you've got all the characters' futures to be decided. Some of them don't know, some of them already decided and others don't care as long as they get a decent job. The fact that they used the last year of high school  is particularly effective in presenting the amount of pressure on all of them as they also have to consider what to do to make a move on the person they love. I guess that's why a lot of anime series use this time to create some drama.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the art, it fitted well with the melancholic mood of the anime throughout. But their were times when it was not at its best, the movements looked pretty forced at times too. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters...\\n\r\nIzumi, Eita:\\n\r\nNice character, I can relate to him a lot. The effort he puts in when helping out Natsume is incredible. Interesting that his future is kind of already planned, unlike the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume, Mio:\\n\r\nDebatable here. A lot of people hate her, I understand that. Some of her actions were ridiculous and stupid but for me it got cancelled out when she realized her real feelings towards the end of the series. Very slow development but it was interesting to see her change bit by bit.\\n\\n\r\nKomiya, Ena:\\n\r\nMVP. Does a lot for Izumi all the he way until the end. Direct and honest character who always knows what she's doing. Her determination to achieve her goals  is amazing, easily likable character. \\n\\n\r\nSoma, Haruto:\\n\r\nBest friend of Izumi, he gives advice to Izumi and gets advice from him too. Their friendship is emphasized throughout the series, even if they didn't meet for quite some time. His face expressions were really funny.\\n\\n\r\nMorikawa, Hazuki:\\n\r\nA character who cares a lot for her family and others' feelings. The way she responded to Haruto towards the end was a bit odd for me but since it involved her future I guess it was the right choice. Liked the hairstyle change.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the story was predictable, but I guess wanting more original ideas is a bit too much. I enjoyed a lot of Haruto's scenes because of his face expressions, and i also liked Komiya's efforts to get closer to Izumi. Overall, I was planning to give this a 8 but since it ended with my ship coming true I'll give an 9.\\n",

It's either one.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nIzumi is a boy that is moving back to his home town from Tokyo and from that moment on he starts to interact with old friend Souma which he met when he was walking around his new school. From that point, he starts to interact with the other people knew and interacting with new people that interact with his old friends aka Souma and Natsume. The story tries to make it feel as realistic as possible and don't try to over dramatic it's characters and the story itself. But at thesame time, the plot is almost like not there or sometimes its everywhere. When you watch the first few episodes, there is almost no story at all. You don't know what's happening beside Izumi is moving back to his home town. The story doesn't really explain much either. I assume they're trying to be realistic and let you see how the characters develops overtime by interacting but I'll explain that later. The story do start to pick up around episode 6-7 but I feel like that's already too late when the series only have like 12 episodes. It's like a story that has no story. That's why you'll either hate it or love it. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not to be praised about but it's not terrible either. The characters sometimes feel flat to the point that there is not much depth into it. The art just feels flat but it's not like terrible either. I just wish they added more depth into the drawing which could raise the score up for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is the best part for this series. The Ending song is really good personally and the Opening is pretty nice to listen to. The ost itself isn't really that great but I guess it fits some part of the story. I guess the OST is a bit bland. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI won't go too much in depth for this because it can spoil some stuff in the anime. The character development in this anime is just so PAINFULLY slow. It's so painfully slow that it's almost like there isn't any development at all. The show is trying to make the character and story realistic as possible but it fell short. There is barely any backstory for each characters.. You will barely know the characters backstory which literally makes the character development so slow. The idea of realism for each characters is executed so badly when the PLOT relies on the character development to make the plot itself. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm trying to enjoy the series as much as I can. I had watched tons of Anime so much to the point I got nothing left to watch. I watched so many Anime that I gotten to the point I'm too lazy to add it on my MAL list. The series is just so painfully slow but episode 7 did start to get a bit interesting for me to keep watching till the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nA plot with almost no plot. Realism executed so poorly. If you want to watch something to fill your over post depression of a series you watch or just bored then I guess you should watch this anime. If you love strong character development, strong plot, meaningful plot, or even something you truly want to enjoy then I will say stay away from this series.",

As you can see story wise the anime is pretty vanilla wich is not a bad thing but certanly doesn't help to make it more interesting.\r\nThe art is ok, but the color scheme is pretty bland giving the anime an even more uninteresting look. Also the animation is pretty unsubstantial from a moment to another you are with agrounded style of animation an then the show decides to go full on spocon. Sound is good, but nothing to write home about. The characters are more of the same generic slice of life tropes you've seen a million times, with, once again, uninspired designs. Another thing to notice is that the humor is bad, it's all reaction base humor with jokes that never land.\\n\r\nThe enoyment of this series is almost non-existant it is mediocrity at it's best.\\n\\n\r\nOverall don't watch it unless you want to stack another anime or you REALLY like this genre.",

            "content": "What can I say, this anime is a visual masterpiece. I really think that no other anime comes close to depicting the mundane details of the characters' daily lives and facial expressions to such an extent. I can't recommend any similar anime to Just Because as the show is just so unique and different; Tsuki Ga Kirei isn't even close except for its romance genre.\r\nAnd the stakes here are high. An original anime series with a myriad of sponsors betting on this show - multinational corporations Canon and Odakyu to name a few. So for all the controversy surrounding the supposed 'delays', this anime isnothing short of impressive. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nIn a world that's increasingly more uncertain the innocence of the story really provides a tiny bit of escapism for viewers. The depiction of everyday life, use of LINE, and the relationships among the main characters are particularly noteworthy. Episodes are barely melodramatic, aside from certain climatic exchanges that mainly serve to provide a direction for the overall story. Yes the premise might be cliche -\\n\r\nHigh school, typical confessions, 2 guys & 3 girls - a recipe for a predictable story line. However, what is so remarkable is how the story unfolds and its execution. Furthermore there are some scenes that might appear redundant but they are critical to the progression of the story such as the baseball games in the first half of the show and the exchange between Haruto and his mum. The overall pacing is just nice, some episodes might feel slower as if nothing has been achieved. Yet it sets a perfect foundation for what is to come next. I just wished that the show was longer.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI'll say it again: Visual Masterpiece. The drawings of the monorail stations, baseball games, exchanges on the bridge, the buses and the bus stops are stunning. More attention is paid to the facial expressions as well (not just the colour of their eyes). Yet for all the complaints regarding the use of CGI, inconsistency in the animation quality, it is highly laudable for a television anime to produce art of such quality. The producers are relying so much on these minute details and it isn't hard to see why they've nailed the slice of life genre perfectly. The overall art creates a mood that is in overall so relaxing and calming and makes you wish to be back in Japan again.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe ED is notable and the lyrics are fitting for the story and mode. Furthermore, they're performed by the voice actresses! I personally prefer it to the OP. Well, the voice actors of the various characters perfectly match the roles. They speak with intonations that really depict what the character is like. For example, the voice actor of Eita really draws out the dullness of his character the producers desire to depict. Transitions, footsteps and also the Trumpet - Pretty good!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nDon't want to dive so much or I'll spoil the story. Thus far, I feel that Komiya is mainly used as a tool to progress the story. Her character is by far unique and the most interesting among the rest. I also like how they showed the personal developments of Natsume and Morikawa throughout the series. The bond between Eita and Haruto as well as the entire group also makes the show noteworthy. The only downside was that Inui Yoriko was neglected, serving as the character to help sail the ship for the main cast (I wish the show was Longer)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI need not say more.\\n\r\nHowever, viewers should note that the supposed delays have nothing to do with the producers or the directors. I've been following @JustBecause_JP on twitter and the local broadcast appears to be on schedule every week on the various Japanese Channels. Furthermore, episodes are produced few months in advanced and the supposed one week break in the middle of the season was meant to give the local viewers a tour of the local Kanagawa sites that are featured remarkably on the anime. Hence, all the accusations against the director and the quality of various scenes are basically unfounded and largely bias.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I felt somewhat compelled on making a review for this just because (lol). Its a pretty lengthy review which WILL contain some spoilers so I'd advise you to read with caution. \r\nIf I were to be asked \"Was there much progression between Mio Natsume (the girl MC likes since middle school) and Eita Izumi once they rejoiced?\" well my answer would simply be there was HARDLY ANY. Most of the time we were stuck with hearing Mio complain and make excuses to our main protagonist for why she hasn't made any progress in confessing to his friend Haruto. At that point it was playing catand mouse, nobody wants to make a move and confess their feelings for the one they liked (between Natsume and Eita). \\n\\n\r\nFor several episodes we are rewarded to some nice touching moments of another girl named Komiya relationship with Eita. Without going too much into details, Komiya goes out of her way to assist Izumi for his exam while at this time \"the witch\" Mio is practically non-existent. Throughout all these episodes, the only time we see \"the witch\" Mio was when she catches the two hanging out for the first time (which probably fueled her rage to the maximum) or too busy being very concerned with Haruto & Morikawa. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished the show, I felt more satisfied with the Eita's friend shipping than his own. Haruto/Morikawa relationship blossoming was more healthy and understandable. It didn't feel anywhere as bad as the official ship between Natsume and Eita which was forced and rushed. Whenever Mio & Eita interactions were shown, it mainly displayed how jealous and b*tchy she truly was. It's not as if there was an episode or two showing Mio & Eita hanging out with each other and getting any closer than they were before which if that happened, I probably wouldn't have nearly as much of a frustration over this relationship. \\n\\n\r\nI hope that my review will help prepare others for what's to come in this anime. I mainly liked Just Because for Haruto/Morikawa moments along with Komiya's refreshing energetic personality. I would give this anime a rating of 6 out of 10 at the moment though a quick look over at this anime at a later time may cause me to change it.",

            "content": "I wish MAL would put a more detailed rating for anime and manga because I'm the guy that thinks it's necessary to have \".5\" in ratings, like: \"6.5,7.5,8.5...\", sometimes I don't feel that an anime it's not good enough for a \"7\" but not that bad for an average \"6\". Anyways, let's get to the review, shall we?.\r\nDisclaimer: This is a Spoiler-free review, please forgive me if you find difficult to understand some parts, as English is not my first language and this is the second review that I write (feel free to read my first review on the anime \"Blend S\").\r\nJust Because !: Acollection of intimate moments, but without fuss\\n\\n\r\nWhen I decided to follow Just Because! I said I would do it because yes, without more. After watching his 12 episodes, I'm left with the experience of an anime that with little it says much. That manages to catch, without being really a portent in any area.\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of this anime is how it presents a common story in a normal, almost boring and yet captures you. It depends completely on the characters, that no matter what they become, whether they reach their goals or not, they put you into their life. Like most slice of life, the story of Just Because! it is simply the daily life of five students, and how they will spend their last months in High school.\\n\\n\r\nIt is that stage of transition, just when school ends and you face the unknown, the future, when you become an adult. It makes sense that many of the most important scenes of Just Because! occur in a train station, because all these guys are about to take one to their future.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a 100% objective point of view, the lives of these guys, except for specific moments, are quite boring. But is not real life like that? And maybe that's where the charm of this series lies. His characters are not particularly interesting, except for Komiya. They have nothing special and none has any real problems. Maybe that's why for many this series has nothing to say.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, there is something that gives value to this original anime from Pine Jam.\\n\\n\r\nIt is that amalgam of normality with classic tropes, which are slightly subverted and then fall back into them. Maybe it's that calm environment and its deliberately slow pace. Without being a work of art, this anime manages to entertain and keep you interested, despite using the familiar resource of a love triangle. Although it started being a geometric figure with more edges.\\n\\n\r\nWeaknesses and strengths of Just Because!\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Just Because! introduces us to a mysterious exchange student ... which is not. Eita Izumi is not unknown to the rest of the protagonists, on the contrary. Four years ago he studied with most of his castmates, but a move took him away from them. Eventually he lost contact, but he did not forget the girl he liked or his best friend back then. His return acts as a catalyst in everyone's lives, and a very successful \"duel\" scene on a baseball diamond with his best friend puts the plot in motion.\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on undoing the love polygon that I mentioned a few lines back and at the same time, decide the direction their lives will take in a few months. Eita struggles to clarify her feelings about Mio Hatsume, an old schoolmate who in turn used to be in love with her best friend, Haruto Souma. In turn, Haruto is interested in timid Hazuki Morikawa, who played in the school band. In the formula is also Ena Komiya, a girl one year below the future graduates, who falls in love with Eita after photographing him while he is facing in an improvised duel of batter and pitcher with Haruto.\\n\\n\r\nThe rhythm of the first episodes is inconsistent and it seems that the story is not going anywhere, which affects the experience. However, in the last episodes it takes speed. In the case of the characters, they are all nice, but none stands out too much. Komiya is probably the best character in the series and yet the series does not show enough of her - or of the others - to understand her motivations. Despite this, they manage to drag us to their inner world, however superficial it might be. For some this may seem a weakness, but for those of us exhausted to see exaggerated personalities in the anime, or one-dimensional characters created around a single edge -like the classic tsunderes- it is actually refreshing to see normal people. However boring they may seem.\\n\\n\r\nAs for art, it is probably the thinnest point of the series. The character design is simply weak. Once again, with the exception of Komiya there is no really outstanding character, neither among the main nor the secondary ones. This contributes to the feeling that it is a mundane story, with nothing extraordinary. As for the animation, it only has two really good moments, and both are about the baseball field. The construction of these scenes of the first and last episode served to make a thematic closure in Just Because! which is appreciated for its symmetry.\\n\\n\r\nMusic, on the other hand, is the element of the highest quality without being overwhelmingly good. The opening \"Over and Over\", interpreted by yanagi Nagi helps convey the feeling of melancholy that permeates the work. However, I prefer the incidental music of Just Because !. The debutante Fukusawa Erika does a great job in giving atmosphere to the story, something that can be seen in the most emotional scenes of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the performances, except for specific moments can be very monotonous. The greatest example of this is Eita himself, who despite being the protagonist, is perhaps the least energetic of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended ... but not for everyone\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, I have to say that I would recommend Just Because !, but not for all public. In essence it is an anime with a typical story and that does not stand out particularly in anything. It does not have a brilliant technical execution, on the contrary, it has more than one pothole. And yet, it has its appeal. The fact that he deliberately tries to be mundane and common gives him a realism not so common in anime. Also, avoid becoming trapped in many romantic dramas, to add frankly exaggerated or melodramatic conflicts to maintain interest.\\n\\n\r\nAvoid curling the curl in love relationships and when it seems that you will make a turn of this style, take the logical, normal route. In that sense, his characters seem to be more mature than normal for his age ... except for some scene of jealousy. They make rational, but boring decisions for those who seek pure and simple entertainment. As someone who has seen a lot of anime in his life, the boring Just Because! In fact it is refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nObviously it is not the best school romance of the year, that honor is for Tsuki ga Kirei, a very superior series. But as a way to pass the time, I found it more than adequate. It is not an ambitious anime and it will certainly pass to oblivion, but it does not cease to be reasonably entertaining for me. Although his final scene was somewhat anticlimactic, my \"Ship\" arrived at safe harbor and I am satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough someone should teach Eita how to change the wallpaper of his phone.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nJust Because! It is an anime without a great message, story, characters or animation. Nothing stands out in excess, however, its apparent mediocrity is refreshing. It will soon be forgotten, but it fulfills its purpose.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating\\n\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The best way to sum up Just Because! is a realistic high school romance melodrama, knowing each character's goals and ambitions that ties in with the love triangle antics. And also, I thought it sounded similar to Spring's Tsuki ga Kirei but it isn't, and while that romance build up overtime, this one is different in most aspects.\r\nOf course, the series isn't without its shortcomings as production values earlier on hindered the so-called \"hidden side\" of the anime industry by director Atsushi Kobayashi, but I defer to think that with all that said and done, the series as a whole pulled off really well, somuch that the production value isn't as bad as what the damage had already been dealt with since the mid-way in the series.\\n\\n\r\nWritten by Hajime Kamoshida of Pet Girl of Sakurasou fame, Just Because! displays the lives of high school seniors in their final semester, working their way amongst their last days of youth, for their goals and ambitions to make way into their future. All of a sudden, a transfer student (Eita Izumi) transfers into the high school, creating a sorta up-roar between the friendship of Haruto Souma and (crush) Mio Natsume to reflect on their past, and re-decide that for their love interests (Haruto X Moriwaka and love triangle Komiya X Izumi X Mio) that they would go on the same ways as their partner would.\\n\\n\r\nFor such a story that's as realistic as it could, while the premise overall was the set-up for the plot I really think that it sums up all the experiences that all of us had with our love interests in school, especially when it's time to transition into our new life stations while maintaining the love for one another that's growing through the years. Just Because! is really a good representation of a coming-to-age romance anime that others out there just don't cut it or even get close to showing the real-life scenes of high school romance.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with that, let's get to the characters (Spoilers to the specific minimum!)\\n\\n\r\nEita Izumi is the comeback MC whose past is ridden with family-moving over the years, and the sudden move back to his hometown sparks up the memories of the forgotten past of friendships, emotions and motivations of the people related to him. As typical as his character may sound, it's not all bad, because he is often seen as the meditator towards his best bud Haruto on his life stations and even towards his liking towards Morikawa, who has reeked his interests because she could play good songs with her small trumpet in the Band Club. But towards the love triangle between Komiya and Natsume, he can be a douche at times, just because it's very easy to misread girls' feelings, and this is the sole representation of that love triangle relationship. A cool go-getter if you can believe that, always wanting to enjoy life to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\nClassmate (and long-time crush) Mio Natsume may be seen as aloof towards the fact that at first, the rumours of her and Haruto borne from an item that sparks a relationship (which Eita suspects also), but in fact the latter is what keeps her alive and well, knowing that the past affections for Eita are unrequited, and his forthcoming made her reconsider how much she has prepared herself at the point when we finally confessed to him for her love towards him, and even the challenges when Komiya made her advances towards him earlier on, disgusting the fact that jealousy may be what is hindering her from realizing that if she doesn't make a move, Komiya may end up being Eita's significant. A character that is light-hearted and cares for others, but Eita's comeback (just because) changed her perspective in moving things along.\\n\\n\r\nBest bud Haruto Souma has always liked baseball, and Eita's influence on his life re-sparked the passion of playing his hobby, and the introduction of Morikawa gave him another chance to desire for a relationship, and although bumpy along the way, the desire that \"if times change and the love interest still stands, the relationship is a go\" is very foretold in a sense that goals and ambitions stand in the way, and if the relationship is still the main core of your life, pursue it by all means. His character basis might not be one that stands out, but it does deserve a mention that throughout the odds of chasing Morikawa, he still wants to stand by her side (just because), and that reflects the affection of not holding back towards the partner in life and beyond.\\n\\n\r\nHazuki Morikawa is unfortunately kinda like an introvert and (like Natsume) seen as aloof, but as mentioned, she is a trumpet player in the Band Club, and that's what makes her character stand out in. The calmest person of the MCs, with her friends helping out in her last days towards graduation, it may seem that she is very chill, often acting out like a normal girl, but deep down, the relationship with Haruto sticks out like a sore thumb just because of the fact that his involvement in her life becomes a burden more than anything, and reconsiderations galore, but that's what may come and to be for the best of both worlds. Overall, the calm one and very composed, not giving in towards easy puppy love.\\n\\n\r\nBest girl Ena Komiya is a 2nd year at the less-than-stellar disbanding Photography Club, and her encounter with Eita makes another goal to realize that other than revitalizing her club, coming into contact with Eita's hobbies pursued her feelings eventually to chase after him, knowing that through these small meetings and coincidences that she confesses towards Eita with a very clear mindset. But all is not well, as Mio knows about it and tries to stop her with a very clear \"no\". Her character is more or less the \"already know what's coming\" person, with her efforts not left in vain to carry on the passion and pursue what is best for her ownself and also left to fend for herself, to the point even after being rejected, that she has to move on from the ordeal.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to the studio of choice, newcomer Pine Jam has earnestly earned its worth being a worthy contender, having made its 1st full TV transition with Summer 2017's Gamers!, and I've gotta say there were leaps and loopholes along the way, but like as mentioned, all that hard work and effort all lies down to the very end card, where us reviewers review the anime series as a whole. The art style may not be special, but it does stand out amongst some of the worthy series we have in Fall 2017 (Ancient Magus' Bride, Houseki no Kuni etc.) by settling in towards the reality side and showcasing some of the smoothest animation I've seen in quite a while (although there were some dropping frames here and there). Even at the expense of quality (though some would agree), I would differ that studio Pine Jam has done a good follow-up towards Gamers! in terms of quality and the amount of work input into this series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd oh, the music. If you know anything about Yanagi Nagi's works (this season's Kino's Journey), her music composition is nothing short of outstanding. The OP \"Here and There \" and the ED \"Behind\" by the anime CVs are a delight to listen to every passing episode, and on its own. In the past, I wasn't really hooked onto her previous works (Ano Natsu de Matteru, Oregairu etc.) but given her track record, she definitely is one of (if not) the best music composers of the modern anime times, and her light and melodious voice just shudders me to oblivion in terms of surging emotions and feelings, it's that good! Really hoping for her next composition work, and the work here really takes your breath away.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Just Because ends up as the surprise anime of Fall 2017. Knowing studio Pine Jam did the production and Yanagi Nagi's music composition has me hooked from Day 1 and I'm not a fair bit disappointed by what I saw. So if you're looking for a realistic romance setting, there are others out there which are better than this, but this is really a show NOT to be overlooked, so go catch it whenever you can, Just Because! (pun intended)",

            "content": "Boy am I a sucker for these types of animes. A school setting, romance in the air, high school students trying to figure out their future as they go through their everyday lives. And Just Because! shows it all. Or does it show it all?\r\nLet's start out with some of the positives.\r\nStory 8/10 - It's a typical school romance anime, but with a nice twist that makes it unique. It has a more dramatic vibe to it but they add in really heartwarming moments and comedic scenes to help lighten the tone.\r\nSound 9/10 - I love the piano in the background as it's perfect forthis type of anime, and the OP and ED were both very solid.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10 - Every episode kept me going and made me want to watch more, as I would be struck with each of the character's emotions and become immersed with their dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the more \"eh\" parts of this show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Art 7/10 - Don't get me wrong, the art in this anime can look really nice, but at other times, really poor. Some examples would be how their faces would look normal, but then in other scenes look completely different and disoriented. As for the animation, it felt clunky at times, shown when the characters were playing baseball, or just walking around.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and their relationships 7.5/10 - At first, I really did like the personalities of the characters in this show, but some of them became to be bland and repetitive in their actions. The MC is a good example, as I thought he was more interesting, but he kind of just acts lifeless in most of the episodes, except for one, where he actually showed that he cared for a certain character. The other characters were fine for the most part. As for the relationships, I felt like there should have been more time showing the progression of their relationships and more screen time with specific characters to explain them better.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then for that last episode, and this is where if you want to avoid any possible spoilers or hinting, should skip this part and head to the bottom.\\n\\n\r\nMan, that last episode. It could have been so much better, but it just wasn't. This anime literally depended on that last episode, as the past 4 or 5 episodes were all just build up for these last scenes. I was thinking about the last episode heading into it, and wondered if they were really going to give us a satisfactory ending, where they're able to tie up everything about the relationships and leave us fulfilled, and I realized that there really wouldn't be a way to do so unless they extended the episode by like 10 minutes. But it was still a 24 minute episode, and they used up every second of those 24 minutes, but they just did not deliver. And what's crazy is that even though the ship I was rooting for won, you don't really know about the progression of them or moreso how they will progress, and that's just because(lol no pun intended) there's just not enough screen time with them, in the last episode and in the previous episodes. At least all of the characters are sent off with a nice ending, but I just wished it was presented in a more satisfactory way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 - It was a roller coaster of emotions all the way through, and I became quite invested in the story and the relationships between them, and it ended in the way I had wanted it to, but just not executed well enough, shadowing over the rest of the anime. But it was nice, and although unlikely, I'd love to see their college life in season 2, where they'll have an opportunity to really build on the relationships made in season 1.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nLike a couple of the characters in Just Because!, I too went through the grueling process of test taking in the hopes of earning high scores and favorable university-related invitations. They went to cram school, so they have a one-up on me in terms of drive, but, as someone who empathizes with their position, I don\u2019t envy them one bit.\r\nAs for the tale told around them and their close friends, the results may just barely pass the mark.\r\nSTORY\r\nFiction sometimes depicts fantastical lands and strange creatures. Other times, it will take a typical setting, twist itslightly, and produce a new take on a familiar concept. But then there are those stories which simply mirror real life in a straightforward way, following the small struggles and everyday events which push most people.\\n\\n\r\nJust Because! takes to heart that last category and never lets go. As the plot focuses on a handful of adult-bound teenagers who must deal with prospects and relationships, the anime revels in its mundanity. No bombastic dialogue. No ultra-exciting happenings. Only believable moments that beget a sense of realism which most people either relate with or otherwise understand firsthand.\\n\\n\r\nThis approach can be a double-edged sword of sorts, for a plot of this nature can tread into dull territory if mistreated. Especially so in this instance when the school setting argues against it for lack of originality (despite being an original project in origin). The drama must therefore have an allure which elevates it to a worthwhile spot so that it may engage the audience with its content.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, this show discovers that allure. Very grounded and very personable scenes form a quiet direction whose sincerity supersedes any perceived dullness. Rekindling a friendship between two people who had grown apart in recent years. Visiting an aquarium as a group. Playing a poignant trumpet out by the river for all to hear. Quizzing someone on the train to calm their nerves. Getting someone a foodstuff from the nearby convenience store. On paper, these scenes appear mediocre at best, but, in practice within Just Because!, they highlight the anime and its ability to capture those mundane yet believable moments.\\n\\n\r\nA breakdown of the narrative, though, starts to unveil cracks in its makeup. Certain story beats \u2013 such as self-promises not being kept or wagers causing the same result regardless of their existence \u2013 do not matter as much as preordained. A grander theme fails to weave in-between those nice moments, too.\\n\\n\r\nIt can get worse when Just Because! invites those two frustrating neighbors from down the bloc just past Romantic Avenue: Ms. Communication and Ms. Understanding. Their involvement prevents some delicious payoff throughout the entire season, and their combined might can even cause plain silliness when, for example, an obviously intelligent student not only amuses a \u201cfriend\u201d where feelings are already known but also somehow cannot change the background of his own phone to avoid obvious confusion.\\n\\n\r\nNow, yes, these neighbors drive the plot and allow the necessary conflict to arise. However, for a story so presumably proud of its realistic portrayal, their arrival often replaces dramatic weight with induced eye-rolling. Thankfully, they aren\u2019t so obnoxious that they outright ruin the show, for the consistent, deliberate events eke out at least a slight victory.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nJust Because! has a small debate which surrounds its visual acumen.\\n\\n\r\nNot in question: the atmosphere. A strong sense for lighting sets the mood quite well as somber thoughts and the unknown future cloud not only the wintery air but also the characters which carry this tone with them.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the background art, it dazzles amidst this cloudiness thanks to the constant establishing shots and realistic detail given to the many areas visited. Often, the audience feels as though they are there at the school, the surrounding city, and even within the homes of the characters as the show goes super out of its way to create a space alive with opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nThe debate comes with the animation quality. On the one hand, its looseness leads to expressiveness, allowing for a larger spread of actions and reactions. On the other hand, it can get (very) rough on occasion and therefore not exactly pretty to look at, especially in contrast to the rest of the artistry.\\n\\n\r\nBut it goes back to the realistic approach which Just Because! champions. How this expressive, rougher style coincides with the anime\u2019s overall direction. Better yet, it lends itself to higher emotion and stronger purpose in the scenes depicted. If nothing else, it can be nice to see some risk now and again, and such is the case with this interesting decision here.\\n\\n\r\nTougher to defend is the CG usage, but it\u2019s infrequent enough that it doesn\u2019t impede the show too much. And, while the color palate for the character designs may be too washed out, that aesthetic follows the grayer mood of the story. Plus, the simplistic looks of Eita and the others ensure that the realism levels remain right where they need to be.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this anime deserves a special shout-out for its phone and texting display. Letting the speech bubbles and stacking exchanges pop up near the characters as opposed to always focusing in on their phones was a neat choice. It gave Just Because! more chances to let the quietness and the normalcy of the visuals breathe, and so the debate deescalates again.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nJust as the story hugs docility, the cast members within Just Because! contribute to that same feeling. Eita, Mio, Haruto, and Hazuki do not necessarily pounce with fervor but instead contend with their personal predicaments in a subtle, reserved manner.\\n\\n\r\nTake Eita. Having been away for a while due to his father\u2019s work, he must reacclimate himself with this familiar-yet-distant environment. Not just the area itself but the people too. Haruto, his once best friend. Mio, the girl he has always had a crush on. While he and they know each other, it isn\u2019t until now that he puts in the effort to really know them on a deeper level.\\n\\n\r\nThat doesn\u2019t mean he overwhelms them with information or digs into their psyches. Rather, Just Because! follows their small conversations, their everyday interactions which create between them those lasting relationships which talking and understanding could only achieve. Be it running into Haruto out on the streets and asking questions about each other or apologizing to Mio (and her in turn as well to him) after the two took part in a small spat, these interpersonal moments allow them and their connections to grow.\\n\\n\r\nIt can also be seen in the other relationships. Hazuki and Mio chat together at a quaint caf\u00e9 or in a secluded spot of the school as they discuss feelings and futures. Haruto and Hazuki have an aside all to themselves on the local baseball field. Mio confronts Haruto about her own thoughts (with eraser in tow). And they all meetup to have a warm, hearty meal to combat the cold weather, taking comfort in the friendships they currently share.\\n\\n\r\nAll the while, as these interpersonal problems play out, they face their individual issues with that same sense of subtlety. Eita chooses to ignore the flow, not letting the leisure of life keep him sedated. Mio stops making excuses and realizes that hard work can pay off. Haruto picks up tons of courage, fights his fears, accepts compromise, and promises to do what he can. And Hazuki begins to think less about what others want and, through makeovers and introspection, starts to think about what she needs as well.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, Just Because! creates in these characters a theme of agency for them to embrace. It doesn\u2019t always manifest in quite the same manner between the lot, but that docile drive to forge their own path rings true. Given the premise, how they are becoming adults very soon and must therefore grasp such independence, this theme gives the anime strength of writing throughout most of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe odd one out, then, is Ena, for she already has that agency. An outsider to this group, and, indeed, only really ever interacting with Eita, she\u2019s a go-getter through and through. Her ideas, her photography, her emotions, her words. Ena may be difficult to handle at times, but her self-understanding arguably puts her above the rest when it comes to reaching adulthood.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why her outcome in the love triangle ends up as one of the most intriguing parts of her arc and the anime at large. The denial comes off as a semi-surprising decision but a realistic one at that. Even better, it juxtaposes with the others in the cast. That having that agency and going for it all does not always equate to success and to happiness.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it goes against the spirit of Just Because!: because everyone else lives happily ever after (more or less). But loss is yet another means of growing up. With a story centered on characters experiencing precisely this transitional phase, this sad outcome fits right alongside the strong character writing present in Eita, Mio, Haruto, and Hazuki\u2019s own arcs.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this anime hits a few walls regarding the audio elements it includes.\\n\\n\r\nWithin the OP, titled \u201cover and over\u201d, the piano flourishes and parts of the vocals get at that poignant feeling which Just Because! adheres to. Yet the fast pace contradicts the flow of the show, other parts of the vocals sound flat, and whatever energy it tries to go for gets lost along the way in its straightforward presentation.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cbehind\u201d, the ED, fights back against its title by moving ahead of its OP counterpart. A mid-tempo pace and a slew of ambient effects give this at-times gentle, at-times empowering song a solid foundation. The harmonized vocals, the return of that piano, and the orchestral edge push it further ahead as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack has both its positives and its negatives. While it can have a couple of nice melodic tunes, some of its more slice-of-life offerings are way too all-over-the-place, making for an unfitting listen that clashes with the subdued vibe of the show.\\n\\n\r\nA couple of the voice-acting performances attempt a save even if nobody exactly knocks it out of the park. Taishi Murata as Haruto brings forth enthusiasm and gleeful responses. And Lynn (her full name given on database sites) as Ena overbears others with her loud, persistent speaking but can also lay bare her softer, emotional side.\\n\\n\r\nAoi Ichikawa as Eita may not have had the most skilled or impressive performance, but, given that it was his first ever role in the medium \u2013 and the main lead at that \u2013 he deserves a little leeway as he sharpens his craft in future projects.\\n\\n\r\nIn total, they do not completely falter, but the audio elements within Just Because! at least seem to be some of its weaker facets.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIt probably comes as no surprise that I\u2019m a big fan of these mature dramas. \u201cMature\u201d defined here as \u201cfocusing on a believable cast with a realistic backdrop and grounded conflicts.\u201d I\u2019m all for stories with lots of action, a comedy side, or a fantasy angle. But I also gravitate towards these intriguing replications of the human condition.\\n\\n\r\nFor this reason, I liked this anime despite some of my grievances. While not a \u201cslow burn\u201d per se, watching the events play out in such a calm, normal manner was not only a nice change of pace but also a mellow experience. It would be fair to say that this tale roots itself too much in non-excitement since almost no parts of it truly stick out as memorable, but its consistency and care within the narrative are positives to me.\\n\\n\r\nOn the characters themselves, some were favorable and a few not so much. Haruto was a good dude, and I admired his attitude when dealing with his situations. Mio didn\u2019t do a whole lot in the anime, but she was cute and likable nonetheless. And Yoriko, the runner girl, was a nice person to have around, too, if only for her wing-girl helpfulness.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t much care for Eita, though, for I found him devoid of any interesting motifs. I wanted to like Hazuki more, but she didn\u2019t have the presence or the impact to get me fully on her side. Indeed, her slight aloofness made me sad to see.\\n\\n\r\nMost of my dislike, though, comes from Ena and her wedging herself into the situation. I know that that\u2019s her personality, and it\u2019s only fair that she has a shot at love like the rest of them. However, she got on my nerves more and more as the season progressed because she just wouldn\u2019t let up and pushed things in a semi-selfish manner.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, credit where credit is due on the show\u2019s part: The last episode had me antsy, agitated with how long it was prolonging its final reveals. It knew what it was doing, and it did it well, for I shouted at the screen at least once, pleading with the anime to \u201cget on with it already\u201d (or another such similar phrase). So, kudos to the show for having me invested in its proceedings.\\n\\n\r\nDoubly so for giving me the ending I was personally rooting for. I will say, though, that I would have preferred greater justification for the winner since their romantic relationship isn\u2019t the most electrifying. The idea is that their future together now will expand on their love for each other, but this story didn\u2019t heavily involve such a throughput, and we the audience will (presumably) not be getting to see it unfold anyway.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, as the title implies, a two-word phrase is sometimes the only retort required.\\n\\n\r\nJust Because! holds a lot of ambition and capitalizes on a few of its ideas. A realistic premise, strong artistry, and a meaningful thread for its characters battle against plot problems, sufferings in the musicality, and some missing excitement. But, if it were to earn a grade, it still passes.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, reveling in mundanity, this believable tale about a bunch of soon-to-be adults finds strength in its quiet setups but invites frustration with its romantic storybeats\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, an overcast mood, detailed establishing shots, a rough-yet-expressive style of movement, simple designs, and neat displaying for the texting achieve a big thumbs-up\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Eita, Mio, Haruto, and Hazuki enlist subtlety and embrace agency, and Ena juxtaposes them for added benefit\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Fine, a weak OP, a gently empowering ED, a subpar OST, and a set of passable VA performances leave the audio as a tossup\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, a likable, mature drama with half the cast lacking appeal\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "I've seen multiple Slice-of-lives and honestly, I can say this is the one, has hit closest to home for me. \r\nI got a feeling of selflessness throughout this whole anime, mainly from Izami and Morikawa and at points Ena. \r\nSo why my love for it? Because it does exactly what it entails, it's a romantic drama that I feel will be ripping my heart out at the very end of it. \r\nIt feels real, like this life they are describing is one I had previously experienced. It's that feeling right there that makes me fall in love with it. \r\nThis is something that I haveyet to feel from an anime. Your lie in April, Clannad, Angel Beats, were the saddest animes I have ever seen but I never felt it was true to real life. This is the first anime I have seen that has been able to do such.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem being, it is too ordinary, plot-wise; I'm willing to bet my guesses from episode one, which I won't be mentioning, will come true. \\n\\n\r\nAlong with the fact I HATE the way the author ships the characters. You have two completely selfless characters and you don\u2019t put them together? (Yes, Mio could be seen as selfless, but I found her jealousy to be too overwhelming. Her character feels dependent on Haruto, to where Izami is a supporting character to their hurdles in life.)\\n\\n\r\nIt's a romance story yet I personally feel that when it reaches its ends... a group of singles college students would be fitting than relationships. When every character is only looking out for those around them they miss what is right in front of them. I\u2019ll quote Ena \u201cYou\u2019re the type of person that doesn\u2019t turn down their friends\u2019 requests, aren\u2019t you?\u201d This is the flaw that makes the story feel real.\\n",

            "content": "I would like to begin this review with I\u2019ve seen a lot of high school romances. Good, bad, mediocre, generic, ugly, I\u2019ve seen it. This show, from its description, sets the groundwork for such an interesting premise that I couldn\u2019t help but gravitate towards it. Just Because follows 6 high school students. 5 of them are seniors nervous about their futures, and one of them is concerned with maintaining her \u201call I have\u201d photography club. \r\nThis anime markets itself to follow the lives of imminently graduating seniors going in different directions. Some are studying for college entrance exams, pursuing sports, and others are going straightto the work force. If this is what the anime would be about, which let me remind you is what it\u2019s advertised as, it would\u2019ve been interesting and relatable. Nonetheless, this engrossing premise serves as nothing short of a trivial side plot until the absolute last episode. Sure, the characters discuss their futures briefly throughout the anime, but it loses all merit when we\u2019re introduced to the characters. Let\u2019s discuss them. \\n\\n\r\nThere are 6 characters, but I\u2019ll only discuss 5 as one (Yoriko Inui) of their entire motivations, is given in a CLOSING SCENE. I would love to tell you the other characters are more interesting, but this is a review not a fable. The actual cast follows Komiya, Natsume, Izumi, Morikawa, and Souma. A love square is established between Komiya, Izumi, Natsume, and Souma until Souma decides he likes Morkiawa turning the square into a triangle. \\n\\n\r\nSouma and Izumi have a brotherlike relationship bound together playing baseball growing up. Komiya photographs Izumi pitching and falls in love with him seeking approval to submit the picture of him to keep her Photography club afloat. Natsume spends the ENTIRETY of the anime with bottled up emotions and studying for entrance exams. Izumi makes a strong case for being quite possibly the most uninteresting main characters in anime history. He\u2019s so dull and void of emotions that he\u2019d belong better in a Shonen or battle anime. I forgot that we had to separate Shonen and battle anime for some odd reason. I\u2019ll save the Shonen discussion for another piece.  \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll never understand why Atsusi Kobayashi, the director, found a character architype like Izumi appropriate. Morikawa is boring. Souma is the comedic relief and is one of the somewhat interesting characters in this story. Interesting characters can save a bad anime. If Kobayashi knew how to write decent characters, the bad animation, mediocre plot, and everything else, to a degree, could\u2019ve been forgiven. Unfortunately, these are the characters I\u2019ve persevered 12 episodes with. And preserver we did.\\n\\n\r\nKomiya and Souma are the only characters worth talking about so let\u2019s briefly discuss them. Komiya began the photography club because she doesn\u2019t have many friends and loves to take pictures. When Izumi questioned why the club was so important, she replied \u201cit\u2019s all I have.\u201d My dilemma with this is that her life was never developed more than I don\u2019t have friends. If I were to dig deep deeper and give this anime more credit than it deserved, I would say this character creation was meant to establish a theme of solitude and loneliness. However, if you\u2019ve seen the anime, which I don\u2019t recommend, you would understand that this is my imagination running wild in an attempt to verify my watching of this show. It would help if her home or personal life were developed. Instead, we\u2019re told to care about her for the sake of caring about her. None of her life warrants sympathy from the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nSouma is more one dimensional. He\u2019s not worried about work, school, or anything outside of his relationships with Izumi and Morikawa. He has feelings for Morikawa because she worked harder than anyone else playing the trumpet. Morikawa is another boring character who\u2019s more of a mother than the mothers in attendance. Here\u2019s the bottom line: because this show is littered with nontheistic characters, I had to root for these two because they had a MOTIVATION for their actions. Izumi and Natsume can\u2019t come admit emotions for each other, Morikawa is a mother to her siblings and a love interest, and Inui doesn\u2019t deserve to be mentioned. \\n\\n\r\nThe projected plot separates itself from other slice of life\u2019s. The standard of following high school drama is pretty streamlined in this anime\u2019s genre. Covering the anxiety and challenges of graduating high school students is something rarely covered in a landfill of slice of life anime. I was so excited reading this description it thrust itself to the front of my bottomless pit of anime I planned to watch. This show is a textbook example of wasted potential. Not wasted potential because the show had potential to be good, trust me it didn\u2019t have that; but wasted potential in the sense that the premise alone was interesting enough for me to watch immediately. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a mediocre melodrama, with boring characters, and below standard animation. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is by no means trash but let me propose a question. Would you recommend this show to a friend? No. A slice of life without an interesting premise is fine. A slice of life without relatable or developed characters would be a crime to recommend. \\n\\n\r\nReview Score: 4.5\\n",

Honestly this anime might be one of the most simple slice-of-life anime I've ever seen. It's very simplistic.\r\nThe characters are quite bland, specially the MC. But I feel that it adds to that \"slice-of-life\" aspect well, as most people in reallife aren't too overboard. Pretty good development.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art is easily the best thing about this anime. It's subtle, but really shows detail when need be.

There was like nothing special, like reused story, reused charakters. \r\nThere where also things that i liked: sometimes the anime looked really nice, sometimes was the atmosphere just perfekt. The problem is this sometimes, the mostof the time the animation and the looks overall where just mediocre.\r\nNow to the thins that i really disliked: The worst thing that noticed was that the 2 times when Morikawa played her trumper in front of Souma the was justa freezed frame for a couple of seconds, that felt really poor. \\n\r\nThe other thing is that the anime lackt musik or it was just that plain that i didnt even noticed. \\n\r\nNow to the real review: In the end the anime wasnt bad so i would not advise against watching it, just dont have any expectations. It is kind of nice for casual watching because you dont have to think yourself into it. So if youre boring or riding train or something than you can watch the anime. \\n\r\nIn the end your experience may vary and I think I was a bit harsh on it so... have fun (ps: sorry for my not so good english, Im not a native speaker and it was also my first review, so it may be not as helpful in the end lul )",

If you want some vibrant characters with some stereotypical archetypes followed by cheesy dialogue with poor animation and an ordinary soundtrack, then you should watch this. Why? Just because. \r\nAlso, I was quite disappointed with the ending. The show was on its way to being a decent 6/10, maybe a 7/10 if the ending was well executed but it, unfortunately, fell flat for me and left me feeling unsatisfied. Also, the animation is QUITE bad. The showhad trouble airing episodes on time and had to hire a few contractor animators for unknown reasons so the art seems rushed and poor. Doesn't detract TOO much from the general feel of the show but a lot of emotional scenes fell far too short of evoking any other emotion other than awkwardness from me because of how unattractive it looked.",

My biggest worry was if that was enough time to develop a realistic romantic relationship between some characters. For a few it did, for others it just seemed extremely rushed and force. Which is surprising because I felt like the forced relationship was between our two main characters.\r\nIn the end this was basically like any other 3 Female 2 Male romance show. The best girl finishes last.\r\nArt: Holy lord I had to give the Art a five, but that mainly came down to the animation as a whole. Thebackground images were very well done but my god the animation at points just took a nose dive.\\n\\n\r\nSound: A slightly above average BGM with an Average opening and ending. I found myself skipping both after the second or third episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I actually liked the characters a lot. One or two stood out to be fantastic characters, while the others were fairly enjoyable as well, with one character falling into my \"Hate\" list, but hey it makes for a good balance when it comes to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While I enjoyed this anime at points, there were some points where I could have just been without. Basically when watching this anime the enjoyment will come from which couple you support.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Nothing really stands out about this anime other then Komiya being one of the most awesome female characters of 2017. Yes of the entire freaking year. I would seriously recommend watching this anime for Komiya she makes this anime much better then it should be.",

            "content": "\"Well, just because.\"\r\n-Ena Komiya (Just Because!)\r\nAn intense quote, showing the tensions between characters, and how they have their own path discover but can easily get in the way of another\u2019s path. The \u201cjust because\u201d means that they are going to go down their own path, no matter what. This is what this anime all about, how characters go about with their lives, and creating and solving conflicts along the way. It is what makes this anime a relatable, enjoyable anime.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nJust Because! Presents the romance/slice of life genre well. It doesn\u2019t completely transform the genre, but rather has many good qualities of the genre inthe anime. It is a quiet and simple anime, but at the same time, it can grip onto your attention the same way a epic action film does. The anime explores the themes of self discovery and relationships, as well as love and rejection. The way slice of life genres way to build drama and conflict are tiny misunderstandings between characters, and this anime does that well. At times though, it may appears to be a little unrealistic(e.g. Eita\u2019s phone wallpaper). The anime in the beginning episodes make your \u201cships\u201d quite unpredictable on whether they are going to sail or sink, giving you the excitement in watching. The ending was a conclusive one as well, not leaving up anything to big to interpretation, or begging for another season. Overall, it is an very enjoyable anime to watch and it will make you end up rooting passionately for one relationship or another(#TeamKomiya).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art was alright. It may not be Gurren Lagann explosive animations, but it has that quiet and calm art style, which fits in the mood and environment in the anime. The art, although simple, still gets the information across to the audience. When the characters text to each other by their cell phones, those texts displayed on the screen for the audience to see(there is no way this show is not sponsored by LINE). This helps for the audience  to relate more to the characters and the story, as well as the struggles one faces through texting(Komiya\u2019s cat is literally evil). The way the art displays the facial structures structures realistic, nothing exaggerated. The art enhances the the storyline by creating a relatable behaviors and sets up the school life mood.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music in the anime was well done, with soft melodic notes of the piano during the times of poignant moments.  It is nothing special, but really puts the scenes in the mood. The voice acting is any typical voice acting you would expect it to be. The sound does not play a big role in the anime, it just adds those moments when something important is happening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThese characters stumble around in their own lives and with love triangles, and how they work to resolve them. They are very relatable characters, people who are still unsure of themselves and are discovering who they are as a person through relationships. They also do school related things, such as preparing for that entrance exam, texting with each other, and visiting the shrine for comfort. Most of the characters grow throughout the anime, as they begin to mature and realize what makes a good relationship, as well as dealing with rejection. The anime shows how characters respond to different events that happen, positively or negatively. There were clich\u00e9s such as the camera girl, but these clich\u00e9s did not really hurt the characters in any way. Overall, the character development was one of the strong points in this anime, and the characters created are very relatable.\\n\\n\r\nSymbols:\\n\r\nEven though this is not really an evaluation point, the symbols in this anime really bring out its flair and what makes it interesting. One big symbol was when Eita and Soma played one on one baseball whenever they needed confidence or support. These symbols enhances the storyline and characters a lot. It helps you think about how each of these characters are facing life at the moment, as well as in their future. Symbols are definitely one of the more important parts to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime really left me wanting more after every episode, to see what would happen to each relationship or how one character would react another. There were a lot of parts that \u201csunk my ships\u201d but then right after the episode, it made me reconsider my thoughts. As I mentioned above, symbols was a very big part of the anime for me. These symbols really put more meaning in to the anime, and connected the life in the show to the life we live in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.2/10\\n\r\nThis anime will definitely be worth your time watching. It really engages you into the character lives, really motivating you to keep on watching to see what happens next.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So here we have one of our latest additions to the romance category Just Because. The anime focus on the end of the final year of high school as the students apply for university's or Jobs and the last sure chance they have to express their feelings. We follow the lives of 5 main characters (3 female, 2 male) and the love triangles that form. It should be mentioned that this anime is more down to earth and realistic than many others of the same category and is serious.\r\nStory: 8\r\nHere we follow Izumi, Eita who has recently moved back to the city after moving awaydue to his fathers work 4 years ago. Upon arriving back he visits his new school where he is able to reconnect with 2 of his friends. The story sets the scene introducing these characters and their current situations such as those stressing to pass exams, those with recommendations and finally people who plan to more forward into a job. This give the show it's realistic factor as these are a lot of situation the watcher is able to relate to. With this in mind the anime then plays at the emotional factor introducing backgrounds of characters and how romance and situations effect them as the series moves forward the love triangle and unrequited love that follows is depicted and shows how it effects the decisions people make, their mental state in these stressful periods, what people are willing to do for their feelings and how they help one another out. Overall the story is very well orientated and keeps the watcher hooked! Yes you could marathon this! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well designed and suit their role in the story, each character had a suitable background explanation and a unique personality and a range of expressions to express themselves not only verbally but visually to. The characters aren't anything special however they are human like you or I, they have typical attitude, style, emotion and reactions that you see in reality, which is what gives us the realistic aspect.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good as expected when it's nearly 2018, however as this rating can only be done at this period it's best to compare it to other works of its generation. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well drawn and the visually the art work is high quality a lot of design was put into the characters enhancing small details that really completes a character looks, this fits the anime well and the category. Background work is mostly good there are time when I thought that it particularly standard out like eye candy in some scenes!  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nI don't have much to say here I feel the intro and outro of the anime are good in my personal opinion and work for it well! The quality of the sound is good and the voice actors fit the characters well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I enjoyed this anime i thought it was down to earth and defiantly worth a watch and if this is your cup of tea i'm sure you will get hooked on it in the first episode as it is quick to dive into romance and not like other anime where you have to wait till the last episode! The show also tends to follow the previous episode starting when it finished or based on the last episode so its not episodic and has a clean story line!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI hope you found this helpful and have a great time watching the anime as I did.\\n\\n\r\nHave a Happy New Year.",

            "content": "Hello there! As always, my review is quite short so if you hate reading long reviews with countless paragraphs and sentences, you're welcome!\r\nI love watching SoL anime and I was hyped for Just Because!. But the first episode was very bad, slow and boring. Still that shouldn't make you drop it, the anime becomes sadder as episodes go by.\r\nI started watching this anime, because the moment I'm writing this, I am in my senior year of high school (or 12th grade). I wanted to get the same feels a high school student experiences when taking an entrance exam and focusing on his/her studies.\r\nThere are severalscenes with studying/worrying about the future, but still this is mostly a romantic anime. The main problem is which of the girls will the MC choose and as you may know, this started a war in the fandom. (People were either #TeamKomiya or #TeamNatsumi)\\n\r\nStill, Komiya and Natsumi have both their flaws and disadvantages. \\n\r\nKomiya is a girl that loves taking pictures, but she often gets in trouble for taking pictures of strangers. She is outgoing, but also very nosy. As for Natsumi she likes studying, but she gets salty and jealous sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best scenes was when Puta (a cat) sent a message with its paw. I think everyone needs a cat like that to text their crush...\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 8/10, the animation is great, the Opening and Ending are so melancholic (I love them both), but the story is not that great. I expected something else besides romantic drama. Also, if a Dub comes out, watch that. The subtitles are pretty messed up. I am still thankful for the one that translated this anime, but they could have done a much better job, smh.\\n\r\nA much better version of this is called Tsuki ga Kirei, and I suggest you watch that first (if you haven't)",

            "content": "At first glance, this anime simply is just another typical romantic shows that you might have come across so many time, however , in this anime , there is a unique way to build up a not only romantic show but it also address some common problems that mostly students in the country has the same education system like Japan(i.e Asian countries) such as taking too much standards exam to pass into university, hardship during preparing for exams, wanting to go to the same college as your friends,... If youare studying in this kind of education, you will definitely find this anime related to your life to some extent and how touching some moments in this anime are as the story reveals the struggles that are somehow similar to your own. In the downside of the storyline, this anime is only targeting for a certain group of viewers.Thus,other people who study in a different kind of education wouldn't be able to experience the same feeling and connection while watching this anime. So this story might seem tedious and slow-paced for them. On the other hand, this anime is a sliced-of-life and romantic show, so there will be peaceful and serene moments that provide relieves and refreshment to your soul. However, the romance in this anime is ruined by its massive flaw which is the plot is so cliched and prevalent as all the material for the romance in this show has been used too much in other anime. Therefore, 7 is the highest score I can give for the story part.\\n\r\n               Regarding the art style of this anime, I would say it is not bad as the characters look appealing and their face expression is well-done. but it is not an outstanding art style compare to most anime. Despite this, the sound effect is utterly pleasant to hear, especially the ED. It sounds impeccable when you are in a sad mood, so I highly recommended you to look up for the ost and op&ed of this anime.\\n\r\n              For the characters review, I would say it is difficult to understand these characters if you dont have the same experience, so the characters somehow looks irrational and cheesy for people who come from another culture. But if you are in a similar situation, you will find a concrete connection between you and characters which makes them look more profound to you. Such as the decision the male protagonist make is related to the people around him. More over, the characterization of the supportive characters is decent, as their emotion or act is related to the protagonist decision and his personality. Since the characterization is fairly done in this anime, I would give a 7 for this aspect.\\n\r\n              Overall, there will be people find them related to this anime and people who find the anime boring because this show only target a certain group of people that I have addressed in the story review. However, if you are keen on slice-of-life and romance genre, you shouldn't miss out this anime as it will bring you a lot of drama and heartwarming moments which will enlighten your day. \\n",

            "content": "I have heard that this work was announced as an April Fool Joke, did they decided to proceed JUST BECAUSE?\r\nTerrible joke aside, \u201cJust Because\u201d made me write review because there are certain things it brings to the table worth discussing.\r\nAt its helm is the author of Sakurasou and Seishun Buta which have achieved raving reviews. Which is not to say there\u2019s much drama to be expected from this. On the contrary, the tone of the story is quite relaxing, considering this is somewhat of an ode to students and teenagers about to enter society. It is quite a hot pot: those who are already acceptedinto university, those who are still trying to get into one and those who are going to university at all. To be honest, I am quite disappointed in the story. I constantly asked myself \u201cwhat\u2019s the focus of the story?\u201d Before anyone even mention Slice of Life doesn\u2019t need a focus, every slice of life has a theme about friendship, companion ship, adolescence, stress, love etc\u2026 This show has all of it yet focus on none of them, quite bewildering. I\u2019m not saying I wasn\u2019t entertained by the dramatic romantic relationship but the series backdrop sort of divert away from that. I get that having a backdrop of students about to leave for the next step in life would impose an air of urgency: confess your love before it\u2019s too late! But instead of that, the series adopted a relaxing, calming air. Considering that the exams are 2 episodes, involving 2 characters. One of which has nothing at stake which kind of destroy the setting. Worse, some implication could be controversial even though the series denies it like: taking an important exam just to chase after your crush or conveniently getting jealous without making clear your feeling. The most serious problem is character growth. There was little sign of it. Characters experiment with love and that\u2019s it. Except for the one taking the exam that changed their choice by having a short conversation, nothing else memorable really happened. There\u2019s a lack of big moment in the story that truly dramatize the events. Everything was just so calm but not in a good way. Aria the animation is calming, this started out with a bunch of drama seeds, but things just seem to resolve itself by the middle. Because of that the last half felt like a marathon instead of being excited to see what happen next. Overall, the plot is almost nonchalant, nothing seems to matter and akin to a better written convenient plot that could have Shinkai drawn up, nicely transit into my next point.\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Mr Shinkai has a finger in the production but thankfully, he didn\u2019t. While the plot is almost at Shinkai level of convenience i.e. swapped choices but someone conveniently couldn\u2019t pass so they could reunite, the art is quite adept seeing as Pine Jam was only founded in 2015. The winter atmosphere drew heavy on the entire 12 episodes with really nice background, bright back drop, detail objects and sometime feels like a better Shinkai or KyoAni production. Which is to say that this has been a gigantic waste of budget. I would rather Shinkai taking up production instead. I understand the dark and grey tone because it is depicting winter, but this has not contributed to the plot at all. Shinkai always add in unnecessary details or segments to his overblown productions but I can appreciate that he\u2019s always trying to set up things in his own crazy way. The art is excessive while not being able to match up to the atmosphere of the plot. Here\u2019s something from Shinkai playbook: put in transport -> trains to create a scene association to daily life/movement/change/shifting situation/separation, sport is associate with competition/special event/effort/disappointment/youth/heat. The art seems to be a love letter to Kanagawa instead. The plot and the art production focus on different theme completely lost me in the middle of the series. Troubled production was noticeable as well with many strange morphing happening on characters. The show seems to be unable to use colour in a bold way, falling back to using grey tones and very uncharacteristic spectrums that brings nothing to attention. More troubling is while I\u2019m sure Kanagawa is beautiful, the art failed to impress with its iconic locations. I think it is important that the industry trying to imitate Mr Shinkai madness, remembers that we learn to love the location depicting in the story because we love the story. Haruhi, K-On, Durarara, Steins\u2019Gate etc.. all successfully captured the audience attention with its colourful cast and story before people start to take pictures of the location in the show. \\n\r\nThe other small things like music and sound is decent enough. While its piano BGM brings calmness, it is also very forgettable. Nothing to rave really. \\n\r\nI asked myself why did they make this show? Was it all worth it? Why did Hajime write a bunch of stories that amount to nothing? I\u2019m not sure did any of the characters really learn anything throughout the process. The art is great but why it is so great but in an average way. There\u2019s no focus in the scenery, completely greying out the pretty bits that somehow makes it unremarkable instead of striking. The amount of Shinkai in this show scares me. After Violet Evergarden baffling mediocrity, a similar but decent show like this lack so much soul. I reminiscence to the days animations have so much characters while is art is hilariously terrible. To be honest, I think the troubled production ruined Hajime plans for the show. If there had been even more struggle to figure their feelings out, more friction between the characters, more spirit shown by anyone other than the side chick of the MC, more thoughtful scenes to convey change in characters instead of the extremely disappointing haircut part, the show could have reached much higher height. For now, I doubt it will be remembered for long. I hope this original show won\u2019t be the nail in the coffin for original animated series. So many have fallen due to the industry expansion, demanding more quality, more episode, faster and cheaper. \\n\r\nThe important question is always: who is this show for? If you have plenty of time on your hand and would like to reminiscence about your exam period (you can see how the premise is quite flawed), this is a very calming show to get away from the everyday life rush. Other than that, I think this could be Pine Jam milestone project. The art team has shown promises and the general direction has been very positive. If Kobayashi is able to polish his direction, focus more the theme and manage his time table better, he could supersede Shinkai with hopefully more substance. \\n",

Unless you skipped high school or whatever.\r\nI was expecting alot of drama and romance but i didn't get it here, unlikeother heavy romance, drama animes i've watched that literally made a baby out of me (talk about a 32yr old Otaku man) but i guess it is soothing and heart warming to watch these kind of stuff. Made me a little soft, just a little. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation quality was GORGEOUS! Characters are kawaii (i was referring to the girls)! Plot was well put so it's kinda okay!

As the anime slowly progresses he tries to understand his feeling towards her AND towards Komiya (a new girl whom he did not know). I was ecstatic with this anime. After watching Tsuki I thought this is the romance I wanted. More mature BUT alas...\r\nOne thing thatthis anime failed (in my humble opinion) is that it made us hate Natsume - Natsume liked Souma who in turned love Morikawa. Izumi saw Natsume declare herself to Souma and being turned down. With the appearance of Izumi Natsume feelings towards him re-appear BUT she is totally underdeveloped - I mean she really do nothing throughout the show and still gets the boy whereas Komiya talks to Izumi, takes pictures of him, they went to see things alone, she declares to him, she makes him a yearbook and still Izumi turns her down. \\n\\n\r\nKomiya crying alone in the end was heartbreaking moment. I was on team Komiya because she was funny and she really loved Izumi going great lengths to demonstrate that; where Natsume did nothing at all - just moaning dragging her silly feet. Until the 11 episode I had great expectations and my rating was 9/10. But that finale was really disappointing to me. Throughout the last 6/7 episodes Izumi and Natsume both say they are going to confess right before going to university then when we know they both love one another they \"show\" us in anti-climatic line messages... BORING! It seems they try to copy Tsuki but failed miserable...\\n\\n\r\nOh well... This is Love is Like After the Rain. So far 9/10.. Don't disappoint me!!",

To those with a background in literary analysis, seeing these elements tastefully placed in an anime was satisfying. Ironically these symbols and themes felt like extra baggage that is irrelevant to conveying the story; this problem is most noticeable in the last episode when all manners of contrivance hinder the final key steps to the main romance's closure. This makes me questionthe anime as a whole,  and I feel that if I re-watched it that many of the scenes would indeed feel quite tedious. The plot could be compressed to less run time or fleshed out more in the time it was given, leading to an ending which feels very rushed--it happens as the credits roll which to me signals that it was an afterthought like the director saying you don't even really need an ending do you?\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are tepid, they have few friends outside of the love Pentagon (as another reviewer coined it), they do help move the plot along but they don't get any development so when they are given screen time you just want them to get away from the camera, and get back to the ACTUAL CAST. The characters don't get intimate with each other and they certainly don't get intimate with you, even the ones who are attracted to one another keep each other at a distance, it is irritating. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is good, save for Morikawa's trumpet playing, a thematic motif that I find rather boring. I suppose that the art isn't all that great when I compare it to my favorites from the 90's which look a lot more inspired and full of life (Evangelion). \\n\\n\r\nEven with its faults this anime deserves at least one watch, but don't bother with a re watch, as I don't think you will find anything new (unless you forgot the whole story in which case go ahead with that re-watch). It tickled my fancy at times,  and there is definitely the impression that it could have tickled my fancy more if the writers and director knew how to keep tickling it at every turn without sounding alarms for clear intervention on the part of the authors.",

            "content": "LA will say this time and again for romance anime like these.\r\n\"If your beta couple are more interesting or worth investing into than your main couple... then you have a problem\".\r\nOk, with that kind of a statement, LA will dive straight into what LA was ticked off by Just Because.\r\nJust Because starts with a rather lethargic start in looking and the future of 5 students of Eita Izumi, Ena Komiya, Hazuki Morikawa, Mio Natsume and Haruto Soma. However quite early on we already see some romantic threads being pulled, the most notable being Hazuki and Haruto's (the beta couple). The thing is after that themain three of Eita, Ena and Mio gets a love triangle ohhh goodie and things for LA at least get worse from there.\\n\\n\r\nOk, to get some things straight, Hazuki and Haruto has some trials and tribulations they face from Hazuki's own problems of taking care of her little brothers to Haruto trying to fit into Hazuki's life and Haruto's shyness getting in the way of things. The thing is for LA at least, though their trials and tribulations are trivial at best and are dealt with rather easily, LA saw their relationship as something of an adolescence romance taken in a mature way especially during their crossroads dilemma, its kinda why LA was rooting for them from the start. Seriously why couldn't Hazuki and Haruto be the main couple?. OK technically they gets as much spotlight as the main couple but in terms of focus, the love triangle of Mio, Eita and Ena by the halfway point GETS ALL THE FOCUS.\\n\\n\r\nSo what's LA problem with Mio, Eita and Ena's love triangle, well for one, it's a love triangle that sprung outta nowhere mainly Ena's interest in Eita for LA came outta nowhere, something like a muse for Ena towards Eita that maybe bloomed into a puppy love or something like that by with this love triangle, LA was ROOTING for Ena instead as she kinda took the limelight for a few episodes. Mio's problem was the entire \"work vs. romance\" debate and mainly her trying to get the college she wanted being one of her focal points for the entire anime and Eita helping her (and with Mio in return doing her typical tsundere (more on dere) scthick). The major problem for LA about this love triangle is the mere case of  if the love triangle resolving itself quickly so that we can actually see the MAIN ROMANCE blossom, instead what we get is of them leaving things off towards the ending and them \"maybe\" having a proper romance we will never get to see, that and again bringing up the out of nowhere romance of Ena and Eita taking precedent AS WELL AS HAVING MORE SCREENTIME is odd for a love triangle like this, almost like Just Because WANTS us to root for Eita and Ena instead of Eita and Mio. If anything it feels like emotional manipulation that Just Because even did this, that's what really annoyed LA about this love triangle.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, all 5 of the main cast are your typical archetypes, from Eita's pessimistic nature, Mio tsundereness, Hazuki's calming demenour,  Ena's genkiness and Haruto's strong yet playful nature is shown in full force. The supporting cast are easily forgettable for LA, merely being NOTHING but supporting to their respective ships. Other than that...there isn't much else character wise considering how romance and school life driven Just Because is.\\n\\n\r\nOk as much LA pretty much hounded Just Because for their main love triangle..LA has some...\"nice\" things to say. for one, Just Because brings us back to the melancholy of high school in both a positive and negative light, pretty much showing us how teenager act and with the added smartphone texting utterly changing how these romance and communications has changed high school...wait this sounds eerily like *cough* Tsuki ga Kirei *cough*. *ahem* From that, for such a lethargic romance anime, it's one you don't need to get fully invested in and with it's nature as it is, it's not full forced dramatic with characters bickering and having petty squabbles and what not, the drama is rather tame all things considered even with a main love triangle dominating the latter half of Just Because. Ohhh and as a final positive thing about Just Because would be Hazuki and Haruto's relationship was the MOST mature LA saw as an epilogue for them especially on how they handled the situation was praiseworthy enough.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Pine Jam, the character designs are diverse enough for LA to distinguish the majority of the cast (though with only 5 main cast members it wasn't that hard anyways). The backgrounds and the attention to detail was especially great, though LA thought Pine Jam had an odd fascination in the animation for making their hair detail as realistic in traditional animation as possible which caught LA's eye. Though for LA, it felt like the animation latter down the line especially with it's characters went from detailed to the background to janky facial expressions at times...but maybe that was just LA. Either way the animation was decent if a bit inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, LA felt at least the majority of the characters fit their character archetype and \"sounding like teenagers\". Karin Isobe as Mio as good, but for LA, LA preferred Yuna Yoshino as Hazuki as well as Lynn as Ena better. Aoi Ichikawa and Taishi Murata did pretty well as Eita and Haruto respectively with how pessimistic with a jerk with a heart of gold archetype and the best friend shy guy attitudes. Oddly enough the voice cast was pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nLA gets it, it's high school, teenagers are gonna make dumb mistakes in their life, be it romantic or otherwise and with how the uncertainty of the future will hold for us but as LA said on the above statement if the beta couple in your ROMANCE ANIME is more interesting or worth investing than the main couple, then we have a problem. \\n\\n\r\nAll LA wished for Just Because was for the main couple to have much tact and thought than the lesser screentime of the beta couple who just did great in terms of progression, the main love triangle just stalled and stalled until the end with the typical scthick we see in love triangles (with all the misunderstandings and out of nowhere love interests to boot)...see why LA prefers Hazuki and Haruto more?. But for the main love triangle it might as well have been...\\n\\n\r\nJust Because...\\n\\n",

This is where the drama starts. The story was kept realistic as possible.butit was kinda dull down the road.it definitely was some lively experience .\\n\\n\r\nThis is an original story which was done by pine jam.. had to say this was done pretty well by them even though the number of anime they did is quite less.\\n\\n\r\nThe sceneries were realistic. The character designs were good, despite male designs being ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nThe music composed was fantastic. Truly befitting to this story. \\n\r\nWatching episode made me want to watch the next one. There are few loop holes as to why this has occurred in the first half of the series but other than that it went smooth and I enjoyed the show for most part. Since the plot was good.\\n\\n\r\nThis had lot of potential but the ending turned out pretty bland..maybe could have done bit better on it so I had to give it an 8 instead of 9.\\n\\n\r\nI can say that  ' just because' anime is the kind of anime which one should watch with patience and calmness,only then one can like it. Otherwise keeping mood of a shonnen anime and watching this will make you think this show is boring.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The main characters are in their final year in high school & have to worry about their future afterwards. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!... There is a lot of drama due to a complicated love triangle in the anime. (To be honest... this is basically a soap opera).\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\nEITA: Came back after being away from his hometown for years. From there he decided to catch up with his old friends and continued where they have left off. Plus, he is monotoned, but is kind and honest.\r\nENA:Clearly passionate about photography (considering she is a photographer herself and is part of the photography club at high school).\\n\r\nHAZUKI: Plays a brass instrument & doesn't like being noticed\\n\r\nMIO: Former classmates of Eita & Haruto during middle school, but still has some unresolved feelings in the past.\\n\r\nHARUTO: Part of the baseball club & is Eita's best friend.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: It's definitely a very interesting anime to watch... but the love triangle involving the main characters is very messy & complex. It has gone to the point where keeping up with the love triangle has given me a headaches. It is interesting to see the main characters in their daily lives worrying about their futures after high school (some of us in reality can relate to them & their struggles). But that's where it becomes more interesting to see what will the main characters do next?",

But from the amount of episodes that have aired so far I have to say this is really good. Though the animation kinda fluctuates in appearance, it is barely noticeable. Also the community on Reddit for this series has to be one of the best I have seen in a while! (I'm TeamNatsume for those Komiya lovers X3) So overall the story is very interesting and gripping while the characters are very relatable.I pretty much recommend it, well mostly those who liked 'Tsuki ga Kirei' becauseboth shows have the same 'Feel' (Hah I made a pun from the animation studio)  , just different ages in characters. \\n\\n",

The lack of ecchiness or fanservice actually makes this a relaxing slice of life to watch. Some might say it is a slow pace anime but for someone that also watches Asian dramas the pacing is not that bad. \r\nOne element that I enjoy is how the MC doesn\u2019t necessary get all the attention during the first quarter of the show and they used it to their advantage; It really shows how the MC is just an average guy which for myself can certainly relate.There isn\u2019t any MC super plot system where girls just somehow get attracted to him. \\n\\n\r\nThe show excels at showing the innocent high school crush feeling. The uncertainty of feelings and also how feelings develop when they least expect it. We need to make choices in circumstances and situations that are given to us even though that might be the only chance that we get. The only thing I wish they had more was flashbacks on how the characters come to like their \u201cCounter Part\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is similar to Tsuki ga Kerei in that aspect but definitely lacks the toki doki or the feels but even then it still keeps the viewer watching the next episode.  This show is definitely worth watching if you are looking for an anime that is relaxing and also enjoyable to watch. I\u2019ve only finished up to episode 8 but depending on the ending this show might end up being something special.\\n\\n\r\nOne special thing to note is how this anime has an episode 6.5 where the VA\u2019s show you around city the anime was based on. Seeing the real life places of iconic moments during the anime is a sight to see.",

The opening was done by Nagi Yanagi(Ehem) and the ending was originally sang by Mio Natsume, Ena Komiya, and Hatsuki Morikawa which are the three main heroine of the Anime.\\n\r\nCharacter: The Character were charming on their own way and it will make you root for other love interests as well and as the story progress the character development was spot on as you will be able to clearly see the growth of each individuals.10./10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Like i said the story and the conclusion might be predictable but hey the executions of those scenes were really great to the point that you might think that the story was original which is really true. Anyway a perfect 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: Well its really a Masterpiece Anime (at least for me) so 10/10 and with that said go and give this Anime a shot if you like it then good for you and if you don't then go find another anime here at myanimelist :D",

            "content": "I've gotten quite tired of the typical romance anime. Most of them are rushed, incomplete and incomprehensible. The characters are often bland and the story usually plays out the same. Male character either meets female character for the first time or they're old childhood friends. Stupid things get thrown their way and prevent them from expressing their interest in each other. Usually the anime cuts the story short and we're left with no resolve, but every once in a while, we're lucky enough to see the romance come full circle.\r\nI was worried about Just Because! because it looked like more of the same, but Iwas pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't. It carefully navigates the complexity of love and succeeds in separating itself apart from the typical romance anime, which always seems to reduce love down to an over-simplistic form.\\n\\n\r\nJust Because! excels in revamping tired storylines and giving them the depth they deserve. The relationships that form in the series are carefully crafted and filled with tons of emotion and complexity. The emotional conflicts between the characters add a lot of depth to the story. I really enjoyed how the series approached romance in a mature way. It does tend to reveal budding love in the typical way, with lines like \"What is this feeling?\", but besides that, the series excels in playing the long game when it comes to love. Unlike most romance anime, this series does a great job of building relationships and love from the ground up, using the entire length of the series to reach a satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is quite great as well. It nails facial expressions, allowing the viewer to truly understand the emotions of the characters. Character designs are great, perhaps bordering on generic, but I think the designs do just enough to overcome that. Backgrounds are great and the colors are wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really sets this series apart is the character development. You get to witness meaningful growth in each character as they approach personal challenges and emerge triumphant. There's a level of maturity that each character gains throughout the series. It often comes in the form of disappointment, but as in life, those moments provide the greatest lessons.\\n\\n\r\nI'm really happy I gave this series a chance, because I think it's one of the best romance series from the last few years. Not quite Tsuki ga Kirei level, but a great series nonetheless. \\n\\n",

Then is this the show for you!\r\nOh man, this one is hard to write about and I can easily understand the low 7's score. However, I'm a sucker for anime featuring photography anything so maybe my disappointment was more severe than other's. Depending on the characters you like, you will love it or ... probably not hate it but be very annoyed by it. \r\nOn the one hand, this show literally inspired me to get serious about my future again and get moving on my various graduate university applications; it has that kind of somber feelto it. I also like how mopey it is. On the other hand the delayed gratification and constant miscommunication or stalled communication = plot gets REALLY old. \\n\\n\r\nNot only that but the authors really push for development in a few characters, while completely ignoring others, only to pull the rug out and force the ending they wanted. Its almost like they incorrectly predicted which way their writing would lean viewers and what they would think of the characters. The logical force of the show is broken several times and its just really off-putting. Like, if your having a deep conversation with someone that you've been anticipating for months only to have them kill it off with a completely unrelated and random set of dialogue with no resolution. In the end its hard to see any of the characters as charming or relatable since they all come across as narcissistic and self serving, save one. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't get the ending I wanted and a good many others didn't either. SORT OF SPOILERS - - - \\n\r\nIt makes the main characters look like terrible people and the warm, sparkling, fuzzy depiction of the ending left me completely empty - I really could care less about the 'two' by then. MORE SORT OF SPOILERS - - - - I mean does anyone actually like Mio/Natsume? She's awful, completely self absorbed, manipulative, troubles everyone by relentlessly procrastinating to give important information, she's just a brat! She the classic controlling and insecure character and I can't stand her, however, the author seems to really think she is actually charming and the character people will enjoy watching. Then they introduce a character that is leagues better than the entire anime can support and, well, if it wasn't for that character I wouldn't like it as much as I did or dislike it as much as I did. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end its a weird, slow ride that tries to mess with you and then delivers you the food you didn't order and expects a standing ovation.",

It had the right tinge of drama without being overly tragic, and the relationship building was pretty realistic for the mostpart. I'm not usually a fan of mundane stories, but this one was enchanting. \\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this if you want something to watch that's simple and enjoyable.

            "content": "Despite it's lackluster title, this show has some depth. And personal charm. That will keep you coming. \r\nStory: You have the summery to read on the story. TL;DR - It's about a boy who moved away from his home town in middle school, only to move back in his last semester of high-school. And as you would expect, seeing his friends, and crush again, after some much time. Is a sweet, and memorable moment. However, in the back of everyone's mind, in the approaching graduation. From there, the story takes on a traditional love triangle. There's nothing really unique about it. A girl who isfighting to keep her photography club alive, and the MC's childhood crush. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing about the story i personally didn't like. Was the fact that, there's really no closure. (*PLEASE NOTE, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE CONTAINS SPOILERS. SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH TO SKIP IT*) The show builds up to this climatic love confession. Only for it to fall flat. And shove everyone else's confessions above the MC's. Only to finally, give us - a tiny bit of closure. With a meh love confession in the final 10 seconds of the show. Aside from that, there's no kiss, no date, absolutely nothing beyond a lackluster love confession. Needless to say, i didn't care for the ending\\n\\n\r\nArt, Characters, and everything else: I'm going to condense the rest into a short paragraph. As none of these categories are particularly note worthy. The art is pretty standard of a newer show. Good uses of color to set the scene. The sound, again pretty standard. Although, it's a bit above the average. And it plays a role in the love of 2 secondary characters. The characters are great, except for the MC. Which is why i gave it a 7. MC has no characteristics. And barely speaks. I guess that's an attempt to make him \"mysterious.\" But it falls flat. And ultimately, i didn't connect with him as i should have. Overall, it's an incredible enjoyable show. About the final moments of a pair of friends high school lives. Which is something a lot of us can connect with. It's special enough to warrant a watch, and not be disappointing. Aside from the ending. In the end, it's a good show. And i feel confident, anyone watching it - will be hooked.",

            "content": "Looks like another seasonal anime for Fall 2017 and let's see what's it about...\r\nSlice of Life... Drama... Romance... not really a unique combination of genres.. but what makes Just Because! different from the others? Let us elaborate for a bit. \r\nThis anime might have an unusual plot unlike any other common school, slice of life titles of the same genres. However, the setting is typical and most likely, composed of common scenes. In the first few minutes of the episode, you might be wondering what's it all about and may even lead you to some assumptions of the plot. With the lack of original setting,the art however makes up for it and I can say that the scenes are well drawn and detailed. Despite the genres of romance and slice of life, the backgrounds are somewhat gloomy and not that beaming compared to other romance focused titles. The backgrounds show seriousness and melancholy which highlights that the drama feel is more focused on this series. Though Just Because! has the focus of drama, there are some comic reliefs in between sad scenes to ease the drama buildup through and through. The sound and background music is well matched for the scenes and music is one of the factors that makes this anime decent. The characters of the show aren't that uniquely drawn and the main character is not aimed to be a bishounen just like most romance anime. Plain looks and plain personality. Though he might sound like a rough character, his development though is what would make up for what he lacks. Realizing everything that I said, I know that there isn't anything special about this series. It's just like any other school romance that you have seen and you might drop it after the first episode. Surely I tell you that this is not a series that will hook you up right off the bat on the first moments. This is a progressive anime that takes patience for the viewer to see the brighter side of it. The plot, the tragedies and shenanigans, and dilemmas of usual romance can be seen here yes. But what if those events turned out on a different way? This series is not something that most people would enjoy because in my opinion, this is not something that you're supposed to enjoy. This is a series where you have to put feelings on it to put this show to good use. Your feelings will not be wasted because don't worry, everything will work out in the end. I recommend this to people who have time and patience to watch a new series. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. There isn't a single episode wherein the monorail doesn't show up even in a single glimpse of a scene. Why does it always have to be there? Maybe the monorail was the focus of this anime all along.. well.. that's just a theory anyways... An Anime Theory.... thanks for reading.",

            "content": "The fall season unexpectedly brought along some of the most popular anime of the year, namely Black Clover, Blend S, and Mahoutsukai no Yome. However, alongside them, was Pine Jam\u2019s newest release, Just Because!, a slice of life-school romance with some unique story telling traits that sets it apart from the rest. \r\nWhat makes Just Because! different from other anime in its category is its approach to the characters and conflicts. Its strong suit is not its romance but its realism, as each student faces their own conflicts such as university exams, job searching and the general uncertainties that come with growing up. Due thecharacters being primarily students, the plot is light-hearted. The relationships truly reflect the age of the characters as they are not unrealistically mature as the development of love interests and friendships mimic that of adolescents, carrying with them the attributes of awkwardness and confusion that is young love. The primary conflicts include Komiya\u2019s journey to win a photography award for the sake of her club, a love pentagon between the main cast, and the stress and pressure that comes from the students\u2019 entrance examinations. In just 12 episodes, the characters\u2019 development and growth is evident as by the end of the series, each character has matured and gained a clearer vision of their wants in life. However, since the plot is centered around every day high school life, it\u2019s not the most exciting anime to watch and certain viewers may find it boring. \\n\\n\r\nOne aspect Just Because! nails in comparison to the competition is it\u2019s consistent pacing. Most romance anime suffer from an extremely slow start and an incredibly rushed conclusion, thrusting viewers through the climax and toward the conclusion, which usually leaves unfilled gaps and plot holes in the story. Just Because!\u2019s relationship dynamics develop with the plot at a steady rate from beginning to end so that there never seems like a moment that is unimportant or elongated. The strong writing allows for good development of chemistry between characters without any unnecessary moments to fill for time. Unfortunately, it does follow the trend of having a predictable plot as certain conflicts are resolved in an easily anticipated manner. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is mediocre as the setting is appealing visually but not always very detailed. However, Pine Jam is a very new studio as Just Because! is only their third release and so the quality of their future releases can be expected to improve over time. The soundtrack is unexpectedly good, with strong opening and ending songs that accompany the anime well and a soundtrack that fans are sure to be anticipating the release of. The voice acting for each character fits, but is nothing spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nOn a final note, something to appreciate about Just Because! is its lack of fanservice. Unlike other romance anime, there are no panty shots, awkward groping or lewdness of any kind. Its romance is pure and light which could be a turn off to some but is refreshing considering the amounts of harem seen in recent fan favourites. In addition, the primary mode of communication between students is the use of the Japanese messaging app LINE, and the animation of its messages were a nice touch. Overall, Just Because! is a pleasant take at the classic coming of age story that highlights the experience of high school, adolescence and growing up, earning it a rating of seven out of ten.\\n",

The characters progression is nice, but sometimes makes you also confused. I loved the art it's one of my favourites and the snow/winter setting makes it all the more enjoyable. \r\nThis anime could be a solid 8/9 and maybe a 10 ifit really did make a surprise.\\n\r\nThe problem with this anime is that the ending was already sort of spoiled in the opening theme, don't get me wrong i loved the OP and the music, but it spoiled the ending. And once we got to see the ending, we got disappointed, not only did we already know who it's going to win, but it was so bland and like rushed at the last minute that it made us feel empty inside. Did i spend so much time waiting for each episode which were nice but the last one was a major flop. That's what i always hate, the ending, very few of them make you really satisfied sadly this one did not. At least give us a few seconds of them actually like holding hands in future how do we know they actually got together and not like ignore each other.\\n\\n\r\nOverall good anime with a bad ending, i can recommend the first 11 episodes but the last one better don't watch, haha.",

            "content": "At first, I wasn't really interested in Just Because when I read the synopsis. But, a friend of mine invited me to join him binge watching this series with him and I agreed. I have to say I didn't regret my decision back then.\r\nIn my opinion, Just Because is an anime which focuses solely on how relationships between people begins and grows. It shows us how we are who we are because of those around us. Overall, I would give this anime a 7/10.\r\nFor each aspect's score:\r\nStory [6/10] : For me, the story was quite well-written. It clearly depicts how a high school student livesboth in and out of school. Unfortunately, it lacks a certain depth to it. The setting and the plot of the story was quite generic with some interesting twists. But, those twists simply doesn't make up the lack of depth that I felt when watching the series from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nArt [5/10] : As for the art, I think a score of 5 is what it deserves. Throughout the series, I always felt a little bit awkward whenever the view changes to the close-up view of a character's face. The characters' facial expressions was a bit weird and wasn't animated properly in my opinion and ruins a scene's mood every once in a while.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8/10] : Overall, the quality of the sounds throughout the series was very good. Every character's speech was very clear and perfectly articulated. Not only that, the background musics throughout the series were nice to listen to and helps to set the mood for certain important events.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9/10] : As I said at the beginning of my review, this is precisely what Just Because focuses on and thus they really did a great job depicting and designing the characters. They were able to somehow make all those characters with different backgrounds and personalities to interact with each other in a natural manner and make it each other grow through those interactions. Not only that, each character was also very relatable because they all had their own problems, problems that are precisely what we faced during high school, the various choices that will most likely define our adult life significantly. The way the anime focuses on how each character faces each of their problems truly make me feel that they're high school students that truly exist somewhere out there facing their final year in high school.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [8/10] : For personal enjoyment, I give it an 8/10 because I really like animes which are centered around romance in high school. Whenever I watches those animes I felt like I was back in my high school years when I didn't have as much responsibility as I currently do, when I was happily laughing and playing everyday with my friends, friends that I rarely could meet with nowadays. And the time when I faced problems that truly made me who I am and where I am right now. I guess you could say that I truly enjoyed this because whenever I watch it, I felt like taking a trip down the memory lane to back when I was still a high school student.",

            "content": "Really just an exceptional romance drama.\r\nIt takes place at a time in people's lives that is so fleeting and scary that it is often taken for granted only to be looked back on with great fondness. This show sets such a lovely melancholic tone that somehow manages to become addictive. Perhaps because it reminds me of feelings I have long since forgotten and replaced with pleasant memories in their stead, thereby eclipsing them. I've never found myself craving a show and dreading watching it at the same time. Nonetheless, I craved the abuse that this show dished out to me. It was able to elicitsuch an interesting dichotomy  of emotions in me. I don't even know how it was possible. I always went into this series knowing that I was about to watch characters that I grew to love struggle and hurt, but I found myself lulled by the memorable comfortability of my senior year of High School and knowing the exact struggle of  expressing your romantic feelings. This series hits very close to home and does so with great care. This is a show I will probably think about for times to come. I will both regret the events and long for the experience once more.\\n\\n\r\nThis show struck a chord with me on a very personal level. I have no doubts that other people had the same experience I'm trying to articulate. However, I am not ignorant to the fact that this show is indeed a slow burn and will more than like lose your focus if you do not feel like you want to dive in to what it has to offer. If Slice of Life airing more on the side of drama isn't your cup of tea, then chances are \"Just Because!\" isn't really going to mean much to you. This is a very niche series that I think only a certain type of crowd will be drawn to. However, if you find yourself being able to invest your attention into this show, I think you will be surprised with the intricate and likable characters and the excellent payoff this show delivers.",

            "content": "This anime is highly recommended if you are: Transfer student (or considering), undergoing a relationship crisis (friend-zone/long-distance relationships), wanting to know more about the life of Japanese (academics + relationships), preference for one-one romance.\r\nCharacter + Story\r\nBeing a transfer-student to be, this anime was really relatable as it paints out the life of a transfer student through the main character,Eita Izumi.The portrayal of Eita as a transfer student is realistic as I felt that most transfer students tend to be less interactive and focused with the objective of school in mind, getting good grades to move on to the next phase of life,especially since mid-way transferstudents find it a little odd to start forming new personal relationships when they already went through such a phase in their previous school.\\n\\n\r\nHaving underwent numerous friend zones in the past, I find the anime interesting in it's relationship circles. It explores relationships that are genuine and earnest. You will realise that relationships aren't so clear-cut as it turns out to be, such as friend zones because of long-distance relationships and studies.The person I felt most relatable to was, Morikawa. Her reasons of not wanting to pursue the relationship further reminds me of myself a lot, just that I have no one chasing me. Showing your love to someone from a different place isn't always easy and most people,will rather choose to take the easy way out. I was touched by Haruto, as he demonstrated resilience and was willing to carry on, despite the circumstances the relationship was placed in. As for Natsume, I really can't emphasise the common friend zone I face in school, using academics as a barrier and because of that, missing out on opportunities for meaningful interactions.\\n\\n\r\nAh, this anime depicts the life of Japanese students, especially in the academics in high school. So far, I have not seen a slice-of-life anime that is equivalent to the way Just Because! illustrates the academic system in Japan's high school. In the high school, you have top students who have already received their university recommendations, average students who are considering of applying to university and the students who felt that they will rather work instead of pursue their studies prior to their high school. I felt that the anime has a realistic focus on the academic system of Japan and not lumping everyone into going to college straight after high school.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is spectacular and realistic. It is a good show for those that might be wondering how do Japanese high school students go about their lives and are into genuine romance. (no harem in this anime!)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Kimi no nawa is an outstanding romance movie but here we have Just Because!, something that doesn't haveall those fantasy or sci-fi themes and instead, it focuses on bringing out the realism of a few student's life.\\n\\n\r\nStory was rated 7 because I felt that the ending was underwhelming. It was the correct ending in my opinion but it wasn't ended properly.\\n\\n\r\nArt was rated 8 as I can see that the animators paid attention to shade the hairs and even more details to the backgrounds and still images. To top it off, trumpeters are in for a treat.\\n\\n\r\nSound is an 8 though I would have given it a 9 if the OP wasn't out of tune. The ED is my favourite this season and it's meaning fits well with the theme of the show with a hint of yearning in the lyrics. For the next and last part, Yes the trumpet part. I have no idea if it was intentional or the lack budget but the performance of the piece \"In Unison\" which is only found in the anime was like an amateur yet still beautiful which makes me believe that it was played In the show and not a person being recorded in the studio. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were a 9, the voice acting was great and so were their behaviours. They constantly showed how a person would behave realistically, their insecurities, their over consideration of many things, their rash full behaviours as teens. Each of the \\n\r\nmain characters also have deep meaning behind actions and insecurities, very much like real life and I assure you that there is definitely good waifu to look for in this show.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 enjoyment. My favourite ED this season, theres a few trumpet part although it's the same song over and over again. What more do I have to say??

            "content": "For an anime themed romance of youth, Just Because! started slowly but promisingly. As anime that focuses on the relationship between characters, the audience may find it a little difficult to recognize the main characters that appear in this episode, but the confusion is gradually helped by the connection between characters that slowly shown in this first episode. Tone colors used in Just Because! it does look very flat, but fits perfectly with Japan's dreary winter atmosphere with gray clouds everywhere.\r\nFor the audience who wants anime romance with Seishun Seasoning, Just Because! may be the right choice for you.\r\nI suspect viewers came to this animebecause of Tawawa and Sakurasou. Regardless of the size of the chests of characters who are big and uplifting, Just Because will be the romance of a high school adolescent that may end well, may end flat. As an original adaptation, the problem is not whether who will involve with whom, but how the process towards inventing (or ending just friends) will eventually be able to be enjoyed well by the audience.\\n\\n\r\nOne other interesting thing is the scenery part of this anime (which is also used as a promotional event for one of the leading camera brands in Japan) which is quite realistic for an anime television. Seen how the scenic background is depicted with the details in this series (including the Shonan Monorail hanging chariot depicted in this anime). For those hoping for a \"boing-boing\" atmosphere of Getsuyoubi no Tawawa, the anime is not as precocious as its predecessor, so let's watch with the upright hope that this series will promise a love story at a fun and exciting school.

            "content": "I'm not really sure what the fascination is with love polyhedrons and love chains - these small groups of platonic friends who are in a hopeless network of mostly-non-mutual attractions. You can see this in similar, recent series like A Lull in the Sea (Nagi no Asukara), Waiting in the Summer (Ano Natsu de Matteru), and Glasslip. Maybe it's just a simple way to pump some drama into an otherwise \"boring\" romantic storyline, or at least to give something better than the Will-They-Won't-They that two-character Romance stories tend to be.\r\nThe cast, arguably the most important part of any romance-centered story, is somewhat of a mixedbag. Of the five main characters, I could really only make the argument for two of them that they are complex and dynamic. Over half of the cast could have been demoted to supporting roles, and pretty much nothing would have been lost - and I, as an armchair storyteller, would also say you would've been left with a much more compelling story, albeit a very different one.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was pretty refreshing about Just Because was the prominence of its main theme - people going through the craziness of graduating from a Japanese high school. I get burned a lot by anime with an interesting premise that basically backseat that premise (A Lull in the Sea, Waiting in the Summer, and Glasslip all did this to me). To have the theme not only be present but also the primary driving force for the entire cast is, to me, a sign of good storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is not a sign of good storytelling is the frankly unbelievable volume of freak coincidences that move the story from one point to the next. While it's difficult to really call out a specific example, just go in with the knowledge that absolutely nothing that happens on screen is a secret to anyone in the cast - if they didn't just happen to be nearby when it goes down, they will accidentally and inevitably find out almost immediately all the same.\\n\\n\r\nI do want to give a shoutout to Komiya Ena, one of the main characters. She's probably my favorite character of 2017, and she came pretty close to saving and carrying the show all by herself. She has a very charming earnestness and aggressiveness that I don't see often in this medium.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, it's an alright romance story that uses a romantic pairing format I'm getting tired of, but is actually smartly using its theme to progress the events. The story is driven by crazy coincidences and the crushes are driven by trivial things that happened in middle school. If you liked Waiting in the Summer, you'll probably like this. If you liked A Lull in the Sea, you probably won't.",

The soundtrack is okay but there a not many songs at least the opening and the main emotional song fit very good into the story. The characters are something I really hated about the anime there were a single good and cool character in concept but the others been flat, stupid and so predictable. In the middle of the anime I\u2019ve got really some hope that the anime would get a finetwist but hell I was wrong and everything followed the same old path than before. In the end only one character I won\u2019t spoil made this anime a bit outstanding for me to not rate this anime with a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 6/10 A little bit over average animes.\\n\\n\r\nNow the question is which people I would recommend this anime?\\n\r\nWell I think it\u2019s easy:\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to all people who neither watched:\\n\\n\r\n- Nagi No Asukara\\n\r\n- Toradora\\n\r\n- Kokoro Connect\\n\\n\r\nAlso to all people who came here after watching this anime I recommend all those anime\u2019s on top to you because they are far more better than Just Because!",

            "content": "Well someone said to me that Fall anime season is gonna suck so I followed that but then Just Because! popped up on my radar and the cover art immediately made me interested. \r\nSo then I decided to give it a go. First 2 EPs already won me over due to the sound and art. I know that the animation quality suddenly dropped after two EPs but I kinda let it slide for now since that news article that featured the Pine Jam production team where the director is having problems in terms of making Just Because!. But then I realized that they're the sameguys who made Gamers! anime and I was like \"Dude. Two animes in a row?\" I get that making animes is their job but making another anime after a season?  That's where I immediately sympathized them and I'm fine with the sudden quality drop in animation.\\n\\n\r\nLooks like I went off the review now. Going back, Just Because! is another school romance anime by Pine Jam and I must say after watching Gamers!, this is a step up from the last anime they made. \\n\\n\r\nStoryline wise, it's about as simple as it can get. It's about 3 high school students who are almost graduating but then a transfer student arrives and this is where everything changes. Now I don't mind usual school romance stories and this is one of them. As for the pacing, as you expect from a school romance anime, it's slow but in Just Because's case, the slow pacing is alright.\\n\\n\r\nArt. Well as mentioned above the first 2 EPs were good in terms of the art quality but eventually EP3 arrived and that's where the art quality suddenly dropped but for me I really don't see much of a quality drop but it varies by person. \\n\\n\r\nSound. Good. Very good music. The songs used fits well to the Winter atmosphere of the anime. Can't say much from here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. Well I do admit that Eita Izumi reminds me a bit of Makoto Yuuki from Persona 3 in terms of his personality. But anyway the characters, they're alright and not one character made me hate him/her. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime overall. As a guy who keeps on looking for good romance anime (especially school romance), this one is good because it captures that feel where you're almost about to graduate and you need to make some moves quick especially when it comes to love confession with someone you liked over the years during your high school days. It actually made me remember my days as a high school student.\\n\\n\r\nOh and last thing: Pine Jam, please get yourself a well deserved rest. You seriously need it especially after doing two animes in a row. You deserve it.",

            "content": "Landonime Presents.. 2017 Anime of The Year: My Loving Take on Just Because!\r\nJust a heads up, this is going to be a very corny review. I'm just going to go in depth on my love for this show. Just Because! came into my life for the last 12-13 weeks and I couldn't thank Pine Jam enough for that. I eagerly waited every Thursday to catch the new episode. I'm a little sad that Just Because! is now behind me. I dream of the day where it gets a movie or maybe even a 2nd season. I'm sad to see it go. I lovedevery single second of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhen this show only had 2 episodes out, I had already placed it close to my favorites. I did a top 40 favorite anime of all time blog on AA and placed this series at number 37. Of course though now its much higher now that I have completed the show. I know it seems dumb to put it in your favorites when only 2 episodes had aired. Though that's the thing, Just Because! had a different aura around it, a different feeling. I had this vibe that it had the potential to be that next big anime. For me at least.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my 2017 anime of the year. No doubt in my mind. Ill look back at my time with this show fondly. Knowing that the fall 2017 anime season will have a place in my heart now. Ill miss Mio's stupid pouty faces. Ill miss Eita's cool and calm demeanor. Ill miss Komiya's dumb ass irritating everyone. Ill miss Haruto being best boy. Ill miss Morikawa being realistic and lovely. I just can't help but put this into my top 20 favorite anime now.\\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere in this show was so realistic. Capturing the feeling of adolescence, your teenage years, and graduating and moving on. These 5 characters truly felt like real people. Going though the reality of there high school days together coming to an end. I loved how the storyline involved Eita coming back right near the end of school. His relationship with Haruto reminded me of my relationship with some of my friends near graduating. When on screen they made me smile. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAlso the twist near the end where Eita failed and Mio got accepted to his school... Borderline genius writing right there. On episode 10 and 11 I was so scared that this wouldn't have a happy ending. Well with that said, I hope Morikawa and Haruto get together happily once she's settled in college. I wish all these characters the best. Also, wanting to thank them for the precious time I spent with them. I hope there will be another season. You can only dream I suppose. \\n\\n\r\n... I guess with all that said.. I can leave Just Because! behind me. I knew I would love it, and I did. 12 episodes of passion. Thank you Studio Pine Jam. Ill never forget my time with this anime.\\n",

No plot points are ever resolved. They introduce something and you think they're going somewhere with it but no. I feel like I'm watching the room. And after watching 12 episodes of them running away from each other and suffering from convenient issues that could've been resolved after 1 minute of texting we're treated to an epic finale. Nope just kidding. \r\nTheart for me sometimes really didn't work. Like sometimes I laughed which is weird because the art style is mainly good I don't know why it goes wrong sometimes. \\n\r\nThis could have been much better. And the ending is disappointing.",

Later on after being hooked, I became increasingly relaxed with the pace and atmosphere of the whole series: safe and sound, safe and sometimes thrilling, peaceful but often dramatic. The storyline however disappoints me quite a lot: the one who actually strove to the limit failed miserably, the one who had recognised her failure changed her direction, and then succeed without breaking a sweat. Even though I appreciate the harsh truth aspect of Just Because, which is not everything will be how it's supposed to be, I still feel somewhat dissatisfied at the ending ofthe movie. Overall, personally I think the strength of the story is not equivalent to how good the art and sound of the series is. What a pity!",

You know that Eita take either the left or the right road, so just be patient and see for yourself which one. Music is outstanding, entire show has this melodic atmosphere which is simply splendid. It is probably the best part of anime when you have those moments where images are still but music keeps on building.\r\nOverall, I believe whoever watches this will not leave with too manynegative comments.

            "content": "Just Because! is a twelve-episode story which could have been told in six episodes. \r\nThe main issue I have with the story is that you discover far too early what the conflict is about. The revelation is in actuality already made in epiosde one, but comes fare more clear in episode two. From that point onwards, the show drags on. The viewer can already see how the characters want to resolve their conflict, but they themselves seem to keep dragging it out. Between the conflict and its resolution there are barely any scenes of relevance. The core story is about the challenges of leaving highschool, going to college and stepping into the adult world and each character has their own way of dealing with it. As such, the main focus of the story is the struggles and development of the characters. Important to all of them is that they want to keep to their final-year-resolutions, but little attention is spent on achieving this. The characters tend to talk a lot about issues, without really knowing what the goal of their discussion is and when the plot demands that they finally take action, they do. This happens without the audience getting the impression that any of these characters have experienced a change.\\n\\n\r\nThis way of storytelling has made the animation department far too complacent. While the character design is somewhat unique, not giving you a copy-paste impression, everything else in the show is sub-par. The animators are good at creating non-moving, pretty images and every now and then there is a scene of a car driving by that feels somewhat convincing, but that's all there is. At times when characters are performing complicated actions the animators zoom in on their faces to avoid a lot of work. Worst of all is that most scenes barely have an interesting angle. The locations seem to be picked for variety's sake without trying to use clever angles, lighting etc. The images are simply there, because that is what is expected of a visual medium.\\n\\n\r\nThe least intersting part of the show was the soundtrack. There were a few melancholy, lackadaisical tunes, but nothing stuck. This type of execution as such didn't draw upon any emotion from me. When you heard the piano play it felt more like a que that you were supposed to interpret the scene in question in a certain way, but without relevant dialogue, a sustained storyline or creative animating techniques the scenes just felt lacking.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, although the show felt like a drag to get through at times, I could draw some enjoyment from watching it. The characters did have somewhat of an identity, although it was equated with the goal they wanted to reach. In fact, their goal seems to be their character and in every scene of dialogue the challenge associated with the character in question is brought up. Nevertheless, I wouldn't call these characters one-dimensional, but I wouldn't call them three-dimensional either. They were somewhat two-dimensional, but I deed feel the desire to see their personal arcs conclude. Overall, I rated the series with a 6.

            "content": "I picked up Just Because! after seeing the preview and what followed was a journey of mixed emotions. Did I like it? Not quite, but I didn't hate it too. I continued watching it because I didn't like to drop it, that's all.\r\nComing to the story, it's your generic school romance. There's a transfer student, there's the beautiful school council president, a nosy kouhai and some good friends. What unfolds is a story so expected that anyone could have predicted the outcome. Transfer student Eita loves the president Mio, and the other characters dangle around them. There's the red string of fate theme, which Idon't hate at all and the outcome? Let's just say the best girl wins.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fantastic, barring the last epsiode. The nature shots, character details and lighting, everything was excellent. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, no matter what others say, Just Because! OP and ED are my favorites this season. They are just calm and soothing, the kind of music I like the most.\\n\\n\r\nThe character is one department, where the anime stumbles. Eita is just a quite melancholic boy who doesn't show any sign of emotion. Mio is just eccentric, though she's the best girl. Komiya shows some emotion, but I still hate her for her nosy attitude and as for Morikawa, she's just a plain idiot. Sorry for the harsh words, but she's just so stupid that I felt like wanting to go and slap her if I could.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the conclusion. If I could watch the anime again by binging it, I could have raised my scores a bit, but for a seasonal where you have to wait for a week, Just Because! was horribly boring for the first two episodes. The first episode is so bad, that I wanted to drop it. Fortuntately, it starts to gain pace afterwards and does justice. The last episode was also horrible and the last scene? Oh my god, I wanted to kill the director. Destroying all that he built up with some cringy old plots and carefully executed misdirections.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, if you are a romance fag like me, go watch it and cheer for Mio and hate Komiya. If you have better things to do, or consider yourself an elitist, don't bother watching Just Because!\\n\\n\r\nI know this review is more of a rant, and less of a review, but sorry I couldn't help it. Fresh from watching the last epsiode I wrote this, and you'll probably understand once you watch it too.\\n",

            "content": "I really love the vibe it sends off. This realistic modern highschool-vibe. For young people (14-20) it really is relatable. The use of phone and media sharing apps like LINE, the constant stress of exams, the romance and constant preocupation over love. I really like romance animes and this is a well done one. Plus I really like the ambient. Looking forward to next episode.\r\nThe design and art of the anime are great, not extraordanary but there are well above the minimum required. The story is not so freaking amazing but that's what I like about it, it's a strory based on realism, wich doesnot involve super powers or overly sad character motivated to be stronger because of the death of one of it's close friends or anything like that. No, it's a story of highschool students, their feelings for one another and how they deal with it, them stressing over exams and having to study. How they deal with their parents and frienship. The main character is a bit cold but it's his shyness that's making him the way he is. I definitely recommend this anime to anyone that likes romantic ones. I give it a 9/10.",

            "content": "From the very first episode to the most current episode, it went from meh to jaw dropping. The characters are easy to like and none of them seem to be overbearing. The intro and ending are pretty good and the soundtrack that plays during the episodes are outstanding too. \r\nThe main characters and side characters don't seem that special but the development that happens between them are amazing. You just end up liking everyone and don't know who to root for. I can't stress enough about the integrity the more recent romance/drama/slice of life anime's are missing nowadays. This anime has it and they givesa solid punches in each category you would want in a romance anime. Not one character is heavily focused, which makes this anime really enjoyable because you get to see how they feel about certain things through the their eyes. One thing is the show isn't very vibrant like other romance anime's. It has a much more colder tone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is very enjoyable for a person like me that hunts for new romance anime's. If you enjoy series like Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru or White Album 2, and so forth. I would definitely give this anime a try until episode 4+ before putting it down. Although it has a slow start, it gradually ramps up and makes you want more!!",

The character designs are quite appealing for me, personally. \r\nI know the anime just started but from the few episode I have seen I can tell you know that this anime won't disappoint you.

Yes, this is platoonic triangle we have here, however Haruto has sight on another girl so the triangle is not working as thought at least that for now. Nevertheless despite the heavy focus onromace Just Because also presented the characters struggle for future in their final year and bit of sport and of course we not forget Komiya and her camera club which are the extra plot for this main story.\\n\r\nI have no comment for music as i am enjoyed the Opening and Ending song which led me to repeat that until i am bored.\\n\r\nThe Characters in Just Because is not so narrow minded on main characters, other supporting characters have their fair character which led lime to sight. Except Izumi all main characters have their own clique (Haruto with his boy gangs, Natsume with her gal gangs, Morikawa with Inu and Komiya with her camera club members aka her secret admirer) where them have interaction with their own clique.\\n\r\nInterestingly, Izumi the main character didn't have any interaction with most supporting characters except Inui so far as Izumi is transfer students so making sense there.\\n\r\nOver all Just Because is a mundane highschool life with usual teenager antic with more realistic view without any annoying generic trope, much similiar to Tsuki Ga Kirei....",

I was yelling at my computer screen come on are you fucking kidding me worst pacing ever. I still had hope I really did maybe the ending would be worth it NOPE the ending was shit it was not worth going though this whole anime and the art and sound were not really that good.. Overall Horrible anime dont even waste your time.",
