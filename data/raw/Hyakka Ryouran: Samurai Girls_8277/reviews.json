            "content": "Oh man.. It's another samurai harem. What's with Japanese people and turning historical figures into high school girls? Anyways, this anime series is based on a light novel series written by Akira Suzuki. Wait a minute. I know what are you wondering.. \"Hey isn't the main male lead name is Muneakira?\" Yes you're right. I mean if you're writing a story about a harem, wouldn't you want to be the center of it? And let's just add \"Mune\" to your name and nobody would even notice.\r\n(Yes, I know Mune can also mean breasts..)\r\nI really had high expectations with this one. No kidding. It's been along time since I've watch an anime about samurais. Unfortunately, as promising as this anime looks, here comes the hundreds of unnecessary fanservice and fillers to drown out the story. Oh sure, I'll like a few fillers now and then but they're rush the entire plot buildup right to the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nNow on the positive side, the reason why I sticked to this anime (No it's not because of the fanservice...) it's the astounding art this anime brings forward. It's a bit nostalgic as this reminds me of the game I used to play about a b*tch.. Umm I mean about a wolf (Ookami was it?) \\n\r\nAnyways, rarely I've seen an anime which uses the traditional ink style for all it's censorship and transition point however it gets annoying over time.\\n\r\nI have no complaints about the sound either.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here comes the characters. What? Only three girls in his harem?? Lame.. However, all three of them have some useful personalities to assist with their ever useless male harem lead. And Im suprised there's more tsunderes than Ive expected! As usual, as the story develops, each girl had their chance to express their feelings to Mr \"Breast\" Akira here. \\n\r\nOh boy, once again the male harem lead is there as a wallflower for every battle. Every battle when you think Muneakira is going to take charge and battle, prepare to get disappointed. Remember, this anime is aimed for people who loves fanservice so they wouldn't want to see a guy in the battle now would they? Hey, at least he isn't dense unlike some other male harem leads.\\n\r\nAnd what about the villains? Twisted as usual. Nothing new here. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I quite enjoyed this anime. That's because unlike others, I did not take the story seriously from the start after watching a few episodes of fillers. If you're looking for a nice samurai story with a decent plot then go look elsewhere. As entertaining as this may be, I wont be watching it again as this sort of anime is where you watch it once and you're already content. I mean, can you watch 12 whole episode about \"Love\", \"Honor\", and \"Bond\" all over again?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a good time killer if you have nothing better to do. Definitely a must watch anime for all you harem lovers. Just don't let the whole ideology of \"Love and Honor conquers all\" get stuck with you. Remember, an anime is an anime, and real life is just like an anime, without those big eyes.  \\n\\n\r\nHaremu Kingu,\\n\r\nSigning off..\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls isn't a series that I expected much from so I guess in a sense it exceeded my expectations.  It is not the best series out there and it's not for everyone either, but it can be a good time waster.\r\nThe series does have a plot but it only significantly advances in the final episodes.  So like many ecchi comedies out there, there is very little plot and when there is it's pretty weak. However not every series requires a strong plot to succeed, in fact there are many series out there that are successful with no plot.  Alla series really needs to do is satisfy it's viewers and I would say it satisfied me. There were a lot of attempts at comedy in this series, some worked and some didn't and there were some moments that were just hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was really stunning and beautiful. The style of art seems really unique and the detail is just amazing, even in the background.  The last couple of minutes of the final episode were full black in white which was visually pleasing to me too. The battle scenes are also well animated and looked nice too. I'm amazed at the amount of detail that were put into each one of them. Then there was the censoring. The ink dots that were used to censor inappropriate body parts could really get annoying especially when characters were moving around, since the dots would have to move with them.  But it really depends on the person, some may be bothered by it and some may not be.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department did an okay job.  The opening sounded great with an intense rock song to get you pumped up for action.  The voices seemed to fit each character's role. There's really nothing else to say about the sound.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the characters could have been done better. Although the protagonist, Muneakira, may be unique in some aspects (he's a samurai for crying out loud), he seems a bit generic. He's useless and usually doesn't have a clue what's going on, yet somehow almost every girl manages to fall for him. I still don't the sick magic that makes girls fall for useless protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nOur main heroine,Jubei, actually has two sides, her normal form and her bad-ass form.  She's usually only in her bad-ass form during battle, in this form she's really strong but also pretty smart as well. In her normal form she has a really innocent personality and refers to herself in third person to be cute.  I like how both personalities contrast from each other. \\n\\n\r\nOf course a harem would not complete without our 2 love rivals, Sen and Yukimura. They both seem bland. Yukimura is our short, flat chested character she is a bit tsundere but at least it's not overly done. Then we got Sen, at first I hated her because of her jealousy but by the end she was tolerable. Both of these characters aren't bad but they both really don't have the qualities that separate them from your typical harem characters.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have some side characters and they sometimes do add to the jokes in the series especially Kanetsugu but there's nothing really notable about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe series as a whole however is enjoyable. Although some of the jokes weren't well executed the others were hilarious. The story might have been lacking but I really can't complain about that since these types of series tend not to have plots. It's definitely a good time waster\\n\\n\r\nHyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls is far from being a masterpiece but it managed to pass the time. Although it's not for everyone, the series manages to entertain and at the end of the day that's all I really ask of an anime.",

            "content": "'Hyakka Ryouran SAMURAI GIRLS' is the 40th anniversary media-mix project by Hobby Japan, a plastic model / video game magazine publisher.\r\nThis series is an interesting watch because it's not only a \"media-mix\" as in franchise with products in multiple media platforms, it also feels like many popular anime series are mixed together. However, it represents everything that went wrong with today's anime industry.\r\nART:\r\nSeries like 'Gankutsuou', 'Mononoke', 'xxxHOLIC', 'Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei', and 'Yojouhan' have such distinctive and unconventional art style or character designs that you'll never forget once you've seen it. Sounds pretty cool, we should do it too! And there we have it, sumi-e (washpainting) style backgrounds, ink drops and brush strokes for censorship and scene transitions.\\n\r\nI have to admit that the style was unique, background is visually pleasing, and there were couple of breathtaking scenes. However, this art style was executed very poorly in many aspects. For one, the character designs were rather ordinary and they looked out of place in the picture even with the thick outlines as a buffer. The presence of modern day gadgets and use of CG made it seem awkward at times because it did not conform to the era or the style. The censoring technique was fine in still pictures, but it was unsightly and annoying when character is moving because the way ink dots follow and disappear screams of \"look at me! I'm different!\"\\n\r\nThe action is cool, and labeling of people and attack move's names were done rather well though.\\n\r\nThe animation in this series will certainly be remembered, but it simply did not work for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nYagyuu Juubee's voice is really cool when she's transformed into Master Samurai, but sounded way too cute/loli despite her appearance in normal form. Muneakira sounds too girly for the macho hero who's supposed to be all about samurai honor. Otherwise, the side characters' voices were done pretty well and sound like they should.\\n\r\nBGM was pretty generic. OP is a really good intense rock song, not only is it very catchy, it also had the Japanese flavor, and the vocal was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY/CHARACTER:\\n\r\nThe title \"Hyakka Ryouran\" has two meanings. The first, more literal meaning is \"Profusion of Flowers Blooming in Chaos\", as in girls (flowers) of various (profusion) backgrounds are unlocked (blooming) into master samurai and wreak havoc (chaos). The second meaning is \"Appearance of Abundant Talent in a Short Period\", which describes the resurgence of Master Samurai after a considerable draught in awakening. This series has a great naming sense in its own title, and also the names of signature moves for each character. For example in Sen's \"DenKouSekka\", a lightning attack which reads \"Lightning Fast\" in Japanese, \"Kou\" is deliberately written in wrong kanji that has same pronunciation that means \"Royalty\". D'Artagnan's ice attack that seals enemy movement \"Zettai Reido\" means \"Absolute Zero\", but written \"Absolute Slavery(Imprisonment)\".\\n\r\nA lot of moves have such creative names like that. However, the originality ends there.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is really, really bad. Sure, it's an alternate universe where the Shogunate rule survives, and there's zero Western influence in Japan, but then you have all the advanced technology (from the West) like air planes, cameras, and computers. It got so bad at one point that commando units holding guns were guarding ninjas and samurais. Talk about awkward.\\n\r\nThe premise is basically Evangelion ripoff, you have a chosen hero who unlocks the power of super-powerful beings to fight ones that want to end the world, and an organization trying to prevent that. The secretive organization functions through unethical practices (human experiments/sacrifices vs child labor), and yes, there was mass production of the super-beings to build up the force.\\n\\n\r\nThen all the characters were for manufactured harem. All the girl fighters except Sen have names of MALE historical figures or fictional characters of major literature with similar attributes. It's not even 'Sora no Otoshimono', and girls literally fall from the sky, and yes, one of the them is a cyborg. The initial villain is identical to Vegeta, he thinks he's above all others (emperors and kings), he does have a good purpose but uses any means to achieve his goals, he even wears a Power Level Scanner, and of course, he joins the hero and heroines in the end.\\n\r\nThere were many other similarities to DBZ, from \"Her power level is over half a million!\" to \"They are far beyond our capabilities, we can only watch\". The girls basically power up like Super-Sayan, and then a heroine even flies like one, before getting spirit bomb-like power recovery from allies. The whole action is like 'DBZ' meets 'Sengoku BASARA' with ridiculous power and constant yelling about love, honor, and justice. While this could've been quite funny if it was parody, there was nothing in this series to suggest that was the case.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there's these random fan-services with explosion ripping off girl's clothes, a girl wearing thongs all the time (historically some men did, but still...), dumb activation of power (kiss), and 'Sailor Moon' ripoff naked transformation.\\n\r\nCharacter behavior in general made no sense, and things happen just to advance the plot.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL\\n\r\nIt's nearly impossible to create a completely original story or characters in this day and age. For example, one of the villains in this series also had a magical eye like Alpha Stigma, a ripoff of Geass, which is a modified Sharingan, which is a souped up version of Hiei's evil eye, and then you can trace that all the way back to Medusa.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, good storywriting can camouflage similarities well enough that they won`t be easily noticeable and bother us. On the other hand, the mix of themes and reference in this show is blatant and shameless. They are so poorly executed that the apparent lack of originality is obvious to the viewer. And then you have excessive moe and ecchi fan service, failed art style innovation, and manufactured harem environment to distract us from the flaws in story and production. Like many similar harem anime today, 'Hyakka Ryouran' was a very poorly produced and forgettable series.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the story is shallow and clich\u00e9, but it does have a good pace and some of the tried and true formula do work, and the action scenes are exciting. The show is a true mix of previous anime and lacks originality, but it does offer quick entertainment.\\n",

            "content": "At this point of the story, it hasn\u2019t fully revealed itself to be important, because majority of my thoughts were being distracted by the beauty of the cel-shaded animation. However, there is more to the story than just action fan service scenes.\r\nWhether it\u2019s standing still or in movement, it\u2019s really a rich and attractive art design. The environments feel like a sharp watercolor painting, and the characters blend in with a darker, deeper color.\r\nHirakawa, Daisuke (School Days, Omamori Himari) and Kugimiya, Rie (Toradora!, Hayate the Combat Butler!) share the majority of airtime on the first episode. Both of these voice actors have had their shareof different roles, so expect nothing but a perfect performance from the both of them. The sound effects match the soundtracks used in intense, dramatic, mysterious scenes, and also match the amusing, make-fun-of-the-size-of-my-breast scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEach characters outfit/weapon shows a lot of creativity, detail, and personality. Although, not much characters were revealed my favorite characters so far are Yagyuu, Muneakira and Sanada Yukimura. Yagyuu feels mysterious, and Sanada is hyperactive-ish.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed my visit in the world of Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls and I can\u2019t wait to view more episodes when they air. The story is intriguing, the animation is colorful and smooth, the sound fits the atmosphere, and the characters are likable.",

Another harem series rated with mild nudity!\u201d --- Me\r\nI\u2019ve been a fan of harem series as long as I can remember. I don\u2019t know; maybe part of it was because it won\u2019t happen for me in real life. I know I\u2019m not the only one who projects themselves as the protagonist, and that\u2019s why, maybe, I don\u2019t watch shoujo series at all. Enough about me spouting nonsense. Let us proceed further into my review of Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls.\r\nStory: 7\r\nHyakka Ryouran\u2019s story isn\u2019t that great. But the setting will pique a bit of your interest. Why? It\u2019s because ofthe odd setting of the story. If you think that the story happened in the samurai era, which was in the past. You are wrong, mister.\\n\r\nThe story happens in the early 21st century, in an alternate reality where the Tokugawa Shogunate has remained in power.  21st century, meaning computers (in fact they\u2019re using Microsoft OS on their computers), airplanes, trains, etc. exist. So don\u2019t get confused. I like the fact of mixing modern and feudal-era in the story. The setting is unique in its own way.\\n\r\nAs for the story, a girl mysteriously appears in front of him descending from the sky and steals his first kiss. And voil\u00e0, he gained one of the girls he\u2019ll be adding into his arsenal of samurai babes! There\u2019s more to it than that of course. Buuuuuuuuuuut! You halfta\u2019 watch the series yourself to understand it more. Considering that Hyakka Ryouran has only 12 episodes, (second season not included) it is in fact very short. The story\u2019s really easy to grasp so you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\\n\r\nYou can say I\u2019m lazy for not telling you the plot. Half of its true, half of it is I just don\u2019t want to spoil you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nHyakka Ryouran\u2019s art is great. Or it\u2019s just a biased opinion of silly self. Either way, Hyakka Ryouran\u2019s art is very appealing to me. Everything that was drawn was surrounded by these heavily inked borders around them. And the fight scenes weren\u2019t half bad, too. In short, everything was bloody messed up with ink. But it comes with colours, too! Like black, purple, white. INK, INK, INK!!! Even sword slashes were inks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nConsidering Hyakka Ryouran\u2019s a harem series, we should have a lot of bishoujous surrounding our MC. Oh and yes, did they deliver. An air-head; a loli (who is voiced by Rie Kugimiya); and a jealous-type girl.  The supporting characters were decent, too. The lack of male characters in the story is quite disturbing. I\u2019ve only seen two guys in the story. Oh whelp, who cares about males. What am I even saying? This show\u2019s for guys anyway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know why, but the background songs in the fights scenes seem really familiar to me. For the OP theme and ED theme; I did like the ED theme which was done by Rie Kugimiya! The OP theme\u2019s made by Faylan. They also made songs for Seikon no Qwaser, which, incidentally, is like Hyakka Ryouran. Although it\u2019s a lot more mature than Hyakka Ryouran.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it? Of course, my inner male did. But my inner plot-centred-self isn\u2019t quite as happy as my inner male did. Why? It\u2019s the lack of legitimate plot. What I irked me the most was the progress of the story. The first few episodes were good, explaining some things how this and that happened. But continuing to the middle episodes it got boring. What I mean is, the plot of the story doesn\u2019t progress that much until the last few episodes. Nevertheless, the simple punches and sword swings that could tear the girls\u2019 clothes really made me happy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nHyakka Ryouran\u2019s far off from being called a masterpiece. It lacks a lot of essentials on how to be a great series. Looking at the fan service it provides, especially to adolescent boys, it\u2019ll be a decent show, or better, a great show (for them). Let\u2019s all face it, boobies and panties aren\u2019t enough to wow viewers these days, or even make them watch the series.\\n\r\nMy verdict: Hyakka Ryouran\u2019s a good watch, not a \u201cmust-watch\u201d series. But it\u2019ll definitely entertain you.\\n",

YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but anything else is not so good.\r\nwell first of all anime setting is in some alternative world where \"great japan\" is attacked by outside forces and \"great japan\" instead of using their millitary using \"master samurais\" who are a sexy females inpatsu. no theres no males. only females. and only in patsu. and those master samurais is somehow japans only hope to survive attacks or something. \\n\\n\r\nand so we see the first and most ridiculous scene where few bitches jumps to FUCKING SKY and cuts bomber jets with katanas... ok this is not just stupid and imposible but just... a cheap copy of Dragonball?? oh shit not another one...\\n\\n\r\nnow from the beggining theres no logic in this anime. not at all. not even a little bit of logic you will find here. and story is complete bullshit. a female fell from sky into protagonists arms and he kiss her and activate her superpower so she became a master samurai and we have transformation scene similar to those from sailor moon and here she is a legendary Jubei Yagyu who's power level is way beyond 9000. and so that bitch who fell from sky can transform into a master samurai if she is kissed but in regular life she is retarded stupid girl with big boobs and 3 year old brains just like that fucking Lucy/nyu from elfen lied. well she ofcourse not the only bitch, theres a whole harem that includes every type and every size from boobless loli to enormous boobled childhood friend. and yes they show boobs openly, no censoring. well if it would be hentai it would be so much better but we have what we have...\\n\\n\r\nso also the whole story is just pure nonsence. have no point. it would be as good without story at all. it actually is without any story at all... like just nothing, I repeat NOTHING that would make sense. just a boob/ass show that pretends to be about samurai honor.. somehow...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nso yeah samurais! yes theres also katanas and \"sword fights\" (if you can call that bullshit fights). yet these fights are so cheap and stupid that it just makes me angry... well dont expect ANYTHING similar to that Rurouni Kenshin historical japanese mood and sounds of coliding katanas in those (almost) well animated sword fights. nooooo here we have A FUCKING NUCLEAR EXPLOSION every time some bitch draws or swings her katana. like BOOOM and fight is over! yes fight is over. a nuclear explosion ends fight really fast. oh you might think that there's no survivors after nuclear explosion caused by katana.. somehow.. but nooooo the only damage that those massive nuclear explosions inflict to human beings is that it rips off their clothes. yes rips off clothes. so you can see a boobs. thats the damage you get after nuclear explosion somehow caused by katana..... \\n\r\nin short there's no sword fights at all. only those regular energy blasts, explosions and similar bullshit we seen so many times since DragonBall times (1989). and sailor moon type of transformations that you will see EVERY FUCKING TIME before \"fight\" starts. \\n\\n\r\nin short all this anime is offence to Japans culture and history as it uses historical names and pretends to be japan historicaly based or something...\\n\\n\\n\r\nand also we have that stylish green haired dickless pussy main protagonist Yagyu Muneakira. he's not just bad character... he's not really even a character. he have stylish katana and suposed to be a brave samurai ready to die for great japans sake yet soon he turns out to be \"general\" of several bitches who's the only one who can activate their \"hidden power\".. by kissing them.\\n\r\nand that all he do. in entire show his only job is to kiss his bitches and act like a complete fucktard. and most important - whining, crying, worrying and act like a fucking dickless pussy shit kirito bitch kasanova shit for fuck sake. seriously this is one of the most boring, stupid, stereotypical, useless and regular harem character I've ever seen. arguably worse than kirito kirigaya itself... guess how many times he fought in those 13 episodes?? how many??? huh? your guess?? NONE!! he never even fucking fought a single time in entire 13 episodes! he only hidding behind womans back like a fucking pussy!! whenever enemy comes he hides under the backs of his bitches! \"save me girls! I m in trouble\" .....is he even a man? isn't its a man who suposed to protect a woman? but yeah lets not forget this is alternative twisted world where womans protecting those weak mans who are all pussies like Muneakira. also millitary is made exclusively out of womans. yes all the soldiers in this world is females only and no man serve in millitary forces... mans here can only be \"generals\" (harem masters, kasanovas).... seriously...\\n\\n\\n\r\nthis should've been made as Hentai and that would be almost ok... almost..\\n\\n\\n\r\nbut now its a fucking disaster...\\n\\n\\n\r\n this is one of the shitiest anime I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\n2/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nwhy not 1/10? because some nice boobs out there.. yeah if you want to watch this nonsencial bullshit just for the sake of boobs go on!\\n\\n\\n\r\nalso theres a 2nd season for this shit called \"samurai bride\". didin't watch this one and not gonna watch it. not for me...\\n",

            "content": "Taking place in an alternate 21st century where the Tokugawa Shogunate still rules Great Japan, the generals of the country relied on Master Samurai's; very powerful women with special powers to fight their battles. As time passed, this breed of warrior has become more scarce. Muneakira Yagyu heads to the Buou Academy to meet with his long time friend Princess Sen, but he ends up in the middle of a battle taking place between students of the academy, and their rival Yukimara and her assistant who both represent Toyotomi. During the battle a girl falls from the sky claiming to be Jubei Yagyu before shepasses out after the fight. Who is this girl? And what was that display of power? These are only some questions leading to the coming events. -summary \\n\\n\r\nI really wish that I stuck with my gut and avoided this atrocious anime title like AIDS. I've just about had it with Sentai Filmworks and their ridiculous line of anime titles. At this point in time, I've completely seen four of their titles and every last one of them rank amongst the worst anime I have ever seen including Samurai Girls. Despite not getting into the trailer at all, I came into this completely from a level-headed perspective. I gave this anime the benefit of the doubt and it made me literally cringe during the entire duration. Samurai Girls is almost completely devoid of all imagination, and it heavily relies on those same tired old harem comedy clich\u00e9s. It features the same old mousy loser who's completely afraid of pussy, and is surrounded by a host of women for the flimsiest of reasons. The tired old love triangles, the girls who berate him for things that's not his fault, it just goes on and on. I am so sick and tired of this weak shit. \\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, and I'm not trying to come off offensive or like some type of elitist, but Samurai Girls is for that type of anime fan who either has no standards at all, or are completely new and really haven't experienced the absolute best titles the genre has to after. The only positives I can think of lies in the visuals and music score. The anime is indeed stylish with a heavy manga influence filled with dark lines, and very nice looking backgrounds that reminds me of Super Street Fighter IV. Visually, there's just nothing bad to look at here and the character designs are very sexy for the women. There's some great detail in the loads of fan service provided. In addition, black ink blotches frequently drop down to the screen, and later on in the series, they feature different colored blotches that really does look cool. The action scenes contain many flashes and light shows reminiscent of Bleach and Dragonball Z. The BGM which is provided by Tatsuya Katou complements the anime well, when working for the action and comedy. Unfortunately, although these things stand out, they really didn't make getting through this anime any easier. \\n\\n\r\nSamurai Girls was a chore for me. The visuals tend to overshadow the characters, plot, action, and story, because none of those things are anything special. The plot spins its wheels very early with little to no progression at all. The characters soon learn that the female samurai's can be transformed into Master Samurai's by kissing Muneakira, this pits at least three of them in this unoriginal, by the numbers love triangle that grows boring and annoying very quick with lots of bickering. To add to the lack of originality and completely insipid, the main character Jubei goes through a Lucy/Nyu-esque of Elfen Lied fame transformation, from powerful samurai warrior to an infantile retard that is nowhere near as annoying as Nyu, but is annoying as hell in her own right. None of the characters were the least bit interesting to me. If it wasn't for the fact that they were named after real samurai's of the Sengoku and Edo periods, I would have never even known their names. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime features one comic relief after the other, and even though I chuckled here and there to the characters antics. I felt the writers were trying way too hard to be funny, and more than half of the time the jokes were completely flat. They get even worse due to the constant rehashing. Later on around the ninth episode, something of a plot develops when the heroes learn they will have to face a demonic threat that could wipe them all out. Unfortunately, it's too badly paced and thanks to all of the filler before it everything feels too tacked on and very rushed. The action, which should be a stand out, is made up of flashes of action and falling bodies, with way too many high energy attacks. The writers cut way too many corners as there aren't any choreographed sword on sword exchanges, which is completely ridiculous for a show with a samurai setting. \\n\\n\r\nThere's no doubt that I personally believe I sat through a certified shitcapade, but what keeps these DVD's from being certified coasters, is that the anime never attempts to take itself too seriously. There are no tonal shifts, it's a straight forward light hearted ride meant to be fun; but the problem is that it doesn't accomplish any of its goals in the areas it set out to excel in as far as I'm concerned. This anime is an ant amongst giants when compared to series close to its type such as Excel Saga and Slayers. \\n\\n\r\nSamurai Girls is a very poor excuse of a samurai/harem show. The only area it really stands out in is the prodution values; character designs, flashy action moments, fan service, music score, and for me, this just isn't enough. I hated the characters, their played out interactions, non choreographed action scenes, that troll final episode. It was just a bad experience for me. I only recommend this to the very easy to please. If you enjoyed Needless and High School of the Dead, then you'll love this. \\n\\n\r\nHighs: Production values\\n\\n\\n\r\nLows: Plot, characters, comedy, etc.\\n",

            "content": "If there's one thing 2010 isn't short of, it would have to be the abundance of ecchi anime that's aired this year. From titles like Kiss x Sis, High School of the Dead, and even Seikon no Qwaser, it makes one think that Japan has had a rise in lonely boys who are buying into this stuff like ice to Eskimos.\r\nHyakka Ry\u014dran: Samurai Girls is no different in that all it really is, is a show about samurai with breasts set in neo-Japan. Die-hard fans of historical anime/literature may feel insulted to this as famous names like Sanada Yukimura, Yagy\u016b J\u016bbei and even Senhim\u00e9 aremade to cast as mo\u00e9 characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nRy\u014dran takes place in an alternate world where the samurai co-exist with modern technology. How Akira Suzuki(author of the light novels) came up with the idea is beyond me but its definitely not unheard of if your a fan of Gintama. In this reality, master samurai are like guardian deities who serve their shogun as well as protect the populace with their godly powers that differentiate them from your average samurai. \\n\\n\r\nSound good so far? I thought so too until I realized this series was more a rom-com harem then an action anime.  Don't get me wrong, there definitely is action in the series but there just wasn't enough to outweigh the lame overdone comedy. For those who have seen the series Sekirei may see some similarities(like the norito kiss) in this anime, and will probably get the same disappointment in regards to Ry\u014dran's plotline.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nIf there's one thing Ry\u014dran will be remembered by(if it ever gets remember by next season), is its art and animation. From background to character design, everything is presented in a unique fashion that is different from your typical 2D or CG anime. Of course that doesn't mean that characters are drawn in a weird way as first and foremost, this is an ecchi anime that has samurai girls showing off their assets. One thing I have to commend the director with is the method to which they use to censor the ladies naughty bits. Instead of using the traditional white light or white fog, we are shown ink blotches which coincide with the series artwork.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst I wouldn't say animation is first class for Ry\u014dran, I'd definitely rate it higher then other battle anime that's come out recently(like Nurarihyon no Mago)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nAnother component I guess I enjoyed for this series would have to be its sound. With J-rock band Faylan performing the OP \"Last Vision For Last\", your easily swayed into thinking this series is well worth watching as it pulls you in with the beat like any good shon\u00e9n anime should. The ED \"Koi ni Sesse Tooryanse\" performed by the leading ladies of the series is not bad either(nor is it any good) and the BGM is nicely set in place giving you the right ambiance and pacing.\\n\\n\r\nI really have no complaints with the voice cast, asides from that anyone who has seen School Days may be clearly reminded that the main lead for this series is Makoto. Thought I'd throw it out there  :D\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\r\nThis is where the series fails. The characters of Ry\u014dran are shallow and there is not one character in the anime that I could say is solid. We are reminded time and time again through each character, that this really is a two-bit harem. The main lead at first showed some promise but quickly fell into the endless spiral of uninspiring harem males and the supporting ladies are a joke. If someone was to ask me if I've seen Ry\u014dran, my first reply would be \"Oh, that boobies show?\" because that's all the women of Ry\u014dran is all about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nWatching Ry\u014dran is like riding a bicycle through a mountainous valley. There are so many ups and downs to the series that its not worth counting. As long as your not looking for a deeper meaning to what this show portrays, then its all downhill in regards to enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5\\n\r\nHyakka Ry\u014dran: Samurai Girls is first and foremost an ecchi anime. If that's what your looking for, then this series should definitely please. Yes it has action and a bit of story, but I wouldn't call it its selling point and is more a bonus.",

            "content": "You know, once in a while you'll find yourself watching an episode of an anime thinking, why am I watching this? But for Hyakka Ryouran, you'll be thinking, why have I not heard of this earlier?! (unless this was in one of your first 10 anime, ignore that whole paragraph.)\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nA martial arts anime with harem, romance, comedy and school. Except, the genre that was least shown was of course, the school genre. Probably just to make everything look more interesting. This type of story isn't for your light hearted, slice of life type anime fan, because there's also mild violence. The romance genre canbe really sweet sometimes, as each character builds a bond with Muneakira Yagyuu. The story keeps you on your toes, but sometimes gets off track, which may be really boring. Other than that, the story is solid and doesn't drag too much. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhy a high rating, you ask? The art is very unique, having very dark and thick outlines on each character, not to mention the smooth animation. The theme of the anime is set on the Tokugawa era, so not a lot of vibrant colors and more of a dark, ancient style of art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for each scene is mostly Japanese-themed, sticking to the roots of the anime. The OP goes nicely with the anime, fitting the action+romance. The ED is all about love, so I guess that fits the romance genre.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEach character stayed with their role, Muneakira being the protagonist and of course, all protagonists are heroes. The only thing I hate about him is the voice actor, he sounds like he's still in his teens, because of how his voice can crack very often. Not very fitting for a strong, kind character.\\n\\n\r\nThe 3 girls that are mostly around Muneakira:\\n\\n\r\nYagyuu Jubei, having the cutest sounding VA in the anime, Yuuki Aoi. She's a very cheerful, kind and friendly character but she's a klutz. Her 'alter-ego' is similar to Akashiya Moka, from Rosario to Vampire. She is the complete opposite when she is in her 'alter-ego'.\\n\\n\r\nSanada Yukimura, having the voice actress of the 'Queen of Tsundere', Kugimiya Rie. Tsundere, flat chested, but a genius too.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, Sen Tokugawa, the childhood friend of Muneakira. A strong, smart, and the type of female character who would misunderstand any perverted situation. She is also the student council president.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this season because of the story PANTYSHOTS, the smooth animation TITS, the characters themselves BOOBS- oh forget it, this anime has a lot of Ecchi. Pantyshots every minute, ink-censored nipples, but that enough won't get you from the story. Would I re-watch it? Maybe.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime that is similar to:\\n\r\nRosario to Vampire\\n\r\nHighschool DxD\\n\r\nand more harem+action anime, then look no further, this anime is just for you.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ahh, the classic ecchi action show. I am not a fan of the genre in general, but the first episode seemed like it could turn out well. It also seemed like it had a plot. The art also seemed rather unique in its genre of bright and happy. Yes, it was all what it seemed.\r\nExpectation: 6\r\nEpisode scores:-,-,-,-, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 6, 6, 6\r\nActual: 4 Bad\r\nYet the plot is quickly put aside for the last episodes, nothing unusual, as the harem tries to become master samurai. Now what can be wrong with that? Well, i don't mind the cliche random guy getting all thechicks, and the fact that at first they are essentially just trying to use him as a stepping stool. Yet, while there is some actually relationships that seem to do well, any interaction is transformed into interaction between a master and his samurai. Well at least for the dense lead anyways. Even the kisses are lame, and insignificant because of the same property.\\n\\n\r\nWith Samurai you would expect some good battles. Yet, we are bombarded with poor fight after poor fight. Either it is a master samurai beating the crap out of somebody defenseless or them pulling off their 'named move' once or twice inbetween talking. The only exceptional scene is the climax, but they sacrifice any logic for the  pretty effects.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a lot more comedy that i enjoyed which was unexpected. It might of been one of the few redeeming qualities of this show, but even then they are not that good. i might of just felt like enjoying slapstick humor for some reason when i was watching this.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not very deep. The harem consists of tsunderes with a side dish of servants and energetic idiots that fell of of the sky. Their characters are not really anything special, nor do they have at least one oddity about them. At least i was a Rie fan so i was able to appreciate something about at least one character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, not that much different from any other ecchi show. The plot is pretty lame, and the comedy is not up to par with a lot of better actual 'ecchi comedies' out there. I would call this average for this genre, but the standard is set pretty low as far as i am concerned as of late.",

The art is good enough that I sometimes get distracted and end up missing the dialogue.  The cel-shading may offend some, but I've never had an issue with this style of animation.  \r\nAs far as being categorized as ecchi...I'd consider this to be very mild.  While there are the usual scantily clad (or no clothes at all) scenes and plenty of fanservice, none of them are directly explicit(at least so far.)  This anime does not use theexcessively over-distorted proportions common to other series (like Godannar or Koihime Mus\u014d)  \\n\\n\r\nThere is apparently a great deal of back story as several conflicts and a touch of intrigue was revealed during the first episode.   \\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences are only fair which I found surprising considering the high quality of the artwork.  There has not been much combat to rate this show with but some low-quality (shadows, off-screen sequences) tricks were used to avoid drawing them outright.  \\n\\n\r\nStill I'm looking forward to seeing more of this series and seeing how the plot unfolds.",

This is one of the most unique and well done art styles I have seen in an anime in a long time. The heavy lines, softness of the colors, detail, all combines to make it very nice to watch.\r\nGranted, there is a lot of fan service. And I agree with others assessment, the ink blots used to cover naughty bits was annoying, especially in combat. However, getting the blu-ray version obviously fixed this problem.\r\nI don't havea problem with naughty bits, in fact it is a plus for me. (I am a guy duh) But I don't like that it will take away from some of the demographic because of that. With such great art, action and story, I know there are people that will miss out because of it.",

            "content": "I figured for my first speed review I'd try to do my best not to completely berate an anime or worship it as a deity (Edit: I failed). What better to do it on than Hyakka Ryouran?\r\nPossibly the worst anime I've ever watched. However, it DID manage to get on my watched(completed) list, instead of the pile of crap I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole, the (dropped) list. Which makes me ponder how I ever finished it.\r\nI can't really be unbiased, because I honestly hate almost every single aspect of this show. The story is border line retarded, there is little character development,and none of the characters are all that likable. (save maybe the sadistic side of Yagyu Jubei, but then again, I seem have an affinity for crazy psycho bitches) \\n\\n\r\nThe main character was as interesting as a pile of dog crap, and that's as far as I'll go into. None of the girls had any depth. The main heroine (the mya~ side of Yagyu Jubei) had the personality and intelligence of a 5 month old kitten. Don't get me wrong, I quite like kittens, I just wouldn't want one for a girlfriend nor a main heroine. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my biggest gripes with this show is, the main villain general guy... douchefag. This is one of the most hated characters on my hated characters list. \\n\r\n   One of the biggest pet peeves I have, are guys who treat girls like shit, and guys that wear dicks on their heads. This guy is both.\\n\\n\r\n Often times villains fall into four categories. Ones which you can hate with all your heart, ones you can fear and admire, ones you can connect with, and the random bunches of monsters demons and angels that want humans dead. The only downfall with the first type of villian, is for some reason, more than 50% the time, they get forgiven, have a change of heart and do a 180.\\n\r\n  Bullshit! These villains spend the majority of the anime fueling my hate, keeping me watching and hoping for the satisfying moment when they get their heads torn off and necks shatted down \u00e0 la Duke Nukem style. But no, they often give some bullshit reason for why they did what they did, in hopes of having the viewer connect with them. \\n\r\n  Too late!! I already hate them with all my heart. They doesn't deserve retribution, they just needs to dieee.\\n\\n\r\n  But on to why I started the show. The animation is.. amazing. It is one of the best animation styles I have ever seen. The whole entire feel of the anime is like a 1950's samurai movie. The ink tones, outlines, and colors are beautiful. Random ink splotches filled the screen at times, making the anime feel like a beautiful work of calligraphy. Even the censors are brilliantly done (via conveniently placed inkblots). Which makes it such a shame, that the story and characters are so god damn awful.\\n\\n\r\nThis well done animation (and the hopes of seeing the main villain murdered brutally at the end) is the ONLY thing that kept me watching. With knowing that *SPOILER*, that asshole doesn't die in a complete satisfying bloody mess, nor the main character, nor any of the other retarded characters in this show. It's really hard to recommend this. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to see mindless action and fan-service go for it. You might actually get enjoy the wonderful animation, that is if you don't blow your brains out halfway through due to the complete retardedness of all the characters.\\n\\n\r\n(Alright I confess. As my first review, it was a little rushed. It's prolly been more than 3 years since I've watched it. During which I was half dazed, in awe of the animation, and half trying to blow my brains out from the god awful storyline/characters. So it's not as in depth, well put, and unbiased as I wanted. Having said that, I still hope you enjoyed reading review this as much as I did writing it.)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "At this stage of my review, that is to say, the very beginning, i feel obligated to let you know that this review will not end positively. It's a warning you perhaps do not wish or care to hear but one i must inform you thusly. There will be positive comments throughout but they will all fall eventually into a melancholic tone to highlight certain disappointments.\r\nThis show can be summarised in the following sentence; that is to say if i do not go off on a random tangent instead, big breasted female samurai fight against villains. That is, there are only two villains of theshow but one of them isn't really that bad. He's just extreme. There are also only two males who actually do something. I believe there to be a third but he would hardly count and you do hear about other males but they are never seen. Expect a lot of harem clich\u00e9s to slither their way in and out of the plot. I say out but to be fair they never leave. They stick around to the end. I will not claim Hyakka to be great and groundbreaking for its genre or claim it to be so terrible it's an insult.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting for this show is a hard one to grasp. At first you start thinking perhaps it is set in the edo period or a period similar but then a character whips out a computer from nowhere. Unless the writer of this show knows something the rest of the world doesn't. I don't think they had computers that far back, at the very least, we do know it is set in Japan and that it is set among very traditional Japanese people; Dojo's, Kimono's, those sliding doors. Not really surprising. It would be weird having a samurai show in modern day Tokyo or something. It's one of the shows facets that help it differ from the likes of Sekirei and Ikkitousen.\\n\\n\r\nEach character from this show i found out (help from wikipedia was much appreciated) shares their name with famous Japanese icons from the past albeit gender flipped and huge personality changes. I mean ALL of the characters do, not just a couple or a few. There are two who do not however rendering my previous inflection on 'all' moot. Muneakira is our harem protagonist and to be fair to him he is a lot better at it than most HPs but he isn't that great. He actually does very little but what he did do was pretty bad ass. Yukimura is a small flat chested girl and is basically the 'smart' one of the group. Sen is the Ojou type who is incredibly bossy but does lessen as time goes on. These two become quite obsessed with the HP at times, i know, a pain right? Jubei is a slpit personality of sorts and claims the family name Yagyu, the exact same as our HP, yes they managed to throw in the classic non blood related little sister. Her 'other' half is so cool, that it can be forgiven. Matabei, Kanetsugu and Hanzo are pretty much there for the fan service. I mean, Matabei only ever wears a loincloth and a small shirt, Hanzo's attire consist os the standard maid uniform and Kanetsugu looks like Hatsune Miku of Vocaloid fame. With the abundance of clich\u00e9s you should expect these characters clothes to get shred to pieces. I watched the blu ray (oh boy the blu ray) so everything was revealed in full HD. Something of which is hard to explain to people walking by glancing at what i am watching and having to explain not all anime is tentacle and boobs. Ah yes. I do believe i forgot to mention there are in fact two separate tentacle monsters and an invisible fiend. If you do not possess the ability to see me through your computer monitor i am as of mentioning the three monsters, shaking my head. You do have a blond haired big breasted d'Artagnan to look forward to (or straight at if you tend to perv).\\n\\n\r\nThe music was an area i don't have any particular feelings towards. The opening is enjoyable as far as openings go. I will listen to it for one minute thirty every episode but i will not hunt down the full mp3 anytime soon. Same goes for the ending. Had i not watched this on my tv but instead on my laptop i would most certainly have skipped it. Now holding my hands up in regret, i did not pay an attention to the background music for the most part. That is not a good thing, if it didn't stand out it was probably out sounded by speech or destruction or just wasn't very good at all. My money being the latter. One thing i did notice a couple of times. The battle music sounded awfully similar to Black Lagoons opening theme song.\\n\r\nThe voice actors did an ok job. I watched both sub and dub. Well only about a thirds worth of it subbed but still subbed non the less. Now there were a couple of moments in which phrases such as; 'Ooooh' and 'Aaaah' would uttered from my lips in reply to the occasionally badly acted line but i would put the blame on the scrip more than the actors. This is a show in which the sub out ways the dub but i would recommend watching the dubbed version due to the reason stated in my next paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of is the art. Not necessarily the greatest compliment you could get. In fiction i consider the story and characters to be far more important than how good something looks. Here though it should be seen as a compliment as had this show used a regular art style it wouldn't stand out in the least. Everything is drawn with a thick black outline compared to a normal thin line that may not even be black. Often when looking at a still you could compare it to a more traditional western comic book. They also had some fun with color. The entire final abttle is in black and white. Not the kind of black and white where it's drawn in color and then a black and white gradient map in Photoshop has been applied leaving a more grey feel to. No. This is drawn verbatim. Black shadows and outlines. White everything else. It really did make it look quite nice. They also used blood splatter on a regular basis. Even in calm moments just to pan from scene to scene. It was a nice change. Even during battle certain characters had different color motifs. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is the single part of Hyakka that sets it apart from the crap you usually find in battle harems. It is also why i probably would never recommend Hyakka Ryouran to anybody. Because what am i supposed to say? 'Watch Hyakka, it looks pretty', i'll likely get replies along the lines of 'Sod off' or 'anime always looks good idiot' or 'So does Gankutsuou and that's better'. Anyway, i find this show to be top of it genre, not really a compliment in as much, the rest is just shite. Quite frankly my dear the bad far out way the good and i can fully understand why it has the MAL rating it does.",

There are great fights, and intriguing premise, and moderately well developed characters.  Sure alot of the things in here have been done before, but this anime manages to have fun without losing sight of the importance of the plot.  Sure there is fan service and the requisite awkward situations, it still maintains a serious undertone since the fate of Japan is riding on them.

            "content": "Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls is the kind of anime show that seems to have everything going the right way before it even starts airing. A storyline revolving around samurais? Check. Edgy visuals that make the anime stand out from the rest? Check. Fan service? Double check. All the ingredients to make a great anime series are present, which makes it all the more perplexing that Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls turned out to be a complete failure of a show.\r\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning. Taking place in Great Japan in an alternate timeline where the samurai tradition has been kept alive through modern age, the showstarts off with the arrival of protagonist Muneakira Yagyuu at a samurai academy, where he accidentally stumbles upon Yukimura Sanada and her bodyguard Matabei Gotou as the two undress, encounters childhood friend and princess of the Tokugawa clan Sen Tokugawa, meets the quirky Jubei who he seems to share a special connection with, and otherwise gets to know a good deal of other female students. However, no one seems to be aware of the fact that Great Japan is standing before a grave threat; one that shares a long history with the country.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to get a good sense of what Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls is about during the first episodes, because when it comes to story progression, the series is all over the place. Taking a look at the first half of the show\u2019s episodes, close to nothing happens that is relevant to the plot. It seems as though the anime forgot that it actually has a story to tell, concentrating too much on trying to deliver as much entertainment value as possible, but ultimately failing in that respect as well, with many jokes simply falling flat and the amount of humour ending up to be rather insufficient overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series isn\u2019t much better either. Whereas the earlier episodes seemed to go nowhere, the final ones feel extremely rushed. Characters are introduced on the go, the antagonistic threat literally appears out of the blue, and the plot suddenly rises in scale with no explanation whatsoever. In addition, despite having so much time on its hands to allot for character development (early on the episodes are basically just various interactions between characters put together to reach the twenty minute mark), most characters end up feeling rather underdeveloped, with protagonists such as Jubei and Muneakira turning out to be nothing more than cardboard cut-outs of anime stereotypes as the show concludes.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing preventing Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls from being a complete waste of time is the visual department, where the series clearly stands out. Boasting an unconventional look, the show features a stunning art style comprised of detailed\u2014albeit not particularly original\u2014character design, backgrounds in wash painting style, and ink drops marking scene transitions and censorship, in case you\u2019re watching the censored version. The animation is also relatively well-done, though for an anime revolving around samurai warriors, the amount of fight and action scenes is surprisingly sparse.\\n\\n\r\nHyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls also lacks in scope. Aside from a number of scenes that I can count on the fingers of one hand, only the characters relevant the plot are shown, making the anime unbelievably disconnected from the world the story takes place in and causing the experience of watching the show to feel like a far-off and underwhelming venture. There\u2019s a lot more to complain about, but the things mentioned earlier should give you a general idea of what to expect and\u2014more importantly\u2014what not to expect from Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls going in.",

            "content": "Overall: Hyakka Ryouran Samurai Girls is a fresh take on Ecchi anime.  The main charecter is only stereo typical in that he is a tad shy about sex (like most maile leads in ecchi anime), but that forgivable aspect aside he is a highly skilled samurai.  With fresh visuals and a good use of sound to compliment them you should have a good time with this show.\r\nStory: I would have given this show a lower value if is wasnt for the last 2 episodes.  So far the story has been very bland, but as of episodes 10 and 11 the plot hasfinally begun to move and its much more enjoyable.  Basically something evil is moving towards japan and the two sides that can do anything about it are fighting each other, because one wants total power and the other group is made up of our free spirited protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Wow.  The first episode should give you an idea of the art style they choice for this show, and I have to say it is fantastic.  I know that some people might be turned off by black paint strokes in the middle of the screen and dripping paint for a transition, but it works for me, if only because its very unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is also fantastic and it compliments the tone and the visuals quite well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  The characters that make up samurai girls start off one dimensional but grow into fully fleshed out people while the show itself grows in scope.  I find this to be a pleasing formula and some how they pulled it off.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Fun, funny and action oriented this show should if nothing else entertain you for its duration.  But by no means will it leave you with any lasting impressions.",

            "content": "Oh man.. It's another samurai harem. What's with Japanese people and turning historical figures into high school girls? Anyways, this anime series is based on a light novel series written by Akira Suzuki. Wait a minute. I know what are you wondering.. \"Hey isn't the main male lead name is Muneakira?\" Yes you're right. I mean if you're writing a story about a harem, wouldn't you want to be the center of it? And let's just add \"Mune\" to your name and nobody would even notice.\r\n(Yes, I know Mune can also mean breasts..)\r\nI really had high expectations with this one. No kidding. It's been along time since I've watch an anime about samurais. Unfortunately, as promising as this anime looks, here comes the hundreds of unnecessary fanservice and fillers to drown out the story. Oh sure, I'll like a few fillers now and then but they're rush the entire plot buildup right to the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nNow on the positive side, the reason why I sticked to this anime (No it's not because of the fanservice...) it's the astounding art this anime brings forward. It's a bit nostalgic as this reminds me of the game I used to play about a b*tch.. Umm I mean about a wolf (Ookami was it?) \\n\r\nAnyways, rarely I've seen an anime which uses the traditional ink style for all it's censorship and transition point however it gets annoying over time.\\n\r\nI have no complaints about the sound either.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here comes the characters. What? Only three girls in his harem?? Lame.. However, all three of them have some useful personalities to assist with their ever useless male harem lead. And Im suprised there's more tsunderes than Ive expected! As usual, as the story develops, each girl had their chance to express their feelings to Mr \"Breast\" Akira here. \\n\r\nOh boy, once again the male harem lead is there as a wallflower for every battle. Every battle when you think Muneakira is going to take charge and battle, prepare to get disappointed. Remember, this anime is aimed for people who loves fanservice so they wouldn't want to see a guy in the battle now would they? Hey, at least he isn't dense unlike some other male harem leads.\\n\r\nAnd what about the villains? Twisted as usual. Nothing new here. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I quite enjoyed this anime. That's because unlike others, I did not take the story seriously from the start after watching a few episodes of fillers. If you're looking for a nice samurai story with a decent plot then go look elsewhere. As entertaining as this may be, I wont be watching it again as this sort of anime is where you watch it once and you're already content. I mean, can you watch 12 whole episode about \"Love\", \"Honor\", and \"Bond\" all over again?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a good time killer if you have nothing better to do. Definitely a must watch anime for all you harem lovers. Just don't let the whole ideology of \"Love and Honor conquers all\" get stuck with you. Remember, an anime is an anime, and real life is just like an anime, without those big eyes.  \\n\\n\r\nHaremu Kingu,\\n\r\nSigning off..\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls isn't a series that I expected much from so I guess in a sense it exceeded my expectations.  It is not the best series out there and it's not for everyone either, but it can be a good time waster.\r\nThe series does have a plot but it only significantly advances in the final episodes.  So like many ecchi comedies out there, there is very little plot and when there is it's pretty weak. However not every series requires a strong plot to succeed, in fact there are many series out there that are successful with no plot.  Alla series really needs to do is satisfy it's viewers and I would say it satisfied me. There were a lot of attempts at comedy in this series, some worked and some didn't and there were some moments that were just hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was really stunning and beautiful. The style of art seems really unique and the detail is just amazing, even in the background.  The last couple of minutes of the final episode were full black in white which was visually pleasing to me too. The battle scenes are also well animated and looked nice too. I'm amazed at the amount of detail that were put into each one of them. Then there was the censoring. The ink dots that were used to censor inappropriate body parts could really get annoying especially when characters were moving around, since the dots would have to move with them.  But it really depends on the person, some may be bothered by it and some may not be.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department did an okay job.  The opening sounded great with an intense rock song to get you pumped up for action.  The voices seemed to fit each character's role. There's really nothing else to say about the sound.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the characters could have been done better. Although the protagonist, Muneakira, may be unique in some aspects (he's a samurai for crying out loud), he seems a bit generic. He's useless and usually doesn't have a clue what's going on, yet somehow almost every girl manages to fall for him. I still don't the sick magic that makes girls fall for useless protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nOur main heroine,Jubei, actually has two sides, her normal form and her bad-ass form.  She's usually only in her bad-ass form during battle, in this form she's really strong but also pretty smart as well. In her normal form she has a really innocent personality and refers to herself in third person to be cute.  I like how both personalities contrast from each other. \\n\\n\r\nOf course a harem would not complete without our 2 love rivals, Sen and Yukimura. They both seem bland. Yukimura is our short, flat chested character she is a bit tsundere but at least it's not overly done. Then we got Sen, at first I hated her because of her jealousy but by the end she was tolerable. Both of these characters aren't bad but they both really don't have the qualities that separate them from your typical harem characters.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have some side characters and they sometimes do add to the jokes in the series especially Kanetsugu but there's nothing really notable about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe series as a whole however is enjoyable. Although some of the jokes weren't well executed the others were hilarious. The story might have been lacking but I really can't complain about that since these types of series tend not to have plots. It's definitely a good time waster\\n\\n\r\nHyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls is far from being a masterpiece but it managed to pass the time. Although it's not for everyone, the series manages to entertain and at the end of the day that's all I really ask of an anime.",

            "content": "'Hyakka Ryouran SAMURAI GIRLS' is the 40th anniversary media-mix project by Hobby Japan, a plastic model / video game magazine publisher.\r\nThis series is an interesting watch because it's not only a \"media-mix\" as in franchise with products in multiple media platforms, it also feels like many popular anime series are mixed together. However, it represents everything that went wrong with today's anime industry.\r\nART:\r\nSeries like 'Gankutsuou', 'Mononoke', 'xxxHOLIC', 'Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei', and 'Yojouhan' have such distinctive and unconventional art style or character designs that you'll never forget once you've seen it. Sounds pretty cool, we should do it too! And there we have it, sumi-e (washpainting) style backgrounds, ink drops and brush strokes for censorship and scene transitions.\\n\r\nI have to admit that the style was unique, background is visually pleasing, and there were couple of breathtaking scenes. However, this art style was executed very poorly in many aspects. For one, the character designs were rather ordinary and they looked out of place in the picture even with the thick outlines as a buffer. The presence of modern day gadgets and use of CG made it seem awkward at times because it did not conform to the era or the style. The censoring technique was fine in still pictures, but it was unsightly and annoying when character is moving because the way ink dots follow and disappear screams of \"look at me! I'm different!\"\\n\r\nThe action is cool, and labeling of people and attack move's names were done rather well though.\\n\r\nThe animation in this series will certainly be remembered, but it simply did not work for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nYagyuu Juubee's voice is really cool when she's transformed into Master Samurai, but sounded way too cute/loli despite her appearance in normal form. Muneakira sounds too girly for the macho hero who's supposed to be all about samurai honor. Otherwise, the side characters' voices were done pretty well and sound like they should.\\n\r\nBGM was pretty generic. OP is a really good intense rock song, not only is it very catchy, it also had the Japanese flavor, and the vocal was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY/CHARACTER:\\n\r\nThe title \"Hyakka Ryouran\" has two meanings. The first, more literal meaning is \"Profusion of Flowers Blooming in Chaos\", as in girls (flowers) of various (profusion) backgrounds are unlocked (blooming) into master samurai and wreak havoc (chaos). The second meaning is \"Appearance of Abundant Talent in a Short Period\", which describes the resurgence of Master Samurai after a considerable draught in awakening. This series has a great naming sense in its own title, and also the names of signature moves for each character. For example in Sen's \"DenKouSekka\", a lightning attack which reads \"Lightning Fast\" in Japanese, \"Kou\" is deliberately written in wrong kanji that has same pronunciation that means \"Royalty\". D'Artagnan's ice attack that seals enemy movement \"Zettai Reido\" means \"Absolute Zero\", but written \"Absolute Slavery(Imprisonment)\".\\n\r\nA lot of moves have such creative names like that. However, the originality ends there.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is really, really bad. Sure, it's an alternate universe where the Shogunate rule survives, and there's zero Western influence in Japan, but then you have all the advanced technology (from the West) like air planes, cameras, and computers. It got so bad at one point that commando units holding guns were guarding ninjas and samurais. Talk about awkward.\\n\r\nThe premise is basically Evangelion ripoff, you have a chosen hero who unlocks the power of super-powerful beings to fight ones that want to end the world, and an organization trying to prevent that. The secretive organization functions through unethical practices (human experiments/sacrifices vs child labor), and yes, there was mass production of the super-beings to build up the force.\\n\\n\r\nThen all the characters were for manufactured harem. All the girl fighters except Sen have names of MALE historical figures or fictional characters of major literature with similar attributes. It's not even 'Sora no Otoshimono', and girls literally fall from the sky, and yes, one of the them is a cyborg. The initial villain is identical to Vegeta, he thinks he's above all others (emperors and kings), he does have a good purpose but uses any means to achieve his goals, he even wears a Power Level Scanner, and of course, he joins the hero and heroines in the end.\\n\r\nThere were many other similarities to DBZ, from \"Her power level is over half a million!\" to \"They are far beyond our capabilities, we can only watch\". The girls basically power up like Super-Sayan, and then a heroine even flies like one, before getting spirit bomb-like power recovery from allies. The whole action is like 'DBZ' meets 'Sengoku BASARA' with ridiculous power and constant yelling about love, honor, and justice. While this could've been quite funny if it was parody, there was nothing in this series to suggest that was the case.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there's these random fan-services with explosion ripping off girl's clothes, a girl wearing thongs all the time (historically some men did, but still...), dumb activation of power (kiss), and 'Sailor Moon' ripoff naked transformation.\\n\r\nCharacter behavior in general made no sense, and things happen just to advance the plot.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL\\n\r\nIt's nearly impossible to create a completely original story or characters in this day and age. For example, one of the villains in this series also had a magical eye like Alpha Stigma, a ripoff of Geass, which is a modified Sharingan, which is a souped up version of Hiei's evil eye, and then you can trace that all the way back to Medusa.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, good storywriting can camouflage similarities well enough that they won`t be easily noticeable and bother us. On the other hand, the mix of themes and reference in this show is blatant and shameless. They are so poorly executed that the apparent lack of originality is obvious to the viewer. And then you have excessive moe and ecchi fan service, failed art style innovation, and manufactured harem environment to distract us from the flaws in story and production. Like many similar harem anime today, 'Hyakka Ryouran' was a very poorly produced and forgettable series.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the story is shallow and clich\u00e9, but it does have a good pace and some of the tried and true formula do work, and the action scenes are exciting. The show is a true mix of previous anime and lacks originality, but it does offer quick entertainment.\\n",

However, there is more to the story than just action fan service scenes.\r\nWhether it\u2019s standing still or in movement, it\u2019s really a rich and attractive art design. The environments feel like a sharp watercolor painting, and the characters blend in with a darker, deeper color.\r\nHirakawa, Daisuke (School Days, Omamori Himari) and Kugimiya, Rie (Toradora!, Hayate the Combat Butler!) share the majority of airtime on the first episode. Both of these voice actors have had their shareof different roles, so expect nothing but a perfect performance from the both of them. The sound effects match the soundtracks used in intense, dramatic, mysterious scenes, and also match the amusing, make-fun-of-the-size-of-my-breast scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEach characters outfit/weapon shows a lot of creativity, detail, and personality. Although, not much characters were revealed my favorite characters so far are Yagyuu, Muneakira and Sanada Yukimura. Yagyuu feels mysterious, and Sanada is hyperactive-ish.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed my visit in the world of Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls and I can\u2019t wait to view more episodes when they air.

            "content": "Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls. \r\n\u201cOooooooooh, lookie-lookie! Another harem series rated with mild nudity!\u201d --- Me\r\nI\u2019ve been a fan of harem series as long as I can remember. I don\u2019t know; maybe part of it was because it won\u2019t happen for me in real life. I know I\u2019m not the only one who projects themselves as the protagonist, and that\u2019s why, maybe, I don\u2019t watch shoujo series at all. Enough about me spouting nonsense. Let us proceed further into my review of Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls.\r\nStory: 7\r\nHyakka Ryouran\u2019s story isn\u2019t that great. But the setting will pique a bit of your interest. Why? It\u2019s because ofthe odd setting of the story. If you think that the story happened in the samurai era, which was in the past. You are wrong, mister.\\n\r\nThe story happens in the early 21st century, in an alternate reality where the Tokugawa Shogunate has remained in power.  21st century, meaning computers (in fact they\u2019re using Microsoft OS on their computers), airplanes, trains, etc. exist. So don\u2019t get confused. I like the fact of mixing modern and feudal-era in the story. The setting is unique in its own way.\\n\r\nAs for the story, a girl mysteriously appears in front of him descending from the sky and steals his first kiss. And voil\u00e0, he gained one of the girls he\u2019ll be adding into his arsenal of samurai babes! There\u2019s more to it than that of course. Buuuuuuuuuuut! You halfta\u2019 watch the series yourself to understand it more. Considering that Hyakka Ryouran has only 12 episodes, (second season not included) it is in fact very short. The story\u2019s really easy to grasp so you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\\n\r\nYou can say I\u2019m lazy for not telling you the plot. Half of its true, half of it is I just don\u2019t want to spoil you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nHyakka Ryouran\u2019s art is great. Or it\u2019s just a biased opinion of silly self. Either way, Hyakka Ryouran\u2019s art is very appealing to me. Everything that was drawn was surrounded by these heavily inked borders around them. And the fight scenes weren\u2019t half bad, too. In short, everything was bloody messed up with ink. But it comes with colours, too! Like black, purple, white. INK, INK, INK!!! Even sword slashes were inks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nConsidering Hyakka Ryouran\u2019s a harem series, we should have a lot of bishoujous surrounding our MC. Oh and yes, did they deliver. An air-head; a loli (who is voiced by Rie Kugimiya); and a jealous-type girl.  The supporting characters were decent, too. The lack of male characters in the story is quite disturbing. I\u2019ve only seen two guys in the story. Oh whelp, who cares about males. What am I even saying? This show\u2019s for guys anyway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know why, but the background songs in the fights scenes seem really familiar to me. For the OP theme and ED theme; I did like the ED theme which was done by Rie Kugimiya! The OP theme\u2019s made by Faylan. They also made songs for Seikon no Qwaser, which, incidentally, is like Hyakka Ryouran. Although it\u2019s a lot more mature than Hyakka Ryouran.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it? Of course, my inner male did. But my inner plot-centred-self isn\u2019t quite as happy as my inner male did. Why? It\u2019s the lack of legitimate plot. What I irked me the most was the progress of the story. The first few episodes were good, explaining some things how this and that happened. But continuing to the middle episodes it got boring. What I mean is, the plot of the story doesn\u2019t progress that much until the last few episodes. Nevertheless, the simple punches and sword swings that could tear the girls\u2019 clothes really made me happy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nHyakka Ryouran\u2019s far off from being called a masterpiece. It lacks a lot of essentials on how to be a great series. Looking at the fan service it provides, especially to adolescent boys, it\u2019ll be a decent show, or better, a great show (for them). Let\u2019s all face it, boobies and panties aren\u2019t enough to wow viewers these days, or even make them watch the series.\\n\r\nMy verdict: Hyakka Ryouran\u2019s a good watch, not a \u201cmust-watch\u201d series. But it\u2019ll definitely entertain you.\\n",

YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but anything else is not so good.\r\nwell first of all anime setting is in some alternative world where \"great japan\" is attacked by outside forces and \"great japan\" instead of using their millitary using \"master samurais\" who are a sexy females inpatsu. no theres no males. only females. and only in patsu. and those master samurais is somehow japans only hope to survive attacks or something. \\n\\n\r\nand so we see the first and most ridiculous scene where few bitches jumps to FUCKING SKY and cuts bomber jets with katanas... ok this is not just stupid and imposible but just... a cheap copy of Dragonball?? oh shit not another one...\\n\\n\r\nnow from the beggining theres no logic in this anime. not at all. not even a little bit of logic you will find here. and story is complete bullshit. a female fell from sky into protagonists arms and he kiss her and activate her superpower so she became a master samurai and we have transformation scene similar to those from sailor moon and here she is a legendary Jubei Yagyu who's power level is way beyond 9000. and so that bitch who fell from sky can transform into a master samurai if she is kissed but in regular life she is retarded stupid girl with big boobs and 3 year old brains just like that fucking Lucy/nyu from elfen lied. well she ofcourse not the only bitch, theres a whole harem that includes every type and every size from boobless loli to enormous boobled childhood friend. and yes they show boobs openly, no censoring. well if it would be hentai it would be so much better but we have what we have...\\n\\n\r\nso also the whole story is just pure nonsence. have no point. it would be as good without story at all. it actually is without any story at all... like just nothing, I repeat NOTHING that would make sense. just a boob/ass show that pretends to be about samurai honor.. somehow...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nso yeah samurais! yes theres also katanas and \"sword fights\" (if you can call that bullshit fights). yet these fights are so cheap and stupid that it just makes me angry... well dont expect ANYTHING similar to that Rurouni Kenshin historical japanese mood and sounds of coliding katanas in those (almost) well animated sword fights. nooooo here we have A FUCKING NUCLEAR EXPLOSION every time some bitch draws or swings her katana. like BOOOM and fight is over! yes fight is over. a nuclear explosion ends fight really fast. oh you might think that there's no survivors after nuclear explosion caused by katana.. somehow.. but nooooo the only damage that those massive nuclear explosions inflict to human beings is that it rips off their clothes. yes rips off clothes. so you can see a boobs. thats the damage you get after nuclear explosion somehow caused by katana..... \\n\r\nin short there's no sword fights at all. only those regular energy blasts, explosions and similar bullshit we seen so many times since DragonBall times (1989). and sailor moon type of transformations that you will see EVERY FUCKING TIME before \"fight\" starts. \\n\\n\r\nin short all this anime is offence to Japans culture and history as it uses historical names and pretends to be japan historicaly based or something...\\n\\n\\n\r\nand also we have that stylish green haired dickless pussy main protagonist Yagyu Muneakira. he's not just bad character... he's not really even a character. he have stylish katana and suposed to be a brave samurai ready to die for great japans sake yet soon he turns out to be \"general\" of several bitches who's the only one who can activate their \"hidden power\".. by kissing them.\\n\r\nand that all he do. in entire show his only job is to kiss his bitches and act like a complete fucktard. and most important - whining, crying, worrying and act like a fucking dickless pussy shit kirito bitch kasanova shit for fuck sake. seriously this is one of the most boring, stupid, stereotypical, useless and regular harem character I've ever seen. arguably worse than kirito kirigaya itself... guess how many times he fought in those 13 episodes?? how many??? huh? your guess?? NONE!! he never even fucking fought a single time in entire 13 episodes! he only hidding behind womans back like a fucking pussy!! whenever enemy comes he hides under the backs of his bitches! \"save me girls! I m in trouble\" .....is he even a man? isn't its a man who suposed to protect a woman? but yeah lets not forget this is alternative twisted world where womans protecting those weak mans who are all pussies like Muneakira. also millitary is made exclusively out of womans. yes all the soldiers in this world is females only and no man serve in millitary forces... mans here can only be \"generals\" (harem masters, kasanovas).... seriously...\\n\\n\\n\r\nthis should've been made as Hentai and that would be almost ok... almost..\\n\\n\\n\r\nbut now its a fucking disaster...\\n\\n\\n\r\n this is one of the shitiest anime I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\n2/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nwhy not 1/10? because some nice boobs out there.. yeah if you want to watch this nonsencial bullshit just for the sake of boobs go on!\\n\\n\\n\r\nalso theres a 2nd season for this shit called \"samurai bride\". didin't watch this one and not gonna watch it. not for me...\\n",

            "content": "Taking place in an alternate 21st century where the Tokugawa Shogunate still rules Great Japan, the generals of the country relied on Master Samurai's; very powerful women with special powers to fight their battles. As time passed, this breed of warrior has become more scarce. Muneakira Yagyu heads to the Buou Academy to meet with his long time friend Princess Sen, but he ends up in the middle of a battle taking place between students of the academy, and their rival Yukimara and her assistant who both represent Toyotomi. During the battle a girl falls from the sky claiming to be Jubei Yagyu before shepasses out after the fight. Who is this girl? And what was that display of power? These are only some questions leading to the coming events. -summary \\n\\n\r\nI really wish that I stuck with my gut and avoided this atrocious anime title like AIDS. I've just about had it with Sentai Filmworks and their ridiculous line of anime titles. At this point in time, I've completely seen four of their titles and every last one of them rank amongst the worst anime I have ever seen including Samurai Girls. Despite not getting into the trailer at all, I came into this completely from a level-headed perspective. I gave this anime the benefit of the doubt and it made me literally cringe during the entire duration. Samurai Girls is almost completely devoid of all imagination, and it heavily relies on those same tired old harem comedy clich\u00e9s. It features the same old mousy loser who's completely afraid of pussy, and is surrounded by a host of women for the flimsiest of reasons. The tired old love triangles, the girls who berate him for things that's not his fault, it just goes on and on. I am so sick and tired of this weak shit. \\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, and I'm not trying to come off offensive or like some type of elitist, but Samurai Girls is for that type of anime fan who either has no standards at all, or are completely new and really haven't experienced the absolute best titles the genre has to after. The only positives I can think of lies in the visuals and music score. The anime is indeed stylish with a heavy manga influence filled with dark lines, and very nice looking backgrounds that reminds me of Super Street Fighter IV. Visually, there's just nothing bad to look at here and the character designs are very sexy for the women. There's some great detail in the loads of fan service provided. In addition, black ink blotches frequently drop down to the screen, and later on in the series, they feature different colored blotches that really does look cool. The action scenes contain many flashes and light shows reminiscent of Bleach and Dragonball Z. The BGM which is provided by Tatsuya Katou complements the anime well, when working for the action and comedy. Unfortunately, although these things stand out, they really didn't make getting through this anime any easier. \\n\\n\r\nSamurai Girls was a chore for me. The visuals tend to overshadow the characters, plot, action, and story, because none of those things are anything special. The plot spins its wheels very early with little to no progression at all. The characters soon learn that the female samurai's can be transformed into Master Samurai's by kissing Muneakira, this pits at least three of them in this unoriginal, by the numbers love triangle that grows boring and annoying very quick with lots of bickering. To add to the lack of originality and completely insipid, the main character Jubei goes through a Lucy/Nyu-esque of Elfen Lied fame transformation, from powerful samurai warrior to an infantile retard that is nowhere near as annoying as Nyu, but is annoying as hell in her own right. None of the characters were the least bit interesting to me. If it wasn't for the fact that they were named after real samurai's of the Sengoku and Edo periods, I would have never even known their names. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime features one comic relief after the other, and even though I chuckled here and there to the characters antics. I felt the writers were trying way too hard to be funny, and more than half of the time the jokes were completely flat. They get even worse due to the constant rehashing. Later on around the ninth episode, something of a plot develops when the heroes learn they will have to face a demonic threat that could wipe them all out. Unfortunately, it's too badly paced and thanks to all of the filler before it everything feels too tacked on and very rushed. The action, which should be a stand out, is made up of flashes of action and falling bodies, with way too many high energy attacks. The writers cut way too many corners as there aren't any choreographed sword on sword exchanges, which is completely ridiculous for a show with a samurai setting. \\n\\n\r\nThere's no doubt that I personally believe I sat through a certified shitcapade, but what keeps these DVD's from being certified coasters, is that the anime never attempts to take itself too seriously. There are no tonal shifts, it's a straight forward light hearted ride meant to be fun; but the problem is that it doesn't accomplish any of its goals in the areas it set out to excel in as far as I'm concerned. This anime is an ant amongst giants when compared to series close to its type such as Excel Saga and Slayers. \\n\\n\r\nSamurai Girls is a very poor excuse of a samurai/harem show. The only area it really stands out in is the prodution values; character designs, flashy action moments, fan service, music score, and for me, this just isn't enough. I hated the characters, their played out interactions, non choreographed action scenes, that troll final episode. It was just a bad experience for me. I only recommend this to the very easy to please. If you enjoyed Needless and High School of the Dead, then you'll love this. \\n\\n\r\nHighs: Production values\\n\\n\\n\r\nLows: Plot, characters, comedy, etc.\\n",

            "content": "If there's one thing 2010 isn't short of, it would have to be the abundance of ecchi anime that's aired this year. From titles like Kiss x Sis, High School of the Dead, and even Seikon no Qwaser, it makes one think that Japan has had a rise in lonely boys who are buying into this stuff like ice to Eskimos.\r\nHyakka Ry\u014dran: Samurai Girls is no different in that all it really is, is a show about samurai with breasts set in neo-Japan. Die-hard fans of historical anime/literature may feel insulted to this as famous names like Sanada Yukimura, Yagy\u016b J\u016bbei and even Senhim\u00e9 aremade to cast as mo\u00e9 characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nRy\u014dran takes place in an alternate world where the samurai co-exist with modern technology. How Akira Suzuki(author of the light novels) came up with the idea is beyond me but its definitely not unheard of if your a fan of Gintama. In this reality, master samurai are like guardian deities who serve their shogun as well as protect the populace with their godly powers that differentiate them from your average samurai. \\n\\n\r\nSound good so far? I thought so too until I realized this series was more a rom-com harem then an action anime.  Don't get me wrong, there definitely is action in the series but there just wasn't enough to outweigh the lame overdone comedy. For those who have seen the series Sekirei may see some similarities(like the norito kiss) in this anime, and will probably get the same disappointment in regards to Ry\u014dran's plotline.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nIf there's one thing Ry\u014dran will be remembered by(if it ever gets remember by next season), is its art and animation. From background to character design, everything is presented in a unique fashion that is different from your typical 2D or CG anime. Of course that doesn't mean that characters are drawn in a weird way as first and foremost, this is an ecchi anime that has samurai girls showing off their assets. One thing I have to commend the director with is the method to which they use to censor the ladies naughty bits. Instead of using the traditional white light or white fog, we are shown ink blotches which coincide with the series artwork.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst I wouldn't say animation is first class for Ry\u014dran, I'd definitely rate it higher then other battle anime that's come out recently(like Nurarihyon no Mago)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nAnother component I guess I enjoyed for this series would have to be its sound. With J-rock band Faylan performing the OP \"Last Vision For Last\", your easily swayed into thinking this series is well worth watching as it pulls you in with the beat like any good shon\u00e9n anime should. The ED \"Koi ni Sesse Tooryanse\" performed by the leading ladies of the series is not bad either(nor is it any good) and the BGM is nicely set in place giving you the right ambiance and pacing.\\n\\n\r\nI really have no complaints with the voice cast, asides from that anyone who has seen School Days may be clearly reminded that the main lead for this series is Makoto. Thought I'd throw it out there  :D\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\r\nThis is where the series fails. The characters of Ry\u014dran are shallow and there is not one character in the anime that I could say is solid. We are reminded time and time again through each character, that this really is a two-bit harem. The main lead at first showed some promise but quickly fell into the endless spiral of uninspiring harem males and the supporting ladies are a joke. If someone was to ask me if I've seen Ry\u014dran, my first reply would be \"Oh, that boobies show?\" because that's all the women of Ry\u014dran is all about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nWatching Ry\u014dran is like riding a bicycle through a mountainous valley. There are so many ups and downs to the series that its not worth counting. As long as your not looking for a deeper meaning to what this show portrays, then its all downhill in regards to enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5\\n\r\nHyakka Ry\u014dran: Samurai Girls is first and foremost an ecchi anime. If that's what your looking for, then this series should definitely please. Yes it has action and a bit of story, but I wouldn't call it its selling point and is more a bonus.",

            "content": "You know, once in a while you'll find yourself watching an episode of an anime thinking, why am I watching this? But for Hyakka Ryouran, you'll be thinking, why have I not heard of this earlier?! (unless this was in one of your first 10 anime, ignore that whole paragraph.)\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nA martial arts anime with harem, romance, comedy and school. Except, the genre that was least shown was of course, the school genre. Probably just to make everything look more interesting. This type of story isn't for your light hearted, slice of life type anime fan, because there's also mild violence. The romance genre canbe really sweet sometimes, as each character builds a bond with Muneakira Yagyuu. The story keeps you on your toes, but sometimes gets off track, which may be really boring. Other than that, the story is solid and doesn't drag too much. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhy a high rating, you ask? The art is very unique, having very dark and thick outlines on each character, not to mention the smooth animation. The theme of the anime is set on the Tokugawa era, so not a lot of vibrant colors and more of a dark, ancient style of art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for each scene is mostly Japanese-themed, sticking to the roots of the anime. The OP goes nicely with the anime, fitting the action+romance. The ED is all about love, so I guess that fits the romance genre.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEach character stayed with their role, Muneakira being the protagonist and of course, all protagonists are heroes. The only thing I hate about him is the voice actor, he sounds like he's still in his teens, because of how his voice can crack very often. Not very fitting for a strong, kind character.\\n\\n\r\nThe 3 girls that are mostly around Muneakira:\\n\\n\r\nYagyuu Jubei, having the cutest sounding VA in the anime, Yuuki Aoi. She's a very cheerful, kind and friendly character but she's a klutz. Her 'alter-ego' is similar to Akashiya Moka, from Rosario to Vampire. She is the complete opposite when she is in her 'alter-ego'.\\n\\n\r\nSanada Yukimura, having the voice actress of the 'Queen of Tsundere', Kugimiya Rie. Tsundere, flat chested, but a genius too.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, Sen Tokugawa, the childhood friend of Muneakira. A strong, smart, and the type of female character who would misunderstand any perverted situation. She is also the student council president.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this season because of the story PANTYSHOTS, the smooth animation TITS, the characters themselves BOOBS- oh forget it, this anime has a lot of Ecchi. Pantyshots every minute, ink-censored nipples, but that enough won't get you from the story. Would I re-watch it? Maybe.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime that is similar to:\\n\r\nRosario to Vampire\\n\r\nHighschool DxD\\n\r\nand more harem+action anime, then look no further, this anime is just for you.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ahh, the classic ecchi action show. I am not a fan of the genre in general, but the first episode seemed like it could turn out well. It also seemed like it had a plot. The art also seemed rather unique in its genre of bright and happy. Yes, it was all what it seemed.\r\nExpectation: 6\r\nEpisode scores:-,-,-,-, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 6, 6, 6\r\nActual: 4 Bad\r\nYet the plot is quickly put aside for the last episodes, nothing unusual, as the harem tries to become master samurai. Now what can be wrong with that? Well, i don't mind the cliche random guy getting all thechicks, and the fact that at first they are essentially just trying to use him as a stepping stool. Yet, while there is some actually relationships that seem to do well, any interaction is transformed into interaction between a master and his samurai. Well at least for the dense lead anyways. Even the kisses are lame, and insignificant because of the same property.\\n\\n\r\nWith Samurai you would expect some good battles. Yet, we are bombarded with poor fight after poor fight. Either it is a master samurai beating the crap out of somebody defenseless or them pulling off their 'named move' once or twice inbetween talking. The only exceptional scene is the climax, but they sacrifice any logic for the  pretty effects.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a lot more comedy that i enjoyed which was unexpected. It might of been one of the few redeeming qualities of this show, but even then they are not that good. i might of just felt like enjoying slapstick humor for some reason when i was watching this.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not very deep. The harem consists of tsunderes with a side dish of servants and energetic idiots that fell of of the sky. Their characters are not really anything special, nor do they have at least one oddity about them. At least i was a Rie fan so i was able to appreciate something about at least one character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, not that much different from any other ecchi show. The plot is pretty lame, and the comedy is not up to par with a lot of better actual 'ecchi comedies' out there. I would call this average for this genre, but the standard is set pretty low as far as i am concerned as of late.",

The art is good enough that I sometimes get distracted and end up missing the dialogue.  The cel-shading may offend some, but I've never had an issue with this style of animation.  \r\nAs far as being categorized as ecchi...I'd consider this to be very mild.  While there are the usual scantily clad (or no clothes at all) scenes and plenty of fanservice, none of them are directly explicit(at least so far.)  This anime does not use theexcessively over-distorted proportions common to other series (like Godannar or Koihime Mus\u014d)  \\n\\n\r\nThere is apparently a great deal of back story as several conflicts and a touch of intrigue was revealed during the first episode.   \\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences are only fair which I found surprising considering the high quality of the artwork.  There has not been much combat to rate this show with but some low-quality (shadows, off-screen sequences) tricks were used to avoid drawing them outright.  \\n\\n\r\nStill I'm looking forward to seeing more of this series and seeing how the plot unfolds.",

The heavy lines, softness of the colors, detail, all combines to make it very nice to watch.\r\nGranted, there is a lot of fan service. And I agree with others assessment, the ink blots used to cover naughty bits was annoying, especially in combat. However, getting the blu-ray version obviously fixed this problem.\r\nI don't havea problem with naughty bits, in fact it is a plus for me. (I am a guy duh) But I don't like that it will take away from some of the demographic because of that.

            "content": "I figured for my first speed review I'd try to do my best not to completely berate an anime or worship it as a deity (Edit: I failed). What better to do it on than Hyakka Ryouran?\r\nPossibly the worst anime I've ever watched. However, it DID manage to get on my watched(completed) list, instead of the pile of crap I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole, the (dropped) list. Which makes me ponder how I ever finished it.\r\nI can't really be unbiased, because I honestly hate almost every single aspect of this show. The story is border line retarded, there is little character development,and none of the characters are all that likable. (save maybe the sadistic side of Yagyu Jubei, but then again, I seem have an affinity for crazy psycho bitches) \\n\\n\r\nThe main character was as interesting as a pile of dog crap, and that's as far as I'll go into. None of the girls had any depth. The main heroine (the mya~ side of Yagyu Jubei) had the personality and intelligence of a 5 month old kitten. Don't get me wrong, I quite like kittens, I just wouldn't want one for a girlfriend nor a main heroine. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my biggest gripes with this show is, the main villain general guy... douchefag. This is one of the most hated characters on my hated characters list. \\n\r\n   One of the biggest pet peeves I have, are guys who treat girls like shit, and guys that wear dicks on their heads. This guy is both.\\n\\n\r\n Often times villains fall into four categories. Ones which you can hate with all your heart, ones you can fear and admire, ones you can connect with, and the random bunches of monsters demons and angels that want humans dead. The only downfall with the first type of villian, is for some reason, more than 50% the time, they get forgiven, have a change of heart and do a 180.\\n\r\n  Bullshit! These villains spend the majority of the anime fueling my hate, keeping me watching and hoping for the satisfying moment when they get their heads torn off and necks shatted down \u00e0 la Duke Nukem style. But no, they often give some bullshit reason for why they did what they did, in hopes of having the viewer connect with them. \\n\r\n  Too late!! I already hate them with all my heart. They doesn't deserve retribution, they just needs to dieee.\\n\\n\r\n  But on to why I started the show. The animation is.. amazing. It is one of the best animation styles I have ever seen. The whole entire feel of the anime is like a 1950's samurai movie. The ink tones, outlines, and colors are beautiful. Random ink splotches filled the screen at times, making the anime feel like a beautiful work of calligraphy. Even the censors are brilliantly done (via conveniently placed inkblots). Which makes it such a shame, that the story and characters are so god damn awful.\\n\\n\r\nThis well done animation (and the hopes of seeing the main villain murdered brutally at the end) is the ONLY thing that kept me watching. With knowing that *SPOILER*, that asshole doesn't die in a complete satisfying bloody mess, nor the main character, nor any of the other retarded characters in this show. It's really hard to recommend this. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to see mindless action and fan-service go for it. You might actually get enjoy the wonderful animation, that is if you don't blow your brains out halfway through due to the complete retardedness of all the characters.\\n\\n\r\n(Alright I confess. As my first review, it was a little rushed. It's prolly been more than 3 years since I've watched it. During which I was half dazed, in awe of the animation, and half trying to blow my brains out from the god awful storyline/characters. So it's not as in depth, well put, and unbiased as I wanted. Having said that, I still hope you enjoyed reading review this as much as I did writing it.)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "At this stage of my review, that is to say, the very beginning, i feel obligated to let you know that this review will not end positively. It's a warning you perhaps do not wish or care to hear but one i must inform you thusly. There will be positive comments throughout but they will all fall eventually into a melancholic tone to highlight certain disappointments.\r\nThis show can be summarised in the following sentence; that is to say if i do not go off on a random tangent instead, big breasted female samurai fight against villains. That is, there are only two villains of theshow but one of them isn't really that bad. He's just extreme. There are also only two males who actually do something. I believe there to be a third but he would hardly count and you do hear about other males but they are never seen. Expect a lot of harem clich\u00e9s to slither their way in and out of the plot. I say out but to be fair they never leave. They stick around to the end. I will not claim Hyakka to be great and groundbreaking for its genre or claim it to be so terrible it's an insult.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting for this show is a hard one to grasp. At first you start thinking perhaps it is set in the edo period or a period similar but then a character whips out a computer from nowhere. Unless the writer of this show knows something the rest of the world doesn't. I don't think they had computers that far back, at the very least, we do know it is set in Japan and that it is set among very traditional Japanese people; Dojo's, Kimono's, those sliding doors. Not really surprising. It would be weird having a samurai show in modern day Tokyo or something. It's one of the shows facets that help it differ from the likes of Sekirei and Ikkitousen.\\n\\n\r\nEach character from this show i found out (help from wikipedia was much appreciated) shares their name with famous Japanese icons from the past albeit gender flipped and huge personality changes. I mean ALL of the characters do, not just a couple or a few. There are two who do not however rendering my previous inflection on 'all' moot. Muneakira is our harem protagonist and to be fair to him he is a lot better at it than most HPs but he isn't that great. He actually does very little but what he did do was pretty bad ass. Yukimura is a small flat chested girl and is basically the 'smart' one of the group. Sen is the Ojou type who is incredibly bossy but does lessen as time goes on. These two become quite obsessed with the HP at times, i know, a pain right? Jubei is a slpit personality of sorts and claims the family name Yagyu, the exact same as our HP, yes they managed to throw in the classic non blood related little sister. Her 'other' half is so cool, that it can be forgiven. Matabei, Kanetsugu and Hanzo are pretty much there for the fan service. I mean, Matabei only ever wears a loincloth and a small shirt, Hanzo's attire consist os the standard maid uniform and Kanetsugu looks like Hatsune Miku of Vocaloid fame. With the abundance of clich\u00e9s you should expect these characters clothes to get shred to pieces. I watched the blu ray (oh boy the blu ray) so everything was revealed in full HD. Something of which is hard to explain to people walking by glancing at what i am watching and having to explain not all anime is tentacle and boobs. Ah yes. I do believe i forgot to mention there are in fact two separate tentacle monsters and an invisible fiend. If you do not possess the ability to see me through your computer monitor i am as of mentioning the three monsters, shaking my head. You do have a blond haired big breasted d'Artagnan to look forward to (or straight at if you tend to perv).\\n\\n\r\nThe music was an area i don't have any particular feelings towards. The opening is enjoyable as far as openings go. I will listen to it for one minute thirty every episode but i will not hunt down the full mp3 anytime soon. Same goes for the ending. Had i not watched this on my tv but instead on my laptop i would most certainly have skipped it. Now holding my hands up in regret, i did not pay an attention to the background music for the most part. That is not a good thing, if it didn't stand out it was probably out sounded by speech or destruction or just wasn't very good at all. My money being the latter. One thing i did notice a couple of times. The battle music sounded awfully similar to Black Lagoons opening theme song.\\n\r\nThe voice actors did an ok job. I watched both sub and dub. Well only about a thirds worth of it subbed but still subbed non the less. Now there were a couple of moments in which phrases such as; 'Ooooh' and 'Aaaah' would uttered from my lips in reply to the occasionally badly acted line but i would put the blame on the scrip more than the actors. This is a show in which the sub out ways the dub but i would recommend watching the dubbed version due to the reason stated in my next paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of is the art. Not necessarily the greatest compliment you could get. In fiction i consider the story and characters to be far more important than how good something looks. Here though it should be seen as a compliment as had this show used a regular art style it wouldn't stand out in the least. Everything is drawn with a thick black outline compared to a normal thin line that may not even be black. Often when looking at a still you could compare it to a more traditional western comic book. They also had some fun with color. The entire final abttle is in black and white. Not the kind of black and white where it's drawn in color and then a black and white gradient map in Photoshop has been applied leaving a more grey feel to. No. This is drawn verbatim. Black shadows and outlines. White everything else. It really did make it look quite nice. They also used blood splatter on a regular basis. Even in calm moments just to pan from scene to scene. It was a nice change. Even during battle certain characters had different color motifs. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is the single part of Hyakka that sets it apart from the crap you usually find in battle harems. It is also why i probably would never recommend Hyakka Ryouran to anybody. Because what am i supposed to say? 'Watch Hyakka, it looks pretty', i'll likely get replies along the lines of 'Sod off' or 'anime always looks good idiot' or 'So does Gankutsuou and that's better'. Anyway, i find this show to be top of it genre, not really a compliment in as much, the rest is just shite. Quite frankly my dear the bad far out way the good and i can fully understand why it has the MAL rating it does.",

There are great fights, and intriguing premise, and moderately well developed characters.  Sure alot of the things in here have been done before, but this anime manages to have fun without losing sight of the importance of the plot.  Sure there is fan service and the requisite awkward situations, it still maintains a serious undertone since the fate of Japan is riding on them.  Overall a great littleseries, more than worth watching.",

            "content": "Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls is the kind of anime show that seems to have everything going the right way before it even starts airing. A storyline revolving around samurais? Check. Edgy visuals that make the anime stand out from the rest? Check. Fan service? Double check. All the ingredients to make a great anime series are present, which makes it all the more perplexing that Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls turned out to be a complete failure of a show.\r\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning. Taking place in Great Japan in an alternate timeline where the samurai tradition has been kept alive through modern age, the showstarts off with the arrival of protagonist Muneakira Yagyuu at a samurai academy, where he accidentally stumbles upon Yukimura Sanada and her bodyguard Matabei Gotou as the two undress, encounters childhood friend and princess of the Tokugawa clan Sen Tokugawa, meets the quirky Jubei who he seems to share a special connection with, and otherwise gets to know a good deal of other female students. However, no one seems to be aware of the fact that Great Japan is standing before a grave threat; one that shares a long history with the country.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to get a good sense of what Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls is about during the first episodes, because when it comes to story progression, the series is all over the place. Taking a look at the first half of the show\u2019s episodes, close to nothing happens that is relevant to the plot. It seems as though the anime forgot that it actually has a story to tell, concentrating too much on trying to deliver as much entertainment value as possible, but ultimately failing in that respect as well, with many jokes simply falling flat and the amount of humour ending up to be rather insufficient overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series isn\u2019t much better either. Whereas the earlier episodes seemed to go nowhere, the final ones feel extremely rushed. Characters are introduced on the go, the antagonistic threat literally appears out of the blue, and the plot suddenly rises in scale with no explanation whatsoever. In addition, despite having so much time on its hands to allot for character development (early on the episodes are basically just various interactions between characters put together to reach the twenty minute mark), most characters end up feeling rather underdeveloped, with protagonists such as Jubei and Muneakira turning out to be nothing more than cardboard cut-outs of anime stereotypes as the show concludes.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing preventing Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls from being a complete waste of time is the visual department, where the series clearly stands out. Boasting an unconventional look, the show features a stunning art style comprised of detailed\u2014albeit not particularly original\u2014character design, backgrounds in wash painting style, and ink drops marking scene transitions and censorship, in case you\u2019re watching the censored version. The animation is also relatively well-done, though for an anime revolving around samurai warriors, the amount of fight and action scenes is surprisingly sparse.\\n\\n\r\nHyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls also lacks in scope. Aside from a number of scenes that I can count on the fingers of one hand, only the characters relevant the plot are shown, making the anime unbelievably disconnected from the world the story takes place in and causing the experience of watching the show to feel like a far-off and underwhelming venture. There\u2019s a lot more to complain about, but the things mentioned earlier should give you a general idea of what to expect and\u2014more importantly\u2014what not to expect from Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls going in.",

The main charecter is only stereo typical in that he is a tad shy about sex (like most maile leads in ecchi anime), but that forgivable aspect aside he is a highly skilled samurai.  With fresh visuals and a good use of sound to compliment them you should have a good time with this show.\r\nStory: I would have given this show a lower value if is wasnt for the last 2 episodes.  So far the story has been very bland, but as of episodes 10 and 11 the plot hasfinally begun to move and its much more enjoyable.  Basically something evil is moving towards japan and the two sides that can do anything about it are fighting each other, because one wants total power and the other group is made up of our free spirited protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Wow.  The first episode should give you an idea of the art style they choice for this show, and I have to say it is fantastic.  I know that some people might be turned off by black paint strokes in the middle of the screen and dripping paint for a transition, but it works for me, if only because its very unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is also fantastic and it compliments the tone and the visuals quite well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  The characters that make up samurai girls start off one dimensional but grow into fully fleshed out people while the show itself grows in scope.  I find this to be a pleasing formula and some how they pulled it off.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Fun, funny and action oriented this show should if nothing else entertain you for its duration.  But by no means will it leave you with any lasting impressions.",

It falls right into the garbage bin where every other \"cute girls do cute things, have no dignity, and beat up some loser guy\" animu had been created.\r\nAt firstI didn't wanna watch because I heard \"ninjas and samurai slash apart weaponry sent by the US\" and instantly labeled it \"jingoist Japanese garbage.\" But then \"Snickering Fat Guy\" (ADV-turned-Sentai) licensed and dubbed this.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching 8 episodes of this on YouTube I can say that it had something going but decided to throw it away: Panty shots, maid ninja Hanzo, and schizophrenic moron/psychopath Jubei. Muneakira did have something going there at the start; being able to one-up Matabei, and keeping Sen and Yukimura from fighting... But he ended up as yet another loser who gets beaten up by the chicks for daring to have an \"unneeded harem.\"\\n\\n\r\nLook: I want Wayne LaPierre of NRA to suffer because he's an idiot for wanting to flood the streets with guns and have the gunmaking industry pocket the money at innocent people's expense. But creating someone to beat up because he's able to get more women than you ever will... DAMN!!

I also really liked the fact that Jubei had two personalities and at the beginning you thought they were opposite from each other butat the end they had a lot in conmen. \\n\\n\r\nI liked the art and sound but didn't love it but that might be because the videos i watched were bad quality. I think it's a bit to 'blurry' (That's not the right word for it but i can't think of the right word, but it is close) buy the sound was fine, nothing special really.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i did really enjoy it but the 'nude' scenes could be, well, scripted out i guess ;).

If the anime wasn't so short, and they focused on the plot more, this could have been an incredible anime that was very different from all of the other ecchi/harem anime. Overall, the plot was poorly executedand the comedy isn't all that great either.\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. The style has a nice look to it, and I particularly like the character design of the male protagonist. The background artwork looks like something you may see in an old Asian painting. The animation is smooth, and the few fight scenes that were there were pretty cool. The fact that they integrated ink splotches to make the anime seem like a painting was very nice. However, I feel like they over did it with the ink transitions; they happened way too frequently and kind of got annoying. The ink censorship was also very distracting in the censored version, but I watched the uncensored version so I didn't mind much.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThere was nothing particularly good or bad about the music in my opinion.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters were the basic characters you'd expect in a harem/battle anime. We have the oblivious, yet pure-hearted male. We have the super-smart loli female, arrogant yet beautiful female, cool headed female, masochistic female, annoying female that is unimportant, and an antagonist who treats his female partner like trash. We received barely any character development for any of these characters since there were so many to be introduced, so when love scenes started, they seemed a bit rushed.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEven though the love scenario was rushed, I still sort of enjoyed it, and the art was very nice to watch. The fan service may have been to much, though. I had a feeling the plot wasn't going to be performed as well as it had potential for while watching this series, but I still hoped that it would pick up, and it didn't. The end, like all of the other developments, was rushed. I still managed to enjoy it though.\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis anime wasn't very well executed in the story or character department, which is essential for a successful anime. The art was incredible, but it would have been nice to see more serious battle scenes rather than so much fan service. How can so many breasts be exposed so easily!? Either way, if you really enjoy ecchi anime, or nice artwork, and don't mind the bad characters and storyline, then you might want to give this one a try. Otherwise, this anime is just like every other harem/ecchi anime out there, and is not worth mentioning in particular.",

            "content": "It was another one of those days where I just felt like sitting back and watching people go nuts over each other for one reason or another. Unfortunately my cable was out and so I was stuck here lol. But seriously, I have been watching a lot of serious titles recently, including the new season of Samurai Jack. So i wanted to take a break and watch a light hearted rom-com. Seeing how this too was about samurais, I thought why not. So let's slice into this one.\r\nStory: 6\r\nI have to say, I barely recall the story from beginning to end. I remember the setup well enough but the details of each episode more or less are foggy. I can already see you going \"Duh, its a harem. The plot was going to be boring and forgettable from the start\". To you I say, yea I know. But I honestly tried to care. Set up wise, you have a guy who is called to an academy to help look into a string of disappearances but suddenly catches a girl who fell from the sky. When he catches her, she turns into what the story calls a \"master samurai\" and it turns out he has the power to make people (girls) into them. The story then put the investigation part on the sidelines and focused on what harems normally do, the girls. Like I said, this story isn't much that will stick with you. It does make headway in the end and does manage to have a conclusion. They also shoehorn a revival at the last minute. No dialogue, no build up, just boom..... alive.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 7 and 7\\n\r\nThis is one of those times where the artists said they wanted to have a unique theme and would never stray from it. They went for the brush painting look, which means that aside from the characters, the setting, transitions, and effects will look like they were done with a brush and ink. At first it will look cool and unique but believe me when I say it gets annoying. I ended up getting used to it, but still cringed when the scree would get splattered with ink when people powered up or landed blows. The sound good too. The opening was actually really catchy (and I listened to it the whole time I wrote this too lol). I had a really nice beat to it; I would probably pin that to the electronic bass. The ending is also a really cool track as well that I actually listened through to the end instead of just hopping to the next episode. Although, much like the story, I don't remember any memorable tracks that played during the episode. Voice acting was also pretty as nobody really sounded out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, let's open this bag and take in the smell of tsundere for a minute. Yea, a harem that used a different flavor of the same archetype. Before that let's talk main male lead. Our piece of Osmium (the densest element the naturally forms for you chemistry fact of the day) is Muneakira (yes I had to look up the spelling). He is a normal samurai who got roped into the role as piece of meat that girls seem to like. The guy at least knows how to fight, but ends up letting the girls do much of the work for him. Morally in the right place and emotionally hopeless. Although he at least admits he can't decide from them. Now for the fifty shades of tsundere. Well our first girl actually acts like a dimwit most of the time but she has a hidden tsundere who when in battle. The next girl is a smart tsundere whose ego for her brain is meant to cover her lack of features. The third is the tsundere childhood friend who can't help but continuously boss the lead around. It ends there for the fawning girls but there are other pieces of eye candy. The problem with these characters are that they only follow their archetype, which just gets old when they consist one type.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nIn a way, I could of just stopped watching this and not given a damn about the ending. Although, I stuck with it because there was still a story to follow, and it came through in the end. I probably won't rewatch this but considering how I forgot most of the plot by the time I wrote this, I may just rewatch it just to remember. All in all though, it was an alright show and left me with enough energy to watch season 2.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

            "content": "Samurai girls... I had never heard about this until I watched it, and DAMN was I happy with it. \r\nThis is a harem series as it follows our main male protagonist muneakira and the band of big-boobed, (with one exception) weapon-wielding girls that follow him around all the time. He appeals to everyone, be it; a princess, her archenemy, a few servants, and all the naked girls falling from the sky... Yes, naked women rain down on this guy all the damn time. After this I decided that I should move to wherever the hell this takes place, because the climate here sounds way moreawesome than where I live. \\n\r\nBack to the harem part, whats a good harem without high amounts of meaningless fanservice? This show is like tits en masse! Be it all the girls jumping in baths together, or just grabbin on each other all the time, or whippin em out for muneakira's sake there are enough titty flashes to sink a really big ship! \\n\r\nThe story kinda just floats along with the happy harem on one side, and the devious plot to fight an ancient enemy on the other. The nice thing with this show is that it doesnt wait until the last episode to do something, it actually gets some fights and shit going halfway through which as far as anime goes, is pretty good. The downside is that we hear samurai and we want some amazing fights, well thats not gonna happen here, we get some okay fights, and of couse a big showdown, but we have to remember that the main part of the story is going to be focused on the harem/ romance stuff.\\n\r\nThe art is pretty cool to me because it is actually quite simple but it looks so good at the same time.\\n\r\n The characters are all good, shallow perhaps, but c'mon its harem! all they have to to is have big jugs(with that one exception) and they're in!\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this alot, in fact once i finished, I immediately watched it again, and thats what you should take away from this.\\n\r\nAlso, I am a firm believer that a shows music can make or break it, and I loved the theme songs for this, they were fucking awesome!!\\n\r\nThis is all i have, if you like romance, tits, humor, more tits, and an interesting story this is definitely something you should consider watching.",

[/sarcasm]  The girls are obviously more powerful than the guy but they listen to them.  They like to be controlled by a powerful guy. Talk about a S&M relationship, and sadly not the hentai kind of S&M.  This anime hardly has nudity, and when you think might get to see something it is censored. \r\nOMG the stupid ink blob things that cover the screen can get very irritating.  I have to say that 70% of the time you seetons of ink blobs that cover about half the screen at times.  It is used for \\n\r\ncensorship and during fight scenes.  The FIGHT scenes....... I mean come on!  It may look cool to some of you but I think i completely gets in the way.  !@#$%^&* \\n\\n\r\nHonestly i can't give a good evaluation about the sound because I some times I needed to concentrate in order to read what people where saying and watching what was going on, or at least what I could see.  \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I can not figure out was the point of Jubei and Muneakira having the same surname.  What purpose did it really serve?  Maybe I just don't remember.  Then there is Matabei and Yukimura.  Both of them are the bad guys, or at least that is what it seems like when the show first starts.  Then all of a sudden they are not the bad guys.  Turns out the bad guy is really [Insert giant ink blob here]  \\n\\n\r\nDespite me saying a bunch a bad stuff about this anime I did like it, to a certain extent.  Otherwise I wouldn't have finished it.  Everything was just barley good enough for me to keep watching.  I do like anything with a little bit of ecchi, but that is just my personal taste.",

            "content": "At the beginning, Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls almost seems to know where it's going in terms of plot. Almost. A fascinating introduction informs us that this show will combine historical elements with fantasy and science fiction elements. Somehow, in this world of Zeppelins, DragonBall-style scouters, and bio genetic mutations, the Tokugawan Shogunate is in charge. And this re-imaged version of the Tokugawan Shogunate maintains its grip of power by utilizing attractive female super-warriors that it calls \"Master Samurai\". Now, this is all pretty far out there, but its also kind of cool, and after the first episode I was eager to see where they weregoing with it. The premise felt very promising.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe show becomes more and more complex, with naked Samurai-girls mysteriously descending from the sky, and angles relating to a government conspiracy unfolding. I don't shy away from complex stories, but its clear that they bit off more than they could chew with this one. As far as the romance goes, wait did i say romance? This isn't meant to be a sweeping love drama. It's a harem anime; you get your typical haphazard sexual tension with jealousy at first. It certainly never takes itself too seriously in this aspect, but as a result it's never particularly moving either.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n The Characters in Hyakka Ryouran are, as a rule of thumb, flat. Occasionally we'll get a flashback that attempts to inform us more of that characters resolve, but these flashbacks usually aren't very exciting or interesting and mostly forced and not properly integrated into the experience. Most of the characters don't even receive this treatment, and we are instead left with stock characters pasted into the story to fulfill their purpose. Among these are the hotheaded, pampered princess, Sen Tokugawa, the super genius-tsundere Yukimura Sanada, and the male character who does absolutely nothing but act as plot-glue for the girls, Muneakira. I don't want to give away spoilers, but you will see when you start watching it. What exactly is the MC's main role?\\n\\n\r\nThey are not, however, without their positive qualities. Aesthetically, almost all of the characters have an interesting design (at least the female ones.) And despite being generic, the characters aren't unlikable. Characters such as Yukimura fulfill an archetype that works; and it would take a person without a heart to hate the adorable Jyuubei. Aside from that though their really is nothing redeeming or inspiring bout the characters in this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis show's artistic style boiled down to one word: ink. This was never meant to be a series that looks \"normal\" like other animation. Character outlines here are strikingly bold, but the thickness of the lines vary as if it were done with a brush stroke. Backgrounds appear to have been painted in a similar way. It never looks bad, but it's also strange to see this application of style in an anime.  It appears more to be a style used in visual novels or video games. Still, it looks great when animated; screen captures do it little justice. Hyakka Ryouran's love affair with ink doesn't end with the character and background lines though. During battles, the ink blots actually splash off of the characters weapons onto the \"camera.\" During transitional screens, the ink blots are again prevalent. In fact, even the rain is drawn boldly in black, as if it were meant to be ink. Not even the opening and ending videos are spared the splatter. This effect is really incredible in episode one, but by episode twelve, it begins to feel really stale. They did something great, but they went back to the well too often with it. This is perhaps my personal most favorite aspect of the show, no joke. It reminds me of some video games like \"Okami\" or Muramasa the demon Blade's visual anesthetic art style.\\n\\n\r\nNow speaking of the music.  I will say that the opening song is what actually drew me to this show in the first place, the opening is very catchy and a great j-pop with a mix of rock in it. I truly enjoyed the opening and it even gave that unique artistic style in the first episode, the moment i watched the opening, i was drawn to the series. As far as the music in the series it self, it was pretty mediocre. The music did improve towards the end of the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\n The animation quality is high, and the visual effects look quite good. Unfortunately, none of the battles in the show have any punch to them. They feel as though just pretty pictures of still images on screen flashing back and forth during transitioning of scenes.\\n\\n\r\nI do want to say that one thing I found appealing was that the girls each have their own unique attacks which appear on the screen (written in ink of course.) I found this aspect kind of cool. I am not sure if different fansubs differ in that regards but i watched the Ryuumaru fansubs and each character, along with attacks had their own colored texts.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words\\n\r\nHonestly, if you've read this far you've probably already decided whether or not you're going to watch this show. It's an ecchi. If you're planning to watch it, it's for the blend of comedy and the fan service even though the comedy was not that hilarious to me. I had a few chuckles here and their but thats bout it. You're going to get all of the breasts shots, tits and even ass. Lots of soft core nudity as expected with most harems. Think about (Sekirei). If moments like that are what you're after, you won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, Hyakka Ryouran doesn't have much going for it, though. Everyone should watch at least one episode just to get a sense of the unique style, since it is something different, and it's something kind of cool. Ikki tousen ( I am taking bout the 1st season of course) came to mind well watching this, but as sup bar as ikki tousen is, i would say that ikki tousen does a more improved job of integrating the story and not just heavily focusing on ecchi as a primary core element of the series. Taking into account everything, else, story, plot, character development, i am going to say pass on this one.  Their are much better samurai girl anime's out their.",

            "content": "I liked the premise behind this anime especially the fact that it was set in an alternate Japan during the 21st century where the Tokugawa Shogunate is still in power instead of Imperial rule being restored.  I like how each character has a name that is related to actual people who existed in the past.  One thing about the anime I really enjoyed was the animations.  This is the first anime I have ever seen where the animations remind me of a manga, it is a very clever idea.  Although the story was clever I think they should have put moreof an emphasis on the main character I am referring the General.  Although his samurai\u2019s followed him without question I couldn\u2019t get over the fact that he seemed like he had no ability.  The anime shows a flash of his ability in the first episode which is what originally made me want to see this show; however, they really stopped developing him as a character as the show progressed.  The ending was spectacular but the finale left me quite angry and disappointed.  I do hear that there are some new ova\u2019s coming out though so maybe that will sooth the anger.  The show was good but could have been better and the ending was really good but hard for me to swallow.",

            "content": "This is a review of the censored TV version of the show:\r\nHyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls is another representative of a show that started with potential but failed due to bad direction. I'll state my main gripes first before stating the main aspects that were appealing. First off I'll say that if you seek echii content, this \"may\" be an ok anime to watch (which I'll explain later); if you seek story then you should turn to a different anime. \r\nThe story overall was pretty generic and in my opinion, was pretty forgettable for about half of the season. Hyakka Ryouran is a harem, and beinga harem, it suffered at multiple points. The whole general-sword master idea reeked of the near identical Ashkabi-Sekirei relationship which only stopped pissing me off when I realized there were no more new characters to be introduced. Character development was nothing special, I would say that the only thing that was different is that the male protagonist was not 'as' pitiful as other shows. My biggest pet peeve is probably the overuse of the ink blot effect. It could have been an extremely enjoyable effect but it ended up being the one thing I hated most since it was blatantly used to censor any nudity.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Hyakka Ryouran does have some nice artwork, not the \"best\" but pretty good. The art took on a sort of pastel look multiple times and at multiple times the animation was recognizably different from most animes, sort of how Bakemonogatari had a unique feel to it. If you take out the bad ink effects, the ink blot during the fight scenes really caught my eye in a good way. Also, I did like how the colors \"white\" and \"black\" didn't necessarily mean \"good\" and \"evil\". I said above that ecchi seekers may like this anime, which is true if you watch the uncensored DVD version. If you watch the censored for echiiness, you may notice the ink blots even more than I did, though it isn't to the degree of Seikon no Qwaser (which I did watch for echiness). I can't post my final positive since it may be considered a spoiler but its more on the lines of the lack there of than something that was in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI finished this anime with a feeling of disappointment and will be highly surprised if a sequel is made. Watch once if you're interested in some of the art concepts but don't get your hopes up for anything else. Rated '6' for fine",

            "content": "To be honest, I was deceived by popularity and great animation of this series. \r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026..\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nThere was nothing new about the story. A typical harem accompanied with gigantic bouncing boobs of girls who would always show it to the male lead. Harem type of story is one of my most hated genres of all. It is always about a boy who would be surrounded by so many girls and usually they are the ones who protect the boy. And the indecisiveness of the boy is another irritating thing. In this series, like always the boy needed physical contact with thefemale leads as so they can transform and power-up. And to make the complete clich\u00e9 of all, the girls were always doing lewd things or exposing themselves to the male lead. I mean come on! What is so amazing about a large number of girls fighting over one single guy? One of the irritating thing, the drama was too over-the-top. The dialogues were also so damn cheesy and too dramatic. It\u2019s not touching at all and worst, it became so irritating. The plot and storyline is not interesting at all. It\u2019s very much like, \u201cI\u2019ve seen that before\u201d . The main plot seemed very interesting at first but it was not realized at all until the series ended.  \\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nOf course, the characters were also too clich\u00e9. A guy so indecisive and so na\u00efve that he was easily manipulated. He was always protected by his samurai girls and he was supposedly an amazing person enough to be qualified as a general. I didn\u2019t felt his supposedly amazing character at all. All he did was shout some over dramatic lines whenever they are in pinch and that was it. And the girls are like always, would fight over him. They were complete with tsundere type girl, chivalrous girl, childish girl, and so on. Typical type of girls surrounding a male lead. All of them were not likeable at all. Almost all the character was so irritating at one point.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION\\n\r\nThe only thing that was amazing about this series was the animation. In fact, this was one of the reasons why I was interested in the first place. It was not just one of the best. You can even consider the animation of it as great or even better compared to some of the most famous animes of today. It was very original and such a refreshment. The illustrations and artworks were so brilliant. It was like a breath of fresh air from your typical animation. It made all the visual effects and fight scenes so magnificent. The characters and landscapes are made amazingly and very unique.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing for a viewer to feel is to wonder why they are even watching this thing! Having an amazing animation is definitely not enough. Ah! I\u2019ve done it again! I always do this. Thinking that because it is popular and have such an amazing animation, I would always expect an anime to be such an amazing one. I never learn. Lesson learned: Just because it is great for so many that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it will great for me as well.\\n",
