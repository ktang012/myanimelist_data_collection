            "content": "Since Rewrite is a visual novel by Key, a lot of people will compare it to the likes of Clannad, Angel Beats, Air Cannons, etc. But, I propose some new comparisons.\r\n1. Shitcom, because both are pretty shit comedies.\r\n2. The sensation of hitting your head against a brick wall for six hours.\r\nIf you enjoy either of these, then Rewrite might be the perfect show for you. Otherwise, I consider it one of the worst anime of 2016: a fucky jambalaya of overdesigned characters, dumb memes, and a plot that was probably written by someone putting a bunch of sticky notes on a dartboard and writing inwhatever they threw at.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I go on, let me just say that I don\u2019t give a flying fuck about how good the visual novel is or isn\u2019t. I don\u2019t care what purpose this anime serves to it, whether to be some sort of adaptation, if you can even call it that, or just a teaser meant to advertise it, whatever. I\u2019m just reviewing the anime the same way I review any other anime: like a little dickbag who isn\u2019t good at anything els--I mean, independent of any other source material. I did not at all write a Shokugeki review comparing it to the manga to contradict myself and then delete it out of embarrassment.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you\u2019re not very familiar with Key\u2019s works, here\u2019s how they generally go: The MC is an everyday normal guy with just enough wit to keep him from being 100% beta, but not enough substance to put him above the level of a general self-insert. He goes to a weird school filled with even weirder people (mostly overly-designed cutesy girls) with some maddeningly strange characteristics. Various shenanigans occur for a few episodes until the plot finally comes in, or maybe there\u2019s one to begin with but doesn\u2019t have much of a focus yet. \\n\\n\r\nIf you can\u2019t tell, I\u2019m not a fan of these Key guys who think it\u2019s funny to put their logo on every coffee can in every episode of every show. The way they tell their stories is very jarring because of their spontaneous, bombastic sense of humor. Half the time, I can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re trying to make a teenage melodrama, or if they\u2019re trying to make a dinnertime cartoon sitcom for dummies. It's an uncomfortable mixture of both, like ketchup and mac and cheese. Since they like to dick around with their storytelling, things can get rushed and/or confusing in the end.\\n\\n\r\nThese things are increased thousandfold in Rewrite.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no plot in Rewrite. None. It pretends to have one in the second half, but the \u201ctwist\u201d being that something is actually happening comes out so half-heartedly that the writers seem disappointed in themselves that they can\u2019t write in as many dank maymays into their show. Instead\u2026 eh. There are monsters, eh. People are fighting, eh. The world is gonna die, eh. FEECOF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whoops, there goes Rewrite being funny again xDDDD!\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t believe me? Here\u2019s part of MAL\u2019s synopsis, albeit fanmade by MAL Rewrite (that joke is funnier than anything else in this show): \\n\r\n\"Equipped with the superhuman ability to permanently rewrite any part of his body to multiply his strength or speed, Kotarou is naturally drawn to the supernatural.\"\\n\\n\r\nYou know when this Rewrite ability is shown for the first time? Episode fucking four. Not one. Four. And, as usual, the story just reveals it as if it\u2019s the most normal thing in the world. No prior hints for him having this power, no explanation as to how or why he has it, nothing. And that synopsis isn\u2019t even accurate, because it's not just about increasing strength. At one point, he \u201crewrites\u201d his body to resist poison. What else can he do? Resist age? Resist death? Become invisible? Triple the size of his dick? You know, that would be a good power to have in a massive waifu war such as Rewrite. I think there was a hugely missed opportunity here.\\n\\n\r\nOther people have powers too. Just because. And there are shitty CG monsters sometimes. Just because. Eh. It\u2019s all part of the hilariously goofy fun that is the Whatever Club at Whatever High School! \\n\\n\r\nThe real plot towards the end turns out to be some environmental awareness campaign. People are assholes and don\u2019t take care of the planet, so other people need to out-asshole them and activate a thing that will kill everyone so that the planet can live. I don\u2019t know how this is supposed to tie into the main character having the ability to theoretically give himself the neck of Alolan Exeggutor. Maybe there\u2019s a reason somewhere that I missed, but it\u2019s a little hard to follow along when the show tries to adapt every possible waifu route in the game while playing catch-up with the plot because that took forever to come in and now it needs to do 3,000 things at once if it wants to wrap up in time. Except the plot took so long to come in that I lost interest before it even happened. Maybe this show should\u2019ve had a rewrite, eh? Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh???\\n\\n\r\nAnd at the end of the day, what did this amount to? A dead end. Literally. The ending is not satisfying, as it\u2019s apparently just one route of many, leading me to wonder what the point of all of this even was. Was it to introduce the characters? Anything could\u2019ve done that within a couple episodes; to say an entire thirteen-episode season can be dedicated to that would be an outright lie. Is it to introduce the setting? Kazamatsuri has basically no focus at all. I know that it\u2019s a big place and kinda environmental-friendly. My fucking bedroom could've been a more interesting setting, because at least I have Big Order posters. Is it to explain the conflict of the show? Well, it only took them until at least six episodes for them to reveal that there was any conflict in the first place, so\u2026 no. It\u2019s all a bunch of mush, and I\u2019m not quoting whatever that pink sheep dog thing was. It tries to please both visual novel readers and newcomers by adapting the visual novel with an anime-original route that tells a complete story while also introducing a story. I don't even know what the fuck that means, but it failed at all of it.\\n\\n\r\nKey should just make their own Nichijou. A show where nothing happens, everything is stupid, and it\u2019s funny as hell. Make something like that to satisfy their own sense of humor, so that maybe they can tell a compelling story and find a way for someone to get attached to its characters beyond humorous interactions. Ha ha, Kagari likes coffee and calls it \"feecof\"!! What a deep character!!!\\n\r\nAs everyone will write in every review for every comedy anime in the world: comedy is subjective. Not everyone is going to love it or get it, so making the characters more like a bunch of running jokes in the midst of a deep melodrama might not be the best idea. When they fed me a character's sob story, my reaction wasn't \"Oh no, how sad! I'm emotionally invested now!\", it was \"Wait, I was supposed to take this seriously?\" The usual nonsense that follows a sad moment leads me to believe that I had the right idea.\\n\\n\r\nI can admit that the show was a little funny at times. It was. There was about\u2026 one gag per episode that got a laugh out of me. For about four episodes. Because within those first few episodes, I was still somewhat invested in the show. I thought everything would make sense in the end, that something was gonna happen at any moment that would tie everything together and make me believe the show was actually a work of genius. But then it never happened, and even still I was trapped, because I was at a point where I was in too far to pull out and cut my losses. I needed to see it to the end, so I could at least splash more salt than Arataka Reigen. Perhaps that was the point, just to lure everyone in and keep them thinking that, someday, it\u2019ll all come together and make sense, only for them to post a note at the end saying \u201clol fuk u idiot\u201d. If so, congrats Rewrite, Key, Studio 8bit, you totally PRANK\u2019D me bro!! XDDDDDdddeDdDdrefzdfxff\\n\\n\r\nAh, it\u2019s like someone probably once said, a good piece of entertainment is one that leaves the viewer thinking. Rewrite leaves me thinking that I should\u2019ve died in that car wreck I had last year. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know who the fuck this 8bit studio is, and given the art of this show and that their most popular work is Infinite Stratos, it seems I haven\u2019t missed out on anything. Rewrite looks terrible. Not even because of the mediocre studio, but even designs imported from the visual novel. Who in the name of Lady Gaga designed the school uniforms in this show? What kind of cruel monster would subjugate these poor girls to this kind of torture? They all have to wear these extremely overdesigned, uncomfortable-looking dresses with skirts and sleeves that you could drive a truck into despite the torso clinging to their tits like a wet washcloth. Isn\u2019t that nice? No, they don\u2019t look cute in the slightest, they look like they take a half-hour to actually put on. And I\u2019m sorry to disappoint everyone, but I\u2019m not really into fucking the wrappers of strawberry-and-creme hard candies. But, whatever fetish you relish.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is mediocre, which for the most part isn\u2019t a problem, but for some reason the anime becomes an action series with a bunch of fights, and then it\u2019s a problem. Even worse is that there are a bunch of weird supernatural beasts in the second half of the show, and while they have an interestingly jaded color scheme, they\u2019re done in really poor CG. At other times, it\u2019s inconsistent, such as the way they animate Kagari. Do her ribbons move around with a mind of their own, or don\u2019t they? I dunno, I guess whatever key animator 8bit hired for that episode gets to decide that. No particular positives about the art can make up for the big negatives; the only things possibly worth mentioning are that the OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s look surprisingly good, and that maybe the character designs are okay, but as you can expect from a visual novel full of girls, some of them are gonna look strange, like Shizuru and Kotori.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I should also mention some of the voice acting, because Hana Kanasamanawamallama voiced the main loli girl. Apparently that means it\u2019s good. Not really, because her role didn\u2019t have anything impressive about it, but at least her voice is nice to hear. Otherwise, the soundtrack was decent; it never felt spectacular and most of the time it was pretty average, but there were some good, emotional or light-hearted tracks here and there, especially when (and this is weird to say) Kotaro was about to grope Akane, they played the VN's OP. Nice. The OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s were all pretty decent as well, though not impressive either.\\n\\n\r\nDo I need to say anything else? Don't watch this anime, no matter what sort of relationship you have with the source material. This anime sucks. The story sucks. The idea of it sucks. The way it\u2019s told sucks. The people who are in it suck. Hell, the people that made it probably suck too. Maybe I\u2019ll join Gaia. Not because I care about the planet, but because, sometimes, I just feel that a lot of people dying would fix things. Kefka did nothing wrong. Get well soon, Maeda-san.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 1/10\\n\r\nArt - 3/10\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 2/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1/10\\n\r\nMemes - Aboutaslifelessasharambe/10\\n\r\nOverall - 1.25/10 (Range - 1-2)\\n\r\nFavorite episodes - 0\\n\r\nFavorite characters - Akane\u2019s Boobs\\n\r\nRecommendation level - no",

            "content": "Rewrite, one of Key\u2019s most prominent visual novels getting an anime adaptations? This almost feels surreal, right? I\u2019ll get straight to the point. While the idea of Rewrite finally getting an anime has been a dream for Key fans for many years, it may also be somewhat a tarnished reality as we realize what we\u2019re really getting. After finishing the show, it\u2019s more than just tarnished. Much more.\r\nOn paper, Rewrite follows a lot of standard Key formulas you\u2019ll recognize easily if you\u2019re already familiar with their work. The slow paced story from the beginning, generic character personalities, and supernatural phenomenon are just a few toname. However, one thing this adaptation didn\u2019t fully embrace is its ability to move the audience. What that literally means is its inability to make the viewers feel tearful unlike some other series. (ex. Clannad After Story) Some may question that it would be unfair to compare Rewrite to other Key\u2019s works but in reality, the adaptation really has more humor than it should.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first few episodes, we meet Kotarou Tennouji, the male protagonist. He gets involved with his school\u2019s Occult Club where we meet the other female characters. They range with different personalities and all more or less oddball characters at first. The real catch though is that they are also involved in some kind of darker plot that unfolds as the series progresses. But on paper, the first few episodes doesn\u2019t reveal much of itself as it tries to get viewers to familiarize with the franchise. In essence, the main female characters will likely be a hit or miss to get attached to. Most of them are stereotypes like the school council representative type or the redheaded tsundere. Meanwhile, the series does also introduce a mysterious character from Tennouji\u2019s dream, a young girl with ribbons that seemingly kills him. Perhaps this is where viewers will get intrigued by the show.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a standard viewpoint, the storytelling of the series bounces between acceptable and awful. There are some episodes that nails the coffin when it comes to creativity while others makes you feel like it\u2019s a forced chore to finish. As an anime original viewer, I confess that the show itself is underwhelming particular with characters such as Lucia. The way their own story is set up not only feels rushed but lacks concrete feelings. It\u2019s hard to feel what they are going through with the pacing especially from the buildup and ultimately doesn\u2019t really satisfy what its intentions were. On the other hand, some other background storytelling such as with Shizuru (the eye patch girl) feels it\u2019s done right because of the more tragic mood. Still, with the show being just 1-cour, you really shouldn\u2019t expect a full adaptation of each girl\u2019s story. In fact, this particular anime actually develops into a more mysterious plot that unfolds with connecting events. Unfortunately, the insert episodes of the girls\u2019 routes doesn\u2019t do much justice and weighs down the show overall.\\n\\n\r\nAs Rewrite retains a lot of comedy, there\u2019s also the mysteries that carries over the course of the show. I already mentioned about the strange ribbon girl from Tennouji\u2019s dreams. However, we also get the main setting that itself is a mystery. The series takes place Kazamatsuri and has quite a lot of hidden secrets, some that ventures into the supernatural realm. Being the curious guy that he is, Tennouji is drawn to these mysteries as he has a supernatural ability of his own. A major turning point revolves about the utopia-like environment and where all sorts of strange occurrences takes place. When one of the students at Tennouji\u2019s school goes missing, that\u2019s where we realize Rewrite can be darker than it seems. We are also introduced to factions that have conflicts with each other and some of the girls from the Occult Club are involved. Tennouji himself also begins to display inhuman talent with his own Rewrite ability. And finally, we also learn a lot more about the mysterious ribbon girl that appears in Tennouji\u2019s dream. It\u2019ll take patience for viewers to eventually get to the main meat of the plot and if you\u2019re the type that sees Key as an insufferable product, then this will be a hard show to follow.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps storytelling isn\u2019t just what Rewrite emphasizes on though. There\u2019s also relationships, connections that tries to be meaningful. Tennouji develops several important relationships with others including Lucia, Kotori, Kagari (the ribbon girl), among others. However, the show itself seems to focus on that mostly on the surface level. Because of time restraints, they aren\u2019t concretely developed as you\u2019ll anticipate. Oh and it\u2019s easy to forget about characters like Haruhiko when his role in the show seems to be mainly comic relief. And romance? That part is mostly teased at and hard to really appreciate if it\u2019s even there. At best, character relationships are subtly memorable but because of the mediocre buildup, they aren\u2019t very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio 8-bit, the show itself is underwhelming when it comes to visual quality. The characters look blend while it does retain Key style features such as the moe-eyes, feminine parts, and surreal-like atmosphere. However, the action is more of a disappointment. Well to be honest, the action was never a main attraction in the show anyway and the brief segments where we see that isn\u2019t so appealing either. There\u2019s not much fan service in the show except with the blushing and that one episode where Lucia puts on a maid outfit. Oh yes, a maid outfit.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, soundtrack for Rewrite is impressive. Well, not in the impressive that it\u2019s a masterpiece but definitely hits the key points. The theme songs offers choreography that fits the show quite right while the OST is mysterious as it should be. Even during comedic moments, the music seems to fall in place naturally. Furthermore, character voice expressions are well delivered if you compare to their characters from the VN. \\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, what should you really take for granted from Rewrite? It\u2019s pretty much a popcorn entertainment that\u2019s perhaps only easy to watch if you come with an open mind. For those with high expectations, it\u2019s probably a good idea to drop the show as it seems to appeal to a broader audience, beyond the visual novel fans. I think Rewrite tried to take a risk and although it partially succeeds, there\u2019s more failure. In the end, it\u2019s a nice show to pass time with for fun but not something to talk about for years to come. Oh and season 2 has been announced for the love of God, let\u2019s pray for a better sequel.\\n",

How? What?\", so that was the very weak point with this animation, maybe because the length of the visual novel, this story have so much to say, so transfer this to the animation was unsuccessful at certain grade.\\n\\n\r\nEven that it's a story that can be valuated well if you see it with calm, maybe if you get very confused and intrigued, you can awake the feeling to play the visual novel (like me).\\n\\n\r\nI think this is all, so be patient and play the VN, that a solution, if you reach this point and feel this review useful or only time lost, anyway thanks for read it all, happy anime and happy VNs, remember the other routes will be animated in 2017!!",

            "content": "Before starting the review I would like to say that I have read most part of the Visual Novel, and I love it, but I will not compare them and I will not argue about the number of episodes, because the review section is supposed to tell about the anime only, and why you should watch or not watch it according to my opinion.\r\nRewrite is set in the fictional city Kazamatsuri where treeplanting and afforestation have caused the city to become overgrown with trees and flowers in much the same way that other cities are filled by buildings. Tennouji Kotarou lives here. He's a highschool student who has the ability to rewrite his own body. He can become stronger and faster at any time he chooses. He investigates supernatural mysteries with five girls from his school.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the story very simplified, it doesn't really catch many attention by simply reading the synopsis, despite being much more complex than it seems.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is an action, comedy, romance and school genre, but why is harem not included here? Refering to the ANIME it really should be a harem genre, a guy staying with five girls in a club, getting along better with each one at each episode. As regards to the action genre I really think they tried to have many action scenes since the very beginning of the anime, which I think was not necessary, because if it followed a slower pace I'm pretty sure it would be way better than that, there's too many action and too many things happening, I mean, things happen too fast and sometimes you don't even know anymore what you are watching, I think the word that fits it better is: messy, I also saw many people saying that weren't understanding anything about the anime. About the Comedy in the anime, it's funny, not a anime that you will laugh every minute, not even every episode, just because it is not meant to be this way, so I really think it doesn't lack comedy at all, in other words, in my opinion the comedy was almost used in the right way, there are some scenes where comedy wasn't necessary, actually, it shouldn't be there. About the Romance, until now the romance was not very present, it just seems like a generic harem anime, not romantic, even the characters personalities seems like harem.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art of the anime tried to be the most moe as possible, all the girls were supposed to be cute, I don't think it fits the anime at all, it could be a lot better, but I didn't found it bad or ugly. It has some CG's, some of them were well made, but most of them weren't, I don't consider it unpleasant, maybe for the majority it can be, also some scenes I feel like the art is a bit bad, but it also has some scenes I found the art pretty, specifically at the beginning of the first episode only, to be honest, as the episodes went by I had the feeling the art worsened.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the sound, I think it's almost perfect, it fits with the scenes and they are very pleasant to hear, OP and ED are beautiful, also 2nd OP and ED are great, Koibumi from Yanagi Nagi and Sunbright by Ayaka Kitazawa are wonderful, I just think the musics were used in the wrong way or timing sometimes, that's why I wouldn't give it a 10 score.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters all of them are pretty funny in their own way, all of them have unique characteristics and personalities, although they seem like the same generic harem type of characters in the beggining, they are pretty well made and show their real selfs at some point.\\n\\n\r\nI can say I did enjoy it a lot, and also that I didn't, probably because I read the novel it disappointed me in some points, but it was so enjoyable to see some good scenes being animated, many action scenes, drama, some funny scenes and some romance aspects, although it really feels like just another harem action anime in the beginning. The anime has a fast pace and that's the bad point here, this \"original route\" was not bad, the way they adapted it to be a 13 episodes isn't bad, but the way the story was presented and how rushed it is, this is what makes it bad, also the original route is pretty much a mix of every route in Rewrite in a lighter version, when what's happening is \"too heavy\" it seems that they tried to break the ice making a comedy scene right after it, that's another bad point.\\n\\n\r\nA new season has already been announced, which I think is great, this entirely season seemed to be rushed and it really was. Anime-only viewers probably disliked it, also some people who read the novel too, they left so many things unexplained, but there's still hope for this, next season Moon and Terra routes will be adapted, so it will probably be more understandable for everyone and it's expected to be better adapted too. I'm looking forward for it and I hope everyone feels the same, I mean, this entire season feels like an introduction for the vast and complex story of rewrite, and probably everything will be much more clear after season two, and also depending on how good next season will be, people may change the opinion about this, unfortunately(or not) some people probably just won't watch next season.",

            "content": "A lot of anime each season tends to adapt material from a different medium. Manga, light novels, videogames, and sometimes even visual novels. Of all of them, a visual novel is arguably the hardest to adapt. Why, you ask? Since visual visuals novels tend to have branching narratives with multiple possible storylines and alternate endings, it\u2019s difficult to simply \u201cchoose\u201d one to adapt or adapt the \u201cright\u201d one and pull out a good anime from. \r\nDecisions made by the player during the game compound on top of one another and can eventually change which storypath the VN goes down and lead to an alternate ending.It\u2019s not uncommon for VNs to have well over 5 alternate endings, so when it comes to adapting it to anime, how does it actually work out? How do you adapt multiple story lines into one 13 or 26 episode anime? \\n\\n\r\nIn the case of Steins;Gate, studio White Fox decided to adapt a \u201ctrue ending\u201d route, which is the route that tied up the most loose ends and had the most satisfying ending. In the case of Fate/stay night, studio ufotable and studio DEEN both adapted two out of the three distinct routes from the original VN, and next year studio ufotable will adapt the final route in a trilogy of films titled \u201cHeaven\u2019s Feel\u201d. So when it comes to Rewrite, a commercially successful and critically acclaimed visual novel with around 5 distinctive routes, what does studio 8bit decide to do? Well of course, fuse half of them into one monumental mess!\\n\\n\r\nAdapting a VN is hard enough, so why does 8bit try and make it harder for themselves by blending multiple stories into one? The original alternate story lines are alternate for a reason; they are purposefully set as different playable routes for the player because of their distinctive nature. The main character, Kotarou, forms different and unique relationships with each of the supporting characters in their respective routes, so what happens when you blend half of them into one? Disharmony is what happens. Unevenness. Asymmetry. A narrative that isn\u2019t well-rounded nor that has a clear and defined goal is what is produced. I can say with sufficient surety that nobody watching Rewrite as it was airing (without prior knowledge from the visual novel) was able to understand what the main conflict or goal was that was present in the story. Studio 8bit\u2019s unreasonably resolute determination to adapt a careless fusion of routes spawns a monstrosity of an anime that forces its viewers into a submission of perplexity.\\n\\n\r\nRewrite\u2019s disjointed narrative overflows with a smorgasbord of elements that just don\u2019t click with one another. Slice of life moments, pseudo-harem elements, convoluted supernatural magic powers and giant CGI monsters that will more often that not leave you bewildered and lost rather than intrigued. The stakes are raised to unfathomably unreachable heights, but it is difficult to grasp them tightly enough to take seriously, what with all the convoluted magic stuff and the irrepressible escalation of \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe problems arisen from the show that materialize from its poor adaptation are mostly contained and limited to the first half, in which Kotarou forms and develops his relationships with the all-female supporting cast he\u2019s constantly surrounded by (hence, \u201cpseudo-harem elements\u201d). Originally, Kotarou is supposed to develop separate and unique relationships with all the girls individually, but since 8bit decided that \u201cjust didn\u2019t cut it\u201d, Kotarou insteads fleshes out relationships with only half of the cast. This results in back-to-back episodes expanding on Lucia and Shizuru\u2019s backstories (\u201csob stories\u201d would technically be the more accurate term) that collectively feel episodic in nature and superficial in execution. It\u2019s very obvious, almost as if explicitly implied, that the show just had to find a way to squeeze in these two character\u2019s backstories because those were part of the routes 8bit decided to fuse together. No real respect is offered towards the rest of the cast, they all feel like plot devices used to escalate the narrative towards the back stories of the two. This lack of authenticity makes the show and characters mechanical and robotic, the only characters that you can empathize with are the two the show force their backstories into. \\n\\n\r\nNow of course, the poor adaptation isn\u2019t to blame alone. The original narrative of the Rewrite visual novel has its fair share of innate problems that deserve a respectable portion of the blame as well. The narrative of Rewrite shifts its focus from cute girls, high school club goals, supposedly heart wrenching sob stories and then finally sets it sights on world destruction and human extinction. How can it all connect? Where is the delicacy in execution? Earlier I said the show had an irrepressible escalation of \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d moments. This isn\u2019t an escalation of say, running up a set of staircases dangerously fast like a frantic 10-year-old who\u2019s been suppressing his bladder all day; it\u2019s more like a clinically insane and frenetic individual rocket jumping from the CN tower to the moon, only because the moon \u201clooked cool\u201d. Shifting from cute girls doing cute things to a commentary on the nature of humanity and world destruction is already a pretty implausible change in tone, but actually not entirely impossible. \\n\r\nWhat Rewrite lacks is a sense of scale. It starts small, with a comfortable high school setting and fictional city within its reach, which disallows room for expansion of tackling immensely bigger topics and more impactful themes and premises; it started with a small scale, when it should have started with a large one and focused on a small part of it; It outlined and gave away little information, when it should have outlined a lot and gave only a small part of it. If it did those things it would transform its irrepressible escalation of \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d moments into an irrepressible escalation of \u201coh, that\u2019s how it connects. Awesome!\u201d moments. \\n\\n\r\nSo how could they have adapted it properly? While we\u2019re asking that question, let\u2019s go a little broader. How can an anime adapt its source material properly? Well, the answer is simple: with care. Just care. A little attention to detail here, a little improvisation there, and maybe, just maybe, they\u2019ll be able to translate a possibly great work into an equally great medium. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10 || Enjoyment 4/10\\n\\n\r\nAmongst many avid visual novel players unlike myself, Rewrite is beloved. Talked and praised about endlessly, news of its anime adaption left its near-obsessive fans with a bloated sense of ecstasy; just think, the joy of having something you truly love with all your heart being reshaped into the medium that you love just as much\u2026 It\u2019s an unfathomable state of euphoria, albeit if funnily enough trivial, that just can\u2019t be achieved by other things in life. Nothing else raises people\u2019s moods quite like that. There is a \u201cbut\u201d though, and it exists because of a studio\u2019s lack of care; not to say studio 8bit didn\u2019t necessarily care for the work, but more so the evident absence of care in execution that can be seen by anyone who\u2019s experienced both the visual novel and the anime adaptation. This execution that lacks finesse and charm unfortunately forces Rewrite to join its brothers and sisters in the collection of anime grouped as \u201cthe source material was much, much better.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was informative and helpful.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes I can't help but wonder why certain things have to be animated in the first place.\r\nAlready back when it was first announced that Rewrite was going to be adapted, I was getting some very mixed feelings. On one hand I was happy that one of my all-time favorite visual novels was finally getting an anime against my expectations, but on the other hand I also knew that making a good adaptation out of it would be incredibly difficult. This is partially because the visual novel is extraordinarily long and partially because all of its routes directly contradict each other and therefore wouldn't make muchsense in a linear medium like anime. So it's fair to say that I came into this with a fair amount of skepticism, especially considering that 8bit were the ones pulling the reigns: the same studio which had already completely destroyed another top rated visual novel two years earlier in Grisaia no Kajitsu.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as it turns out, I was right to be skeptical, albeit not quite for the reasons I initially expected. See, the main reason Kajitsu was butchered so hard was because it was unbelievably rushed: they tried to squeeze in a full 80-ish hour visual novel into 13 episodes, and unsurprisingly failed miserably at it, so I was expecting Rewrite to get roughly the same treatment. But as it turns out that wasn't quite the case, because this time around they decided that instead of trying to adapt an enormous amount of content in an impossibly small time frame, they made an anime original story instead. They tried to circumvent the problem by doing an original arc instead of adapting any of the routes of the game itself, which felt like a bit of a cop-out move to me, but given the circumstances it was probably the best thing they could have done. On paper that is.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem is, however, that this series doesn't actually function properly as an original anime. Why? Because if you're an anime-only viewer, the story makes absolutely no sense. For anyone that hasn't played the visual novel, you're most likely going to come out of this anime thinking \"wtf just happened\" more so than anything else. Basically what they've primarily done is taken certain snippets from Rewrite's various visual novel routes and put them all together into something new, but it just doesn't work out very well at all. It's like blindly taking out all the contents of your refrigerator and throwing them into a blender, and hoping that the resulting slurry turns out to be tasty (protip: it probably won't). There are so many characters that are just thrown into the show with barely any explanation whatsoever, so many plot twists that come across as pulled totally out of nowhere, so many underlying themes and deeper messages that will fly completely over anime-only viewers heads due to lacking proper exposition, and so many supposedly emotional scenes which wholly miss their mark partially because they feel spontaneous and unnatural, and partially because the show does almost nothing to make you empathize with its characters due to how little development they get. Also how they insist on using some of the amazingly beautiful soundtracks from the visual novel for a few such scenes feels almost insulting due to how low the actual emotional impact of the scene itself is compared to where those tracks were originally used in the game... it's like watching a death scene from Another set to the music of Continued Story: you just don't.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, despite supposedly being an anime original version, it's still part of the same complex universe that the visual novel routes play out in, and if you're an anime-only watcher it'll all be very confusing to watch not only because of how lightning fast the pacing is, but also because of how many scenes are omitted and how much information about the bigger picture of the world itself that you don't have. As I mentioned earlier, Rewrite is built upon having blatantly contradictory character routes which together create the overarching story as a whole. Everything is connected and part of a much greater picture. So when you're doing an anime original route instead, you can't really avoid having to leave a ton of loose ends open. As a result this is barely even watchable as an anime-only viewer, and even if you have played the visual novel it's still rather inexcusable. Yes, I might understand what is going on a lot more so than most viewers as a result, but it doesn't change the fact that the entire anime is a huge clusterfuck that doesn't even come remotely close to the level of the visual novel at any point. It just doesn't feel satisfying to watch at all, and constantly leaves you hanging with this feeling of \"what could have been\".\\n\\n\r\nThere are also certain plot points which are so obviously catered towards people familiar with the source material that they don't really function properly for those who aren't. For example, in the beginning of episode 8 there is a minute-long scene of a tiny rock floating through space at high velocity, eventually crashing through Earth's atmosphere and hitting Kagari right in the head. Evidentially it hit her head pretty badly because from that moment on, her personality makes a full 180, which has a rather drastic impact on the following turns of events. Now if you've played the visual novel you should be able to figure out how and why this happened as it's certainly not anything random, but for an anime-only viewer this plot point is completely absurd. A random tiny asteroid ending up hitting a girl's head as it crashes onto the planet, forever altering her personality? I mean it'll look like the most forced plot twist ever made if you don't know any better. Sure, after the upcoming second season (and yes that was announced at the end of episode 13) they should be able to piece it together as well, but the entire joke of the scene won't really work retroactively and it'll still come across as somewhat forced that way. I just can't help but feel like this is the wrong kind of execution to do when you make an anime original route, because again it pretty much assumes that the viewer has knowledge of latter events which at the current point in time only people who've read the visual novel will have. If this Kagari route had been part of the game, it'd probably have been pretty far down on the recommended route order chart; certainly not at the very top at least.\\n\\n\r\nNow I've seen some people argue that 8bit have still done a decent job under the circumstances considering that they had a basically impossible task to begin with, and while I do see what they're getting at (because let's face it, making a proper adaptation of Rewrite with this few episodes is a laughable idea regardless of who's pulling the strings), I can't really agree on it. While it is true that this anime was more or less doomed before it even started, there were definitely things they could have done a lot better. For example, episodes 4 & 5 were in my opinion a complete waste of time. What I was promised was an anime original story focusing on one of the girls that didn't have a normal route in the visual novel, Kagari, and nothing more. I wasn't exactly satisfied with that prospect but I could live with it given the lack of realistic options. But despite that they still insist on spending entire episodes solely on going into the backstories of some of the other heroines in an incredibly rushed manner of fashion that not only felt extremely unsatisfying on their own due to the terrible pacing, but also it has almost nothing to do with the anime original route itself. So why even adapt it? Like you either adapt a route properly or not at all, don't just throw in abridged versions of them out of nowhere just because you can, geez. In the first place, what's the point of teasing so much about the other girls when you're not ever going to follow up on it and properly show the full picture of what the truth behind them is? To tease people into buying the game I guess? Perhaps even more importantly though, by doing this you're taking away precious screen time that could have actually been spent on developing this original arc you're so insistent on doing. Like if there's one thing which you should never end up having pacing issues with, it's an original anime. I mean the entire scenario script is supposed to be written from scratch specifically to fit the episode count damn it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I found really disappointing is how incredibly casual the anime is about revealing the supernatural. In the visual novel you don't even find undeniable evidence that there even is anything supernatural until the end of the common route (adapted in episode 7 in a different version), which is almost 20 hours into it. Yes, you know Kotarou can rewrite himself, and yes, you encounter ominous-looking black dogs in the forest and the city at night as well as numerous suspicious people, but that's about it. Then when the actual reveal comes, it hits you like a hammer with how dramatic the tone shift is. The early part of Rewrite is supposed to be school/comedy/mystery, and then in the actual character routes it transforms into action/drama/supernatural. But in the anime, they've kind of just... jumbled everything together. Kotarou is like yeah I have a super power, Shizuru casually reveals hers without much explanation provided, and when Kotarou is given his \"claws\" then you're just going to have to accept what you're watching because the anime sure isn't planning on explaining where they came from anytime soon, etcetera. It all feels very mish-mashed without any clear direction, almost as if they did everything in the wrong order. I don't know, making a good anime out of Rewrite with such a tight schedule is probably impossible no matter what you do; even an original route like this doesn't really work because the world itself is far too complex for you to be able to make a satisfying standalone arc without it becoming entangled in the \"real\" story of Rewrite in some way, causing a ton of loose ends that will never be able to followed up upon. It only forces 8bit to include a bunch of scenes they seriously shouldn't, wasting even more of what little precious screen time they have at their disposal. It's no wonder the pacing is so all over the place. On top of that the anime also has some incredibly awkward usage of CGI for all the various types of familiars it contains, so the action scenes aren't exactly a pleasure to look at either. Hell, even the regular 2D art really dips in quality every so often, especially in the last few episodes of the show. It felt like they were having some serious budget issues here, and as a result there were a lot more derp faces than I would have liked.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters goes, I'm also pretty disappointed. I actually consider the visual novel's character cast to be in my top 5 even to this day, due to its diversity, great character development on many different fronts, and for just being plain entertaining in general. But the anime does... basically nothing to showcase either of these things. First and foremost, there are simply way too many characters in Rewrite for such a short anime to support. It's a very complex universe including multiple factions, people with drastically different ideals and goals, driven by their own respective backstories, etcetera. There just isn't anywhere near enough time to explain who they all are and what their purposes in the story really are. Especially considering that (you guessed it) for many of them, said explanations are provided deeper into the various heroine routes of the game, and they're not just something you can throw out at a moment's notice. In other words they really never had a chance to be anything more than random supporting characters in the anime because the script doesn't permit their characters to ever be properly explained or developed. Maybe you should have thought about that before you decided to go full anime original? And this is just talking about the supporting cast; if we talk about the actual main characters here then it's obviously even worse because all the original main heroines (Kotori/Chihaya/Lucia/Shizuru/Akane) just come across as random harem members in the anime as none of them get any proper characterization to speak of at all. Why? Well... because their routes aren't adapted. It all keeps coming back to that, doesn't it? Even Kotarou suffers from this because he's supposed to grow in those arcs as well.\\n\\n\r\nSooo I don't know, I don't straight-up hate the show but I just can't help but feel that it's so pointless. If you've played the visual novel, the anime feels like a massive downgrade in comparison, and if you haven't played it then you'll be missing out on so much that it'll barely be comprehensible due to how confusing the story will be, how much content is cut out and how rushed it is. So what is the target demographic supposed to be? No one can say they're truly 100% happy with this anime. At least on that front it's certainly no different from Kajitsu.\\n\\n\r\nI think the obvious yet unfortunate truth here is that the whole point of this anime is nothing more than to be an advertisement for the Rewrite+ release of the visual novel, which is a new version released on July 29th in Japan this year, I.E: shortly after the anime started airing. It contains new CGs, more voice acting, slight scenario revisions, etcetera. For a long time I was also under the impression that this release was going to contain the new Kagari route as well in visual novel format, but as it turns out that's actually not the case. It doesn't really seem to contain any noteworthy new story content at all. So my hypothesis is that the release of Rewrite+ in combination with this original anime is nothing more than a marketing ploy, where people who have no prior experience with the franchise will get a first-time introduction to it through the anime and get interested enough to at least be willing to purchase the game. Then of course since Rewrite+ has just been released recently, which sounds like a much cooler version than the original for people not knowing any better, those new fans will throw their money at the much more expensive \"new\" game instead of the cheaper \"old\" Rewrite from 2011. Again, this is just my theory but honestly it's the only idea I can come up with that can financially justify re-releasing a game 5 years later with hardly any noteworthy changes made, as well as simultaneously making an awful anime adaptation of the same game that is neither satisfying for old fans of the games nor anime-only watchers.\\n\\n\r\nSo with that said, in the end... I can't help but feel like this anime is meaningless, or at least it'll only function as a sales booster for the new game release, which is nice for the creators I guess but that doesn't actually make the anime itself any better for me personally, nor should it for any other viewers of it.\\n\\n\r\nIt has to be said though that if we ignore this show's origins for a second and just look at it as any other anime among the thousands of others out there, then it's not the worst thing I've ever seen, far from it, but it'd probably be something most people would forget about almost completely within a day or two of finishing it. However, we can't avert our eyes from the truth that much, and the fact of the matter is that this is supposed to be a representation of one of Key's three biggest visual novels, alongside Clannad and Little Busters. Personally I'd even say Rewrite is the best of them all; I played all three of them back-to-back way back in the beginning of 2013, and at least for a short time afterwards I actually considered Rewrite to be my favorite visual novel. It might not have maintained that spot for too long but either way the point is that... it just deserves better than this. Yes, I've known ever since the day I finished the game that making a proper adaptation of Rewrite was probably impossible no matter what, but I was still hoping for a lot better than what this anime gave us. At the very least it should have gotten more episodes than this; Clannad got 4-cours and Little Busters got 3, why is Rewrite stuck with merely 2? If anything this is the one which needed the most episodes out of the trio since it has a lot less content that can be omitted. Realistically speaking 4 cours would probably have been the optimal pacing-wise given the length of the game. But I guess that's just the world we live in nowadays: anime are mostly produced in order to promote their source materials and boost the sales of those, and as a result we very rarely see shows with more than 2 cours anymore. For a lot of series that's totally fine and all, but for ones with very long source materials like this, it's basically a killing blow, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least though, as mentioned previously we are at least getting a second season for Winter 2017 (so it's a split cour), and this is giving me a certain feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. See, as badly as 8bit destroyed Grisaia no Kajitsu two years ago, they actually did a very respectable job with its sequels, Meikyuu and Rakuen, and the main reason for that was simply that the sequels are way shorter to begin with and thus much easier to adapt since they didn't have to rush them so badly, unlike with Kajitsu. And I feel like the same thing could very well happen with Rewrite. In case you don't know, the visual novel has one route for each of the main heroines (Kotori/Chihaya/Lucia/Shizuru/Akane) and then a two-part True route at the end, with the first part being called Moon and the second part being called Terra. Now in the anime they've basically replaced the five girls' routes with this original Kagari route, and the upcoming second season will adapt Moon and Terra. In other words the second season should actually not be anime original, unlike this one. There will probably be minor changes in order to accommodate for everything they've done in the first season, but for the most part I reckon it should be pretty much the same as in the game. And above all, just Moon and Terra on their own should actually be doable in 1 cour, so we might actually have acceptable pacing next time around as well. With all that being taken into account, it could actually turn out to be a pretty good anime. The downside is of course that we seriously lack proper buildup for it since none of the heroine routes were adapted first, so I'm not sure how everything will turn out in the end regardless. But I think it at least has decent potential to come out alright for those who are already familiar with those routes, I.E: those who have played the visual novel first. And for those who haven't... maybe, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, given how unsatisfying this first season has been on its own it can only go upwards from here. Let's hope the second time's the charm in this case. Then again I know better than to expect much from 8bit no matter what by now, so I won't get my hopes up too high just yet.",

Unless you're one of the bizarre new race of try-hard anime critics who couldn't judge something well or properly if their lives depended on it, you will enjoy this anime.\r\nI have a strong feeling season 2 is much better, just given that they decided to adapt a specific route from the Rewrite VN, andseason 2's is more interesting. But still season 1 did a solid job. I don't really have any complaints really.\\n\\n\r\nObviously this isn't a proper review, it was just disgusting seeing the review section of this anime being such a horrid garbage fire. Really i'm sure most intelligent anime fans don't actually read the reviews on this site, since within 2 sentences you can already tell it's just complete trash. But for any that stumble on this review with the thought of not watching the anime because of what others have said, give it a shot. Just do it. It's only a 13 episode anime anyway.",

            "content": "Well well well, Romeo Tanaka. We meet again. It hasn't even been a year since I reviewed that last atrocity with your name on it, and now you're teaming up with a company that people only remember at this point because After Story still ranks high on MAL after all this time in order to get recognized by anime fans who will never play your supposed masterpiece Cross Channel, and thus will only remember you as the guy who made Humanity Has Declined and a load of shit that no one cares about. I sympathize with you. I really do. The anime industry is afucked up place that holds back actual talent. We all know that by now.\\n\\n\r\nBut like the people who okayed that godawful Ratchet & Clank movie, you've got to ask yourself this: is having an anime adaptation of your work really the ultimate prize it's all cracked up to be? Don't you realize by now that you work in a video game industry, and thus are inherently incompatible with an entertainment medium that the viewer can't physically interact with? Don't you realize that for ever Steins;Gate and Madoka Magica that ends up making it big, there are fifty World Conquest Zvezda Plots, Robotics;Notes, and Classroom Crises. And assuming you do know this, don't you know that teaming up with fucking 8-bit is considered a mistake in every sense of the word? I mean who even remember what anime they made? Oh right, these are the guys who made Grisaia. And yet somehow, even when you're working with them, they end up creating a product several times worse to the point that I could have done better.\\n\\n\r\nYou'd think I'd have spent all my outrage regarding Rewrite after the last post I wrote about it and you'd be mostly right, but the thing about this show is that it's my favorite kind of bad to review on the grounds that it fucks up so royally that you could write more essays about what it does wrong than you can about the many interpretations of Utena. It's not bad in that \"incredibly lackluster to the point that I can't even remember what it is I'm supposed to be complaining about\" that characterized the last few shows I reviewed. This is straight up \"I see how this could have been better if it was handled by people with actual talent, or at least a chimpanzee\" bad. And even when I'm being calm about it, there's so many words dripping with unsubtle bile I can write about the product that I can actually cause some impact on the industry by making the producers lose even less money than they already have. Hell, I've already written quite a bit and I haven't even actually started describing Rewrite as of yet. Girls Beyond the Wasteland wishes it could have fucked up as much as this.\\n\\n\r\nRewrite is an anime about a young boy named Kotarou Tennouji, living all by himself (of course) in the incredibly environmental-friendly town of Kazamatsuri. A town which houses a bunch of mysterious secrets such as dodgy CG crabs and annoying fairy creatures that our git of a main lead just has to discover the truth about, so he ends up joining an occult club and recruits members to help him out that all happen to be female and only two of them at best exist for the sake of more than just fetish fuel. Of course, in this show's defense, there is some semblance of a reason for his decision to only invite girls to hang out with him on one of his nature walks whilst ignoring the one male dude who he antagonizes more than Bugs Bunny did to any of the other Looney Toons. It's because he's a grade-A pervert who thinks sexually harassing his friends and touching their boobs is a charm point. Hey, I didn't say the reason wasn't \"pants-on-head\"levels of retarded.\\n\\n\r\nBut as is usual for visual novel anime, this is all just a smoke-screen for some upcoming serious plot that the writers seem to think would be a good idea to wait until halfway through the show to introduce for some reason, and in Rewrite's case, it turns out that Kotarou's friends actually belong to secret government organizations that are in conflict with each other because one side wants to destroy the world in order for it to be birthed anew and the other side wants to protect humanity even though said world is a morbid state of affairs where humans can kill trees without any repercussions. Yes, the plot is basically X/1999 if you replaced all the pretentiously cool CLAMP characters with little girls who would rather drink tea and bathe in hot springs than actually do something interesting. And yes those are your eyes that just rolled on the floor right now, because your mind can't comprehend how fucking retardedly mismatched the two plotlines are. I mean what's next? Harem school club anime that suddenly turns into Breaking Bad?\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly though, Rewrite does lean heavily on one of its mismatched sides to the point that the other one doesn't cause much interference. It's just too bad that said side is the banal school life side where nothing interesting ever happens and there's no drive to events other than curious retardation. Yeah, remember how I said before that I hate most visual novel anime (and most anime in general for that matter) because for some reason people can't get it into their heads that \"comedic episodes and light conflicts that solely exist to build up the world and the characters so that when the true dramatic story hits, it's all the more effective\" is an absolutely awful concept that no one with a brain would possibly enjoy, let alone prefer to just \"starting the dramatic story at the very start\"? Well generally, these sorts of shows stop with their inane prologues by the halfway point, but Romeo Tanaka adaptations just can't seem to grasp the definition of the word \"stop\". It takes more than three quarters of the runtime for both Girls Beyond the Wasteland and Rewrite to get something even approaching an ongoing plot, and even then the latter seems to think that it can take a break and let girls relax in hot springs as a sort of reward for all the action that occurred previously, even though said action is only a minor skirmish against a twat that looked awful and no lasting impact because apparently stab wounds are easier to recover from than paper cuts.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is just littered with every bad adaptation choice you could possibly make when adapting an interactive non-linear product to a non-interactive linear world to the point that it feels like we're living in that shitty visual novel adaptation phase of anime again. Do you remember how one of my big complaints about Charlotte was that it had a severe lack of drama when it was desperately needed? Well it seems Rewrite misinterpreted the complaints people have made about Key products being overly manipulative even harder and decided to only give service to the company's token melodrama in the worst way possible. There's only two episodes that try to tug at the viewer's heartstrings and of course, it'd be directed towards the two girls with no plot-importance whatsoever, as well as being fucking botched to boot.\\n\\n\r\nJust as an example, one of the episodes in the first half of the show is centered on the purple-haired girl, Lucia, and plays out like a bad horror story with its poorly directed attempts to be creepy that end with Kotarou discovering it was her who was causing all the strange things to happen because she has the ability to poison anything she touches thank to experiments done on her. Said episode ends with her throwing a hissy fit, accidentally poisoning Kotarou, him fixing himself up, revealing that she works for a secret organization, and then happy school life continues again in the very next episode. Excuse me Rewrite for not having the tear ducts required to appreciate sadness caused by \"magic\" that has never been foreshadowed until now, has no impact on the story beyond a few plot points that you could have conveyed better by shooting someone, doesn't further anyone's characterization, and indeed is never brought up again after it's told!\\n\\n\r\nI could go on listing all the bad adaptation decisions...so let's continue, shall we? The animation is uglier than Andrew Lloyd Webber, looking like one of those crappy flash animated shows from the early 2000s with the shining buffed up a bit. And that's not even getting into the 3D animation for the monsters in this show, which looks so retarded and clashes so badly with the backgrounds that Polygon Pictures themselves would have fired the people working on it. And even by visual novel standards, the characters are just completely unlikable. Kotarou basically bullies and sexually harasses his friends for no reason, constantly begging to touch their breasts even during serious moments to the point that you sympathize with Lucia in regards to wanting to murder the bastard. But for some reason, the girls still hang out with him like the moe tsundere sycophants they are. Even dressing into cat-eared maid costumes at his request because apparently we're living in an age where people still think it was funny when Higurashi did this. It's like someone took a bunch of dating sim stereotypes, tacked on an arbitrary twist to each of them, and then beat them over the head with a crowbar that was made out of concentrated STUPID.\\n\\n\r\nFinally there's the ending, which is both the best part of the show in how laughably terrible it was in a \"I can't believe you did that\" kind of way, as well as the worst part of the show because you couldn't believe they actually did that. To those who played the visual novel, remember how every single girl's route would end with the world getting fucked? Well instead of using one of those endings to cap things off, the producers decided to go a bit more original...by ripping off Evangelion like every other anime under the sun. One of the girls performs a ritual that kills off every human being on the planet and turns them into glowing orbs so that our plant life sovereign can reign supreme in a manner that would make Poison Ivy blush. No, I am not kidding. That is actually what happens, and before you guys start thinking \"hey, that actually sounds pretty awesome\", note that a sequel adapting the true route that will no doubt retcon the ending harder than Aldnoah Zero did after its three-month break is coming out next season because the creators were so confident that die-hard fans would want it after sitting through this misery. Starting right at the end of this sentence, you have one second to name a single anime where keeping the prologue and the actual meat of the story divided into two distinct series was a good idea. Time's up. That's what I thought.\\n\\n\r\nI am not exaggerating when I say there is literally no audience for this show at all. If you're a fan of the visual novel, you'll be turned off by the insipid adaptation choices that basically scream \"fuck it, if they paid full price for that Little Busters anime, they'll pay full price for this\". And if you're not a fan, you'd be clawing your eyes out at the complete lack of fun on screen assuming you can work up the interest necessary to acknowledge Rewrite's existence in the first place. I don't know how well the blu-rays sold, but the number can't be high. I mean we're living in an age where the fujoshi market makes up the numbers now and Rewrite definitely doesn't have much in the way of manservice for fangirls to slobber over. The only people I can possibly see enjoying this show are those with a lead pipe shoved in your brain's front lobe, and if that's the case, it'd be cheaper and more exciting to just shove poo down the pipe's hole.",

            "content": "The idea of having an anime original content is something that can be rather double-edged when it comes to adaptations. It can either be something that can go and help with the narrative point of view of the series, or it can make things easier for the series in question for certain reasons. \r\nFor Rewrite's case however, where does it stand around with this? ever since they made the announcement of the anime series coming around, they did announced the staff members, mainly the director being Motoki Tanaka (aka the director behind series such as Kiniro Misaic and the Grisaia series) along with the additionof them making an anime original route, in order for \"make people understand this easier\" to say the least around. The idea itself doesn't sound bad on paper due to the circumstances of the original Visual Novel, but where does it really lead up to? We'll find out, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you my anime review of Rewrite.\\n\\n\r\nPlease before you continue with this review, I might tell you guys some warnings throughout here. The first warning is that yes, I will spoil some plot points in order to make my point across on my opinion of the anime overall, that also includes things that are connected to the original source material in order to justify my reasons for the negatives and the positives.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing is that if you disagree with this review, that's completely fine, everyone has their own personal opinion on shows so that's something I can understand on that. Without further ado, let's begin:\\n\\n\r\nStory:  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in a place called Kazamatsuri, the beautiful home of our Main Protagonist, Tennouji Kotarou. Our main protagonist has this ability, which he gets drawn around in the Supernatural Phenomenon, and one day he meets up with the Occult Club President, Akane Senri, as then, Kotarou would start recruiting new members to the club, and usually living the daily life being in there, until certain moments happens within the series where it changes their paths forever.\\n\\n\r\nNow you see, the thing about this series is that I have a lot of mixed feelings towards it, so of course this might go a bit confusing but I'll try to keep it simple, or at least attempt to. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, for the first half it did a decent job at a lot of things more than the wrong, just because for one, I believe it did a decent job at condensing the amount of hours because if they extended the dialogue a lot, at the same time dragging this for the period of time (lets say focusing this on an entire season of sorts) a lot of people would get bored of it, and it would basically become a chore to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI think while having a good concept as how Rewrite just showed, it shouldn't be dragged out a lot because it then becomes rather slow and at the same time it would bore the person, probably. If I was the one watching this and then for example I haven't read the source, depending, I would feel tiring and before we even get there I might have fallen asleep with it.\\n\\n\r\nIn a sense, Rewrite's anime did a pretty good job at that and condensing the Slice of Life aspects through.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the second thing that I give props to the anime is basically some of the anime original jokes which are for example the Fart joke from one of the first few episodes (I'm not gonna lie I did laughed at that) as well with few references in the middle parts of the first half. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the episodes that were focused around the characters were done decently, and for example Shizuru's Beginning of her route or, her route taken place in Common still, it was done pretty nicely and it was condensed pretty alright, and as a standalone it was pretty good because it gives a solid background to her story. I give props to the anime at that stance for it.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the first half's downsides are a few things that I got in mind:\\n\\n\r\n- Some of the Original Things that they added don't really add much in the end (which I will explain later on in the problems of the second half)\\n\\n\r\n- Lucia's Route (which was taken 2 weeks before the certain event happens) was probably the worst contender of this first part, the reason why I say this it's because the way they condensed it didn't really helped in their favour, in fact, compared to Shizuru's Route which was done rather nicely since the pacing was good and slow, this one felt abrupt. \\n\\n\r\nIt seemed like they immediately forgot how to pace out the moments for the route and this doesn't even take 1 episode, it would most likely take 2 for at least to cover part of her story, and even the shifting of events are pretty weird placed because in one moment for example, Lucia and Kotarou were in the room talking and revealing her curse, and then the next moment we're at the church right now. I don't think that's a good transition at all in all honesty. \\n\\n\r\nIt's basically like moving from my own house having a happy and jolly time, towards a sad scene where a friend of mine died, there's no actual in between for the scenes and it just feels and looks awkward and it makes a lot of people question what the fuck happened between the time gap between those two scenarios. Compared to how they handled Shizuru's ending point, this one felt like a poorly written and executed route, and well I'd say before anyone goes and argues about the 2 other parts, that's not really needed for certain reasons, at the end, point being, is that the way they handled Lucia's first half of her end was pretty weak by comparison.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while I don't think this is the worst part of the show, it is quite disappointing how they handled her this way, and it's because of the amount of time that first half takes for her end, which actually left me on a mixed bagged feelings about it. It is probably the worst part about the first half.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as for the second half this is probably the big mix, and this is where I will point out something. The idea of an anime original route is NOT a bad idea on paper, the reason why I'm saying that the idea isn't bad in the case it is because in the original Visual Novel, it is quite difficult to adapt different plotlines in which, will connect to the second season, and also, it takes a lot of episodes' worth to even focus on all of those things including certain plot points to where it connects to the true routes, so they wanted to take the easier approach to do an anime original \"6th Route\" which was supposed to be focused around Kagari. The BIG problem with the second half are basically these:\\n\\n\r\n- Remember when I said that some of the stuff that they added in the first half didn't helped much? Well, in the second half they pretty much made most of it rather pointless. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, in one of the first half episodes they introduced Midou, which is one of the major characters of the series that goes around in the second half. In the second half however, in my eyes they treated him pretty much like fodder, in which they literally gave no actual background to him to know him as a character, and in the next episodes, they pretty much decided to pull a middle finger and just take him off. I feel like this is one of the major problems of the show which kinda sours me.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing that comes around is Lucia, and remember when I said that her route was pretty much condensed only for the first half? I wouldn't really mind this, as apparently she was supposed to play a major role in the second half. \\n\\n\r\nGuess what happens? She pretty much looks even more useless in the second half. The problem I have with this for her is that, in one of the episodes she was pretty much fighting against Midou, and in that episode they pretty much gave some sort of point where she would want to protect Kotarou and everyone else, and that in itself would have been a great thing in some way because it then brings a bit of reality towards Kotarou and to how he was going to go and shake things off, basically to try to explain it more shortly, in that episode, they could pretty much bring a bigger impact towards the characters. \\n\\n\r\nBut then what happens? She survives, but not only that, right? Where is her actual role around here? If the role was pretty much go and Pretend to be dead then that's just actually pointless, it takes away a lot of the tension and possible buildup towards the show and it's even worse when you don't really utilize her further. I wouldn't even mind if she was alive as long as they could make her role useful, or at least position. In the end that's probably another sour moment throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that I need to point out is that, the series isn't really well explained, further into it, there's a main conflict within the series which, the anime really never have made it cleared for those that are anime onlies, and only those that knows about the Original Source would know what it is, and that in itself is bad because it then would either cause confusion or when they watch the second season, it will pretty much be difficult for them to understand, and only those that have read it would probably try to explain it. Because of this, its really hard to get the message across for my perspective.\\n\\n\r\nLastly and not only... the amount of repetitive, and forced comedy. This is probably the biggest issue around the entire Original Route, and this is pretty much where I would have to explain a bit into it. I wouldn't mind the comedy in this route, if they didn't repeat the same joke over, and over, and over, and over, about the Fee Coffee and then the Boob grabbing, and the boob grabbing is the lesser thing that bugged me. But, repeating the same comedy skit again and again doesn't make it more funny, it makes it even more boring, and worse, it takes away the tension from the certain situations as well. And only few episodes worked well with the comedy skit, at least the Fee Coffee wise. It was only on the first few episodes of the second half, and those were actually funny because they weren't recycled, but when you constantly use it, over and over, it wouldn't help much and it will feel like the audience will have a major headache out of it.\\n\\n\r\nThis all causes the majority of the execution to fall poor and very flat, the idea in itself for the original route isn't bad, the problem comes from how it was executed majority of the time in there. It doesn't help the series in itself to make things easier at most, in fact it hurts the series because there's no clarification, lack of consistency and a lack of explanation at a lot of cases, including the pacing in itself. Those are my major complaints around the second half from a perspective.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there were very much a lot of downs, I do will give it where it's due with the second half and one of the things that I will give towards it, it's around one of the messages that the anime displayed it easier, which was basically the sense of not wanting to be in this fate, and they would want to be normal. That's basically one of the messages that the Original VN has, but it really hasn't been that noticeable, and as much as the story did wrong in this half, it did that thing right in its own.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I will give credit to the second half is the ending itself, as it was a decent buildup towards the second season, which is coming around pretty soon. The ending pretty much ended as I expected it to be, with then hinting the scene with Kagari at the end, which hoping the second season does justice on the manner.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think Rewrite's story in this anime is pretty mediocre overall, it started off decently with minor issues within the show, but the second half was pretty much a middle finger and giving more wrong than right, in the end cause a lot of inconsistency, explanation and clarification throughout, which will be hard to understand in the runtime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThis is pretty much another thing that falls around flat and poor a bit. The problem with this as well is that majority of the characters in Rewrite's anime had either their backstories skipped (for example Chihaya's) towards being butchered or just poorly executed, to be frankly honest. \\n\\n\r\nMajority of the cast lacked any further background and were given little snippets of their backstories, and the only backstory that was handled decently was Shizuru's. \\n\\n\r\nDespite how everyone or a lot of people says that her route was rushed in the past, it was well paced by comparison, given to how short that section of her route was and second, the way they utilized it was pretty much more of an opening connection towards Kotarou as a character and for Shizuru as well, and at least it did something very decently over there on the manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters barely had any clarification towards their backstories (exception of Kotarou for reasons), a lot of them are either unexplained, have been explained but poorly executed, have been explained but finely executed, but somehow wasn't of any much of use, etc. \\n\\n\r\nIt all depends around which character I'm talking about, for example Akane's end wasn't really explained further and well, basically it leaves to confusion at the hand, as for Lucia's end her end was basically condensed rather poorly as explained in the story's part, Chihaya's was never explained in her and her backstory is important for the later parts of the second season for reasons. Kotori's was explained fine and well, however there's something that left rather shallowed.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other casts, I wouldn't really say much but given to how it was handled here, it will affect a lot in the later parts of the series at least to my eyes, but they do bring importance in the story but I won't go and explain further, I will only say that because of how the second half turned out, it will affect a lot of the stuff in the later parts, unless you have read the original Visual Novel.\\n\\n\r\nAs for personality, I'd say the main cast got some pretty decent characterization, and pretty much enough to make them feel like they have some liveliness within them, so that's pretty much a plus.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, on the character department it's pretty much the weakest, due to how a lot of the characters have poorly handled backgrounds or have not really explained them at the slightest amount, with some pretty decent characterization towards them as a positive side.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\r\nNow we're going to talk about the production side of Rewrite. As you already know, this anime is produced by 8bit, also known as the studio behind works such as Infinite Stratos, Absolute Duo, Tokyo Ravens, Comet Lucifer, etc. \\n\\n\r\nIn the production stance, Rewrite doesn't really look like the worst in their production side but, the art does go and drop a lot after the first episode, and that's mostly because of the horrible schedule the staff has for this production because of the company at hand (Aniplex), and they have to rely on a lot of stuff (or from what I remembered the helping studios) in order to make it look good, but it still looked like completely bad by standards due to a lot of massive derps put into it and it's all because of the horrible schedule they received, along with the huge amount of lighting that usually would bug a photographer.\\n\\n\r\nYou know when you try to go and take a picture with one of those high quality cameras, but then someone tries and ruins it for you by turning the brightness up to 5 or max, and it then looks completely horrible where it ruins the atmosphere? Picture Rewrite in your head, with that imagery, and just take a moment to think. The artwork that already looks bad enough from the facial structure towards the body forms, looks worse when you put a light at the side of the backgrounds, and if the backgrounds looks beautiful in there, they're probably ruined by the big amount of lighting it puts around in the outside of certain places.\\n\\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong, lighting in here can work at times, like for example when few occasions when the main protagonist is in the Club at night time, or when the side of the Club is pretty dark, those types works pretty decently and it doesn't look like completely dark, but it doesn't work in other occasions in the show.\\n\\n\r\nFor the CGI, I'll say this, for the most part... it's pretty bad. They're pretty much poorly rendered and hardly any fluidity on them, and it feels like they're either stiff or just not fitting at all, and in some cases for the CGI it doesn't even need CGI for some of the monsters displayed, some of them are even easy to draw around, so it is rather sour at the end when it comes to this.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the animation goes, it's a hit or miss for majority of the times. In some cases the animation looked alright, some of them pretty average, and well... being real, a lot would pretty much look inconsistent with the amount of animators given, and it doesn't look pretty fluid either, and compared to Episode 1's Nonaka animation which gives fluidity and life towards the characters, in the later episodes it doesn't really deliver much, which is disappointing in a sense because I really liked the animation from Nonaka's end.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's also a shame as well, since this series is supposed to be action-focused as well so it should give some pretty nice battle choreography and fluid animation in that stance, and even the Aurora doesn't really look that pleasing by comparison. \\n\\n\r\nIt looks like it lacked any flavor or consistency and we only see that in the first episode and in bits and pieces of the final episode, plus some decent animation when it came towards the episode between Midou and Lucia, despite some inconsistency around, it still was pretty alright... when you have that, it's pretty bad. Even by action genre standards.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plus, I will give the show this, the character designs looks nice and adorable, but I am talking more about the Nonaka designs, from the drafts towards the PVs, even Episode 1 and some certain moments when the designs look okay, it does look nice. So I'll give it a plus around, the color usage isn't bad either, I did liked the brightness colors around for this series.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound/Voice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nNow we're going to the part where I usually like about the anime, but I'll pretty much get into the music first, but we'll talk about the sound department first.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound department, let me tell you this. Who hired this person to be in here and why? and don't get me wrong I don't mind first timers a lot, in fact there are few weird occasions where a newbie staff member would come to such big projects and for my end it's pretty much rare to get a good solid start or first-timer. So that isn't much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nBut the sound directing for this anime is pretty horrible, even worse than Berserk 2016's sound directing when it came to the \"CLANG CLANG\" sounds from the sword. The sound consists of a lot of loud noises and at times even covering or just disturbing the music while certain moments happens, and it's not really pleasing to the ears because it will pretty much explode them. \\n\\n\r\nFrom what I got this person mostly is a producer, so while I don't have anything against the person, they should need to work on the sound parts further, since this is clearly not a good thing when it comes to watching this show. It disturbs the ears and it pretty much for me leaves me deaf around, wanting to go and just check on other things further afterwards. Or they could replace that person with another sound director or someone that handles the sound department better, because I don't really think this would work well for this show with these type of sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nNow as for the music? I'd say this, they played the Original Soundtracks at most for this adaptation, and a lot of times it works for the scenes, sometimes it really doesn't in certain situations. Some of the OSTs don't even last that long, they only endure depending on the music like 5-10 seconds more, it pretty much either feel painfully useless or rather weirded out. However, there were some compositions that fits well in certain situations, like for example Koibumi in Episode 4 which fits pretty well throughout for Shizuru's end. Same with other compositions such as the Kotarou vs Esaka fight.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of that, I might give credit where its due to this as well, while having the OST from the Visual Novel, we do have some arrangements of the soundtracks or remakes, there was a piano version of the ending of the season which is the ED for Havest Festa, as well as the Piano version of the song \"Rewrite\". Also there there was an arrangement for the Kotarou vs Esaka fight which was great to listen towards.\\n\\n\r\nFor the OPs and EDs they're pretty good arrangements at least for the main ones, since depending on the episodes they might enter the characters' respective ending songs around, but for the main OPs and EDs, they're good to listen to, especially the 2nd ED of the anime, sang by Aoi Tada, which brings this beautiful tone to it which makes my ears ring of happiness.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the voice acting, at most they did a good job with their performances, while the most lively one was Kotarou, since I did loved Morita's voice acting in the later parts of the Original source, so seeing him bringing Kotarou to life around here is pretty lovely to listen to, as well with the other character voice actors bringing life to their own despite how the show turned out in the end. Especially Kotori's end, though my major complaint is probably Kagari's voice acting but that goes more towards the final episodes, there's a reason for that in all honesty.\\n\\n\r\nThe Personal Point:\\n\\n\r\nI'll pretty much be honest, despite how the anime turned out from those flaws, it did somehow felt enjoyable, and yes there were half and half issues with the story, and at the same time there were some under development throughout the anime, however my enjoyment for at least mostly the first half was pretty good, it was fun, enjoyable, and pretty much nice to see the characters animated, despite how the series went of course for a lot of reasons, and it is a shame really, as I didn't enjoyed the second half more than the first due to how poorly executed it went throughout with the inconsistency of the writing and the forced Fee Coffee joke.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Opinion:\\n\\n\r\nShould you give Rewrite a shot? Well, it just goes towards you, but if I can go and suggest, I'd suggest to go and read the Original Visual Novel more, and it's not only because of the flaws of the series that I have mentioned, it is because since the second season is in the works, and it's pretty close to coming around, I'm suggesting you guys to go and read it because just in case if the anime does go and do things correctly, either way, it will be confusing for the anime onlies, but that depends for each person but I do assume a lot will be even more confused than the usual. If you want to go to the anime, and want to see it, then go ahead and check it out. Who knows, you may end up liking it perhaps? But that's all up to you in the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnd also in the end for this review, I don't really hate this adaptatio (as I stated as long as they are enjoyable in a way), but I do think it could have done so much more than what it just delivered, or anything of the sorts, but I do hope that the second season becomes better, hopefully? Who knows. We'll just have to wait and see when the second season arrives.",

            "content": "This is one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen, and easily the worst Key anime to date.  8-bit, Tensho, and the entire staff should be ashamed of what was produced here.  This Rewrite adaptation is in the similar vein as M Night Shyamalans \"The Last Airbender\" adaptation where you have characters with the same names and some of the story elements, but presented without soul and crushed down until it possesses none of its quality.  The original source material wasn't perfect.  In fact I would deem it inconsistent and flawed, but it was refreshingly different from other works fromKey and was a very interesting read.  However, to see it degraded to this ugly mess was utterly depressing.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10 (atrocious)\\n\\n\r\nSeriously!?  Who is this adaptation for?  Studio 8-shit thought it was a great idea to horribly rush events directly from the VN for the first half, and then go anime original into a rushed incomprehensible second half.  Like... if you don't have the time to adapt it and were going to make most of it original, you might as well have made it completely anime original.  If you wanted to adapt the whole thing then trying to do it in merely 13 episodes was a terrible idea in the first place.  The first half will immediately turn off people who haven't read the novel since it appears to be something generic with rapid tonal swings and horrible pacing.  The second half only goes out of its way to give fans of the novel the finger by creating a train-wreck of several side routes combined into a weird anime original clusterfuck with only one frigging thing original outside of the source material.  Finally if your a Key fan, you will be so emotionally distant from the generic underdeveloped characters that if you were hoping for the famous \"feels\" you won't even get that.  There are many elements of the story that will probably seem incomprehensible to new viewers, and when you need the source material to understand what is going on, then it has failed utterly as an adaptation.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10 (terrible)\\n\\n\r\nIncredibly thin and underdeveloped.  Like the other flawed Key anime Charlotte, most of them only have time to be defined by some single trait that is repeated for punchlines.  \"Pervert and lets be BFF generic\" Kotarou, the ribbon girl loves coffee, Chihiya is a dumb jock, you have tsundere \"don't touch me pervert\" Lucia, you have \"cute loli that defends protagonist no matter what\" Shizuru.  I don't even remember what they gave Kotori as a character in the anime.  Two of the characters are given backstories with some scenes that feel like they were on fast forward... I am not even kidding, all of it is so rushed that even as someone who read the novel, I was BARELY able to follow, and felt disconnected pretty quickly.  When you speed up events with no flow or breathing time, it ends up moving too fast for you to digest and process what is going on and what you should be feeling.  The result is a rapid slideshow summarizing whats going on without giving you time or space to feel or care about the events on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only two characters in the show that could be somewhat entertaining.  One of them is in it for like 10 minutes (Yoshino), and the other was the ribbon girl who ironically has the least personality in the original source material.  The ribbon girl has an anime original circumstance that occurs, and there is a charm to her that sort of works for a single episode that I thought was passable.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it was when I saw the final episode that I realized how terrible the cast was treated in this horrid adaptation.  You see characters being injured, dying, yelling and screaming in a chaotic battle with supposed high stakes in the air.  Yet, despite having read about them for 50+ hours in the novel, I simply watched bored and emotionally disconnected from everything happening onscreen.  I didn't care about any of these characters that I remembered liking so much from the visual novel.  None of the charm, fun, or heart of these characters were there.  They were became nothing but hallow shells carrying their names.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 3/10 (terrible)\\n\\n\r\nRewrite looks ugly.  The art and animation is somewhat passable for the first couple episodes, and then it takes a quality nosedive in the second half.  8-shit decided to make this show CGI heavy and the result is atrocious.  It honestly gives Berserk 2016 a run for its money in awfulness.  I hate the character designs, which look too small and way too \"cutesy\" for my liking.  The character are very often off-model and look awful in motion at times.  Tensho, the director, is also very weak at framing good actions sequences so even if your just there for decent spectacle it can't even manage that.  Plus, a personal gripe, why is the lighting always so bright?  Jesus!!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 (very good)\\n\\n\r\nLike... the one saving grace?  Maybe?  Something good to say about this trash is the soundtrack that was taken straight from the visual novel...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nI honestly wished this anime didn't exist.  The fans of the visual novel and of Key deserve much better than this.  I feel very bad for people who loved the original material and was expecting something good.  Unfortunately this isn't the adaptation you were looking for.  If you aren't a fan of either Key or the novel, I don't recommend this either since there are much better options out there.  This entire adaptation needs a rewrite, and from a studio that doesn't rhyme with shit.  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

It is not impossible to create a perfect depiction or adaptation of a VN, a fine example would be Clannad which just happens to be another Key VN.\r\nI am not saying it has to follow through the VN's story completely, I am fine with many new plot twists because new content actually excites me. However it is obvious that 13 episodes is not long enough to condense the story of a VN no matter how much you twist and turn the storyline. I wouldn't hold my breathe for the announced 2nd season either.\r\nMyadvise to whoever is interested in picking up Rewrite is, play the VN first then watch the anime. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, my experience with Rewrite the video game has been truly astounding. The animated adaption has only served me as fanservice.",

            "content": "Rewrite. The second highest rated Key Visual Novel on VNDB, only surpassed by Clannad. Something more than well worth reading, in my eyes. \r\nThat's not what this anime is, at all. Not only was it hardly an adaptation with its gratuitous anime original content, but they managed to ruin any small thing they did adapt. \r\nTherefore, I'm going to review this while trying to put aside my thoughts of the original material.  \r\nStory: 1/10.\r\n-What is the premise? What am I watching? Where is the plot?- All questions asked throughout Rewrite's duration. None of which were answered. The fact is, this series had no direction.We have \"twists\" that are in no way surprising, and generally poorly executed. We have info dump after info dump of information that in the end, really amounted to nothing, and yet we still were left with a plethora of questions. We also got an ending with a vague after credits scene to try and lure us into the next season. A complete, and utter mess. The only reason I rate this a 2, is due to the fact there was a beginning and end, something that I admittedly cannot say for some anime series. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\n-While obviously lacking, and rather flat, I can't say I have much to complain about on this front. It was derpy, but hey, with the schedule Aniplex gave 8-bit, who can blame them?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 2/10\\n\r\n-The Sound Director for this series... was not originally a sound director. Poorly placed BGMs that blended together awfully, despite being very pretty on their own. Cringe like screams and grunts that generally felt unnatural. Only thing redeeming was the OST itself, which is absolutely perfect. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\n-A large cast of characters, of which really only two were given any real development, which even then was minimal. Felt nothing for them, and little to no attachment to them existed. Only rated 2/10 because none of them were bad characters, just very two dimensional and forgetful. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\n-When the pacing and overall themes are so much of a mess they don't make sense, things go south quickly. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I would've dropped this at around Episode 3, if not for my fondness of the somewhat related original material. The show on its own didn't feel like a chore, but wasn't something I particularly looked forward to. I honestly wouldn't reccomend this anime to anyone, even to people who enjoy the genre. If it must be anime, I would have to reccomend something else. \\n\\n\r\nI do hope that the second season, supposedly adapting the later parts of the original, will be done well. I assume the only people watching it will be fans, or people who actually enjoyed the first season. If that's the case, let's hope for the best. :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "I had to write a review for this. Because Rewrite is my favorite Key work of all-time. Because it deserved better than this.\r\nIf you are wondering if this anime is worth your time, I say this: if the premise catches your eye, or the character designs, or anything at all, I absolutely implore you to check out the original visual novel. It's deep. It's beautiful inside and out. It's got a message that cannot be ignored. None of which can be said about this travesty of an adaptation. 8bit did not know what they were doing, and do not deserve five hours of your timespent here. Avoid this trainwreck at all costs.\\n\\n\r\nThe story jumps around like a pinball in a dryer. There is no semblance of cohesive storytelling to be found. It takes bits and chunks of the branching \"routes\" from the visual novel and attempts to tie them together in a haphazard, charmless sort of way. At first I wondered if this was on purpose, like the show was just meant to be a treat for people who have already read the source material it is based on, but no. No reader of the visual novel can find anything redeemable at how badly 8bit botched this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters have been derailed extensively. Shizuru, Lucia, and especially Kagari act in ways that are unthinkable for their VN counterparts. Kagari is supposed to be an ominous, mysterious entity, a legitimate threat to Kotarou's peaceful life and instead becomes a caffeine-addicted, narcissistic victim of fart jokes.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that Rewrite gets right is the music. It's taken straight from the visual novel, some truly great pieces that practically tell a story all by themselves. The voice actors are all returned to reprise their roles for this adaptation, but Chiwa Saitou, whose turn as Kotori Kanbe made the character one of the most beloved in the novel, sounds almost chronically bored. It's a shame, but I think even she saw that this script and this adaptation would be lovingly omitted from any resumes she makes going forward. Kana Hanazawa, my favorite seiyuu of all-time, returns as Kagari, but I've already mentioned how badly they've botched her character, and it feels like KanaHana knew it too. She puts forth only just enough effort to keep the dysfunctional train on the tracks.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is dreadful. The characters, whose designs are lovingly detailed in the visual novel, are reduced to frilly moeblobs with very little detail. There are some decent panning shots of Kazamatsuri, but that's about it. And the CG monsters that crop up routinely during the show are just about at the point where they might have looked passable in a 1980s Gundam show. But it's now 2016, and these CG dinosaurs and leaf dragon look pitiful. Perpetually locked at somewhere south of 18 frames per second, it feels like you're watching a particularly unappealing PlayStation 2 game.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this is something to be avoided. I thought I had learned my lesson when I watched their dreadful Absolute Duo adaptation, but at least that was a case where the source material was also uninspired and trite, so 8bit could be almost excused for going through the motions in adapting it. Rewrite is not only great, but a downright tome of greatness, with nearly 100 hours of content. There was no way they were going to be able to do it justice with just 13 episodes, but I would have at least respected an honest attempt to try. Instead, I got a fanservice-laden clusterfuck of scenes that go nowhere, schizophrenic pacing, dull action scenes, and an ending that teases the inevitable second cour. I'll be taking a pass on that, 8bit. Don't take it personal. I'll be too busy \"Rewriting\" my brain to cleanse it from this disaster.\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time, may the Song of Destruction be heard all across 8bit's headquarters.",

            "content": "The first two episodes are funny school life characterization stuff that was genuinely enjoyable to watch. Then the mystery, supernatural, and action elements begin to become more prevalent, and my interest dived.\r\nThis anime is plagued with issues. Some of them have to do with having too much source material to adapt and thus make the anime feel rushed or overall poorly paced. I will not be talking about those issues.\r\nEven if an anime is poorly paced, there is a limit to how much an anime can jump from one scene to the next with wildly different tones without it being jarring. One scene can seempretty tense and traumatic, and then the next scene goes to a short BS school drama thing and sours all of the emotion of the previous scene. The characters act as if they have NO MEMORY of past events unless the plot demands it, and it screams bad writing. This occurs from the very first episode and doesn't stop until the plot kicks into high gear around episode 8-ish (your mileage may vary). \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is serviceable in the slice-of-life-y portions, but in action scenes apart from maybe the last episode, the animation is cringe at times and almost laughably bad at others, especially with the anime's heavy use of CG. Even when the characters are standing still, I don't remember any points where they looked great. There is nothing visually interesting in this show, which really hurts it since some characters are supposed to be super powerful and action is supposed to play up the tension in some areas.\\n\\n\r\nThese two things alone make the anime painful to watch, but if you are willing to look past them, then you might find a surprisingly interesting story with a few twists. The problem is that the storytelling is bad enough that you might not see the story. \\n\\n\r\nAt the very least, I kind of liked the ending, for both ironic and non-ironic reasons. It sort of hints at the possibility of a continuation. Idk, it could go either way, but I can't say I'm excited to see another whole season with this kind of quality.\\n\\n\r\nMy advice: Maybe watch the first two episodes. If it looks something like you'd be interested in experiencing, stop watching and figure out some way to play the game. The anime has a different story from the routes in the game, but every route in the game is probably way better than the anime so don't look back.",

            "content": "Rewrite tells the story of Kotarou who has the ability to rewrite parts of his body giving himself superhuman strength or speed. The show follows him as he joins the Occult Club to research supernatural phenomena along with several girls from his school. He is also followed by a mysterious ribbon-wearing girl named Kagari who kills him in one of his dreams, causing Kotarou to consider her a threat.\r\nThe anime is split into two story arcs with the first being the better one out of the two. In the arc, Kotarou learns a lot about the girls during their club activities. At times he isalso attacked by mysterious creatures forcing him to use his abilities to survive. The overall story of the arc is interesting and later takes a lot of unexpected turns. At times however, the plot can seem a bit rushed and may leave the viewer with a lot of questions.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc mostly follows the ribbon girl, Kagari, as Kotarou learns more about who she is and why she\u2019s following him. Although the arc starts out pretty well, in the end it turns into a rushed mess with the anime trying to explain all the questions raised earlier in a way too short span of time. It also does constant twists that are all done in such a short amount time they only end up confusing the viewer. The ending feels like it was intended to be the something amazing but the writers simply didn\u2019t have the time or the talent to execute it properly. In the end it turns out to be nothing but random events and twists happening constantly with the viewer having barely any idea of what\u2019s going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe interactions between the characters were the best parts about the show for me. One of the most enjoyable things about the first arc was watching Kotarou and the girls living their school lives and doing Occult Club activities. Also, the first half of the second arc, which heavily features both Kagari and Kotarou, was the best part about the otherwise lackluster arc for me.\\n\\n\r\nKotarou is very different from the characters in other Key series. He doesn\u2019t have the personality of the typical harem protagonist, making him one of the most unique main characters in a Key anime. Kagari starts out as an emotionless character but later on goes through a change and learns about the positive aspects of humans. The girls in the Occult Club are also very interesting characters. At first, they seem to be there just to create the harem setting most Key series are known for, but throughout the anime it\u2019s revealed that there\u2019s more to them than meets the eye. Some of the girls also have interesting backstories. While they help flesh out their characters, they end up feeling a bit too rushed to have any kind of emotional impact present in other Key anime. The show also feels way too short for the amount of characters in it which leads to a lot of the side characters not getting nearly enough screen time.\\n\\n\r\nI have some mixed feelings about the animation. The 2D animation for the most part is decent but can dip a lot in quality in certain scenes. There are still certain moments in the series such as the first ending theme that I feel are really well done. The 3D animation is definitely one of the weakest points in the series. It can be very low quality and feel out of place in a lot of the scenes that use it. Even the frame rate in some of the 3D scenes is very low, which should be unacceptable for a pre-rendered scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really good which is to be expected from a Key series. It fits the overall theme of the show really well and does a good job supporting a lot of the scenes. I also liked the opening and ending themes as well as the voice actors of the show. One of the noteworthy performances to me was Hanazawa Kana voicing Kagari as I felt like she did a good job portraying the curious nature of this mysterious ribbon girl as she learns about the daily lives of other people.\\n\\n\r\nI have a lot of mixed feelings about Rewrite. The show has its moments but ends up being way too rushed. It has a lot of potential with the story and the characters being interesting but suffers from poor execution. The anime felt like it was way too short to properly tell its story and flesh out all the characters. I\u2019d recommend skipping it unless you\u2019re a big Key Studios fan.\\n",

            "content": "Ill write the same review as I did with the second season. If you just watched season 1 or haven't watched a season feel free to read because I didn't really wrote any spoilers\r\nWhen I watch, finish, understand and feel an Anime I get depressed after I finish it, thats how I rate an anime. \r\nThis anime made me feel mixed emotions specially at the end of the two seasons. The end of season 1 was depressing and could have kept me depressed for a long time if I watched it while it was being aired but since I watched it  late season 2was already waiting for me. Of course that didn't lessen the impact the scenes gave. Plot wise id say it made my feelings dance. Specially season 1 where there are good mix of comedy specially between Kotarou and Yoshino, Romance and friendship between Kotarou and his harem. The lacking of action was understandable and it was also Okay considering their  age in season 1. \\n\\n\r\n Season 2 was kinda depressing specially after you build up ships and favorites in season 1. But it gave a new taste to the anime too and kinda a huge leap in terms of character development for the characters. The first episode was really emotional and may confuse other people(I wasn't) but those scenes was really specially to how the story will progress around Kotarou. Personally I didn't ship any because it was kinda obvious already AND I didn't really like Kagiri character wise but plot wise she did blend well. The ending may also confuse some people but if you look at episode 1 and the major happenings in season 1 you will understand why Kotarou progressed to that. It was very depressing but it kinda gives you that peace in mind knowing what happened and you can already guess what will happen even if the anime didn't continue. \\n\\n\r\nIn short I describe this anime as \"Having a Beautiful Story and Character design.\" I'm guessing not everyone will like it and of course it didn't reach the mainstream flatform but that's okay because this anime is really special",

            "content": "KEY Anime Adaptations plus those KEY Original Anime have been disappointing me for the past few years because of poor handling of said series and the goddamn pacing. I get that producing a 2-cour series is expensive than 1-cour but due to how KEY's story structure is set-up, 1 cour is NEVER going to work. \r\n[Story]: (5/10)\r\nA lot of KEY fans who read the Rewrite VN hyped this series even though the red flags were already raised and flying. I do understand why though. Firstly, it's a KEY work. Their works are usually really great with great story and amazing characters. Secondly, I just startedplaying the VN 2 weeks ago and it's a lot better than the anime but I'm not going to do a lot of VN - Anime comparisons for this review. I'm just going to write this review as if I'm writing this with no knowledge of the source material. What were the red flags you ask? For starters, 8bit is handling the adaptation and the director is the same director who also directed that messy VN anime adaptation called \"Grisaia no Kajitsu\". I mean, need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nWe all thought that 8bit was going to prove themselves by producing a 1 hour 1st episode. Turns out that wasn't the case. The biggest problem with Rewrite is how rushed the series is. The story wasn't even bad, by any means, but most of the time, the story can get really confusing because of how rushed it is and how they spend little-to-no time explaining what the hell is going on. The pacing did slow down a bit once the Common Route was over and switched up to the original route called \"Kagari's route\" (but it was still rushed as fuck) which wasn't present in the VN. Not like I have any problem with 8bit doing original route. That was kind-of the purpose of this anime adaptation. To advertise Rewrite and also, to present a new-original route for \"fans of the VN and new fans alike\". Notice the quotation marks? Take that quote as you may but my eyes were rolling when I read that quote.    \\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen a KEY anime work before before then you're familiar with how the show is going to be structured. Rewrite's first 7 episodes is basically the Common Route. It introduces the characters, show some happy and fun slice of life moments and all that crap. I already mentioned this but I'm going to say this again but the pacing pretty much ruined the first 7 episodes. How am I supposed to know the characters properly if the pacing is so rushed? I just didn't feel for the characters when the show decides to abruptly switches from a slice-of-life moment to dropping a dramatic character flashback right at my face. There's just no way in hell that's going to work if the show decides to focus on a certain female character for just 1 episode then her problem gets resolved at the end of the episode and switches to another female character in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nNow I want to talk about the episodes past episode 7. Episode 8 and the rest of the episodes after that was when the plot finally began. The show introduces us to the Guardian and Gaia organization. They both work differently so that's why they fight each other but they have the same goal. Saving the Planet. It's just that their ways of achieving their goal is completely different from one another. One of the organizations (I forgot who it was) decides to get rid of the humanity because of how they ruined the Planet Earth. Yes, the plot is like some Environmental Awareness ad, to remind us how we're ruining this planet and to also, probably, make us feel bad about our actions. Kagari is also a major character for this arc and she got more character development than the rest of the characters in the series. That's not really a praise since Kagari's character development was just too messy, really rushed and the development wasn't that much. There's also a few plot twists, here and there, like how Kagari is actually the Key....whatever the fuck that means...And etc. Some surprised me, some didn't and some I just didn't care. \\n\\n\r\nRewrites comedict aspect was a hit-or-miss. At times, it made me laugh and at times, it made me laugh...awkwardly. More like the show was trying to force me to laugh. I just didn't like Rewrite's sexual jokes. It was mostly Kotaru \"accidentally\" grabbing someone's breasts or that he always thinks about groping the \"president's boobs\". I'd like to think that Rewrite's fanservice was anime-original because there's no way in hell that these fanservice scenes are present in a VN that's rated for \"all ages\". \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (6/10)\\n\r\nI'm going to be in the minority here when I say this but I'm not really a fan of KEY's art style and the Character Designs in their VNs. I just find it really ugly. Because of those reasons, I prefer 8bit's Art Style and the anime's Character Design. Now, in terms of Rewrite's Animation, it's very mediocre. You can tell that 8bit wasn't given that much time to produce this series. Since Aniplex and a whole load of big-name companies are funding this production, I'm very sure that the Animation Issues that this show had wasn't because of Budget Issues. For example, when it came to the fighting scenes, the staff had to resort to cheap animation tricks because of time constraints. The fighting scenes didn't even look good and it's just very unappealing to watch. Even in the 2nd OP Animation, you can tell that the Animation was just crap. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that the staff did justice in this Anime Adaptation of a Visual Novel, it's the soundtrack. The VN's soundtrack sounds really good and it's one of KEY's best OSTs yet so I'm glad that 8bit kept most of the OST. Even the 1st OP and ED from the VN was also in the anime. As the show's OP and ED theme song. For the first 7 episodes, at least. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme songs are \"Philosophyz\" by Runa Mizutani and \"End of the World\" by Anri Kumaki. I'm really glad that 8bit reused and even remastered the 1st OP, even if it was only for the first 7 episodes. Right now, I love the anime version's OP way more than the VN version. The anime version sounds more modern and puts more emphasis on the background, something the VN version lacked. As for the 2nd OP, it sounds really weak compared to the 1st OP. It's not a shitty song, per say, but the 1st OP is miles better than the 2nd OP. However, I still like the 2nd OP though and I like it way more than the VN's 2nd OP. I hated that song and it baffles me that a lot of people even liked that song. So I'm glad that 8bit made their own OP instead of re-using/remastering the VN's 2nd OP. \\n\\n\r\nThe ED theme songs are \"Sasayaka na Hajimari\" by Runa Mizutani and \"Word of Dawn\" by Aoi Tada. You wouldn't believe how much I squealed when I heard the 1st ED in Ep.2. The VN's ED is one of the best ED's (Also in my Top 10) I've heard in a long-ass time and hearing the remastered version in the anime makes the 1st ED sound more beautiful. I also like the anime version more than the VN's version. Just like the 1st OP, they put more emphasis on the background and making it sound more modern which is the reason why I prefer the anime version. As for the 2nd ED, it sounds surprisingly great. I mean, it's not better than the 1st ED but it sounds really great and unlike the 2nd OP, the 2nd ED doesn't sound weak at all. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (5.5/10)\\n\r\nHonestly, the only characters that I liked in the series are Lucia and Kagari. I liked Lucia because she's a tsundere and I'm a big fan of tsundere girls. I also like Kagari because she's the only funny character in the series. As for everyone else, they could have been a lot better if they've gotten a lot more screentime. Or in other words, the series needed MORE THAN 13 episodes to flesh out the characters instead of rushing through their character development. Also, those 1 episode arc that focuses on Shizuru and Lucia was simply not enough for me to give a crap about their past and the problems that they were facing in the present. They were simply too rushed. \\n\\n\r\nNow I'm going to talk about some of the main characters. Kotarou Tennouji, the main protagonist of the series, is a high school student and has an ability called \"Rewrite\". I really have no more idea what to talk about him because his character is bland, his personality is really inconsistent, and he barely got any character development.  Why is his personality inconsistent, you ask? The guy doesn't have his own personality. His personality somehow switches depending on the girl that he hangs out with. The guy gets all perverted and idiotic around Akane (The president of the Occult club) but he acts differently when he's around with Kotori or Lucia. He's like a different person depending on the girl that he hangs out with and I just couldn't figure out his TRUE personality. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Kotori, a childhood friend of Kotarou. She seems like an innocent normal person at first who doesn't know anything about the supernatural things but then there's a plot twist about her. I was, honestly, surprised learning the truth about her. Then there's Chihaya, a girl with super-human strength. Chihaya felt like she was a non-existent character. The show didn't really focus that much on her. It's like she only got 5 mins. of screentime every 2-3 episodes. Hell, I didn't even know her name throughout the show. While the show was airing, I kept calling her the \"Orange-dressed Tsundere girl\". I wasn't even sure if she was a tsundere but since she was an almost non-existent character, I just don't care. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Akane Sunri, the president of the Occult club. She's a gamer because she can be constantly seen playing a FPS (First Person Shooter) game and she has the personality of \"Why the fuck am I here\" type of girl. Then there's Shizuru Nakutsu, a loli girl with an eye-patch that made her look like a chuunibyou at first but turns out, it was more than that and there was a reason why she was wearing an eye-patch. Then there's Lucia Konohana. All you need to know about her is she's a stereotypical tsundere girl who punches Kotarou from time to time and if you pay attention to her hand, there's a reason why she's constantly wearing a glove and that's where her 1 episode-arc will focus on. I admit, I enjoyed Lucia's arc but it could have been better. \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least is Kagari. A mysterious character who kept popping up on Kotarou's dream and making mysterious appearances on Kotarou's bedroom and his school. Kagari became my most favourite character in the series after episode 7 because I love her personality and she was really hilarious. Her jokes did become overplayed on the later parts of her arc. For example, her \"FEECOF\" jokes were funny at the start but became somewhat annoying at the end. I can't wait to see more of her in the next season because I heard from VN readers that she gets more focus on the \"Moon\" and \"Terra\" arc.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (6/10)\\n\r\nDespite how mediocre this series, I still somewhat enjoyed this series. The 2nd arc was more enjoyable and bearable then the \"Common Route\".  I wouldn't say that this is the worst anime I've ever seen because there's a whole lot more anime this year that's worse than Rewrite. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nRewrite could have been a great series if it had 26 episodes but sadly, it suffered the same fate as \"Charlotte\" and \"Angel Beats\". The story and the characters needed more than 13 episodes to flesh out the story and its characters. Instead, what we got is a series with a very rushed/poorly explained story and a cast of characters with barely any focus, screentime or character development. If you're a fan of the Rewrite VN or you're looking for a great KEY anime then Rewrite is not the anime you're looking for. Charlotte and Angel Beats were also rushed but not as rushed as Rewrite and those series were more bearable to watch than this. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (5.7/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Amazing Soundtrack, especially the remastered OP and ED theme songs from the VN\\n\r\n+Kagari's character is quite hilarious\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-The Pacing is very rushed\\n\r\n-Storyline can be a bit hard to follow due to how rushed the show is. \\n\r\n-Almost every characters in this series got little to no character development. \\n\r\n-Needed more than 13 episodes to flesh out its story and its characters\\n\r\n-Unnecessary Fan-service scenes\\n\r\n-Underwhelming Ending",

            "content": "This review is split into two sections:\r\n- The first section is devoted to those who are new to Rewrite and are contemplating watching the anime adaptation. This section is entirely spoiler free.\r\n- The second section is dedicated to those who have already read the Visual Novel. This section contains major spoilers.\r\nFirst Section (for people new to Rewrite)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAn Introduction: Key is a company that is renowned for its visual novels, most of which enjoy critical acclaim. Almost all these VNs have anime adaptations, which enjoy varying degrees of fame \u2013 be it Clannad, which holds the position of one of the top few anime of MAL,or Air, which is relatively unheard of. Whichever the case may be, the general consensus is that all these anime are quite good, since they all take advantage of the \u2018feels\u2019 factor (as in making the viewers attached to the characters and then making them feel some degree of emotional turmoil by putting those characters through adverse conditions). Rewrite is Key\u2019s latest flagship VN, which was released way back in 2011. While Rewrite was very successful in the market, it still took around 5 years for it to get an anime adaptation, which we see here today. I shall be going into some detail about this anime in the paragraphs to come.\\n\\n\r\nStory (3/10):\\n\r\nWhile the plot itself is passable, let me remind you that plot is not the only element under consideration in this section. The biggest issues with the story are the pacing and presentation. \\n\r\nThe pacing is extremely haphazard and the various scenes seem to jump from one to another without any concern for flow. This often ruins the impact of many important scenes and makes the viewer wonder what exactly is happening. The presentation of many scenes tend to unnecessarily give the viewers the wrong idea about these events of the anime, which can lead to a good deal of frustration.\\n\r\nWhen you try to cram a 60+ hour Visual Novel into a 13 episode anime, there are two possible outcomes \u2013 A badly paced rush-job or a completely different story. While Rewrite was supposed to have a different story from the VN, it has all the features of the former case. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10):\\n\r\nI knew that the short duration of the anime adaptation would limit the amount of character development that could be given to most characters, but I never expected it to be this terrible. \\n\r\nThe characters are extremely clich\u00e9d to begin with - a happy-go-lucky protagonist, a childhood friend girl, an \u2018aho\u2019 transfer student girl, a modern tsundere class rep girl, a healing presence/small furry animal type kouhai, a domineering yet lazy senpai, a mysterious loli and a chuunibyou delinquent \u2013 basically a buffet of all the stereotypical characters that you may find in any school-based anime, with some combinations thrown in the mix\u2026. And that\u2019s the good part.\\n\r\nA little later into the show, development is forced on the characters so hard that almost all of them feel broken by the end of it. Some of the characters are changed so much that they\u2019re not even the same characters any more. Viewers who are new to Rewrite will have a lot of difficulty understanding the behaviour and dialogues of many of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtracks and the OPs are just remixed versions of the same from the VN, but are still quite pleasant to the ears, though there are some moments where the soundtrack doesn\u2019t match the situation. The EDs are above average.\\n\\n\r\nArt (4/10):\\n\r\nThis is where the low budget of Rewrite really shows. The regular animation is passable at most times, though you\u2019ll find a lot of horribly warped faces and such if you happen to pause at the wrong moment. \\n\r\nIt also makes use of some really clunky CG at times, which serves to further ruin the effect. The main issue is that the scenes where CG is used tend to be rather important to the plot, thus decreasing the enjoyment of the series on the whole.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10):\\n\r\nThe anime version of Rewrite seems to be fan service aimed at those who have already read the VN. Those who are new to the series will find it extremely difficult to follow. It is quite dull for the majority of the episodes, while some episodes are mildly intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10):\\n\r\nYou\u2019d think that 8bit studios might have learned something from their extremely messy adaptation of the Grisaia trilogy, but guess what \u2013 Rewrite is an even bigger abomination. I had predicted that it would end up something like Charlotte\u2026 looks like I was mistaken \u2013 Charlotte is infinitely preferable to this.\\n\r\nAs I have already mentioned before, the main purpose of this adaptation seems to be \u2013 to appeal to the pre-existing fans and to advertise the source material. Both of these seemed to have failed rather miserably.\\n\r\nVerdict \u2013 Don\u2019t watch it. You\u2019re just spoiling a perfectly good Visual Novel for yourself. Even if you\u2019re not planning to read the VN, the anime is still not worth the effort. Give this one a pass unless you really want to waste a couple of hours of your time (for which there are far better methods and shows).\\n\\n\r\nSecond section (For the Rewrite veterans \u2013 HEAVY SPOILERS)\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nI\u2019ll mainly be talking about the story and characters in this section.\\n\r\nAs you may already know, the anime was supposed to follow an original route, which should give a brand new story. In fact, what we actually got here is an amalgamation of pretty much all the routes, done in a very messy fashion. \\n\r\nThe base is the Terra route, with a few scenes from the Moon route thrown in every now and then. The first parts (back-stories) of Lucia\u2019s and Shizuru\u2019s routes are given one episode each, while Chihaya and Kotori are largely ignored. Akane gets a little bit of time, but more focus is given to her transformation into the new prophet rather than anything else. Pretty much all of them are broken or close enough to make no difference. In fact, the only character who actually got a decent representation was Yoshino, short as his screen time was. Kagari is the most messed up of the lot, as they completely changed her personality\u2026 and not for the better.\\n\r\nIn the end, this anime can be considered a tutorial on \u2018How to butcher a perfectly good Visual Novel\u2019. If you absolutely must watch it, go in with zero expectations, with only the hope of revisiting the world of Rewrite. Otherwise, just don\u2019t bother.\\n\r\nWith this, I conclude.\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n",

            "content": "The potential of storytelling is truly limitless. Rich, vibrant realms can be created with the simplest of tools. Within them, characters can be given life, allowing us to form a compelling connection with whatever struggles they may face. But perhaps the greatest power which these stories can hold is the one to create impact--to inspire change within reality itself.\r\nThe Rewrite anime isn't one of those stories--not even close. It's unable to craft any sort of concrete narrative. Storylines which seemingly have no connection to each other are tenuously stapled together, in a similar manner to a child's hopes being crushed by the towering expectations ofothers. Yet, it never manages to convey anything internally, and it never cares to. Instead, it grows its own fragile ego of ostentatious themes and overly ambitious goals. Eventually, it reveals itself to be a guise meant to weakly dispel any acknowledgment of its own hollow identity.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, Rewrite's narrative goals weren't of grandeur, but of re-captivating a naive high school adolescence typically found in anime. In theory, its premise sounds heartfelt: Rewrite follows its main character, Koutarou Tennouji, who, while boisterous and unpredictable among his friends, represses his own isolation and longing for a sense of belonging. Eventually, Koutarou is given the opportunity to join the outlandish Occult Club, where he then gather his friends together, never failing to crack a smile in the way, in order to a live fulfilling youth under the pretext of solving supernatural occurrences. \\n\\n\r\nThe High School Club is no revolutionary innovation for anime, but Rewrite's spin on seems like a fresh of breath air as, in opposition to the rigid, cynical, protagonists common in the setting, Koutarou is more than voluntary creating fun for his club. His situation becomes all the more palatable; there are no foreboding conditions to be made or dark, secret pasts covered by a mask. It\u2019s just good ol\u2019 fun.\\n\\n\r\nYet, Rewrite manages to disassemble itself from ever becoming satisfactory, let alone becoming inspiring. And it does so in the worst way possible: making Koutarou an appalling asshole to watch.\\n\\n\r\nUsually, when describing what goes into good character writing, a common idea thrown is the one of making characters be multifaceted. However, character writing doesn't even need superfluous depth to be effective--that's just one way in which characters are made real. The simplicity of everyday life and idealism reflected by characters can, arguably, echo that reality much easier than the acclaimed Big Damn Heroes. A couple of mannerisms which form a character can go a long way if used with competence, such as giving autonomy to them that allows for coherence.\\n\\n\r\nRewrite's Koutarou seems to have gotten the wrong idea as to what it is that constitutes a good character. Instead of mixing in one or two mannerisms his characters, Rewrite mixes in a boiling pot of tropes to compose Koutarou. He becomes absurdly multi-faced,  being one second a thirsty, flaming pervert, the next second a teen with a heart of gold, and in another instance an angsty philosopher strolling some somber ruins. \\n\\n\r\nKoutaru's character traits accumulate so much that they inevitably topple over, often contradicting each other in the process. When a depressed Koutarou wishes for friends in the morning, only to then taunt his only male friend on a whim, Koutarou can no longer be definitively defined by his desire for companionship which the narrative so strives to develop. \\n\\n\r\nContradictory characters aren't inherently bad; they can be played for a compelling scenario of irony. A good example being the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise\u2019s Kyon, who portrays a similar desire for extravagant fun to that of Koutarou's, but under the heavy guise of snarky cynicism. However, Kyon, unlike Koutarou, regulates his own traits. He'll only be snarky when he feels the time calls for it. Eventually, Kyon is able to form a middle ground between those two traits, one that humanizes what inflicts his wisecracking nature and what triggers his excitement. It's a process by which we're invited to form a greater connection to the events that stimulate Kyon as he develops, but also one in which Kyon is made more cohesive and, consequently, more believable in his actions.\\n\\n\r\nKoutarou is missing that natural cohesiveness that's important to making him work. His traits aren't connected with each other to form the bigger picture of the Socially Awkward Teenager he is, but instead deliberate throwaways meant to emphasize Koutarou's supposed humorous innateness as a character. They're abrupt, appearing at any moment whether appropriate or not, before fading away. Each instance of Koutarou feels like an entirely different character, up to the point where he no longer feels like a character, much less a person. He becomes an annoyance, enhancing none of the situations he's in but instead stripping away their authenticity.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, Koutarou lacking any sense of character might be a deliberate thematic element Rewrite is going for. Under the implication, Koutarou's \"core\" as a character would be spawning different personalities to surpass his lack of any at all, only to then ironically drive home that Koutarou's many faces exhibit a hollow identity to the point of no longer feeling human. In a sense, Koutarou would be a criticism of high school anime protagonists saying that none of the wishful cliches they involve themselves are authentic experiences. They'll only serve as a means of egoistic indulgement, one that deteriorates any sense of \"being human\" in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nBut Koutarou's character shouldn't be trying to make a \"point\" as an excuse for incompetent character writing. Regardless of whether Koutaoru is meant to satirize protagonists or just represent the hollow shell of a teenager, Rewrite never supplements any context to support such characterization. Under which societal standards found in Rewrite's fictional city, Kazamatsuri, would Koutarou be pressured to be devoid of character? Rewrite doesn't answer any questions which propose a further expanding of Koutarou's background as a person. Consequently, no characterization is given that humanizes his incoherency.\\n\\n\r\nKoutarou arrests every narrative goal to be in assistance towards his character, with everything revolving around him internally. Once Rewrite\u2019s fictional city setting, Kazamatsuri, begins to center around just Koutarou, there are no contrasting comparisons which can be made of both him and his world that can develop both as genuine. It doesn't help that Rewrite\u2019s first half is mostly framed around the high school setting--something which limits construction of an outside world. Kazamatsuri, as a result, loses its tangibility as a location with its own life.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the destruction of a setting being a narrative offense, especially in the case of shows heavy on worldbuilding such as Rewrite, a much greater offense is committed: the dehumanization of other characters as people. \\n\\n\r\nSympathy and its importance in our relationships with others is a prevalent theme that Rewrite pushes through with Koutarou, who's selfishly blinded by his own lack of receiving any that he, at times, fails to notice the suffering of others. The first half largely consists of making Koutarou come to this realization through the additions of his club members: Kotori Kanbe, Koutarou's childhood friend, Shizuru Nakatsu, Koutarou's kouhai, Lucia Konohana, Koutarou's class president, Chihaya Ohtori, a transfer student, and Akane Senri, the founder of the occult club.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the typical nakige anime formula, most of these girls have a hidden past, prompting them to have many insecurities covered by their mannerisms. In the context of the narrative, this formula is especially interesting due to how some of the girls echo Koutarou's flaws. This aspect of the characters is exploited most in their development. However, instead of fleshing them out as people, Rewrite establishes them as figures of sympathy used for drama first and foremost.\\n\\n\r\nAny other traits for these characters are passed aside, leaving many of them to just be unpolished archetypes and nothing more. Within their own universe, they're marginalized, forever trapped by their narrative roles. Kotori, for instance, can only ever be Koutarou's childhood friend. Every dilemma which she faces, every choice she makes, and even her interactions with others are centered on her relationship with Koutarou. \\n\\n\r\nWe're restricted from ever having glimpses of these characters lives outside of Koutarou's World that may seem trivial, but add to their humanization as characters. And a lot of these characters clearly show lives beyond the narrative functions; I'd love to see the introspective story of a sexually ambiguous Kotori. But with how Rewrite capitalizes on its characters potential to be melodramatic first, that's just not possible. With their treatment, these characters can no longer be deemed as clearly autonomous people. They're unable to convey any sense of real emotion, much like Koutarou.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, whereas some characters like Chihaya become utterly forgotten by their own story, quite a few are highlighted with sob stories. With their abrupt nature and lack of any meaningful context, the sob stories can barely function in giving texture to characters. However, Shizuru perhaps provides the single best instance of characterization throughout the whole show thanks to her sob story. In an accident involving her parents, a young Shizuru is left to live off as an orphan with heavy guilt. However, we're not demanded to sob with her, as it's a moment meant to highlight Shizuru's growth from that point onwards. She becomes independently strong, removing most of her regrets from that time. This moment, even if missing some key essentials to being great, is satisfactory enough to inspire a reason to be compelled by Shizuru.\\n\\n\r\nYet, after this sob story, this aspect of Shizuru's character isn't ever developed, or even touched on, again. The sob story is revealed to have just been vague foreshadowing for some major plot points without showing much care towards Shizuru's strengths. She reverts back to her innocent loli archetype and continues to express her quirky nature to Koutarou in a flaunting manner until drama calls her back again.\\n\\n\r\nIt's incredibly ironic how Rewrite shows a total disregard for character development in favor for the tiny tidbits of plot buildup, as said plot is entirely reliant on characterization. The destructive foreshadowing by which everything is sacrificed towards constitutes its second half, which is where Rewrite goes from being a Bottom-Of-The-Barrel title to being downright asinine; it becomes an insult just watching it.\\n\\n\r\nRewrite's second half, for as convoluted as it can get, can be simplified into one narrative goal: challenging Koutarou's attachments. These attachments, whether they're Kazamatsuri or the Occult Club, become parts of Koutarou's character. However, while doing so, Rewrite denies its audience any attachment towards those settings. They become abstract, stagnant husks of places, devoid of any natural dynamism. This hinders the second half entirely, as it introduces a new setting that's established and feeds off of the hypothetical substance developed in the mundane one. However, as Rewrite evidently doesn\u2019t develop any sense of meaning beforehand, viewers are left in the dark as incoherent melodrama ensues.\\n\\n\r\n[Disclaimer: From this point on, major spoilers regarding Rewrite may be discussed.]\\n\\n\r\nSupernatural elements are a recurrence in Rewrite's first half; it's what all that foreshadowing suggests towards. Yet, there's a total disconnection between the small scope of Koutarou's High School Life and the literal End of The World which Rewrite reveals as the plot of its second half. The apocalyptic threat in Rewrite feels incredibly inappropriate in comparison to anything the show has established beforehand. It's an atrocious plot twist that not only invalidates it's own story and confirms its own superficiality, but also neglects an audience's immersement. At this point, Rewrite no longer feels like a single, coherent show; it feels like two different shows entirely. When internal consistency in Rewrite's world becomes lost, no longer is there any reason to care for its destruction.\\n\\n\r\nEven in isolation, the Supernatural Kazamatsuri fails to create a sense of tangibility like its mundane counterpart. Rewrite builds a world of an ancient conflict between two organizations, Gaia and Guardian, who wish to either end the world or preserve it, respectively. Gaia can control familiars, whereas Guardian members are superhumans, both powers which, while interesting in concept, never seek their potential. But even neglecting their tactical strategies, warfare between the two is dealt with insensitivity. Ideologies are what solely define them and not the humanity behind them. Rewrite doesn\u2019t just expect their abrupt appearance to be meaningful, but it also expects their single, underdeveloped motivations to be compelling to watch in conflict alone. For once in Rewrite, Koutarou shows relatability because of this as he barely betrays any apprehension once he discovers of the organizations' existence.\\n\\n\r\nThe main source of hostility between Gaia and Guardian involves around them seeking what determines the earth's destruction, a being dubbed as the Key. Rewrite's countless forms of exposition hinder this tension from being anything close to compelling, with information being told towards the viewer via still shots instead of showing it through the flow of action. Tension, while practically being a scarce element in its first half, becomes nonexistent in its latter half. This can be mostly thanked, however, to the representation of the Key itself: a moe, loli character voiced by Kana Hanazawa.\\n\\n\r\nTypically, characters like Kagari are played with for quick, cheap, future drama; take Fuku Ibuki from Clannad or Kudryavka Noumi from Little Busters! as examples. Unfortunately, to the context of Rewrite's narrative, Kagari doesn't even get this minimal treatment. She isn't even treated like she has a narrative and in-universe function that determines the fate of the plot. She\u2019s completely undermined; when she's undermined for laughs, she's treated as a socially inept figure who is obsessed with coffee. When she's undermined for her fanservice appeal, Koutarou will be \"accidentally\" groping her flat chest.\\n\\n\r\nRewrite has absolutely no shame admitting that Kagari is merchandising potential with the small convenience of being a plot device that can be occasionally thrown around. Kagari's character is Rewrite admitting that, despite its attempts, it has no idea what it is it wants to be and then resorts to solemnly indulge, in defeat, by pandering.\\n\\n\r\nEven though nothing at this point can revive its dead narrative, Rewrite's visuals are, at the very least, satisfactory, even if inconsistent at times. If there's anything Rewrite gets consistent for the most part in its visual department, it's its ability to set scenes through lighting alone. Koutarou's room after a lethargic day of fooling around in school provides us with a faint, artificial light that represents Koutarou's own superficiality, only contrasted by a pitch black, unknown outside acknowledged by a window. It provides the tiresome, melancholic imagery that\u2019s necessary to his character, but is rarely ever given the writing to back it up.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs by Masayuki Nonaka themselves are actually fairly endearing, even if the school uniforms of Kazamatsuri students are rather absurd. Masayuki shows a clear aptitude is being able to make his character designs come to live, having many of Rewrite's moments of vivid character animation be done by him. Ryouma Ebata also joins in on the fun by animating and storyboarding the first ED with his signature, realistic walk cycles. Other than these rare exceptions, Rewrite's character designs for the most part lack a nuance that's necessary for conveying characterization that plot alone can't. Character acting can at times be rigid, if at all. Still shots of characters with their moe, Itaru Hinoue eyes gravely kills some of its more serious scenes. It doesn't help that characters being off-model isn't an uncommon occurrence. \\n\\n\r\nVisually, Rewrite kills itself with conspicuous CGI. For the convoluted designs which many of Gaia's familiars have, CGI is used to prevent there from being some atrocious abomination of 2D animation. Nonetheless, the use of CGI itself still isn't mastered, with many of the models themselves showing repetitive animation cycles which just emphasize their artificiality. As familiars often interact with humans, who are 2D animated, them seeming out-of-place is made quickly apparent and quite awkward. The use of CGI is inevitable, but Rewrite fails to clear its stigma in any way. \\n\\n\r\nBeing originally a visual novel, Rewrite shares most of its soundtrack with that of its source material, while also containing some anime original compositions. By itself, the soundtrack contains some real gems. Scene Shifts Here is a poignant, yet dramatically impactful piece which wonderfully builds up crescendos. VN music composer Shinji Orito is no stranger to living up the fun of everyday life and in Rewrite, this shows. Kazamatsuri is given the musical character it deserves with some of his pieces, with a personal favorite of mine being the campy DIS Is A Pain. The anime originals are fairly lukewarm, though, with most of them just utilizing motifs in previous tracks or just downright being unremarkable remixes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, on a sound design level, Rewrite fails to realize the original emotions contained in its pieces. Many times will leitmotifs accompany characters, serving as reminders of their imprisoning roles, while melodramatic music will be incompetently placed in some scenes. Often times does the music itself try to be emotional substance, in substitution for the lack of any in writing, but ultimately fails. This usage of music becomes formulaic, causing the original tracks to become unfortunately underwhelming. It's a shame seeing some great tracks lose their shine, but with Rewrite's perfunctory directing, it's inevitable. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I remain truly flabbergasted by Rewrite--at that point, it could have been anything, yet been nothing at the same time. With writing so incompetent, and characters to offensive, the possibility of Rewrite being deliberate garbage with minimal effort put into it wouldn't even be surprising. It creates an internal fool itself, meandering around in search for a purpose, as it makes jokes just to fill in a time slot. In the end, it never finds itself; no one, not even a perplexed audience, could develop a sense of meaning within Rewrite. It died like it lived: rebelliously underestimating storytelling, only to then rot and kill itself all together.",

            "content": "Since Rewrite is a visual novel by Key, a lot of people will compare it to the likes of Clannad, Angel Beats, Air Cannons, etc. But, I propose some new comparisons.\r\n1. Shitcom, because both are pretty shit comedies.\r\n2. The sensation of hitting your head against a brick wall for six hours.\r\nIf you enjoy either of these, then Rewrite might be the perfect show for you. Otherwise, I consider it one of the worst anime of 2016: a fucky jambalaya of overdesigned characters, dumb memes, and a plot that was probably written by someone putting a bunch of sticky notes on a dartboard and writing inwhatever they threw at.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I go on, let me just say that I don\u2019t give a flying fuck about how good the visual novel is or isn\u2019t. I don\u2019t care what purpose this anime serves to it, whether to be some sort of adaptation, if you can even call it that, or just a teaser meant to advertise it, whatever. I\u2019m just reviewing the anime the same way I review any other anime: like a little dickbag who isn\u2019t good at anything els--I mean, independent of any other source material. I did not at all write a Shokugeki review comparing it to the manga to contradict myself and then delete it out of embarrassment.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you\u2019re not very familiar with Key\u2019s works, here\u2019s how they generally go: The MC is an everyday normal guy with just enough wit to keep him from being 100% beta, but not enough substance to put him above the level of a general self-insert. He goes to a weird school filled with even weirder people (mostly overly-designed cutesy girls) with some maddeningly strange characteristics. Various shenanigans occur for a few episodes until the plot finally comes in, or maybe there\u2019s one to begin with but doesn\u2019t have much of a focus yet. \\n\\n\r\nIf you can\u2019t tell, I\u2019m not a fan of these Key guys who think it\u2019s funny to put their logo on every coffee can in every episode of every show. The way they tell their stories is very jarring because of their spontaneous, bombastic sense of humor. Half the time, I can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re trying to make a teenage melodrama, or if they\u2019re trying to make a dinnertime cartoon sitcom for dummies. It's an uncomfortable mixture of both, like ketchup and mac and cheese. Since they like to dick around with their storytelling, things can get rushed and/or confusing in the end.\\n\\n\r\nThese things are increased thousandfold in Rewrite.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no plot in Rewrite. None. It pretends to have one in the second half, but the \u201ctwist\u201d being that something is actually happening comes out so half-heartedly that the writers seem disappointed in themselves that they can\u2019t write in as many dank maymays into their show. Instead\u2026 eh. There are monsters, eh. People are fighting, eh. The world is gonna die, eh. FEECOF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whoops, there goes Rewrite being funny again xDDDD!\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t believe me? Here\u2019s part of MAL\u2019s synopsis, albeit fanmade by MAL Rewrite (that joke is funnier than anything else in this show): \\n\r\n\"Equipped with the superhuman ability to permanently rewrite any part of his body to multiply his strength or speed, Kotarou is naturally drawn to the supernatural.\"\\n\\n\r\nYou know when this Rewrite ability is shown for the first time? Episode fucking four. Not one. Four. And, as usual, the story just reveals it as if it\u2019s the most normal thing in the world. No prior hints for him having this power, no explanation as to how or why he has it, nothing. And that synopsis isn\u2019t even accurate, because it's not just about increasing strength. At one point, he \u201crewrites\u201d his body to resist poison. What else can he do? Resist age? Resist death? Become invisible? Triple the size of his dick? You know, that would be a good power to have in a massive waifu war such as Rewrite. I think there was a hugely missed opportunity here.\\n\\n\r\nOther people have powers too. Just because. And there are shitty CG monsters sometimes. Just because. Eh. It\u2019s all part of the hilariously goofy fun that is the Whatever Club at Whatever High School! \\n\\n\r\nThe real plot towards the end turns out to be some environmental awareness campaign. People are assholes and don\u2019t take care of the planet, so other people need to out-asshole them and activate a thing that will kill everyone so that the planet can live. I don\u2019t know how this is supposed to tie into the main character having the ability to theoretically give himself the neck of Alolan Exeggutor. Maybe there\u2019s a reason somewhere that I missed, but it\u2019s a little hard to follow along when the show tries to adapt every possible waifu route in the game while playing catch-up with the plot because that took forever to come in and now it needs to do 3,000 things at once if it wants to wrap up in time. Except the plot took so long to come in that I lost interest before it even happened. Maybe this show should\u2019ve had a rewrite, eh? Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh???\\n\\n\r\nAnd at the end of the day, what did this amount to? A dead end. Literally. The ending is not satisfying, as it\u2019s apparently just one route of many, leading me to wonder what the point of all of this even was. Was it to introduce the characters? Anything could\u2019ve done that within a couple episodes; to say an entire thirteen-episode season can be dedicated to that would be an outright lie. Is it to introduce the setting? Kazamatsuri has basically no focus at all. I know that it\u2019s a big place and kinda environmental-friendly. My fucking bedroom could've been a more interesting setting, because at least I have Big Order posters. Is it to explain the conflict of the show? Well, it only took them until at least six episodes for them to reveal that there was any conflict in the first place, so\u2026 no. It\u2019s all a bunch of mush, and I\u2019m not quoting whatever that pink sheep dog thing was. It tries to please both visual novel readers and newcomers by adapting the visual novel with an anime-original route that tells a complete story while also introducing a story. I don't even know what the fuck that means, but it failed at all of it.\\n\\n\r\nKey should just make their own Nichijou. A show where nothing happens, everything is stupid, and it\u2019s funny as hell. Make something like that to satisfy their own sense of humor, so that maybe they can tell a compelling story and find a way for someone to get attached to its characters beyond humorous interactions. Ha ha, Kagari likes coffee and calls it \"feecof\"!! What a deep character!!!\\n\r\nAs everyone will write in every review for every comedy anime in the world: comedy is subjective. Not everyone is going to love it or get it, so making the characters more like a bunch of running jokes in the midst of a deep melodrama might not be the best idea. When they fed me a character's sob story, my reaction wasn't \"Oh no, how sad! I'm emotionally invested now!\", it was \"Wait, I was supposed to take this seriously?\" The usual nonsense that follows a sad moment leads me to believe that I had the right idea.\\n\\n\r\nI can admit that the show was a little funny at times. It was. There was about\u2026 one gag per episode that got a laugh out of me. For about four episodes. Because within those first few episodes, I was still somewhat invested in the show. I thought everything would make sense in the end, that something was gonna happen at any moment that would tie everything together and make me believe the show was actually a work of genius. But then it never happened, and even still I was trapped, because I was at a point where I was in too far to pull out and cut my losses. I needed to see it to the end, so I could at least splash more salt than Arataka Reigen. Perhaps that was the point, just to lure everyone in and keep them thinking that, someday, it\u2019ll all come together and make sense, only for them to post a note at the end saying \u201clol fuk u idiot\u201d. If so, congrats Rewrite, Key, Studio 8bit, you totally PRANK\u2019D me bro!! XDDDDDdddeDdDdrefzdfxff\\n\\n\r\nAh, it\u2019s like someone probably once said, a good piece of entertainment is one that leaves the viewer thinking. Rewrite leaves me thinking that I should\u2019ve died in that car wreck I had last year. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know who the fuck this 8bit studio is, and given the art of this show and that their most popular work is Infinite Stratos, it seems I haven\u2019t missed out on anything. Rewrite looks terrible. Not even because of the mediocre studio, but even designs imported from the visual novel. Who in the name of Lady Gaga designed the school uniforms in this show? What kind of cruel monster would subjugate these poor girls to this kind of torture? They all have to wear these extremely overdesigned, uncomfortable-looking dresses with skirts and sleeves that you could drive a truck into despite the torso clinging to their tits like a wet washcloth. Isn\u2019t that nice? No, they don\u2019t look cute in the slightest, they look like they take a half-hour to actually put on. And I\u2019m sorry to disappoint everyone, but I\u2019m not really into fucking the wrappers of strawberry-and-creme hard candies. But, whatever fetish you relish.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is mediocre, which for the most part isn\u2019t a problem, but for some reason the anime becomes an action series with a bunch of fights, and then it\u2019s a problem. Even worse is that there are a bunch of weird supernatural beasts in the second half of the show, and while they have an interestingly jaded color scheme, they\u2019re done in really poor CG. At other times, it\u2019s inconsistent, such as the way they animate Kagari. Do her ribbons move around with a mind of their own, or don\u2019t they? I dunno, I guess whatever key animator 8bit hired for that episode gets to decide that. No particular positives about the art can make up for the big negatives; the only things possibly worth mentioning are that the OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s look surprisingly good, and that maybe the character designs are okay, but as you can expect from a visual novel full of girls, some of them are gonna look strange, like Shizuru and Kotori.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I should also mention some of the voice acting, because Hana Kanasamanawamallama voiced the main loli girl. Apparently that means it\u2019s good. Not really, because her role didn\u2019t have anything impressive about it, but at least her voice is nice to hear. Otherwise, the soundtrack was decent; it never felt spectacular and most of the time it was pretty average, but there were some good, emotional or light-hearted tracks here and there, especially when (and this is weird to say) Kotaro was about to grope Akane, they played the VN's OP. Nice. The OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s were all pretty decent as well, though not impressive either.\\n\\n\r\nDo I need to say anything else? Don't watch this anime, no matter what sort of relationship you have with the source material. This anime sucks. The story sucks. The idea of it sucks. The way it\u2019s told sucks. The people who are in it suck. Hell, the people that made it probably suck too. Maybe I\u2019ll join Gaia. Not because I care about the planet, but because, sometimes, I just feel that a lot of people dying would fix things. Kefka did nothing wrong. Get well soon, Maeda-san.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 1/10\\n\r\nArt - 3/10\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 2/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1/10\\n\r\nMemes - Aboutaslifelessasharambe/10\\n\r\nOverall - 1.25/10 (Range - 1-2)\\n\r\nFavorite episodes - 0\\n\r\nFavorite characters - Akane\u2019s Boobs\\n\r\nRecommendation level - no",

            "content": "Rewrite, one of Key\u2019s most prominent visual novels getting an anime adaptations? This almost feels surreal, right? I\u2019ll get straight to the point. While the idea of Rewrite finally getting an anime has been a dream for Key fans for many years, it may also be somewhat a tarnished reality as we realize what we\u2019re really getting. After finishing the show, it\u2019s more than just tarnished. Much more.\r\nOn paper, Rewrite follows a lot of standard Key formulas you\u2019ll recognize easily if you\u2019re already familiar with their work. The slow paced story from the beginning, generic character personalities, and supernatural phenomenon are just a few toname. However, one thing this adaptation didn\u2019t fully embrace is its ability to move the audience. What that literally means is its inability to make the viewers feel tearful unlike some other series. (ex. Clannad After Story) Some may question that it would be unfair to compare Rewrite to other Key\u2019s works but in reality, the adaptation really has more humor than it should.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first few episodes, we meet Kotarou Tennouji, the male protagonist. He gets involved with his school\u2019s Occult Club where we meet the other female characters. They range with different personalities and all more or less oddball characters at first. The real catch though is that they are also involved in some kind of darker plot that unfolds as the series progresses. But on paper, the first few episodes doesn\u2019t reveal much of itself as it tries to get viewers to familiarize with the franchise. In essence, the main female characters will likely be a hit or miss to get attached to. Most of them are stereotypes like the school council representative type or the redheaded tsundere. Meanwhile, the series does also introduce a mysterious character from Tennouji\u2019s dream, a young girl with ribbons that seemingly kills him. Perhaps this is where viewers will get intrigued by the show.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a standard viewpoint, the storytelling of the series bounces between acceptable and awful. There are some episodes that nails the coffin when it comes to creativity while others makes you feel like it\u2019s a forced chore to finish. As an anime original viewer, I confess that the show itself is underwhelming particular with characters such as Lucia. The way their own story is set up not only feels rushed but lacks concrete feelings. It\u2019s hard to feel what they are going through with the pacing especially from the buildup and ultimately doesn\u2019t really satisfy what its intentions were. On the other hand, some other background storytelling such as with Shizuru (the eye patch girl) feels it\u2019s done right because of the more tragic mood. Still, with the show being just 1-cour, you really shouldn\u2019t expect a full adaptation of each girl\u2019s story. In fact, this particular anime actually develops into a more mysterious plot that unfolds with connecting events. Unfortunately, the insert episodes of the girls\u2019 routes doesn\u2019t do much justice and weighs down the show overall.\\n\\n\r\nAs Rewrite retains a lot of comedy, there\u2019s also the mysteries that carries over the course of the show. I already mentioned about the strange ribbon girl from Tennouji\u2019s dreams. However, we also get the main setting that itself is a mystery. The series takes place Kazamatsuri and has quite a lot of hidden secrets, some that ventures into the supernatural realm. Being the curious guy that he is, Tennouji is drawn to these mysteries as he has a supernatural ability of his own. A major turning point revolves about the utopia-like environment and where all sorts of strange occurrences takes place. When one of the students at Tennouji\u2019s school goes missing, that\u2019s where we realize Rewrite can be darker than it seems. We are also introduced to factions that have conflicts with each other and some of the girls from the Occult Club are involved. Tennouji himself also begins to display inhuman talent with his own Rewrite ability. And finally, we also learn a lot more about the mysterious ribbon girl that appears in Tennouji\u2019s dream. It\u2019ll take patience for viewers to eventually get to the main meat of the plot and if you\u2019re the type that sees Key as an insufferable product, then this will be a hard show to follow.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps storytelling isn\u2019t just what Rewrite emphasizes on though. There\u2019s also relationships, connections that tries to be meaningful. Tennouji develops several important relationships with others including Lucia, Kotori, Kagari (the ribbon girl), among others. However, the show itself seems to focus on that mostly on the surface level. Because of time restraints, they aren\u2019t concretely developed as you\u2019ll anticipate. Oh and it\u2019s easy to forget about characters like Haruhiko when his role in the show seems to be mainly comic relief. And romance? That part is mostly teased at and hard to really appreciate if it\u2019s even there. At best, character relationships are subtly memorable but because of the mediocre buildup, they aren\u2019t very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio 8-bit, the show itself is underwhelming when it comes to visual quality. The characters look blend while it does retain Key style features such as the moe-eyes, feminine parts, and surreal-like atmosphere. However, the action is more of a disappointment. Well to be honest, the action was never a main attraction in the show anyway and the brief segments where we see that isn\u2019t so appealing either. There\u2019s not much fan service in the show except with the blushing and that one episode where Lucia puts on a maid outfit. Oh yes, a maid outfit.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, soundtrack for Rewrite is impressive. Well, not in the impressive that it\u2019s a masterpiece but definitely hits the key points. The theme songs offers choreography that fits the show quite right while the OST is mysterious as it should be. Even during comedic moments, the music seems to fall in place naturally. Furthermore, character voice expressions are well delivered if you compare to their characters from the VN. \\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, what should you really take for granted from Rewrite? It\u2019s pretty much a popcorn entertainment that\u2019s perhaps only easy to watch if you come with an open mind. For those with high expectations, it\u2019s probably a good idea to drop the show as it seems to appeal to a broader audience, beyond the visual novel fans. I think Rewrite tried to take a risk and although it partially succeeds, there\u2019s more failure. In the end, it\u2019s a nice show to pass time with for fun but not something to talk about for years to come. Oh and season 2 has been announced for the love of God, let\u2019s pray for a better sequel.\\n",

How? What?\", so that was the very weak point with this animation, maybe because the length of the visual novel, this story have so much to say, so transfer this to the animation was unsuccessful at certain grade.\\n\\n\r\nEven that it's a story that can be valuated well if you see it with calm, maybe if you get very confused and intrigued, you can awake the feeling to play the visual novel (like me).\\n\\n\r\nI think this is all, so be patient and play the VN, that a solution, if you reach this point and feel this review useful or only time lost, anyway thanks for read it all, happy anime and happy VNs, remember the other routes will be animated in 2017!!",

            "content": "Before starting the review I would like to say that I have read most part of the Visual Novel, and I love it, but I will not compare them and I will not argue about the number of episodes, because the review section is supposed to tell about the anime only, and why you should watch or not watch it according to my opinion.\r\nRewrite is set in the fictional city Kazamatsuri where treeplanting and afforestation have caused the city to become overgrown with trees and flowers in much the same way that other cities are filled by buildings. Tennouji Kotarou lives here. He's a highschool student who has the ability to rewrite his own body. He can become stronger and faster at any time he chooses. He investigates supernatural mysteries with five girls from his school.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the story very simplified, it doesn't really catch many attention by simply reading the synopsis, despite being much more complex than it seems.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is an action, comedy, romance and school genre, but why is harem not included here? Refering to the ANIME it really should be a harem genre, a guy staying with five girls in a club, getting along better with each one at each episode. As regards to the action genre I really think they tried to have many action scenes since the very beginning of the anime, which I think was not necessary, because if it followed a slower pace I'm pretty sure it would be way better than that, there's too many action and too many things happening, I mean, things happen too fast and sometimes you don't even know anymore what you are watching, I think the word that fits it better is: messy, I also saw many people saying that weren't understanding anything about the anime. About the Comedy in the anime, it's funny, not a anime that you will laugh every minute, not even every episode, just because it is not meant to be this way, so I really think it doesn't lack comedy at all, in other words, in my opinion the comedy was almost used in the right way, there are some scenes where comedy wasn't necessary, actually, it shouldn't be there. About the Romance, until now the romance was not very present, it just seems like a generic harem anime, not romantic, even the characters personalities seems like harem.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art of the anime tried to be the most moe as possible, all the girls were supposed to be cute, I don't think it fits the anime at all, it could be a lot better, but I didn't found it bad or ugly. It has some CG's, some of them were well made, but most of them weren't, I don't consider it unpleasant, maybe for the majority it can be, also some scenes I feel like the art is a bit bad, but it also has some scenes I found the art pretty, specifically at the beginning of the first episode only, to be honest, as the episodes went by I had the feeling the art worsened.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the sound, I think it's almost perfect, it fits with the scenes and they are very pleasant to hear, OP and ED are beautiful, also 2nd OP and ED are great, Koibumi from Yanagi Nagi and Sunbright by Ayaka Kitazawa are wonderful, I just think the musics were used in the wrong way or timing sometimes, that's why I wouldn't give it a 10 score.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters all of them are pretty funny in their own way, all of them have unique characteristics and personalities, although they seem like the same generic harem type of characters in the beggining, they are pretty well made and show their real selfs at some point.\\n\\n\r\nI can say I did enjoy it a lot, and also that I didn't, probably because I read the novel it disappointed me in some points, but it was so enjoyable to see some good scenes being animated, many action scenes, drama, some funny scenes and some romance aspects, although it really feels like just another harem action anime in the beginning. The anime has a fast pace and that's the bad point here, this \"original route\" was not bad, the way they adapted it to be a 13 episodes isn't bad, but the way the story was presented and how rushed it is, this is what makes it bad, also the original route is pretty much a mix of every route in Rewrite in a lighter version, when what's happening is \"too heavy\" it seems that they tried to break the ice making a comedy scene right after it, that's another bad point.\\n\\n\r\nA new season has already been announced, which I think is great, this entirely season seemed to be rushed and it really was. Anime-only viewers probably disliked it, also some people who read the novel too, they left so many things unexplained, but there's still hope for this, next season Moon and Terra routes will be adapted, so it will probably be more understandable for everyone and it's expected to be better adapted too. I'm looking forward for it and I hope everyone feels the same, I mean, this entire season feels like an introduction for the vast and complex story of rewrite, and probably everything will be much more clear after season two, and also depending on how good next season will be, people may change the opinion about this, unfortunately(or not) some people probably just won't watch next season.",

            "content": "A lot of anime each season tends to adapt material from a different medium. Manga, light novels, videogames, and sometimes even visual novels. Of all of them, a visual novel is arguably the hardest to adapt. Why, you ask? Since visual visuals novels tend to have branching narratives with multiple possible storylines and alternate endings, it\u2019s difficult to simply \u201cchoose\u201d one to adapt or adapt the \u201cright\u201d one and pull out a good anime from. \r\nDecisions made by the player during the game compound on top of one another and can eventually change which storypath the VN goes down and lead to an alternate ending.It\u2019s not uncommon for VNs to have well over 5 alternate endings, so when it comes to adapting it to anime, how does it actually work out? How do you adapt multiple story lines into one 13 or 26 episode anime? \\n\\n\r\nIn the case of Steins;Gate, studio White Fox decided to adapt a \u201ctrue ending\u201d route, which is the route that tied up the most loose ends and had the most satisfying ending. In the case of Fate/stay night, studio ufotable and studio DEEN both adapted two out of the three distinct routes from the original VN, and next year studio ufotable will adapt the final route in a trilogy of films titled \u201cHeaven\u2019s Feel\u201d. So when it comes to Rewrite, a commercially successful and critically acclaimed visual novel with around 5 distinctive routes, what does studio 8bit decide to do? Well of course, fuse half of them into one monumental mess!\\n\\n\r\nAdapting a VN is hard enough, so why does 8bit try and make it harder for themselves by blending multiple stories into one? The original alternate story lines are alternate for a reason; they are purposefully set as different playable routes for the player because of their distinctive nature. The main character, Kotarou, forms different and unique relationships with each of the supporting characters in their respective routes, so what happens when you blend half of them into one? Disharmony is what happens. Unevenness. Asymmetry. A narrative that isn\u2019t well-rounded nor that has a clear and defined goal is what is produced. I can say with sufficient surety that nobody watching Rewrite as it was airing (without prior knowledge from the visual novel) was able to understand what the main conflict or goal was that was present in the story. Studio 8bit\u2019s unreasonably resolute determination to adapt a careless fusion of routes spawns a monstrosity of an anime that forces its viewers into a submission of perplexity.\\n\\n\r\nRewrite\u2019s disjointed narrative overflows with a smorgasbord of elements that just don\u2019t click with one another. Slice of life moments, pseudo-harem elements, convoluted supernatural magic powers and giant CGI monsters that will more often that not leave you bewildered and lost rather than intrigued. The stakes are raised to unfathomably unreachable heights, but it is difficult to grasp them tightly enough to take seriously, what with all the convoluted magic stuff and the irrepressible escalation of \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe problems arisen from the show that materialize from its poor adaptation are mostly contained and limited to the first half, in which Kotarou forms and develops his relationships with the all-female supporting cast he\u2019s constantly surrounded by (hence, \u201cpseudo-harem elements\u201d). Originally, Kotarou is supposed to develop separate and unique relationships with all the girls individually, but since 8bit decided that \u201cjust didn\u2019t cut it\u201d, Kotarou insteads fleshes out relationships with only half of the cast. This results in back-to-back episodes expanding on Lucia and Shizuru\u2019s backstories (\u201csob stories\u201d would technically be the more accurate term) that collectively feel episodic in nature and superficial in execution. It\u2019s very obvious, almost as if explicitly implied, that the show just had to find a way to squeeze in these two character\u2019s backstories because those were part of the routes 8bit decided to fuse together. No real respect is offered towards the rest of the cast, they all feel like plot devices used to escalate the narrative towards the back stories of the two. This lack of authenticity makes the show and characters mechanical and robotic, the only characters that you can empathize with are the two the show force their backstories into. \\n\\n\r\nNow of course, the poor adaptation isn\u2019t to blame alone. The original narrative of the Rewrite visual novel has its fair share of innate problems that deserve a respectable portion of the blame as well. The narrative of Rewrite shifts its focus from cute girls, high school club goals, supposedly heart wrenching sob stories and then finally sets it sights on world destruction and human extinction. How can it all connect? Where is the delicacy in execution? Earlier I said the show had an irrepressible escalation of \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d moments. This isn\u2019t an escalation of say, running up a set of staircases dangerously fast like a frantic 10-year-old who\u2019s been suppressing his bladder all day; it\u2019s more like a clinically insane and frenetic individual rocket jumping from the CN tower to the moon, only because the moon \u201clooked cool\u201d. Shifting from cute girls doing cute things to a commentary on the nature of humanity and world destruction is already a pretty implausible change in tone, but actually not entirely impossible. \\n\r\nWhat Rewrite lacks is a sense of scale. It starts small, with a comfortable high school setting and fictional city within its reach, which disallows room for expansion of tackling immensely bigger topics and more impactful themes and premises; it started with a small scale, when it should have started with a large one and focused on a small part of it; It outlined and gave away little information, when it should have outlined a lot and gave only a small part of it. If it did those things it would transform its irrepressible escalation of \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d moments into an irrepressible escalation of \u201coh, that\u2019s how it connects. Awesome!\u201d moments. \\n\\n\r\nSo how could they have adapted it properly? While we\u2019re asking that question, let\u2019s go a little broader. How can an anime adapt its source material properly? Well, the answer is simple: with care. Just care. A little attention to detail here, a little improvisation there, and maybe, just maybe, they\u2019ll be able to translate a possibly great work into an equally great medium. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10 || Enjoyment 4/10\\n\\n\r\nAmongst many avid visual novel players unlike myself, Rewrite is beloved. Talked and praised about endlessly, news of its anime adaption left its near-obsessive fans with a bloated sense of ecstasy; just think, the joy of having something you truly love with all your heart being reshaped into the medium that you love just as much\u2026 It\u2019s an unfathomable state of euphoria, albeit if funnily enough trivial, that just can\u2019t be achieved by other things in life. Nothing else raises people\u2019s moods quite like that. There is a \u201cbut\u201d though, and it exists because of a studio\u2019s lack of care; not to say studio 8bit didn\u2019t necessarily care for the work, but more so the evident absence of care in execution that can be seen by anyone who\u2019s experienced both the visual novel and the anime adaptation. This execution that lacks finesse and charm unfortunately forces Rewrite to join its brothers and sisters in the collection of anime grouped as \u201cthe source material was much, much better.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was informative and helpful.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes I can't help but wonder why certain things have to be animated in the first place.\r\nAlready back when it was first announced that Rewrite was going to be adapted, I was getting some very mixed feelings. On one hand I was happy that one of my all-time favorite visual novels was finally getting an anime against my expectations, but on the other hand I also knew that making a good adaptation out of it would be incredibly difficult. This is partially because the visual novel is extraordinarily long and partially because all of its routes directly contradict each other and therefore wouldn't make muchsense in a linear medium like anime. So it's fair to say that I came into this with a fair amount of skepticism, especially considering that 8bit were the ones pulling the reigns: the same studio which had already completely destroyed another top rated visual novel two years earlier in Grisaia no Kajitsu.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as it turns out, I was right to be skeptical, albeit not quite for the reasons I initially expected. See, the main reason Kajitsu was butchered so hard was because it was unbelievably rushed: they tried to squeeze in a full 80-ish hour visual novel into 13 episodes, and unsurprisingly failed miserably at it, so I was expecting Rewrite to get roughly the same treatment. But as it turns out that wasn't quite the case, because this time around they decided that instead of trying to adapt an enormous amount of content in an impossibly small time frame, they made an anime original story instead. They tried to circumvent the problem by doing an original arc instead of adapting any of the routes of the game itself, which felt like a bit of a cop-out move to me, but given the circumstances it was probably the best thing they could have done. On paper that is.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem is, however, that this series doesn't actually function properly as an original anime. Why? Because if you're an anime-only viewer, the story makes absolutely no sense. For anyone that hasn't played the visual novel, you're most likely going to come out of this anime thinking \"wtf just happened\" more so than anything else. Basically what they've primarily done is taken certain snippets from Rewrite's various visual novel routes and put them all together into something new, but it just doesn't work out very well at all. It's like blindly taking out all the contents of your refrigerator and throwing them into a blender, and hoping that the resulting slurry turns out to be tasty (protip: it probably won't). There are so many characters that are just thrown into the show with barely any explanation whatsoever, so many plot twists that come across as pulled totally out of nowhere, so many underlying themes and deeper messages that will fly completely over anime-only viewers heads due to lacking proper exposition, and so many supposedly emotional scenes which wholly miss their mark partially because they feel spontaneous and unnatural, and partially because the show does almost nothing to make you empathize with its characters due to how little development they get. Also how they insist on using some of the amazingly beautiful soundtracks from the visual novel for a few such scenes feels almost insulting due to how low the actual emotional impact of the scene itself is compared to where those tracks were originally used in the game... it's like watching a death scene from Another set to the music of Continued Story: you just don't.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, despite supposedly being an anime original version, it's still part of the same complex universe that the visual novel routes play out in, and if you're an anime-only watcher it'll all be very confusing to watch not only because of how lightning fast the pacing is, but also because of how many scenes are omitted and how much information about the bigger picture of the world itself that you don't have. As I mentioned earlier, Rewrite is built upon having blatantly contradictory character routes which together create the overarching story as a whole. Everything is connected and part of a much greater picture. So when you're doing an anime original route instead, you can't really avoid having to leave a ton of loose ends open. As a result this is barely even watchable as an anime-only viewer, and even if you have played the visual novel it's still rather inexcusable. Yes, I might understand what is going on a lot more so than most viewers as a result, but it doesn't change the fact that the entire anime is a huge clusterfuck that doesn't even come remotely close to the level of the visual novel at any point. It just doesn't feel satisfying to watch at all, and constantly leaves you hanging with this feeling of \"what could have been\".\\n\\n\r\nThere are also certain plot points which are so obviously catered towards people familiar with the source material that they don't really function properly for those who aren't. For example, in the beginning of episode 8 there is a minute-long scene of a tiny rock floating through space at high velocity, eventually crashing through Earth's atmosphere and hitting Kagari right in the head. Evidentially it hit her head pretty badly because from that moment on, her personality makes a full 180, which has a rather drastic impact on the following turns of events. Now if you've played the visual novel you should be able to figure out how and why this happened as it's certainly not anything random, but for an anime-only viewer this plot point is completely absurd. A random tiny asteroid ending up hitting a girl's head as it crashes onto the planet, forever altering her personality? I mean it'll look like the most forced plot twist ever made if you don't know any better. Sure, after the upcoming second season (and yes that was announced at the end of episode 13) they should be able to piece it together as well, but the entire joke of the scene won't really work retroactively and it'll still come across as somewhat forced that way. I just can't help but feel like this is the wrong kind of execution to do when you make an anime original route, because again it pretty much assumes that the viewer has knowledge of latter events which at the current point in time only people who've read the visual novel will have. If this Kagari route had been part of the game, it'd probably have been pretty far down on the recommended route order chart; certainly not at the very top at least.\\n\\n\r\nNow I've seen some people argue that 8bit have still done a decent job under the circumstances considering that they had a basically impossible task to begin with, and while I do see what they're getting at (because let's face it, making a proper adaptation of Rewrite with this few episodes is a laughable idea regardless of who's pulling the strings), I can't really agree on it. While it is true that this anime was more or less doomed before it even started, there were definitely things they could have done a lot better. For example, episodes 4 & 5 were in my opinion a complete waste of time. What I was promised was an anime original story focusing on one of the girls that didn't have a normal route in the visual novel, Kagari, and nothing more. I wasn't exactly satisfied with that prospect but I could live with it given the lack of realistic options. But despite that they still insist on spending entire episodes solely on going into the backstories of some of the other heroines in an incredibly rushed manner of fashion that not only felt extremely unsatisfying on their own due to the terrible pacing, but also it has almost nothing to do with the anime original route itself. So why even adapt it? Like you either adapt a route properly or not at all, don't just throw in abridged versions of them out of nowhere just because you can, geez. In the first place, what's the point of teasing so much about the other girls when you're not ever going to follow up on it and properly show the full picture of what the truth behind them is? To tease people into buying the game I guess? Perhaps even more importantly though, by doing this you're taking away precious screen time that could have actually been spent on developing this original arc you're so insistent on doing. Like if there's one thing which you should never end up having pacing issues with, it's an original anime. I mean the entire scenario script is supposed to be written from scratch specifically to fit the episode count damn it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I found really disappointing is how incredibly casual the anime is about revealing the supernatural. In the visual novel you don't even find undeniable evidence that there even is anything supernatural until the end of the common route (adapted in episode 7 in a different version), which is almost 20 hours into it. Yes, you know Kotarou can rewrite himself, and yes, you encounter ominous-looking black dogs in the forest and the city at night as well as numerous suspicious people, but that's about it. Then when the actual reveal comes, it hits you like a hammer with how dramatic the tone shift is. The early part of Rewrite is supposed to be school/comedy/mystery, and then in the actual character routes it transforms into action/drama/supernatural. But in the anime, they've kind of just... jumbled everything together. Kotarou is like yeah I have a super power, Shizuru casually reveals hers without much explanation provided, and when Kotarou is given his \"claws\" then you're just going to have to accept what you're watching because the anime sure isn't planning on explaining where they came from anytime soon, etcetera. It all feels very mish-mashed without any clear direction, almost as if they did everything in the wrong order. I don't know, making a good anime out of Rewrite with such a tight schedule is probably impossible no matter what you do; even an original route like this doesn't really work because the world itself is far too complex for you to be able to make a satisfying standalone arc without it becoming entangled in the \"real\" story of Rewrite in some way, causing a ton of loose ends that will never be able to followed up upon. It only forces 8bit to include a bunch of scenes they seriously shouldn't, wasting even more of what little precious screen time they have at their disposal. It's no wonder the pacing is so all over the place. On top of that the anime also has some incredibly awkward usage of CGI for all the various types of familiars it contains, so the action scenes aren't exactly a pleasure to look at either. Hell, even the regular 2D art really dips in quality every so often, especially in the last few episodes of the show. It felt like they were having some serious budget issues here, and as a result there were a lot more derp faces than I would have liked.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters goes, I'm also pretty disappointed. I actually consider the visual novel's character cast to be in my top 5 even to this day, due to its diversity, great character development on many different fronts, and for just being plain entertaining in general. But the anime does... basically nothing to showcase either of these things. First and foremost, there are simply way too many characters in Rewrite for such a short anime to support. It's a very complex universe including multiple factions, people with drastically different ideals and goals, driven by their own respective backstories, etcetera. There just isn't anywhere near enough time to explain who they all are and what their purposes in the story really are. Especially considering that (you guessed it) for many of them, said explanations are provided deeper into the various heroine routes of the game, and they're not just something you can throw out at a moment's notice. In other words they really never had a chance to be anything more than random supporting characters in the anime because the script doesn't permit their characters to ever be properly explained or developed. Maybe you should have thought about that before you decided to go full anime original? And this is just talking about the supporting cast; if we talk about the actual main characters here then it's obviously even worse because all the original main heroines (Kotori/Chihaya/Lucia/Shizuru/Akane) just come across as random harem members in the anime as none of them get any proper characterization to speak of at all. Why? Well... because their routes aren't adapted. It all keeps coming back to that, doesn't it? Even Kotarou suffers from this because he's supposed to grow in those arcs as well.\\n\\n\r\nSooo I don't know, I don't straight-up hate the show but I just can't help but feel that it's so pointless. If you've played the visual novel, the anime feels like a massive downgrade in comparison, and if you haven't played it then you'll be missing out on so much that it'll barely be comprehensible due to how confusing the story will be, how much content is cut out and how rushed it is. So what is the target demographic supposed to be? No one can say they're truly 100% happy with this anime. At least on that front it's certainly no different from Kajitsu.\\n\\n\r\nI think the obvious yet unfortunate truth here is that the whole point of this anime is nothing more than to be an advertisement for the Rewrite+ release of the visual novel, which is a new version released on July 29th in Japan this year, I.E: shortly after the anime started airing. It contains new CGs, more voice acting, slight scenario revisions, etcetera. For a long time I was also under the impression that this release was going to contain the new Kagari route as well in visual novel format, but as it turns out that's actually not the case. It doesn't really seem to contain any noteworthy new story content at all. So my hypothesis is that the release of Rewrite+ in combination with this original anime is nothing more than a marketing ploy, where people who have no prior experience with the franchise will get a first-time introduction to it through the anime and get interested enough to at least be willing to purchase the game. Then of course since Rewrite+ has just been released recently, which sounds like a much cooler version than the original for people not knowing any better, those new fans will throw their money at the much more expensive \"new\" game instead of the cheaper \"old\" Rewrite from 2011. Again, this is just my theory but honestly it's the only idea I can come up with that can financially justify re-releasing a game 5 years later with hardly any noteworthy changes made, as well as simultaneously making an awful anime adaptation of the same game that is neither satisfying for old fans of the games nor anime-only watchers.\\n\\n\r\nSo with that said, in the end... I can't help but feel like this anime is meaningless, or at least it'll only function as a sales booster for the new game release, which is nice for the creators I guess but that doesn't actually make the anime itself any better for me personally, nor should it for any other viewers of it.\\n\\n\r\nIt has to be said though that if we ignore this show's origins for a second and just look at it as any other anime among the thousands of others out there, then it's not the worst thing I've ever seen, far from it, but it'd probably be something most people would forget about almost completely within a day or two of finishing it. However, we can't avert our eyes from the truth that much, and the fact of the matter is that this is supposed to be a representation of one of Key's three biggest visual novels, alongside Clannad and Little Busters. Personally I'd even say Rewrite is the best of them all; I played all three of them back-to-back way back in the beginning of 2013, and at least for a short time afterwards I actually considered Rewrite to be my favorite visual novel. It might not have maintained that spot for too long but either way the point is that... it just deserves better than this. Yes, I've known ever since the day I finished the game that making a proper adaptation of Rewrite was probably impossible no matter what, but I was still hoping for a lot better than what this anime gave us. At the very least it should have gotten more episodes than this; Clannad got 4-cours and Little Busters got 3, why is Rewrite stuck with merely 2? If anything this is the one which needed the most episodes out of the trio since it has a lot less content that can be omitted. Realistically speaking 4 cours would probably have been the optimal pacing-wise given the length of the game. But I guess that's just the world we live in nowadays: anime are mostly produced in order to promote their source materials and boost the sales of those, and as a result we very rarely see shows with more than 2 cours anymore. For a lot of series that's totally fine and all, but for ones with very long source materials like this, it's basically a killing blow, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least though, as mentioned previously we are at least getting a second season for Winter 2017 (so it's a split cour), and this is giving me a certain feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. See, as badly as 8bit destroyed Grisaia no Kajitsu two years ago, they actually did a very respectable job with its sequels, Meikyuu and Rakuen, and the main reason for that was simply that the sequels are way shorter to begin with and thus much easier to adapt since they didn't have to rush them so badly, unlike with Kajitsu. And I feel like the same thing could very well happen with Rewrite. In case you don't know, the visual novel has one route for each of the main heroines (Kotori/Chihaya/Lucia/Shizuru/Akane) and then a two-part True route at the end, with the first part being called Moon and the second part being called Terra. Now in the anime they've basically replaced the five girls' routes with this original Kagari route, and the upcoming second season will adapt Moon and Terra. In other words the second season should actually not be anime original, unlike this one. There will probably be minor changes in order to accommodate for everything they've done in the first season, but for the most part I reckon it should be pretty much the same as in the game. And above all, just Moon and Terra on their own should actually be doable in 1 cour, so we might actually have acceptable pacing next time around as well. With all that being taken into account, it could actually turn out to be a pretty good anime. The downside is of course that we seriously lack proper buildup for it since none of the heroine routes were adapted first, so I'm not sure how everything will turn out in the end regardless. But I think it at least has decent potential to come out alright for those who are already familiar with those routes, I.E: those who have played the visual novel first. And for those who haven't... maybe, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, given how unsatisfying this first season has been on its own it can only go upwards from here. Let's hope the second time's the charm in this case. Then again I know better than to expect much from 8bit no matter what by now, so I won't get my hopes up too high just yet.",

It hasn't even been a year since I reviewed that last atrocity with your name on it, and now you're teaming up with a company that people only remember at this point because After Story still ranks high on MAL after all this time in order to get recognized by anime fans who will never play your supposed masterpiece Cross Channel, and thus will only remember you as the guy who made Humanity Has Declined and a load of shit that no one cares about. I sympathize with you. I really do. The anime industry is afucked up place that holds back actual talent. We all know that by now.\\n\\n\r\nBut like the people who okayed that godawful Ratchet & Clank movie, you've got to ask yourself this: is having an anime adaptation of your work really the ultimate prize it's all cracked up to be? Don't you realize by now that you work in a video game industry, and thus are inherently incompatible with an entertainment medium that the viewer can't physically interact with? Don't you realize that for ever Steins;Gate and Madoka Magica that ends up making it big, there are fifty World Conquest Zvezda Plots, Robotics;Notes, and Classroom Crises. And assuming you do know this, don't you know that teaming up with fucking 8-bit is considered a mistake in every sense of the word? I mean who even remember what anime they made? Oh right, these are the guys who made Grisaia. And yet somehow, even when you're working with them, they end up creating a product several times worse to the point that I could have done better.\\n\\n\r\nYou'd think I'd have spent all my outrage regarding Rewrite after the last post I wrote about it and you'd be mostly right, but the thing about this show is that it's my favorite kind of bad to review on the grounds that it fucks up so royally that you could write more essays about what it does wrong than you can about the many interpretations of Utena. It's not bad in that \"incredibly lackluster to the point that I can't even remember what it is I'm supposed to be complaining about\" that characterized the last few shows I reviewed. This is straight up \"I see how this could have been better if it was handled by people with actual talent, or at least a chimpanzee\" bad. And even when I'm being calm about it, there's so many words dripping with unsubtle bile I can write about the product that I can actually cause some impact on the industry by making the producers lose even less money than they already have. Hell, I've already written quite a bit and I haven't even actually started describing Rewrite as of yet. Girls Beyond the Wasteland wishes it could have fucked up as much as this.\\n\\n\r\nRewrite is an anime about a young boy named Kotarou Tennouji, living all by himself (of course) in the incredibly environmental-friendly town of Kazamatsuri. A town which houses a bunch of mysterious secrets such as dodgy CG crabs and annoying fairy creatures that our git of a main lead just has to discover the truth about, so he ends up joining an occult club and recruits members to help him out that all happen to be female and only two of them at best exist for the sake of more than just fetish fuel. Of course, in this show's defense, there is some semblance of a reason for his decision to only invite girls to hang out with him on one of his nature walks whilst ignoring the one male dude who he antagonizes more than Bugs Bunny did to any of the other Looney Toons. It's because he's a grade-A pervert who thinks sexually harassing his friends and touching their boobs is a charm point. Hey, I didn't say the reason wasn't \"pants-on-head\"levels of retarded.\\n\\n\r\nBut as is usual for visual novel anime, this is all just a smoke-screen for some upcoming serious plot that the writers seem to think would be a good idea to wait until halfway through the show to introduce for some reason, and in Rewrite's case, it turns out that Kotarou's friends actually belong to secret government organizations that are in conflict with each other because one side wants to destroy the world in order for it to be birthed anew and the other side wants to protect humanity even though said world is a morbid state of affairs where humans can kill trees without any repercussions. Yes, the plot is basically X/1999 if you replaced all the pretentiously cool CLAMP characters with little girls who would rather drink tea and bathe in hot springs than actually do something interesting. And yes those are your eyes that just rolled on the floor right now, because your mind can't comprehend how fucking retardedly mismatched the two plotlines are. I mean what's next? Harem school club anime that suddenly turns into Breaking Bad?\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly though, Rewrite does lean heavily on one of its mismatched sides to the point that the other one doesn't cause much interference. It's just too bad that said side is the banal school life side where nothing interesting ever happens and there's no drive to events other than curious retardation. Yeah, remember how I said before that I hate most visual novel anime (and most anime in general for that matter) because for some reason people can't get it into their heads that \"comedic episodes and light conflicts that solely exist to build up the world and the characters so that when the true dramatic story hits, it's all the more effective\" is an absolutely awful concept that no one with a brain would possibly enjoy, let alone prefer to just \"starting the dramatic story at the very start\"? Well generally, these sorts of shows stop with their inane prologues by the halfway point, but Romeo Tanaka adaptations just can't seem to grasp the definition of the word \"stop\". It takes more than three quarters of the runtime for both Girls Beyond the Wasteland and Rewrite to get something even approaching an ongoing plot, and even then the latter seems to think that it can take a break and let girls relax in hot springs as a sort of reward for all the action that occurred previously, even though said action is only a minor skirmish against a twat that looked awful and no lasting impact because apparently stab wounds are easier to recover from than paper cuts.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is just littered with every bad adaptation choice you could possibly make when adapting an interactive non-linear product to a non-interactive linear world to the point that it feels like we're living in that shitty visual novel adaptation phase of anime again. Do you remember how one of my big complaints about Charlotte was that it had a severe lack of drama when it was desperately needed? Well it seems Rewrite misinterpreted the complaints people have made about Key products being overly manipulative even harder and decided to only give service to the company's token melodrama in the worst way possible. There's only two episodes that try to tug at the viewer's heartstrings and of course, it'd be directed towards the two girls with no plot-importance whatsoever, as well as being fucking botched to boot.\\n\\n\r\nJust as an example, one of the episodes in the first half of the show is centered on the purple-haired girl, Lucia, and plays out like a bad horror story with its poorly directed attempts to be creepy that end with Kotarou discovering it was her who was causing all the strange things to happen because she has the ability to poison anything she touches thank to experiments done on her. Said episode ends with her throwing a hissy fit, accidentally poisoning Kotarou, him fixing himself up, revealing that she works for a secret organization, and then happy school life continues again in the very next episode. Excuse me Rewrite for not having the tear ducts required to appreciate sadness caused by \"magic\" that has never been foreshadowed until now, has no impact on the story beyond a few plot points that you could have conveyed better by shooting someone, doesn't further anyone's characterization, and indeed is never brought up again after it's told!\\n\\n\r\nI could go on listing all the bad adaptation decisions...so let's continue, shall we? The animation is uglier than Andrew Lloyd Webber, looking like one of those crappy flash animated shows from the early 2000s with the shining buffed up a bit. And that's not even getting into the 3D animation for the monsters in this show, which looks so retarded and clashes so badly with the backgrounds that Polygon Pictures themselves would have fired the people working on it. And even by visual novel standards, the characters are just completely unlikable. Kotarou basically bullies and sexually harasses his friends for no reason, constantly begging to touch their breasts even during serious moments to the point that you sympathize with Lucia in regards to wanting to murder the bastard. But for some reason, the girls still hang out with him like the moe tsundere sycophants they are. Even dressing into cat-eared maid costumes at his request because apparently we're living in an age where people still think it was funny when Higurashi did this. It's like someone took a bunch of dating sim stereotypes, tacked on an arbitrary twist to each of them, and then beat them over the head with a crowbar that was made out of concentrated STUPID.\\n\\n\r\nFinally there's the ending, which is both the best part of the show in how laughably terrible it was in a \"I can't believe you did that\" kind of way, as well as the worst part of the show because you couldn't believe they actually did that. To those who played the visual novel, remember how every single girl's route would end with the world getting fucked? Well instead of using one of those endings to cap things off, the producers decided to go a bit more original...by ripping off Evangelion like every other anime under the sun. One of the girls performs a ritual that kills off every human being on the planet and turns them into glowing orbs so that our plant life sovereign can reign supreme in a manner that would make Poison Ivy blush. No, I am not kidding. That is actually what happens, and before you guys start thinking \"hey, that actually sounds pretty awesome\", note that a sequel adapting the true route that will no doubt retcon the ending harder than Aldnoah Zero did after its three-month break is coming out next season because the creators were so confident that die-hard fans would want it after sitting through this misery. Starting right at the end of this sentence, you have one second to name a single anime where keeping the prologue and the actual meat of the story divided into two distinct series was a good idea. Time's up. That's what I thought.\\n\\n\r\nI am not exaggerating when I say there is literally no audience for this show at all. If you're a fan of the visual novel, you'll be turned off by the insipid adaptation choices that basically scream \"fuck it, if they paid full price for that Little Busters anime, they'll pay full price for this\". And if you're not a fan, you'd be clawing your eyes out at the complete lack of fun on screen assuming you can work up the interest necessary to acknowledge Rewrite's existence in the first place. I don't know how well the blu-rays sold, but the number can't be high. I mean we're living in an age where the fujoshi market makes up the numbers now and Rewrite definitely doesn't have much in the way of manservice for fangirls to slobber over. The only people I can possibly see enjoying this show are those with a lead pipe shoved in your brain's front lobe, and if that's the case, it'd be cheaper and more exciting to just shove poo down the pipe's hole.",

            "content": "The idea of having an anime original content is something that can be rather double-edged when it comes to adaptations. It can either be something that can go and help with the narrative point of view of the series, or it can make things easier for the series in question for certain reasons. \r\nFor Rewrite's case however, where does it stand around with this? ever since they made the announcement of the anime series coming around, they did announced the staff members, mainly the director being Motoki Tanaka (aka the director behind series such as Kiniro Misaic and the Grisaia series) along with the additionof them making an anime original route, in order for \"make people understand this easier\" to say the least around. The idea itself doesn't sound bad on paper due to the circumstances of the original Visual Novel, but where does it really lead up to? We'll find out, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you my anime review of Rewrite.\\n\\n\r\nPlease before you continue with this review, I might tell you guys some warnings throughout here. The first warning is that yes, I will spoil some plot points in order to make my point across on my opinion of the anime overall, that also includes things that are connected to the original source material in order to justify my reasons for the negatives and the positives.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing is that if you disagree with this review, that's completely fine, everyone has their own personal opinion on shows so that's something I can understand on that. Without further ado, let's begin:\\n\\n\r\nStory:  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in a place called Kazamatsuri, the beautiful home of our Main Protagonist, Tennouji Kotarou. Our main protagonist has this ability, which he gets drawn around in the Supernatural Phenomenon, and one day he meets up with the Occult Club President, Akane Senri, as then, Kotarou would start recruiting new members to the club, and usually living the daily life being in there, until certain moments happens within the series where it changes their paths forever.\\n\\n\r\nNow you see, the thing about this series is that I have a lot of mixed feelings towards it, so of course this might go a bit confusing but I'll try to keep it simple, or at least attempt to. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, for the first half it did a decent job at a lot of things more than the wrong, just because for one, I believe it did a decent job at condensing the amount of hours because if they extended the dialogue a lot, at the same time dragging this for the period of time (lets say focusing this on an entire season of sorts) a lot of people would get bored of it, and it would basically become a chore to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI think while having a good concept as how Rewrite just showed, it shouldn't be dragged out a lot because it then becomes rather slow and at the same time it would bore the person, probably. If I was the one watching this and then for example I haven't read the source, depending, I would feel tiring and before we even get there I might have fallen asleep with it.\\n\\n\r\nIn a sense, Rewrite's anime did a pretty good job at that and condensing the Slice of Life aspects through.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the second thing that I give props to the anime is basically some of the anime original jokes which are for example the Fart joke from one of the first few episodes (I'm not gonna lie I did laughed at that) as well with few references in the middle parts of the first half. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the episodes that were focused around the characters were done decently, and for example Shizuru's Beginning of her route or, her route taken place in Common still, it was done pretty nicely and it was condensed pretty alright, and as a standalone it was pretty good because it gives a solid background to her story. I give props to the anime at that stance for it.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the first half's downsides are a few things that I got in mind:\\n\\n\r\n- Some of the Original Things that they added don't really add much in the end (which I will explain later on in the problems of the second half)\\n\\n\r\n- Lucia's Route (which was taken 2 weeks before the certain event happens) was probably the worst contender of this first part, the reason why I say this it's because the way they condensed it didn't really helped in their favour, in fact, compared to Shizuru's Route which was done rather nicely since the pacing was good and slow, this one felt abrupt. \\n\\n\r\nIt seemed like they immediately forgot how to pace out the moments for the route and this doesn't even take 1 episode, it would most likely take 2 for at least to cover part of her story, and even the shifting of events are pretty weird placed because in one moment for example, Lucia and Kotarou were in the room talking and revealing her curse, and then the next moment we're at the church right now. I don't think that's a good transition at all in all honesty. \\n\\n\r\nIt's basically like moving from my own house having a happy and jolly time, towards a sad scene where a friend of mine died, there's no actual in between for the scenes and it just feels and looks awkward and it makes a lot of people question what the fuck happened between the time gap between those two scenarios. Compared to how they handled Shizuru's ending point, this one felt like a poorly written and executed route, and well I'd say before anyone goes and argues about the 2 other parts, that's not really needed for certain reasons, at the end, point being, is that the way they handled Lucia's first half of her end was pretty weak by comparison.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while I don't think this is the worst part of the show, it is quite disappointing how they handled her this way, and it's because of the amount of time that first half takes for her end, which actually left me on a mixed bagged feelings about it. It is probably the worst part about the first half.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as for the second half this is probably the big mix, and this is where I will point out something. The idea of an anime original route is NOT a bad idea on paper, the reason why I'm saying that the idea isn't bad in the case it is because in the original Visual Novel, it is quite difficult to adapt different plotlines in which, will connect to the second season, and also, it takes a lot of episodes' worth to even focus on all of those things including certain plot points to where it connects to the true routes, so they wanted to take the easier approach to do an anime original \"6th Route\" which was supposed to be focused around Kagari. The BIG problem with the second half are basically these:\\n\\n\r\n- Remember when I said that some of the stuff that they added in the first half didn't helped much? Well, in the second half they pretty much made most of it rather pointless. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, in one of the first half episodes they introduced Midou, which is one of the major characters of the series that goes around in the second half. In the second half however, in my eyes they treated him pretty much like fodder, in which they literally gave no actual background to him to know him as a character, and in the next episodes, they pretty much decided to pull a middle finger and just take him off. I feel like this is one of the major problems of the show which kinda sours me.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing that comes around is Lucia, and remember when I said that her route was pretty much condensed only for the first half? I wouldn't really mind this, as apparently she was supposed to play a major role in the second half. \\n\\n\r\nGuess what happens? She pretty much looks even more useless in the second half. The problem I have with this for her is that, in one of the episodes she was pretty much fighting against Midou, and in that episode they pretty much gave some sort of point where she would want to protect Kotarou and everyone else, and that in itself would have been a great thing in some way because it then brings a bit of reality towards Kotarou and to how he was going to go and shake things off, basically to try to explain it more shortly, in that episode, they could pretty much bring a bigger impact towards the characters. \\n\\n\r\nBut then what happens? She survives, but not only that, right? Where is her actual role around here? If the role was pretty much go and Pretend to be dead then that's just actually pointless, it takes away a lot of the tension and possible buildup towards the show and it's even worse when you don't really utilize her further. I wouldn't even mind if she was alive as long as they could make her role useful, or at least position. In the end that's probably another sour moment throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that I need to point out is that, the series isn't really well explained, further into it, there's a main conflict within the series which, the anime really never have made it cleared for those that are anime onlies, and only those that knows about the Original Source would know what it is, and that in itself is bad because it then would either cause confusion or when they watch the second season, it will pretty much be difficult for them to understand, and only those that have read it would probably try to explain it. Because of this, its really hard to get the message across for my perspective.\\n\\n\r\nLastly and not only... the amount of repetitive, and forced comedy. This is probably the biggest issue around the entire Original Route, and this is pretty much where I would have to explain a bit into it. I wouldn't mind the comedy in this route, if they didn't repeat the same joke over, and over, and over, and over, about the Fee Coffee and then the Boob grabbing, and the boob grabbing is the lesser thing that bugged me. But, repeating the same comedy skit again and again doesn't make it more funny, it makes it even more boring, and worse, it takes away the tension from the certain situations as well. And only few episodes worked well with the comedy skit, at least the Fee Coffee wise. It was only on the first few episodes of the second half, and those were actually funny because they weren't recycled, but when you constantly use it, over and over, it wouldn't help much and it will feel like the audience will have a major headache out of it.\\n\\n\r\nThis all causes the majority of the execution to fall poor and very flat, the idea in itself for the original route isn't bad, the problem comes from how it was executed majority of the time in there. It doesn't help the series in itself to make things easier at most, in fact it hurts the series because there's no clarification, lack of consistency and a lack of explanation at a lot of cases, including the pacing in itself. Those are my major complaints around the second half from a perspective.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there were very much a lot of downs, I do will give it where it's due with the second half and one of the things that I will give towards it, it's around one of the messages that the anime displayed it easier, which was basically the sense of not wanting to be in this fate, and they would want to be normal. That's basically one of the messages that the Original VN has, but it really hasn't been that noticeable, and as much as the story did wrong in this half, it did that thing right in its own.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I will give credit to the second half is the ending itself, as it was a decent buildup towards the second season, which is coming around pretty soon. The ending pretty much ended as I expected it to be, with then hinting the scene with Kagari at the end, which hoping the second season does justice on the manner.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think Rewrite's story in this anime is pretty mediocre overall, it started off decently with minor issues within the show, but the second half was pretty much a middle finger and giving more wrong than right, in the end cause a lot of inconsistency, explanation and clarification throughout, which will be hard to understand in the runtime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThis is pretty much another thing that falls around flat and poor a bit. The problem with this as well is that majority of the characters in Rewrite's anime had either their backstories skipped (for example Chihaya's) towards being butchered or just poorly executed, to be frankly honest. \\n\\n\r\nMajority of the cast lacked any further background and were given little snippets of their backstories, and the only backstory that was handled decently was Shizuru's. \\n\\n\r\nDespite how everyone or a lot of people says that her route was rushed in the past, it was well paced by comparison, given to how short that section of her route was and second, the way they utilized it was pretty much more of an opening connection towards Kotarou as a character and for Shizuru as well, and at least it did something very decently over there on the manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters barely had any clarification towards their backstories (exception of Kotarou for reasons), a lot of them are either unexplained, have been explained but poorly executed, have been explained but finely executed, but somehow wasn't of any much of use, etc. \\n\\n\r\nIt all depends around which character I'm talking about, for example Akane's end wasn't really explained further and well, basically it leaves to confusion at the hand, as for Lucia's end her end was basically condensed rather poorly as explained in the story's part, Chihaya's was never explained in her and her backstory is important for the later parts of the second season for reasons. Kotori's was explained fine and well, however there's something that left rather shallowed.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other casts, I wouldn't really say much but given to how it was handled here, it will affect a lot in the later parts of the series at least to my eyes, but they do bring importance in the story but I won't go and explain further, I will only say that because of how the second half turned out, it will affect a lot of the stuff in the later parts, unless you have read the original Visual Novel.\\n\\n\r\nAs for personality, I'd say the main cast got some pretty decent characterization, and pretty much enough to make them feel like they have some liveliness within them, so that's pretty much a plus.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, on the character department it's pretty much the weakest, due to how a lot of the characters have poorly handled backgrounds or have not really explained them at the slightest amount, with some pretty decent characterization towards them as a positive side.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\r\nNow we're going to talk about the production side of Rewrite. As you already know, this anime is produced by 8bit, also known as the studio behind works such as Infinite Stratos, Absolute Duo, Tokyo Ravens, Comet Lucifer, etc. \\n\\n\r\nIn the production stance, Rewrite doesn't really look like the worst in their production side but, the art does go and drop a lot after the first episode, and that's mostly because of the horrible schedule the staff has for this production because of the company at hand (Aniplex), and they have to rely on a lot of stuff (or from what I remembered the helping studios) in order to make it look good, but it still looked like completely bad by standards due to a lot of massive derps put into it and it's all because of the horrible schedule they received, along with the huge amount of lighting that usually would bug a photographer.\\n\\n\r\nYou know when you try to go and take a picture with one of those high quality cameras, but then someone tries and ruins it for you by turning the brightness up to 5 or max, and it then looks completely horrible where it ruins the atmosphere? Picture Rewrite in your head, with that imagery, and just take a moment to think. The artwork that already looks bad enough from the facial structure towards the body forms, looks worse when you put a light at the side of the backgrounds, and if the backgrounds looks beautiful in there, they're probably ruined by the big amount of lighting it puts around in the outside of certain places.\\n\\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong, lighting in here can work at times, like for example when few occasions when the main protagonist is in the Club at night time, or when the side of the Club is pretty dark, those types works pretty decently and it doesn't look like completely dark, but it doesn't work in other occasions in the show.\\n\\n\r\nFor the CGI, I'll say this, for the most part... it's pretty bad. They're pretty much poorly rendered and hardly any fluidity on them, and it feels like they're either stiff or just not fitting at all, and in some cases for the CGI it doesn't even need CGI for some of the monsters displayed, some of them are even easy to draw around, so it is rather sour at the end when it comes to this.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the animation goes, it's a hit or miss for majority of the times. In some cases the animation looked alright, some of them pretty average, and well... being real, a lot would pretty much look inconsistent with the amount of animators given, and it doesn't look pretty fluid either, and compared to Episode 1's Nonaka animation which gives fluidity and life towards the characters, in the later episodes it doesn't really deliver much, which is disappointing in a sense because I really liked the animation from Nonaka's end.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's also a shame as well, since this series is supposed to be action-focused as well so it should give some pretty nice battle choreography and fluid animation in that stance, and even the Aurora doesn't really look that pleasing by comparison. \\n\\n\r\nIt looks like it lacked any flavor or consistency and we only see that in the first episode and in bits and pieces of the final episode, plus some decent animation when it came towards the episode between Midou and Lucia, despite some inconsistency around, it still was pretty alright... when you have that, it's pretty bad. Even by action genre standards.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plus, I will give the show this, the character designs looks nice and adorable, but I am talking more about the Nonaka designs, from the drafts towards the PVs, even Episode 1 and some certain moments when the designs look okay, it does look nice. So I'll give it a plus around, the color usage isn't bad either, I did liked the brightness colors around for this series.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound/Voice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nNow we're going to the part where I usually like about the anime, but I'll pretty much get into the music first, but we'll talk about the sound department first.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound department, let me tell you this. Who hired this person to be in here and why? and don't get me wrong I don't mind first timers a lot, in fact there are few weird occasions where a newbie staff member would come to such big projects and for my end it's pretty much rare to get a good solid start or first-timer. So that isn't much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nBut the sound directing for this anime is pretty horrible, even worse than Berserk 2016's sound directing when it came to the \"CLANG CLANG\" sounds from the sword. The sound consists of a lot of loud noises and at times even covering or just disturbing the music while certain moments happens, and it's not really pleasing to the ears because it will pretty much explode them. \\n\\n\r\nFrom what I got this person mostly is a producer, so while I don't have anything against the person, they should need to work on the sound parts further, since this is clearly not a good thing when it comes to watching this show. It disturbs the ears and it pretty much for me leaves me deaf around, wanting to go and just check on other things further afterwards. Or they could replace that person with another sound director or someone that handles the sound department better, because I don't really think this would work well for this show with these type of sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nNow as for the music? I'd say this, they played the Original Soundtracks at most for this adaptation, and a lot of times it works for the scenes, sometimes it really doesn't in certain situations. Some of the OSTs don't even last that long, they only endure depending on the music like 5-10 seconds more, it pretty much either feel painfully useless or rather weirded out. However, there were some compositions that fits well in certain situations, like for example Koibumi in Episode 4 which fits pretty well throughout for Shizuru's end. Same with other compositions such as the Kotarou vs Esaka fight.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of that, I might give credit where its due to this as well, while having the OST from the Visual Novel, we do have some arrangements of the soundtracks or remakes, there was a piano version of the ending of the season which is the ED for Havest Festa, as well as the Piano version of the song \"Rewrite\". Also there there was an arrangement for the Kotarou vs Esaka fight which was great to listen towards.\\n\\n\r\nFor the OPs and EDs they're pretty good arrangements at least for the main ones, since depending on the episodes they might enter the characters' respective ending songs around, but for the main OPs and EDs, they're good to listen to, especially the 2nd ED of the anime, sang by Aoi Tada, which brings this beautiful tone to it which makes my ears ring of happiness.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the voice acting, at most they did a good job with their performances, while the most lively one was Kotarou, since I did loved Morita's voice acting in the later parts of the Original source, so seeing him bringing Kotarou to life around here is pretty lovely to listen to, as well with the other character voice actors bringing life to their own despite how the show turned out in the end. Especially Kotori's end, though my major complaint is probably Kagari's voice acting but that goes more towards the final episodes, there's a reason for that in all honesty.\\n\\n\r\nThe Personal Point:\\n\\n\r\nI'll pretty much be honest, despite how the anime turned out from those flaws, it did somehow felt enjoyable, and yes there were half and half issues with the story, and at the same time there were some under development throughout the anime, however my enjoyment for at least mostly the first half was pretty good, it was fun, enjoyable, and pretty much nice to see the characters animated, despite how the series went of course for a lot of reasons, and it is a shame really, as I didn't enjoyed the second half more than the first due to how poorly executed it went throughout with the inconsistency of the writing and the forced Fee Coffee joke.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Opinion:\\n\\n\r\nShould you give Rewrite a shot? Well, it just goes towards you, but if I can go and suggest, I'd suggest to go and read the Original Visual Novel more, and it's not only because of the flaws of the series that I have mentioned, it is because since the second season is in the works, and it's pretty close to coming around, I'm suggesting you guys to go and read it because just in case if the anime does go and do things correctly, either way, it will be confusing for the anime onlies, but that depends for each person but I do assume a lot will be even more confused than the usual. If you want to go to the anime, and want to see it, then go ahead and check it out. Who knows, you may end up liking it perhaps? But that's all up to you in the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnd also in the end for this review, I don't really hate this adaptatio (as I stated as long as they are enjoyable in a way), but I do think it could have done so much more than what it just delivered, or anything of the sorts, but I do hope that the second season becomes better, hopefully? Who knows. We'll just have to wait and see when the second season arrives.",

            "content": "This is one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen, and easily the worst Key anime to date.  8-bit, Tensho, and the entire staff should be ashamed of what was produced here.  This Rewrite adaptation is in the similar vein as M Night Shyamalans \"The Last Airbender\" adaptation where you have characters with the same names and some of the story elements, but presented without soul and crushed down until it possesses none of its quality.  The original source material wasn't perfect.  In fact I would deem it inconsistent and flawed, but it was refreshingly different from other works fromKey and was a very interesting read.  However, to see it degraded to this ugly mess was utterly depressing.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10 (atrocious)\\n\\n\r\nSeriously!?  Who is this adaptation for?  Studio 8-shit thought it was a great idea to horribly rush events directly from the VN for the first half, and then go anime original into a rushed incomprehensible second half.  Like... if you don't have the time to adapt it and were going to make most of it original, you might as well have made it completely anime original.  If you wanted to adapt the whole thing then trying to do it in merely 13 episodes was a terrible idea in the first place.  The first half will immediately turn off people who haven't read the novel since it appears to be something generic with rapid tonal swings and horrible pacing.  The second half only goes out of its way to give fans of the novel the finger by creating a train-wreck of several side routes combined into a weird anime original clusterfuck with only one frigging thing original outside of the source material.  Finally if your a Key fan, you will be so emotionally distant from the generic underdeveloped characters that if you were hoping for the famous \"feels\" you won't even get that.  There are many elements of the story that will probably seem incomprehensible to new viewers, and when you need the source material to understand what is going on, then it has failed utterly as an adaptation.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10 (terrible)\\n\\n\r\nIncredibly thin and underdeveloped.  Like the other flawed Key anime Charlotte, most of them only have time to be defined by some single trait that is repeated for punchlines.  \"Pervert and lets be BFF generic\" Kotarou, the ribbon girl loves coffee, Chihiya is a dumb jock, you have tsundere \"don't touch me pervert\" Lucia, you have \"cute loli that defends protagonist no matter what\" Shizuru.  I don't even remember what they gave Kotori as a character in the anime.  Two of the characters are given backstories with some scenes that feel like they were on fast forward... I am not even kidding, all of it is so rushed that even as someone who read the novel, I was BARELY able to follow, and felt disconnected pretty quickly.  When you speed up events with no flow or breathing time, it ends up moving too fast for you to digest and process what is going on and what you should be feeling.  The result is a rapid slideshow summarizing whats going on without giving you time or space to feel or care about the events on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only two characters in the show that could be somewhat entertaining.  One of them is in it for like 10 minutes (Yoshino), and the other was the ribbon girl who ironically has the least personality in the original source material.  The ribbon girl has an anime original circumstance that occurs, and there is a charm to her that sort of works for a single episode that I thought was passable.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it was when I saw the final episode that I realized how terrible the cast was treated in this horrid adaptation.  You see characters being injured, dying, yelling and screaming in a chaotic battle with supposed high stakes in the air.  Yet, despite having read about them for 50+ hours in the novel, I simply watched bored and emotionally disconnected from everything happening onscreen.  I didn't care about any of these characters that I remembered liking so much from the visual novel.  None of the charm, fun, or heart of these characters were there.  They were became nothing but hallow shells carrying their names.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 3/10 (terrible)\\n\\n\r\nRewrite looks ugly.  The art and animation is somewhat passable for the first couple episodes, and then it takes a quality nosedive in the second half.  8-shit decided to make this show CGI heavy and the result is atrocious.  It honestly gives Berserk 2016 a run for its money in awfulness.  I hate the character designs, which look too small and way too \"cutesy\" for my liking.  The character are very often off-model and look awful in motion at times.  Tensho, the director, is also very weak at framing good actions sequences so even if your just there for decent spectacle it can't even manage that.  Plus, a personal gripe, why is the lighting always so bright?  Jesus!!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 (very good)\\n\\n\r\nLike... the one saving grace?  Maybe?  Something good to say about this trash is the soundtrack that was taken straight from the visual novel...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nI honestly wished this anime didn't exist.  The fans of the visual novel and of Key deserve much better than this.  I feel very bad for people who loved the original material and was expecting something good.  Unfortunately this isn't the adaptation you were looking for.  If you aren't a fan of either Key or the novel, I don't recommend this either since there are much better options out there.  This entire adaptation needs a rewrite, and from a studio that doesn't rhyme with shit.  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

It is not impossible to create a perfect depiction or adaptation of a VN, a fine example would be Clannad which just happens to be another Key VN.\r\nI am not saying it has to follow through the VN's story completely, I am fine with many new plot twists because new content actually excites me. However it is obvious that 13 episodes is not long enough to condense the story of a VN no matter how much you twist and turn the storyline. I wouldn't hold my breathe for the announced 2nd season either.\r\nMyadvise to whoever is interested in picking up Rewrite is, play the VN first then watch the anime. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, my experience with Rewrite the video game has been truly astounding. The animated adaption has only served me as fanservice.",

            "content": "Rewrite. The second highest rated Key Visual Novel on VNDB, only surpassed by Clannad. Something more than well worth reading, in my eyes. \r\nThat's not what this anime is, at all. Not only was it hardly an adaptation with its gratuitous anime original content, but they managed to ruin any small thing they did adapt. \r\nTherefore, I'm going to review this while trying to put aside my thoughts of the original material.  \r\nStory: 1/10.\r\n-What is the premise? What am I watching? Where is the plot?- All questions asked throughout Rewrite's duration. None of which were answered. The fact is, this series had no direction.We have \"twists\" that are in no way surprising, and generally poorly executed. We have info dump after info dump of information that in the end, really amounted to nothing, and yet we still were left with a plethora of questions. We also got an ending with a vague after credits scene to try and lure us into the next season. A complete, and utter mess. The only reason I rate this a 2, is due to the fact there was a beginning and end, something that I admittedly cannot say for some anime series. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\n-While obviously lacking, and rather flat, I can't say I have much to complain about on this front. It was derpy, but hey, with the schedule Aniplex gave 8-bit, who can blame them?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 2/10\\n\r\n-The Sound Director for this series... was not originally a sound director. Poorly placed BGMs that blended together awfully, despite being very pretty on their own. Cringe like screams and grunts that generally felt unnatural. Only thing redeeming was the OST itself, which is absolutely perfect. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\n-A large cast of characters, of which really only two were given any real development, which even then was minimal. Felt nothing for them, and little to no attachment to them existed. Only rated 2/10 because none of them were bad characters, just very two dimensional and forgetful. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\n-When the pacing and overall themes are so much of a mess they don't make sense, things go south quickly. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I would've dropped this at around Episode 3, if not for my fondness of the somewhat related original material. The show on its own didn't feel like a chore, but wasn't something I particularly looked forward to. I honestly wouldn't reccomend this anime to anyone, even to people who enjoy the genre. If it must be anime, I would have to reccomend something else. \\n\\n\r\nI do hope that the second season, supposedly adapting the later parts of the original, will be done well. I assume the only people watching it will be fans, or people who actually enjoyed the first season. If that's the case, let's hope for the best. :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "I had to write a review for this. Because Rewrite is my favorite Key work of all-time. Because it deserved better than this.\r\nIf you are wondering if this anime is worth your time, I say this: if the premise catches your eye, or the character designs, or anything at all, I absolutely implore you to check out the original visual novel. It's deep. It's beautiful inside and out. It's got a message that cannot be ignored. None of which can be said about this travesty of an adaptation. 8bit did not know what they were doing, and do not deserve five hours of your timespent here. Avoid this trainwreck at all costs.\\n\\n\r\nThe story jumps around like a pinball in a dryer. There is no semblance of cohesive storytelling to be found. It takes bits and chunks of the branching \"routes\" from the visual novel and attempts to tie them together in a haphazard, charmless sort of way. At first I wondered if this was on purpose, like the show was just meant to be a treat for people who have already read the source material it is based on, but no. No reader of the visual novel can find anything redeemable at how badly 8bit botched this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters have been derailed extensively. Shizuru, Lucia, and especially Kagari act in ways that are unthinkable for their VN counterparts. Kagari is supposed to be an ominous, mysterious entity, a legitimate threat to Kotarou's peaceful life and instead becomes a caffeine-addicted, narcissistic victim of fart jokes.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that Rewrite gets right is the music. It's taken straight from the visual novel, some truly great pieces that practically tell a story all by themselves. The voice actors are all returned to reprise their roles for this adaptation, but Chiwa Saitou, whose turn as Kotori Kanbe made the character one of the most beloved in the novel, sounds almost chronically bored. It's a shame, but I think even she saw that this script and this adaptation would be lovingly omitted from any resumes she makes going forward. Kana Hanazawa, my favorite seiyuu of all-time, returns as Kagari, but I've already mentioned how badly they've botched her character, and it feels like KanaHana knew it too. She puts forth only just enough effort to keep the dysfunctional train on the tracks.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is dreadful. The characters, whose designs are lovingly detailed in the visual novel, are reduced to frilly moeblobs with very little detail. There are some decent panning shots of Kazamatsuri, but that's about it. And the CG monsters that crop up routinely during the show are just about at the point where they might have looked passable in a 1980s Gundam show. But it's now 2016, and these CG dinosaurs and leaf dragon look pitiful. Perpetually locked at somewhere south of 18 frames per second, it feels like you're watching a particularly unappealing PlayStation 2 game.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this is something to be avoided. I thought I had learned my lesson when I watched their dreadful Absolute Duo adaptation, but at least that was a case where the source material was also uninspired and trite, so 8bit could be almost excused for going through the motions in adapting it. Rewrite is not only great, but a downright tome of greatness, with nearly 100 hours of content. There was no way they were going to be able to do it justice with just 13 episodes, but I would have at least respected an honest attempt to try. Instead, I got a fanservice-laden clusterfuck of scenes that go nowhere, schizophrenic pacing, dull action scenes, and an ending that teases the inevitable second cour. I'll be taking a pass on that, 8bit. Don't take it personal. I'll be too busy \"Rewriting\" my brain to cleanse it from this disaster.\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time, may the Song of Destruction be heard all across 8bit's headquarters.",

            "content": "The first two episodes are funny school life characterization stuff that was genuinely enjoyable to watch. Then the mystery, supernatural, and action elements begin to become more prevalent, and my interest dived.\r\nThis anime is plagued with issues. Some of them have to do with having too much source material to adapt and thus make the anime feel rushed or overall poorly paced. I will not be talking about those issues.\r\nEven if an anime is poorly paced, there is a limit to how much an anime can jump from one scene to the next with wildly different tones without it being jarring. One scene can seempretty tense and traumatic, and then the next scene goes to a short BS school drama thing and sours all of the emotion of the previous scene. The characters act as if they have NO MEMORY of past events unless the plot demands it, and it screams bad writing. This occurs from the very first episode and doesn't stop until the plot kicks into high gear around episode 8-ish (your mileage may vary). \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is serviceable in the slice-of-life-y portions, but in action scenes apart from maybe the last episode, the animation is cringe at times and almost laughably bad at others, especially with the anime's heavy use of CG. Even when the characters are standing still, I don't remember any points where they looked great. There is nothing visually interesting in this show, which really hurts it since some characters are supposed to be super powerful and action is supposed to play up the tension in some areas.\\n\\n\r\nThese two things alone make the anime painful to watch, but if you are willing to look past them, then you might find a surprisingly interesting story with a few twists. The problem is that the storytelling is bad enough that you might not see the story. \\n\\n\r\nAt the very least, I kind of liked the ending, for both ironic and non-ironic reasons. It sort of hints at the possibility of a continuation. Idk, it could go either way, but I can't say I'm excited to see another whole season with this kind of quality.\\n\\n\r\nMy advice: Maybe watch the first two episodes. If it looks something like you'd be interested in experiencing, stop watching and figure out some way to play the game. The anime has a different story from the routes in the game, but every route in the game is probably way better than the anime so don't look back.",

The show follows him as he joins the Occult Club to research supernatural phenomena along with several girls from his school. He is also followed by a mysterious ribbon-wearing girl named Kagari who kills him in one of his dreams, causing Kotarou to consider her a threat.\r\nThe anime is split into two story arcs with the first being the better one out of the two. In the arc, Kotarou learns a lot about the girls during their club activities. At times he isalso attacked by mysterious creatures forcing him to use his abilities to survive. The overall story of the arc is interesting and later takes a lot of unexpected turns. At times however, the plot can seem a bit rushed and may leave the viewer with a lot of questions.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc mostly follows the ribbon girl, Kagari, as Kotarou learns more about who she is and why she\u2019s following him. Although the arc starts out pretty well, in the end it turns into a rushed mess with the anime trying to explain all the questions raised earlier in a way too short span of time. It also does constant twists that are all done in such a short amount time they only end up confusing the viewer. The ending feels like it was intended to be the something amazing but the writers simply didn\u2019t have the time or the talent to execute it properly. In the end it turns out to be nothing but random events and twists happening constantly with the viewer having barely any idea of what\u2019s going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe interactions between the characters were the best parts about the show for me. One of the most enjoyable things about the first arc was watching Kotarou and the girls living their school lives and doing Occult Club activities. Also, the first half of the second arc, which heavily features both Kagari and Kotarou, was the best part about the otherwise lackluster arc for me.\\n\\n\r\nKotarou is very different from the characters in other Key series. He doesn\u2019t have the personality of the typical harem protagonist, making him one of the most unique main characters in a Key anime. Kagari starts out as an emotionless character but later on goes through a change and learns about the positive aspects of humans. The girls in the Occult Club are also very interesting characters. At first, they seem to be there just to create the harem setting most Key series are known for, but throughout the anime it\u2019s revealed that there\u2019s more to them than meets the eye. Some of the girls also have interesting backstories. While they help flesh out their characters, they end up feeling a bit too rushed to have any kind of emotional impact present in other Key anime. The show also feels way too short for the amount of characters in it which leads to a lot of the side characters not getting nearly enough screen time.\\n\\n\r\nI have some mixed feelings about the animation. The 2D animation for the most part is decent but can dip a lot in quality in certain scenes. There are still certain moments in the series such as the first ending theme that I feel are really well done. The 3D animation is definitely one of the weakest points in the series. It can be very low quality and feel out of place in a lot of the scenes that use it. Even the frame rate in some of the 3D scenes is very low, which should be unacceptable for a pre-rendered scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really good which is to be expected from a Key series. It fits the overall theme of the show really well and does a good job supporting a lot of the scenes. I also liked the opening and ending themes as well as the voice actors of the show. One of the noteworthy performances to me was Hanazawa Kana voicing Kagari as I felt like she did a good job portraying the curious nature of this mysterious ribbon girl as she learns about the daily lives of other people.\\n\\n\r\nI have a lot of mixed feelings about Rewrite. The show has its moments but ends up being way too rushed. It has a lot of potential with the story and the characters being interesting but suffers from poor execution. The anime felt like it was way too short to properly tell its story and flesh out all the characters. I\u2019d recommend skipping it unless you\u2019re a big Key Studios fan.\\n",

            "content": "Ill write the same review as I did with the second season. If you just watched season 1 or haven't watched a season feel free to read because I didn't really wrote any spoilers\r\nWhen I watch, finish, understand and feel an Anime I get depressed after I finish it, thats how I rate an anime. \r\nThis anime made me feel mixed emotions specially at the end of the two seasons. The end of season 1 was depressing and could have kept me depressed for a long time if I watched it while it was being aired but since I watched it  late season 2was already waiting for me. Of course that didn't lessen the impact the scenes gave. Plot wise id say it made my feelings dance. Specially season 1 where there are good mix of comedy specially between Kotarou and Yoshino, Romance and friendship between Kotarou and his harem. The lacking of action was understandable and it was also Okay considering their  age in season 1. \\n\\n\r\n Season 2 was kinda depressing specially after you build up ships and favorites in season 1. But it gave a new taste to the anime too and kinda a huge leap in terms of character development for the characters. The first episode was really emotional and may confuse other people(I wasn't) but those scenes was really specially to how the story will progress around Kotarou. Personally I didn't ship any because it was kinda obvious already AND I didn't really like Kagiri character wise but plot wise she did blend well. The ending may also confuse some people but if you look at episode 1 and the major happenings in season 1 you will understand why Kotarou progressed to that. It was very depressing but it kinda gives you that peace in mind knowing what happened and you can already guess what will happen even if the anime didn't continue. \\n\\n\r\nIn short I describe this anime as \"Having a Beautiful Story and Character design.\" I'm guessing not everyone will like it and of course it didn't reach the mainstream flatform but that's okay because this anime is really special",

            "content": "KEY Anime Adaptations plus those KEY Original Anime have been disappointing me for the past few years because of poor handling of said series and the goddamn pacing. I get that producing a 2-cour series is expensive than 1-cour but due to how KEY's story structure is set-up, 1 cour is NEVER going to work. \r\n[Story]: (5/10)\r\nA lot of KEY fans who read the Rewrite VN hyped this series even though the red flags were already raised and flying. I do understand why though. Firstly, it's a KEY work. Their works are usually really great with great story and amazing characters. Secondly, I just startedplaying the VN 2 weeks ago and it's a lot better than the anime but I'm not going to do a lot of VN - Anime comparisons for this review. I'm just going to write this review as if I'm writing this with no knowledge of the source material. What were the red flags you ask? For starters, 8bit is handling the adaptation and the director is the same director who also directed that messy VN anime adaptation called \"Grisaia no Kajitsu\". I mean, need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nWe all thought that 8bit was going to prove themselves by producing a 1 hour 1st episode. Turns out that wasn't the case. The biggest problem with Rewrite is how rushed the series is. The story wasn't even bad, by any means, but most of the time, the story can get really confusing because of how rushed it is and how they spend little-to-no time explaining what the hell is going on. The pacing did slow down a bit once the Common Route was over and switched up to the original route called \"Kagari's route\" (but it was still rushed as fuck) which wasn't present in the VN. Not like I have any problem with 8bit doing original route. That was kind-of the purpose of this anime adaptation. To advertise Rewrite and also, to present a new-original route for \"fans of the VN and new fans alike\". Notice the quotation marks? Take that quote as you may but my eyes were rolling when I read that quote.    \\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen a KEY anime work before before then you're familiar with how the show is going to be structured. Rewrite's first 7 episodes is basically the Common Route. It introduces the characters, show some happy and fun slice of life moments and all that crap. I already mentioned this but I'm going to say this again but the pacing pretty much ruined the first 7 episodes. How am I supposed to know the characters properly if the pacing is so rushed? I just didn't feel for the characters when the show decides to abruptly switches from a slice-of-life moment to dropping a dramatic character flashback right at my face. There's just no way in hell that's going to work if the show decides to focus on a certain female character for just 1 episode then her problem gets resolved at the end of the episode and switches to another female character in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nNow I want to talk about the episodes past episode 7. Episode 8 and the rest of the episodes after that was when the plot finally began. The show introduces us to the Guardian and Gaia organization. They both work differently so that's why they fight each other but they have the same goal. Saving the Planet. It's just that their ways of achieving their goal is completely different from one another. One of the organizations (I forgot who it was) decides to get rid of the humanity because of how they ruined the Planet Earth. Yes, the plot is like some Environmental Awareness ad, to remind us how we're ruining this planet and to also, probably, make us feel bad about our actions. Kagari is also a major character for this arc and she got more character development than the rest of the characters in the series. That's not really a praise since Kagari's character development was just too messy, really rushed and the development wasn't that much. There's also a few plot twists, here and there, like how Kagari is actually the Key....whatever the fuck that means...And etc. Some surprised me, some didn't and some I just didn't care. \\n\\n\r\nRewrites comedict aspect was a hit-or-miss. At times, it made me laugh and at times, it made me laugh...awkwardly. More like the show was trying to force me to laugh. I just didn't like Rewrite's sexual jokes. It was mostly Kotaru \"accidentally\" grabbing someone's breasts or that he always thinks about groping the \"president's boobs\". I'd like to think that Rewrite's fanservice was anime-original because there's no way in hell that these fanservice scenes are present in a VN that's rated for \"all ages\". \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (6/10)\\n\r\nI'm going to be in the minority here when I say this but I'm not really a fan of KEY's art style and the Character Designs in their VNs. I just find it really ugly. Because of those reasons, I prefer 8bit's Art Style and the anime's Character Design. Now, in terms of Rewrite's Animation, it's very mediocre. You can tell that 8bit wasn't given that much time to produce this series. Since Aniplex and a whole load of big-name companies are funding this production, I'm very sure that the Animation Issues that this show had wasn't because of Budget Issues. For example, when it came to the fighting scenes, the staff had to resort to cheap animation tricks because of time constraints. The fighting scenes didn't even look good and it's just very unappealing to watch. Even in the 2nd OP Animation, you can tell that the Animation was just crap. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that the staff did justice in this Anime Adaptation of a Visual Novel, it's the soundtrack. The VN's soundtrack sounds really good and it's one of KEY's best OSTs yet so I'm glad that 8bit kept most of the OST. Even the 1st OP and ED from the VN was also in the anime. As the show's OP and ED theme song. For the first 7 episodes, at least. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme songs are \"Philosophyz\" by Runa Mizutani and \"End of the World\" by Anri Kumaki. I'm really glad that 8bit reused and even remastered the 1st OP, even if it was only for the first 7 episodes. Right now, I love the anime version's OP way more than the VN version. The anime version sounds more modern and puts more emphasis on the background, something the VN version lacked. As for the 2nd OP, it sounds really weak compared to the 1st OP. It's not a shitty song, per say, but the 1st OP is miles better than the 2nd OP. However, I still like the 2nd OP though and I like it way more than the VN's 2nd OP. I hated that song and it baffles me that a lot of people even liked that song. So I'm glad that 8bit made their own OP instead of re-using/remastering the VN's 2nd OP. \\n\\n\r\nThe ED theme songs are \"Sasayaka na Hajimari\" by Runa Mizutani and \"Word of Dawn\" by Aoi Tada. You wouldn't believe how much I squealed when I heard the 1st ED in Ep.2. The VN's ED is one of the best ED's (Also in my Top 10) I've heard in a long-ass time and hearing the remastered version in the anime makes the 1st ED sound more beautiful. I also like the anime version more than the VN's version. Just like the 1st OP, they put more emphasis on the background and making it sound more modern which is the reason why I prefer the anime version. As for the 2nd ED, it sounds surprisingly great. I mean, it's not better than the 1st ED but it sounds really great and unlike the 2nd OP, the 2nd ED doesn't sound weak at all. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (5.5/10)\\n\r\nHonestly, the only characters that I liked in the series are Lucia and Kagari. I liked Lucia because she's a tsundere and I'm a big fan of tsundere girls. I also like Kagari because she's the only funny character in the series. As for everyone else, they could have been a lot better if they've gotten a lot more screentime. Or in other words, the series needed MORE THAN 13 episodes to flesh out the characters instead of rushing through their character development. Also, those 1 episode arc that focuses on Shizuru and Lucia was simply not enough for me to give a crap about their past and the problems that they were facing in the present. They were simply too rushed. \\n\\n\r\nNow I'm going to talk about some of the main characters. Kotarou Tennouji, the main protagonist of the series, is a high school student and has an ability called \"Rewrite\". I really have no more idea what to talk about him because his character is bland, his personality is really inconsistent, and he barely got any character development.  Why is his personality inconsistent, you ask? The guy doesn't have his own personality. His personality somehow switches depending on the girl that he hangs out with. The guy gets all perverted and idiotic around Akane (The president of the Occult club) but he acts differently when he's around with Kotori or Lucia. He's like a different person depending on the girl that he hangs out with and I just couldn't figure out his TRUE personality. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Kotori, a childhood friend of Kotarou. She seems like an innocent normal person at first who doesn't know anything about the supernatural things but then there's a plot twist about her. I was, honestly, surprised learning the truth about her. Then there's Chihaya, a girl with super-human strength. Chihaya felt like she was a non-existent character. The show didn't really focus that much on her. It's like she only got 5 mins. of screentime every 2-3 episodes. Hell, I didn't even know her name throughout the show. While the show was airing, I kept calling her the \"Orange-dressed Tsundere girl\". I wasn't even sure if she was a tsundere but since she was an almost non-existent character, I just don't care. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Akane Sunri, the president of the Occult club. She's a gamer because she can be constantly seen playing a FPS (First Person Shooter) game and she has the personality of \"Why the fuck am I here\" type of girl. Then there's Shizuru Nakutsu, a loli girl with an eye-patch that made her look like a chuunibyou at first but turns out, it was more than that and there was a reason why she was wearing an eye-patch. Then there's Lucia Konohana. All you need to know about her is she's a stereotypical tsundere girl who punches Kotarou from time to time and if you pay attention to her hand, there's a reason why she's constantly wearing a glove and that's where her 1 episode-arc will focus on. I admit, I enjoyed Lucia's arc but it could have been better. \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least is Kagari. A mysterious character who kept popping up on Kotarou's dream and making mysterious appearances on Kotarou's bedroom and his school. Kagari became my most favourite character in the series after episode 7 because I love her personality and she was really hilarious. Her jokes did become overplayed on the later parts of her arc. For example, her \"FEECOF\" jokes were funny at the start but became somewhat annoying at the end. I can't wait to see more of her in the next season because I heard from VN readers that she gets more focus on the \"Moon\" and \"Terra\" arc.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (6/10)\\n\r\nDespite how mediocre this series, I still somewhat enjoyed this series. The 2nd arc was more enjoyable and bearable then the \"Common Route\".  I wouldn't say that this is the worst anime I've ever seen because there's a whole lot more anime this year that's worse than Rewrite. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nRewrite could have been a great series if it had 26 episodes but sadly, it suffered the same fate as \"Charlotte\" and \"Angel Beats\". The story and the characters needed more than 13 episodes to flesh out the story and its characters. Instead, what we got is a series with a very rushed/poorly explained story and a cast of characters with barely any focus, screentime or character development. If you're a fan of the Rewrite VN or you're looking for a great KEY anime then Rewrite is not the anime you're looking for. Charlotte and Angel Beats were also rushed but not as rushed as Rewrite and those series were more bearable to watch than this. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (5.7/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Amazing Soundtrack, especially the remastered OP and ED theme songs from the VN\\n\r\n+Kagari's character is quite hilarious\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-The Pacing is very rushed\\n\r\n-Storyline can be a bit hard to follow due to how rushed the show is. \\n\r\n-Almost every characters in this series got little to no character development. \\n\r\n-Needed more than 13 episodes to flesh out its story and its characters\\n\r\n-Unnecessary Fan-service scenes\\n\r\n-Underwhelming Ending",

            "content": "This review is split into two sections:\r\n- The first section is devoted to those who are new to Rewrite and are contemplating watching the anime adaptation. This section is entirely spoiler free.\r\n- The second section is dedicated to those who have already read the Visual Novel. This section contains major spoilers.\r\nFirst Section (for people new to Rewrite)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAn Introduction: Key is a company that is renowned for its visual novels, most of which enjoy critical acclaim. Almost all these VNs have anime adaptations, which enjoy varying degrees of fame \u2013 be it Clannad, which holds the position of one of the top few anime of MAL,or Air, which is relatively unheard of. Whichever the case may be, the general consensus is that all these anime are quite good, since they all take advantage of the \u2018feels\u2019 factor (as in making the viewers attached to the characters and then making them feel some degree of emotional turmoil by putting those characters through adverse conditions). Rewrite is Key\u2019s latest flagship VN, which was released way back in 2011. While Rewrite was very successful in the market, it still took around 5 years for it to get an anime adaptation, which we see here today. I shall be going into some detail about this anime in the paragraphs to come.\\n\\n\r\nStory (3/10):\\n\r\nWhile the plot itself is passable, let me remind you that plot is not the only element under consideration in this section. The biggest issues with the story are the pacing and presentation. \\n\r\nThe pacing is extremely haphazard and the various scenes seem to jump from one to another without any concern for flow. This often ruins the impact of many important scenes and makes the viewer wonder what exactly is happening. The presentation of many scenes tend to unnecessarily give the viewers the wrong idea about these events of the anime, which can lead to a good deal of frustration.\\n\r\nWhen you try to cram a 60+ hour Visual Novel into a 13 episode anime, there are two possible outcomes \u2013 A badly paced rush-job or a completely different story. While Rewrite was supposed to have a different story from the VN, it has all the features of the former case. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10):\\n\r\nI knew that the short duration of the anime adaptation would limit the amount of character development that could be given to most characters, but I never expected it to be this terrible. \\n\r\nThe characters are extremely clich\u00e9d to begin with - a happy-go-lucky protagonist, a childhood friend girl, an \u2018aho\u2019 transfer student girl, a modern tsundere class rep girl, a healing presence/small furry animal type kouhai, a domineering yet lazy senpai, a mysterious loli and a chuunibyou delinquent \u2013 basically a buffet of all the stereotypical characters that you may find in any school-based anime, with some combinations thrown in the mix\u2026. And that\u2019s the good part.\\n\r\nA little later into the show, development is forced on the characters so hard that almost all of them feel broken by the end of it. Some of the characters are changed so much that they\u2019re not even the same characters any more. Viewers who are new to Rewrite will have a lot of difficulty understanding the behaviour and dialogues of many of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtracks and the OPs are just remixed versions of the same from the VN, but are still quite pleasant to the ears, though there are some moments where the soundtrack doesn\u2019t match the situation. The EDs are above average.\\n\\n\r\nArt (4/10):\\n\r\nThis is where the low budget of Rewrite really shows. The regular animation is passable at most times, though you\u2019ll find a lot of horribly warped faces and such if you happen to pause at the wrong moment. \\n\r\nIt also makes use of some really clunky CG at times, which serves to further ruin the effect. The main issue is that the scenes where CG is used tend to be rather important to the plot, thus decreasing the enjoyment of the series on the whole.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10):\\n\r\nThe anime version of Rewrite seems to be fan service aimed at those who have already read the VN. Those who are new to the series will find it extremely difficult to follow. It is quite dull for the majority of the episodes, while some episodes are mildly intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10):\\n\r\nYou\u2019d think that 8bit studios might have learned something from their extremely messy adaptation of the Grisaia trilogy, but guess what \u2013 Rewrite is an even bigger abomination. I had predicted that it would end up something like Charlotte\u2026 looks like I was mistaken \u2013 Charlotte is infinitely preferable to this.\\n\r\nAs I have already mentioned before, the main purpose of this adaptation seems to be \u2013 to appeal to the pre-existing fans and to advertise the source material. Both of these seemed to have failed rather miserably.\\n\r\nVerdict \u2013 Don\u2019t watch it. You\u2019re just spoiling a perfectly good Visual Novel for yourself. Even if you\u2019re not planning to read the VN, the anime is still not worth the effort. Give this one a pass unless you really want to waste a couple of hours of your time (for which there are far better methods and shows).\\n\\n\r\nSecond section (For the Rewrite veterans \u2013 HEAVY SPOILERS)\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nI\u2019ll mainly be talking about the story and characters in this section.\\n\r\nAs you may already know, the anime was supposed to follow an original route, which should give a brand new story. In fact, what we actually got here is an amalgamation of pretty much all the routes, done in a very messy fashion. \\n\r\nThe base is the Terra route, with a few scenes from the Moon route thrown in every now and then. The first parts (back-stories) of Lucia\u2019s and Shizuru\u2019s routes are given one episode each, while Chihaya and Kotori are largely ignored. Akane gets a little bit of time, but more focus is given to her transformation into the new prophet rather than anything else. Pretty much all of them are broken or close enough to make no difference. In fact, the only character who actually got a decent representation was Yoshino, short as his screen time was. Kagari is the most messed up of the lot, as they completely changed her personality\u2026 and not for the better.\\n\r\nIn the end, this anime can be considered a tutorial on \u2018How to butcher a perfectly good Visual Novel\u2019. If you absolutely must watch it, go in with zero expectations, with only the hope of revisiting the world of Rewrite. Otherwise, just don\u2019t bother.\\n\r\nWith this, I conclude.\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n",

            "content": "The potential of storytelling is truly limitless. Rich, vibrant realms can be created with the simplest of tools. Within them, characters can be given life, allowing us to form a compelling connection with whatever struggles they may face. But perhaps the greatest power which these stories can hold is the one to create impact--to inspire change within reality itself.\r\nThe Rewrite anime isn't one of those stories--not even close. It's unable to craft any sort of concrete narrative. Storylines which seemingly have no connection to each other are tenuously stapled together, in a similar manner to a child's hopes being crushed by the towering expectations ofothers. Yet, it never manages to convey anything internally, and it never cares to. Instead, it grows its own fragile ego of ostentatious themes and overly ambitious goals. Eventually, it reveals itself to be a guise meant to weakly dispel any acknowledgment of its own hollow identity.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, Rewrite's narrative goals weren't of grandeur, but of re-captivating a naive high school adolescence typically found in anime. In theory, its premise sounds heartfelt: Rewrite follows its main character, Koutarou Tennouji, who, while boisterous and unpredictable among his friends, represses his own isolation and longing for a sense of belonging. Eventually, Koutarou is given the opportunity to join the outlandish Occult Club, where he then gather his friends together, never failing to crack a smile in the way, in order to a live fulfilling youth under the pretext of solving supernatural occurrences. \\n\\n\r\nThe High School Club is no revolutionary innovation for anime, but Rewrite's spin on seems like a fresh of breath air as, in opposition to the rigid, cynical, protagonists common in the setting, Koutarou is more than voluntary creating fun for his club. His situation becomes all the more palatable; there are no foreboding conditions to be made or dark, secret pasts covered by a mask. It\u2019s just good ol\u2019 fun.\\n\\n\r\nYet, Rewrite manages to disassemble itself from ever becoming satisfactory, let alone becoming inspiring. And it does so in the worst way possible: making Koutarou an appalling asshole to watch.\\n\\n\r\nUsually, when describing what goes into good character writing, a common idea thrown is the one of making characters be multifaceted. However, character writing doesn't even need superfluous depth to be effective--that's just one way in which characters are made real. The simplicity of everyday life and idealism reflected by characters can, arguably, echo that reality much easier than the acclaimed Big Damn Heroes. A couple of mannerisms which form a character can go a long way if used with competence, such as giving autonomy to them that allows for coherence.\\n\\n\r\nRewrite's Koutarou seems to have gotten the wrong idea as to what it is that constitutes a good character. Instead of mixing in one or two mannerisms his characters, Rewrite mixes in a boiling pot of tropes to compose Koutarou. He becomes absurdly multi-faced,  being one second a thirsty, flaming pervert, the next second a teen with a heart of gold, and in another instance an angsty philosopher strolling some somber ruins. \\n\\n\r\nKoutaru's character traits accumulate so much that they inevitably topple over, often contradicting each other in the process. When a depressed Koutarou wishes for friends in the morning, only to then taunt his only male friend on a whim, Koutarou can no longer be definitively defined by his desire for companionship which the narrative so strives to develop. \\n\\n\r\nContradictory characters aren't inherently bad; they can be played for a compelling scenario of irony. A good example being the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise\u2019s Kyon, who portrays a similar desire for extravagant fun to that of Koutarou's, but under the heavy guise of snarky cynicism. However, Kyon, unlike Koutarou, regulates his own traits. He'll only be snarky when he feels the time calls for it. Eventually, Kyon is able to form a middle ground between those two traits, one that humanizes what inflicts his wisecracking nature and what triggers his excitement. It's a process by which we're invited to form a greater connection to the events that stimulate Kyon as he develops, but also one in which Kyon is made more cohesive and, consequently, more believable in his actions.\\n\\n\r\nKoutarou is missing that natural cohesiveness that's important to making him work. His traits aren't connected with each other to form the bigger picture of the Socially Awkward Teenager he is, but instead deliberate throwaways meant to emphasize Koutarou's supposed humorous innateness as a character. They're abrupt, appearing at any moment whether appropriate or not, before fading away. Each instance of Koutarou feels like an entirely different character, up to the point where he no longer feels like a character, much less a person. He becomes an annoyance, enhancing none of the situations he's in but instead stripping away their authenticity.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, Koutarou lacking any sense of character might be a deliberate thematic element Rewrite is going for. Under the implication, Koutarou's \"core\" as a character would be spawning different personalities to surpass his lack of any at all, only to then ironically drive home that Koutarou's many faces exhibit a hollow identity to the point of no longer feeling human. In a sense, Koutarou would be a criticism of high school anime protagonists saying that none of the wishful cliches they involve themselves are authentic experiences. They'll only serve as a means of egoistic indulgement, one that deteriorates any sense of \"being human\" in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nBut Koutarou's character shouldn't be trying to make a \"point\" as an excuse for incompetent character writing. Regardless of whether Koutaoru is meant to satirize protagonists or just represent the hollow shell of a teenager, Rewrite never supplements any context to support such characterization. Under which societal standards found in Rewrite's fictional city, Kazamatsuri, would Koutarou be pressured to be devoid of character? Rewrite doesn't answer any questions which propose a further expanding of Koutarou's background as a person. Consequently, no characterization is given that humanizes his incoherency.\\n\\n\r\nKoutarou arrests every narrative goal to be in assistance towards his character, with everything revolving around him internally. Once Rewrite\u2019s fictional city setting, Kazamatsuri, begins to center around just Koutarou, there are no contrasting comparisons which can be made of both him and his world that can develop both as genuine. It doesn't help that Rewrite\u2019s first half is mostly framed around the high school setting--something which limits construction of an outside world. Kazamatsuri, as a result, loses its tangibility as a location with its own life.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the destruction of a setting being a narrative offense, especially in the case of shows heavy on worldbuilding such as Rewrite, a much greater offense is committed: the dehumanization of other characters as people. \\n\\n\r\nSympathy and its importance in our relationships with others is a prevalent theme that Rewrite pushes through with Koutarou, who's selfishly blinded by his own lack of receiving any that he, at times, fails to notice the suffering of others. The first half largely consists of making Koutarou come to this realization through the additions of his club members: Kotori Kanbe, Koutarou's childhood friend, Shizuru Nakatsu, Koutarou's kouhai, Lucia Konohana, Koutarou's class president, Chihaya Ohtori, a transfer student, and Akane Senri, the founder of the occult club.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the typical nakige anime formula, most of these girls have a hidden past, prompting them to have many insecurities covered by their mannerisms. In the context of the narrative, this formula is especially interesting due to how some of the girls echo Koutarou's flaws. This aspect of the characters is exploited most in their development. However, instead of fleshing them out as people, Rewrite establishes them as figures of sympathy used for drama first and foremost.\\n\\n\r\nAny other traits for these characters are passed aside, leaving many of them to just be unpolished archetypes and nothing more. Within their own universe, they're marginalized, forever trapped by their narrative roles. Kotori, for instance, can only ever be Koutarou's childhood friend. Every dilemma which she faces, every choice she makes, and even her interactions with others are centered on her relationship with Koutarou. \\n\\n\r\nWe're restricted from ever having glimpses of these characters lives outside of Koutarou's World that may seem trivial, but add to their humanization as characters. And a lot of these characters clearly show lives beyond the narrative functions; I'd love to see the introspective story of a sexually ambiguous Kotori. But with how Rewrite capitalizes on its characters potential to be melodramatic first, that's just not possible. With their treatment, these characters can no longer be deemed as clearly autonomous people. They're unable to convey any sense of real emotion, much like Koutarou.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, whereas some characters like Chihaya become utterly forgotten by their own story, quite a few are highlighted with sob stories. With their abrupt nature and lack of any meaningful context, the sob stories can barely function in giving texture to characters. However, Shizuru perhaps provides the single best instance of characterization throughout the whole show thanks to her sob story. In an accident involving her parents, a young Shizuru is left to live off as an orphan with heavy guilt. However, we're not demanded to sob with her, as it's a moment meant to highlight Shizuru's growth from that point onwards. She becomes independently strong, removing most of her regrets from that time. This moment, even if missing some key essentials to being great, is satisfactory enough to inspire a reason to be compelled by Shizuru.\\n\\n\r\nYet, after this sob story, this aspect of Shizuru's character isn't ever developed, or even touched on, again. The sob story is revealed to have just been vague foreshadowing for some major plot points without showing much care towards Shizuru's strengths. She reverts back to her innocent loli archetype and continues to express her quirky nature to Koutarou in a flaunting manner until drama calls her back again.\\n\\n\r\nIt's incredibly ironic how Rewrite shows a total disregard for character development in favor for the tiny tidbits of plot buildup, as said plot is entirely reliant on characterization. The destructive foreshadowing by which everything is sacrificed towards constitutes its second half, which is where Rewrite goes from being a Bottom-Of-The-Barrel title to being downright asinine; it becomes an insult just watching it.\\n\\n\r\nRewrite's second half, for as convoluted as it can get, can be simplified into one narrative goal: challenging Koutarou's attachments. These attachments, whether they're Kazamatsuri or the Occult Club, become parts of Koutarou's character. However, while doing so, Rewrite denies its audience any attachment towards those settings. They become abstract, stagnant husks of places, devoid of any natural dynamism. This hinders the second half entirely, as it introduces a new setting that's established and feeds off of the hypothetical substance developed in the mundane one. However, as Rewrite evidently doesn\u2019t develop any sense of meaning beforehand, viewers are left in the dark as incoherent melodrama ensues.\\n\\n\r\n[Disclaimer: From this point on, major spoilers regarding Rewrite may be discussed.]\\n\\n\r\nSupernatural elements are a recurrence in Rewrite's first half; it's what all that foreshadowing suggests towards. Yet, there's a total disconnection between the small scope of Koutarou's High School Life and the literal End of The World which Rewrite reveals as the plot of its second half. The apocalyptic threat in Rewrite feels incredibly inappropriate in comparison to anything the show has established beforehand. It's an atrocious plot twist that not only invalidates it's own story and confirms its own superficiality, but also neglects an audience's immersement. At this point, Rewrite no longer feels like a single, coherent show; it feels like two different shows entirely. When internal consistency in Rewrite's world becomes lost, no longer is there any reason to care for its destruction.\\n\\n\r\nEven in isolation, the Supernatural Kazamatsuri fails to create a sense of tangibility like its mundane counterpart. Rewrite builds a world of an ancient conflict between two organizations, Gaia and Guardian, who wish to either end the world or preserve it, respectively. Gaia can control familiars, whereas Guardian members are superhumans, both powers which, while interesting in concept, never seek their potential. But even neglecting their tactical strategies, warfare between the two is dealt with insensitivity. Ideologies are what solely define them and not the humanity behind them. Rewrite doesn\u2019t just expect their abrupt appearance to be meaningful, but it also expects their single, underdeveloped motivations to be compelling to watch in conflict alone. For once in Rewrite, Koutarou shows relatability because of this as he barely betrays any apprehension once he discovers of the organizations' existence.\\n\\n\r\nThe main source of hostility between Gaia and Guardian involves around them seeking what determines the earth's destruction, a being dubbed as the Key. Rewrite's countless forms of exposition hinder this tension from being anything close to compelling, with information being told towards the viewer via still shots instead of showing it through the flow of action. Tension, while practically being a scarce element in its first half, becomes nonexistent in its latter half. This can be mostly thanked, however, to the representation of the Key itself: a moe, loli character voiced by Kana Hanazawa.\\n\\n\r\nTypically, characters like Kagari are played with for quick, cheap, future drama; take Fuku Ibuki from Clannad or Kudryavka Noumi from Little Busters! as examples. Unfortunately, to the context of Rewrite's narrative, Kagari doesn't even get this minimal treatment. She isn't even treated like she has a narrative and in-universe function that determines the fate of the plot. She\u2019s completely undermined; when she's undermined for laughs, she's treated as a socially inept figure who is obsessed with coffee. When she's undermined for her fanservice appeal, Koutarou will be \"accidentally\" groping her flat chest.\\n\\n\r\nRewrite has absolutely no shame admitting that Kagari is merchandising potential with the small convenience of being a plot device that can be occasionally thrown around. Kagari's character is Rewrite admitting that, despite its attempts, it has no idea what it is it wants to be and then resorts to solemnly indulge, in defeat, by pandering.\\n\\n\r\nEven though nothing at this point can revive its dead narrative, Rewrite's visuals are, at the very least, satisfactory, even if inconsistent at times. If there's anything Rewrite gets consistent for the most part in its visual department, it's its ability to set scenes through lighting alone. Koutarou's room after a lethargic day of fooling around in school provides us with a faint, artificial light that represents Koutarou's own superficiality, only contrasted by a pitch black, unknown outside acknowledged by a window. It provides the tiresome, melancholic imagery that\u2019s necessary to his character, but is rarely ever given the writing to back it up.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs by Masayuki Nonaka themselves are actually fairly endearing, even if the school uniforms of Kazamatsuri students are rather absurd. Masayuki shows a clear aptitude is being able to make his character designs come to live, having many of Rewrite's moments of vivid character animation be done by him. Ryouma Ebata also joins in on the fun by animating and storyboarding the first ED with his signature, realistic walk cycles. Other than these rare exceptions, Rewrite's character designs for the most part lack a nuance that's necessary for conveying characterization that plot alone can't. Character acting can at times be rigid, if at all. Still shots of characters with their moe, Itaru Hinoue eyes gravely kills some of its more serious scenes. It doesn't help that characters being off-model isn't an uncommon occurrence. \\n\\n\r\nVisually, Rewrite kills itself with conspicuous CGI. For the convoluted designs which many of Gaia's familiars have, CGI is used to prevent there from being some atrocious abomination of 2D animation. Nonetheless, the use of CGI itself still isn't mastered, with many of the models themselves showing repetitive animation cycles which just emphasize their artificiality. As familiars often interact with humans, who are 2D animated, them seeming out-of-place is made quickly apparent and quite awkward. The use of CGI is inevitable, but Rewrite fails to clear its stigma in any way. \\n\\n\r\nBeing originally a visual novel, Rewrite shares most of its soundtrack with that of its source material, while also containing some anime original compositions. By itself, the soundtrack contains some real gems. Scene Shifts Here is a poignant, yet dramatically impactful piece which wonderfully builds up crescendos. VN music composer Shinji Orito is no stranger to living up the fun of everyday life and in Rewrite, this shows. Kazamatsuri is given the musical character it deserves with some of his pieces, with a personal favorite of mine being the campy DIS Is A Pain. The anime originals are fairly lukewarm, though, with most of them just utilizing motifs in previous tracks or just downright being unremarkable remixes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, on a sound design level, Rewrite fails to realize the original emotions contained in its pieces. Many times will leitmotifs accompany characters, serving as reminders of their imprisoning roles, while melodramatic music will be incompetently placed in some scenes. Often times does the music itself try to be emotional substance, in substitution for the lack of any in writing, but ultimately fails. This usage of music becomes formulaic, causing the original tracks to become unfortunately underwhelming. It's a shame seeing some great tracks lose their shine, but with Rewrite's perfunctory directing, it's inevitable. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I remain truly flabbergasted by Rewrite--at that point, it could have been anything, yet been nothing at the same time. With writing so incompetent, and characters to offensive, the possibility of Rewrite being deliberate garbage with minimal effort put into it wouldn't even be surprising. It creates an internal fool itself, meandering around in search for a purpose, as it makes jokes just to fill in a time slot. In the end, it never finds itself; no one, not even a perplexed audience, could develop a sense of meaning within Rewrite. It died like it lived: rebelliously underestimating storytelling, only to then rot and kill itself all together.",

            "content": "Rewrite could have been great. I can smell the potential of the source material on it. However, it turned to be a big mess since the very beggining, and with second season \"Rewrite Moon and Terra\" coming, i feel the need of doing what I consider an accurate review of this show, specially about the main problem i have with.\r\nTalking first about its skin, the art in Rewrite is pleasant. It is your typical Key art with moe characters and eyes bigger than your hand but it's very colorful and shining. Animation is also rather good, with fluid movements and fights. CGI was ok andoverall a good animation for a studio with almost none specially previously good work.\\n\r\nWell, i'm pretty sure why this is not the exception.\\n\r\nThis is my main problem with Rewrite: It is indeed very rushed. Well, you can think this is not a major problem, it is very common skip some things while adapting and things like those, but the reality is that is VERY rushed to the point of being a total disaster. Usually, Key's visual novel structure, with some exceptions like Charlotte or Angel Beats (not necessarily good because of that) is made by a plain guy as a protagonist with a bunch of girls surrounding him with their own arcs and development. In Rewrite, of course, you have the plain guy, and 5 or 6 girls. The problem is Rewrite only focuses in two of them very vaguely (and just one episode), while the other girls are doing random stuff with nosense at all because they have been never explained at least as characters. The show explains you the basics of the world and how it works but suddenly everything changes. The characters on the \"bad side\" are never explained even the minimum. But  the problem, as i said, is not source material's, but adaptation's, because what i can feel on Rewrite is the lack of information, shown or said, that was cutted off for sure because it was probably an extremely long VN to adapt in 13 episodes.\\n\r\nI'll give an example of this (light spoilers): In episode 2 or 3, the main character say something like: \"I'm so happy with the occult club, we are friends and we have spent a lot of things together,i don't want it to be over\". He almost gathered all the girls in the club at that moment, so they skip a lot of probably episodic adventures to make it in time but that's just the beggining of the nonsensical character development of Rewrite. All the flaws i can think are related to be rushed as hell because the story has the potential to be good but the reason why most characters do what they do just fuck the entire story.\\n\r\n\"Why is this character doing this? why is she saying this? who's that character and why is suddenly so important for the plot? why they only try to develop some characters and other remain untouched, even when they are faced with each other, and both sides are right in some way?\" There are some important questions unanswered in Rewrite that turn it into just a shell of a good show. It has indeed no coherent soul. Maybe second season can repair this, but seeing how first one ended, i don't think so. Even if it could, the base material is already so bad that it's a snowball now.\\n\r\nOverall, even if you like Key and its adaptations, this Rewrite anime is completely forgetable and skipable. It just has many things missing from the original VN, and i can say this without playing it, because is obvious if you are not abduced by the moe style and beautiful animation.",

            "content": "I came across Rewrite originally from the visual novel, so I had a basis to start off with and had expectations. I wanted to see how the animation would play out because in all honesty, I don't know how they were planning to go about it as in the visual novel I had only completed about 2.5 routes. Each route goes through a different point of view with a focus on on of the girls the MC interacts with and due to how that works out, I wasn't sure how the anime would decide to do things.\r\nAs the anime started, I remembered parts of thevisual novel but essentially it skips a lot which I expected because the visual novel is so long and focusing on one route would be 12 episodes on its own I guess (or maybe a bit less). So in the anime a lot of things are skipped and you immediately reach the stages of \"Oh here is the other female members\" and \"we quickly get to a key part of that characters background\". Since I've gone through part of the visual novel I already have some idea of what would have happened previously to get up to that stage but if you watch the anime without any prior knowledge, it's just a mess. Things occur in the anime where you are just thinking \"What? what happened? how did this happen? nothing really explains what is going on.\"\\n\\n\r\nI only enjoyed parts of the anime just to see the characters in motion and as well as their personalities; Lucia's tongue rolling sound when she is angry and rolls her rrrrrrr's or Kotori's little humorous personality to make little random jokes and Shizuru's often puzzled expressions.\\n\\n\r\nAt the moment, I haven't bothered to move on to the other half (sequel) and decided to recheck out the visual novel as that is more in-depth and provides to smaller scenes of character interactions where you can grow a liken to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nRewrite in itself the visual novel was quite the hard thing to get around to but the anime is just trying to cram so much in in so little time it doesn't make sense to the regular viewer and because of that it ends up being Key's worst anime adaptation and I'm having to cleanse my mind by going back to the visual novel just to not spoil the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really wished to see in the anime is the fun little interactions between the characters that helped show off more of their personalities.",

Somewhat really accordingly hilarious to figure the plots! Surely the sound is most familiar! And somewhat I found Kagari's Scream from Episode 12, Really disturbing.\r\nCharacter: Kagari is the best character I found on the show. Though she made cameos in episodes 1and 2 and I think some other episodes I think of, And appearing in episode 8. She still turned out to be better than the rest. All the others were enjoyable too. I can picture the whole gaming concept now!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very Enjoyable and I find it most convincingly enough to make this show a good concept drive!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10.

            "content": "Have you ever look forward to a new episode that you can\u2019t stop thinking about all throughout the week? Well, that was the exact opposite with me and Rewrite. Trying to make a joke about wanting the show to be \u201crewritten\u201d, but now I just wished it wasn\u2019t written in the first place. Everything about it was a whole lot of wrong.\r\nI\u2019ll admit, I have not played the original visual novel. However, I won\u2019t use that as an excuse to why I didn\u2019t like it. There were other adaptations of works by Key that were fairly decent. Planetarian was one that was came out thesame time and was much shorter, but at least that was more entertaining. Again, I know nothing of the original source, so I don\u2019t know what is faithful or not. But, that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t distinguish a good story from a bad one.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings me to the story. It\u2019s so difficult to describe that I\u2019m having trouble figuring out what to write in this section. The one thing that bothered me the most, when it comes to the story, is the lack of context. Rarely were things explained, and if so, it was in the vaguest way possible. What\u2019s worse than a bad story is having horrible pacing added to it. I first noticed it in an early episode that focused on a certain character. We get their backstory, and it\u2019s done so quickly that it gives us no time to appreciate (for a lack of better terms) this character\u2019s history. The second half of the show goes so downhill and becomes mind-numbingly ludicrous that I didn\u2019t even react. The overall mood was kind of a mix, as well. It seems serious at times, but isn\u2019t afraid to put in a random fart joke (there\u2019s only one, but it\u2019s really off-putting).\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story may be out there, I can\u2019t say the same thing for the characters. Zero personalities, zero chemistry, zero everything. There is not a drop of redeeming quality to these people that we\u2019re supposed to follow for twelve episodes. I have the strange suspicion that they were well written in the visual novel because we\u2019ll have more time to know them better. For me, I wouldn\u2019t care if the story was terrible, as long as the characters were interesting enough. That\u2019s definitely not the case with this. I couldn\u2019t care less what happens to anyone, and when things did happen to them, I didn\u2019t bat an eye.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing worse than a bad story and a bad set of characters is bad animation, and it really shows here. From episode one, right off the bat, the visuals were unpleasing, and it actually managed to get worse with each week. Not only do we get terrible-looking character designs and action sequences, we\u2019re even presented with horrendously rendered CG creatures. When both of them are shown together, it is an eyesore. There was never a single moment where I was able to say that something \u201clooked nice\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, I can get behind the idea that not everyone has the same opinions on something. Yet, there are shows like Rewrite that makes me wonder why there are people who did enjoy it. Currently, it has close to a rating of 7 on the site, and that puzzles me. How can one look at a single episode of this and say \u201cthat was good\u201d? I knew, from the beginning, this show\u2019s fate was already chosen. I knew what I was getting myself into.\\n\\n\r\nThere is just one thing now I don\u2019t understand: Why is it getting a second season?",

            "content": "Key's claim to fame has always been supernatural harem VNs with deeper meanings and plotlines that go past your typical romcom-style visual novel as themes involving them are usually thought-provoking to some extent and have more value to them with each route that the player accomplishes.  Pairing up with animation studios like Kyoani and P.A. works, the newest Key adaptation comes from our friends at 8bit who can't create a bloody cohesive story, Rewrite.  And I must beg the question.  8bit, you sure this series DIDN'T need a rewrite?\r\nStory: Tennouji Koutarou is a classic harem protagonist going to a school that hasrather ornate-looking female uniforms.  Upon finding himself associating with the occult club, he is asked a question from its president asking whether or not if he had the choice, would he save the world?  \\n\\n\r\nFollowing what has been confirmed as one of the final routes of the Rewrite VN, the story of this adaptation is...messy.  Yeah, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, it's confusing as f**k.  The first problem that comes from Rewrite as a whole is the fact that the entire series follows one of the ENDGAME ROUTES of the entire visual novel, you know, the route that you're only supposed to play or have access to when you have completed everything else and get an understanding for everything?  And so, because of this, the show comes as a confusing mess that attempts yet fails miserably at really creating a cohesive and concise story to explain the  themes and overall plot of the series.  Examples of this are when several characters talk about specific things or epiphanies which when you watch without any context, really doesn't make any or very little sense.\\n\\n\r\nContext aside, the bigger problem that I see with Rewrite is the fact that the show has awful pacing.  The show spends about half of its runtime with high school romcom/harem-esque setup that not only squanders the runtime, but takes away from the show's second half with a war between the two factions that this show exhibits, Gaia and Guardian.  I personally find this to be a huge shame to this series because the actual content of this series actually seemed interesting and it was a real downer to see that the show really didn't deliver on its potential.  Though granted, I'm not sitting through 20 cours of material to get the full scope of this series, so...yeah.  Its rushed pacing broke the second half and added only more and more loose and poorly executed details that ended in an ending that unless you've actually played Rewrite, you will most likely not get.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Actually interesting storyline\\n\r\n-  Piss poor pacing\\n\r\n-  Endgame route which without context, doesn't make much sense\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Visual novel characters from Key always have a tragic or less than happy backstory to coincide with the overall nature of their works.  Rewrite is no different, and therefore has problems because lol8bit.\\n\\n\r\nWith Koutarou, you get what you would expect from a Key protag, which is basically the kind of character who is the complete opposite of your generic harem protag who gets flustered around women and is denser than the earth's core.  But really, that's all you get.  The pacing of this series is done in a way that as a character, anything regarding Koutarou's character in the slightest doesn't really change.  He's pretty stagnant all the way and things in the series just kinda...go along whether it's under his power or not.  Any and all change that he does have feels unnatural and rushed and overall doesn't really make his character any more or less interesting.  Granted he is a VN protagonist surrounded in girls, but hey, Key always somehow makes the player character interesting in some way, so it's not impossible to make them cool or at least interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe last character I will talk about is 'Ribbon Girl'.  I'm not spoiling her name for anyone who actually wants to watch this series (lol), but I will say that her name does actually get announced in the series, but it's so painfully late that I'm still calling her 'Ribbon Girl' for the rest of the series and as I'm writing this.  Now, Ribbon Girl is what would arguably be this route's heroine.  The problem is, you don't really get to know or understand much about her.  The series treats her as the plot device object that everyone wants (which she...kinda is) but as a character, we don't get much about her.  She doesn't feel developed beyond some comedic character traits and understanding of such a character feels and is really minimal.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the girls in the series who belong to their own respective routes that we'll never see...well, they're shafted.  There're really no two ways to go about it since that's just how these VN adaptations go.  For a few of them we do get a bit of an understanding of their tragic past and how they ended up the way they do, but they're just really unnecessary details that I feel really shouldn't even be bothered because the series doesn't focus on them since they're just treated as side characters in this specific adaptation.  Other side characters have even less detail and I would argue to not really give much thought to any of them if at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Interesting and entertaining characters\\n\r\n-  All members of the cast have little to no actual depth to them\\n\\n\r\nArt: As expected with 8bit, the artwork and overall style that they went with was pretty on-par with their standards and quality.  They stuck true to Key's moe artstyle and the entire look of the series has this nice bright sheen to it that adds to the overall quality.  There's little to no actual ecchi as you could expect in a series like this, so I suppose that's a sort of plus.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what does bother me personally is the usage of CGI in this series.  The CGI that the show uses really clashes with the overall look of the handdrawn animation and is actually quite jarring to look at, especially since its usage is increased dramatically as the episodes go by.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good quality hand-drawn animation\\n\r\n-  The CGI clashes with the look of the series\\n\\n\r\nSound: Apart from the second OP in the second half of the series known as \"End of the World\" (Hmm, I wonder what could be happening in this show?), the rest of the soundtrack really isn't all that exciting or memorable.  Only this one OP is perhaps the only real notable track that I could find throughout the entire series.   \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Admittedly, I like Key.  While their works don't always get the best reception or adaptations due to the way that their visual novels are structured, I was intrigued to see what kind of things 8bit, a company that I've had a pretty rough history with would do to completely and utterly destroy the kind of content that Key has made.  Watching Rewrite...I don't really know what I expected to be completely honest.  I went into this series thinking it was going to be subpar at best, and despite getting something that was admittedly worse than my original expectations, I didn't really expect anything less.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nI like the characters.  While they were lacking in the development or backstory department as Key always does, their base character traits, especially Koutarou were enough to keep a smidgen of interest for me to continue, although the lack of development probably pissed me off more than it should.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nOk, I never played Rewrite.  I went into this series pretty much completely blind.  Things.  Didn't.  Make.  Sense.  In order to make sense of anything in this adaptation, I had to resort to wikis and other information sources on the plot of Rewrite to even get an bit of an understanding as to what I was watching here.  And even with that, I still didn't get what was even happening.  This, this I hate.  I get that this was supposed to be an adaptation for the last route of the game, but at the very least, try and make the whole series somewhat cohesive.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nHmm...no.  My suggestion is to just play the VN is you actually want to understand the Rewrite series.  The actual content of this adaptation isn't terrible, it's just not that good and really doesn't have much merit to it because of the sheer number of plot holes and execution problems that this adaptation had.  Content-wise, it had something to it.  Execution-wise, terrible and should be ashamed of itself for its piss poor pacing.",

            "content": "***THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW***\r\nAfter watching Rewrite I am honestly wondering who the hell this anime was made for. Was it for the veteran VN readers or was it some sort of advertisement for the fresh anime watchers? Regardless of their target audience I think that 8-bit has failed miserably.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nFirst, an introduction to the story. Kotarou is the main character of the show. The show literally follows him around as he tries to make the most of his high school life. He ends up reviving an old club in order to form memories with his closest friends. These friends include Akane (a snarky,devious, and rich female), Chihaya (a super strong, airhead idiot), Kotori (Kotarou's childhood friend that loves pocket change), Lucia (the typical loud class rep), and Shizuru (the best girl loli). The first half of the story follows the events regarding Kotarou and the club. What happens later on will be up to you to find out. No spoilers here.\\n\\n\r\nNow if we can take a step back to talk about the quality of the story, I hope I can relay my thoughts. If we take away all connections and points from the VN and judge this show purely on what was presented in the anime, we still get a sloppy mess of a plot. The first 6 or so episodes of the anime somewhat features the common route of the VN. It was however really, really, really condensed down to fit inside the most minimalist of deadlines. The show does include the full cast from the VN which is a feat all on its own but rushes to all hell the introductions and initial character building. The characters somewhat feel like their VN counterparts (helped by the same voice actors and music from the VN) but they lack the punch that their VN counterparts have due to the rushed introductions and lightspeed route completions. What happens at the turning point of the story has very little impact due to this rushed character building. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst bug-o-boo; I don't know what the hell is up with the character models in this show. They just look...off? Like the actual models look like the VN counterparts but they look really washed out. It might be just an A E S T H E T I C quality 8-bit tried to use to make up the show's visual style but it did not work. It ended up making the show look cheap and low quality. It however must be pointed out that the school dresses are really something to look at. Like holy mother of god they look like designer dresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe more actiony scenes in the show seemed animated pretty well but that is all ruined once they throw the CG monsters on screen. To be perfectly honest the CG monsters in this show are some of the worst quality CG things I have ever seen in an anime. They just look so out of place. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMost of the voice lines are just poorly written but that does not take away from the actual performance and quality of what was presented in the show. From what I can tell they used the same voice actors from the VN which is great because all of them are excellent. They are literally the only reason each character actually feels like a character (due to the rushed pacing as explained earlier on). The real star though is the music in the show. They were smart and took most of the musical themes from the VN and placed them very well into the show. Seriously going to pick up the OST for this when it becomes available (although if the VN already has one get that). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI want to make something perfectly clear before I dive into this category. In the VN the characters truly have a life of their own. They are fully fledged out, feel organic, and are some of the best well-knit casts. The anime retains in my honest opinion half of the feeling that the VN provided. The characters are there and the VAs bring out their feelings but it is just not enough. The characters presented in the show just do not seem to meld well enough with each other. In the VN a huge part of the game is laughing and enjoying the interactions of the whole cast as they do club activities. I really did not feel that same sort of organic feeling in the anime when the same scenes were presented. \\n\\n\r\nOddly enough the best part of the show was Kagari's personality. While I have played VN I don't really remember Kagari acting the way she does in the anime in the VN. This might be the new route that the new version of the game is going to include but regardless Kagari is the only character that I ended up liking in the anime. She feels fully fleshed out and honestly steals the screen when she is present.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.9/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain I want to make it abundantly clear that I absolutely love the VN this anime was based on. The VN tells a humorous and enjoyable story with a super well done cast that provide so many great scenes. The anime feels like a super watered down version of the VN. The lines are rushed, the character building/progression is rushed, the visuals look rushed, and the show in general is rushed. If this was a 24 episode show instead of 12 then maybe we would have gotten a worthy adaptation. We however got what we got; a rushed product that I still do not understand who the target audience is. \\n\\n\r\nLet me make this better for you in the long run; watch the OP of the anime and the OP for the VN. If it at all looks remotely interesting to you then go play the VN. I honestly think that watching the anime first then going to play the VN might ruined the experience you would have if you just played the VN without the anime's influence. You would miss out of experiencing the VN fresh without outside things hurting the plot twists. Do. Not. Watch. The. Anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3.6/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

I am not going to dive too deep into analyzing each aspect, so here is the my final verdict. \r\nOverall- 6/10. It seems that the main reason why this anime received an average score is because the story was so rushed compared to the visual novel, butI saw the anime first and still loved it. Maybe the studios that made this anime was having budget issues? Regardless, I would love for them to redo the first season, but that will probably never happen. Also, Masakazu Morita's voice acting as Kotarou is godly, and I usually prefer watching anime in English and couldn't care less about the Japanese VA's, but he has a lot of talent. I do not understand why he was only given a voice acting role in the Moon and Terra routes, excluding the prologue in the visual novel.",

I wouldn't read them anyway.\r\nYo! It's I, The Self-proclaimed Idiot, DevilDuo come to live from the eye of the storm we call the Otaku community. \"Rewrite\" was it good? I will answer that now just in case you are lazy. Yes,\"Season one of Rewrite\" was good. For more detail keep reading! \\n\\n\r\nStory (4/10): Average story for animes coming out recently. Don't want to spoil it for some people, but it is about some group or unknown species trying to destroy the world. Average! Right! But it did do most things better. This is a funny anime. Of course, some people will disagree. Again I got half the story so half the points.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): Beautiful animation. They threw in a little bit of CGI, which I don't like, but it didn't feel out of place. Even the creatures felt pleasing to the eye. No half points probably be the same art style throughout the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10): Don't remember the Opening, but it was not bad. I think?!?!?!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4/10): Great characters design. The voice on the characters fit their body, too me. Backstory was okay in my perspective. Again half the anime half the points!!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (?/10): Don't know how to feel with just one half of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10): Half-ass me, I'll half-ass you. So half probably!?!?!?!?!\\n",

            "content": "Rewrite\r\nArt/Characters: So the art style for this show is pretty traditional for a stereotypical harem, but there are a few differences. The main thing being that a lot of the characters really look alike when you just glance at them. I had legitimate struggles telling the difference between three characters because their face and their hair styles are so similar. As for the rest of the cast, there are two Moe girls and one sassy/tough girl, and this is all exemplified through their art style. The interesting thing about this art is how cartoonish is can get at times. Sometimes things will be serious andreally great art, but other times, things look more airbrushed. Another big problem I have is the use of CGI when it comes to some of the things in later episodes, and it really throws me through a loop. The characters themselves are pretty generic for a show like this: The stoic one, the moe one, the shy moe one, the sassy one, the childhood friend, and the overly happy one. As for the lead guy in Rewrite, he is your run-of-the-mill guy who gets embarrassed easily but is deep down kind of a pervert. He cares for his friends tremendously and that can be seen throughout the story which makes it very watchable.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: The music that we hear through the show is actually pretty generic, and pretty forgettable. For example, I just watched the last episode this morning and I can\u2019t remember the theme this afternoon. There are some good songs that can be found in the background of the show, but really there is only one song that really caught my attention and that was at the end of the final arc of the show. Sound itself did a pretty good job however. There were a lot of times where I would catch myself looking away and not really caring what was happening but all of a sudden there was a sound that caught me and hooked me back in. This is a trait I don\u2019t see often and I would like to see more of.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Kotarou Tennouji is a seemingly average high school boy who just wants to be friends with the people around him. But something has been plaguing him and keeping him up at night the last few nights, a girl in a black dress with a red ribbon. He goes and tries to find her one night where he is seemingly killed by this girl. He wakes up, startled, and thankful that it was just a dream, goes back to sleep. But he has a new ability, the ability to rewrite any part of his body to give him more strength and more speed. He is convinced that this has something to do with the girl so he sets out and joins the Occult club, with his friends, to figure out what the heck has happened to him and what is so special about this girl.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: So the first thing I figured out about this show was that the first episode was 45 minutes, instead of 23. I did not sign up for that, and it was a little unwanted. There was nothing that moved the plot a long in those extra 23ish minutes, and it should have just stuck with being a regular episode. I don\u2019t know maybe this show had a lot of hype, but to me, I was watching and the beginning was just so slow. After things began to pick up with the occult club and the friend group began to grow I was more interested in it. Then all of a sudden, all hell seems to break loose and the plot of the show changes dramatically. I won\u2019t give it away, but the twist came so far out of left field that I almost stopped watching because it was almost like watching a completely different show. The nice thing is that they were able to tie it all back together by the end. Speaking of the end, there was a firm conclusion. I feel like this is actually uncommon for a lot of shows because the anime adaptation is from an ongoing manga or light novel series, but because this was a visual novel there was a clear end and no room for the story to continue. It provided me with a sense of closure that I don\u2019t normally get. If you are into crazy club antics and deep dramatics with a group of friends, you will probably enjoy Rewrite!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6/10",

            "content": "Before I start, let me stress one thing - I love visual novel called Rewrite. It was my firts 10 out of 10 in its genre, not because it's perfect, but rather because when I was reading it, it felt like it was made perfectly for me. And I'm not deaf to criticism, I've since read opinions of many people who were far less content with that story. And most of the time they've made valid points, but just like I said - while Rewrite wasn't story for them, it still was one for me.\r\nNow, why I'm writing this down? Because I think it's importantto show you my mindset at the time when I was starting this anime. You've already seen my score: 5. Merely five for something that I should like, no, love. But sorry, I couldn't. I may be a fanboy, but I'm also not blind. This adpatation wasn't a good one, having constant problems with knowing what it wants to show. Is it fanservice for people who are already familiar with the source material? I'd think so, because there were just so many parts that only they would understand. But then, it wasn't particulary good fanservice (Oh, by fanservice I mean seeing characters you like getting animated, revisiting familiar places and hearing this masterpiece of a soundtrack again. Not those lousy attempts to flash tits). Then again, maybe it was meant for people new to Rewrite, with all heroines route cramed to the first 5-6 episodes? But it still can't be right, because not only they wouldn't really get some parts, it would also spoil for them many plot twists without encouraging to read visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nEh, damn it, that's exactly what's wrong with Rewrite anime - it's a convoluted mess that doesn't know to whom it want to appeal. But you know what? Screw that, let's take a look at anime original story of Kagari, which started in the second half of the season... Nope, still doesn't work. I don't want to spoil anything, so let me just say that the problems that were present earlier are still present here. Plus making tits flashing scenes with that budget and run time - really, 8bit? You just couldn't resist, could ya? And again, don't get me wrong. Oppai route/ending in visual novel made me cry laughing, instantly becoming my S\u00e8vres's measure of fanservice done just right. So while seeing this new Kagari was interesting, that was all.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, if you gonna watch it, please keep in mind that the whole thing doesn't represent what Rewrite really is. If you enjoyed - good for you, if you didn't - I hear you, but in both cases I'd suggest trying visual novel one day. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime isn't good.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\n\u201cRewrite\u201d is a word that I am intimately familiar with.\r\nI cannot tell you how many times I have rewritten paragraphs within my reviews. Entire sentences. Even singular words. Each instance of rewriting getting me one step closer to a piece that I feel comfortable sharing. One that I can be proud of and say, \u201cYes. This looks good.\u201d\r\nIt\u2019s never perfect because there is always something that can be rewritten. But what matters is going through that process in the first place.\r\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t believe Rewrite got the memo.\r\nSTORY\r\nRewrite kicks off in dark fashion. Tennouji Kotarou,a high-school boy, dies in his dream at the hands of some ribbon-twirling girl. While he fears whatever curse has been laid upon him, he does his best to live a fun-filled, worthwhile life with his other friends of the Occult Club. But, when strange happenings and sinister plans surface, he finds that his curse is the least of his worries.\\n\\n\r\nDiscussing Rewrite now is difficult. Not due to the complexity of the material itself, for, arguably, what Rewrite presents is not. But instead due to where the story concluded. It technically gave a complete story but, perhaps obviously, not a full one.\\n\\n\r\nAs was seen, Rewrite\u2019s season finishes with basically what visual novels deem a bad end. For everything pretty much went wrong: all the characters died, and vegetation engulfed the world. Kagari\u2019s final scene, where she witnesses this timeline fizzle out alongside hundreds of other timelines that have existed or are existing, also backs this scenario up.\\n\\n\r\nBut, as can easily be looked up (and given that the second season is currently airing at the time of this writing), this series is a split-cour. And, presumably, the second half will contain the same cast, continue the plot, and uphold the overall major ideas.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it differently, Rewrite has much more to tell \u2013 and hopefully a more cheerful ending to get to.\\n\\n\r\nThis season, then, acts as a primer of sorts. It introduces the important cast members (so that it won\u2019t have to later), it provides the overall dilemma (Kagari\u2019s role as the key to salvation or destruction), and it gives some insight into its more important themes (like environmentalism and that life is better with friends).\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the anime fails on almost all accounts.\\n\\n\r\nWhen introducing the cast and, indeed, whenever Kotarou interacted with any of them, it felt entirely too much like its visual-novel source. One after another, Kotarou talks with the girls in a singular manner to meet some hidden quota, removing the naturalness of the events themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThis awkward event handling goes away come the middle of the season. For, what replaces the school and the introductions is the meat of the plot. Guardian defeating the monsters that Gaia summons. The lingering doomsday prophecy. Separation of the Occult Club.\\n\\n\r\nTransitioning from the predominantly slice-of-life fun to the drama-heavy plot was made possible by the show\u2019s smaller hints about the characters\u2019 powers and the gradual reveal of the not-so-imaginary occult instances.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the anime transitions towards, though, is not the most engaging. Despite the title of the anime, Kotarou\u2019s ability does not play too important of a role, diminishing his impact on the overall narrative to that of just the guy who jokes about wanting to grope Akane\u2019s boobs and who hides away from the whole fray within a forested region for far too long. It also does not help that both Guardian and Gaia are hardly explored let alone clash to any major degree.\\n\\n\r\nTo its credit, Gaia\u2019s evil plan at least makes some sense. Rather than wanting to eradicate all of humanity just because, they feel this route will keep the Earth from destruction at the hands of its most impactful enemy: humans.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads into one of Rewrite\u2019s themes: environmentalism. Although, using the word \u201ctheme\u201d may be a bit too strong since, on a large scale, the anime does not fully explore this idea. The setting is that of a city where cleaner energy takes precedence, and, as was discussed, the anchor to the whole plot relies on protecting the Earth and its bounty. But the show doesn\u2019t target climate change, the effects of abusing resource collections, or even the importance of vegetation in general. To put it differently, it\u2019s more a small surface detail for the story rather than a prominent, nuanced motif.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s other major theme \u2013 life is better with friends \u2013 is one that Rewrite more actively pursues (when compared to the environmentalism). Kotarou finding solace in the Occult Club, their eventual breakup fragmenting his life, his reliving of those happier times with Kagari, and the eventual reunion they (almost all) have at Kotori\u2019s hideaway.\\n\\n\r\nThis thread is well-meant, and it gives the anime\u2019s narrative better footing. Sadly, it does not firmly plant its feet due to the weakness of its foundation While the Occult Club is a place where Kotarou and the girls hang out and enjoy life together, the anime has a tough time making said togetherness worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, they do not feel like a tightknit group of friends because the events therein do not give them that chance. They chase after a critter, but the highlight is Kotarou grabbing Lucia\u2019s butt and a secretary lady using a fishing pole. They scour a forest, but the odd discoveries and the eventual dive into the heavier drama take over. They conduct a series of investigations into the occult (with fruitless results), but these are gone through so quickly that they mean very little in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nAll this says nothing about a few awkward plot points (Chihaya not immediately giving Kotarou the super-important letter that Akane addressed to him), the weak action sequences (Midou and Lucia\u2019s duel is about the only memorable one but, even then, just barely), and the anime\u2019s avoidance of showing more of the final scenes (Lucia squaring off against and killing Touka, Chihaya fighting alongside the monstrous Sakuya).\\n\\n\r\nThe continuation may turn it around, but, for now, this season simply doesn\u2019t work.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nRewrite\u2019s character designs are quite nice. The frilly, pink-and-red dresses that the ladies wear are both cute and detailed. Each girl has her own set of accessories: Shizuru\u2019s eyepatch, Lucia\u2019s white gloves, and so on. And the slightly older style for their faces \u2013 large eyes, squarer heads \u2013 don\u2019t take anything away but rather adds to their overall charm.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, the anime does about as well as it can within its setting. The school isn\u2019t too interesting, and same goes for some of its other more mundane spots like Kotarou\u2019s house or the local town. It can have its moments, though, like in the clubroom with its furniture and bookcases.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, given its focus on environmental impacts, the various nature shots are a welcome inclusion. The lush forests, the greenery encasing flowers, and the immense overgrowth that eventually consumes the world are where the anime is at its prettiest.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the anime has a strong use of lighting regardless of the location. The school\u2019s hallways casting shadows from the windows or Kotori\u2019s hideaway basked in moonlight give Rewrite a lot in the way of nuance where it normally does not have much.\\n\\n\r\nThe CG works against the show, though. It\u2019s used rather sparingly, but Gaia\u2019s dinosaur monsters and Kotori\u2019s woodland defenders stick out too much from the surrounding art to be much else besides distracting. Although, admittedly, those defenders do have an interesting green-energy effect from their designs.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation remains consistent throughout the season. Earlier episodes hold up rather well during its slice-of-life segments such as Lucia reacting to Touka (their teacher and her commander) blowing cool air on her ear or Kotarou running away from an evil demon dog. A lot of sitting and speaking goes on, but, even during these scenes, reactions to the situations and other comedic bits give the anime the chance to show off some movement.\\n\\n\r\nLater episodes aren\u2019t as strong animation-wise, but they do include a lot more action. Shizuru riding her motorcycle, Lucia dueling Midou, and Kotarou struggling against the flying plant-like beast are just a few of the many examples where the cast do more than just eat snacks in the clubroom.\\n\\n\r\nKagari\u2019s ribbon manipulation (her makeshift crane, her slapping) are also worth noting. Her ribbons are almost always doing something, giving her character and the scenes in which she exists a nice amount of dynamism.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAs it was with the story, Rewrite\u2019s split-cour nature and, more importantly, this season\u2019s outcome (the \u201cbad end\u201d) makes it tough to talk about Kotarou and the other girls. The anime still has more to tell, but it still provided character-focused content worth discussing.\\n\\n\r\nMost notable are Shizuru and Lucia. Unlike everyone else, they get their own episode \u2013 which can be looked at in one of two ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe first is with appreciation. The anime understandably wants (and needs) to showcase a lot of its important plot points, but it does not have a whole lot of time in which to do so. So, when the anime squeezes their entire backstory, development, and importance into a single episode, it\u2019s more about giving them the attention they deserve (and likewise need) rather than worrying about the execution. In other words, it\u2019s nice that the audience got something.\\n\\n\r\nThe second is with question. Their dilemmas are poorly explained through large amounts of exposition. Pacing has no place. Some development occurs but lacks impact. Yes, the audience learns why Shizuru always wears an eyepatch or Lucia always wears gloves, but the events themselves are not handled with the best of care. The show gives them to the audience and that\u2019s that.\\n\\n\r\nOf the two approaches, the second is the more arguable since not a whole lot happens with Shizuru and Lucia after these episodes (especially Shizuru). Lucia goes to help Kotarou and the others, saying \u201cWhat could possibly take priority over protecting my friends?!\u201d An indication of how she has changed her lonely self from before. But that\u2019s about it. As for Shizuru, she eventually abandons her spot within Guardian, but it comes as too little, too late after being sidelined for so long.\\n\\n\r\nRewrite handles Kotori\u2019s character differently, but the conclusion is roughly the same. Arguably worse.\\n\\n\r\nShe likes sleep, money, and the great outdoors. Extra emphasis for the last one on the list since she eventually reveals her druidic nature. Unlike Shizuru and Lucia, she receives a miniscule amount of backstory. One scene about how she turned down Kotarou\u2019s love confession (meaning the meta childhood-friend curse continues), and one scene about how her parents died in a car accident (which led to her druid powers). The latter unable to support the drama that their second deaths (through their reanimated bodies) bring.\\n\\n\r\nRumored to be a powerful witch, Akane \u201cleads\u201d their occult club \u2013 but mostly just plays her online FPS. She apparently skips class as much as she wants but still moves on to the next grade level, indicating some level of power or influence of a hierarchical nature (which is later proven true when her family connections are revealed).\\n\\n\r\nHer breasts are a (joking) motivation for Kotarou to investigate the otherworldly happenings presented to them. But, normally, she\u2019s indifferent to the whole occult thing, often lazing about whenever Kotarou brings them all on yet another failed outing.\\n\\n\r\nAkane (with Chihaya) inevitably parts with the group once her Gaia affiliation comes to light. Although she does not seem too keen on following their ways, for the prospect of her mind melding with the other saints that preceded her and thereby losing herself, as well as the annihilation of the whole Earth, does not strike her as exactly favorable.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, she does lose, succumbing to her undue fate and ultimately leading everyone to their demise. To put it differently, this season establishes and shows what happens when she isn\u2019t saved. Hopefully, come the next season, Kotarou and crew flip that fate, but, for now, her role as the puppet worked well enough.\\n\\n\r\nNot much can be said about Chihaya, for Rewrite gives her next to nothing thrown her way besides her introduction and the occasional joke. It\u2019s not a major problem right now since the anime chose to focus on Shizuru and Lucia and, to some extent, Kotori and Akane. Meaning, they must delve into Chihaya\u2019s character more in the follow-up season \u2013 lest she end up as worthless when viewing the bigger picture.\\n\\n\r\nThis leaves Kotarou. As the main protagonist of this tale, he\u2019s the one that brings the other girls together. He does so for their sake but mostly for himself; he wants a place where he can feel comfortable and have fun with what little youth they have left to spend. For he has always felt like an outsider of sorts just like Yoshino and the girls.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, he forms a friendly relationship with them thanks to his kindhearted personality. Lucia beats him up, Shizuru eats lunch with him, Kotori teases him, Chihaya gets familiarized with this new place through him, and Akane looks down on him. All playful and silly.\\n\\n\r\nBut, as is shown, intrigue is afoot. His rewrite ability (what the anime is supposedly named after) is something he keeps hidden and uses to permanently alter his person. Actual occult occurrences appear from time to time. And an odd ghost nightly nibbles on his arm.\\n\\n\r\nThe intrigue eventually forces the group to split, and, in doing so, leaves Kotarou by himself. Coincidentally, Kagari, the nibbling ghost, begins to follow him around like a regular person. His friendship with her reminds him of the fun he had in the club with the other girls, making him long for those peaceful times once again.\\n\\n\r\nWhile helping Kagari discover herself, he meets up with Kotori for the first time since the group split. She reaffirms the end goal of the war between Guardian and Gaia (saving the world) and explains in further detail that Kagari is the \u201cKey,\u201d a physical manifestation of the Earth that is (appropriately enough) the key to said war.\\n\\n\r\nKotarou chooses to protect Kagari, doing what he can to train with his new Wolverine-energy claw so that he can avoid the problems he encountered in the past. While not much of it is shown beyond Sakuya tutoring him and him punching the air, he slowly improves his fighting prowess. All the while, Lucia and Chihaya reappear, giving Kotarou that feeling of comfort and fun that he felt at the beginning of the season.\\n\\n\r\nOnce everything starts to fall apart, he does his best to fight Midou but must run away instead. And, during his fight with Sougen, he loses even after overclocking with his rewrite power. That is, despite all the training he went through, it didn\u2019t amount to much of anything. An odd writing decision but perhaps a necessary one, considering the bad end achieved.\\n\\n\r\nTo this end, twisted magic, from the ribbon planted within his arm and the echoing song that pierces the air, consume him, turning half of him into foliage. Yet he still gets to make the final choice: kill Kagari and save everyone from death, or save Kagari and doom everyone to nonexistence. It\u2019s a callback to the philosophical question he answered on the questionnaire in the beginning of the season.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYou have power, and are discontent with this world. Tell me, do you wish to change this world? Or do you wish to change yourself?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nKotarou originally answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d His choice to save Kagari seems as though he now would select changing the world, but it\u2019s hard to know whether that\u2019s the case since the continuation still looms. Because, given that his answer forms the crux of his character, answering it now would mean the end of his development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kotarou is not a horrible character. He does what he can for Kotori and the others, he trains himself over time, and he still has that lingering question to answer. He\u2019s not a very strong character either, considering his minimal influence and the lack of focus on him as a person. Still, he\u2019s better than the rest of the cast, and he has that second season to hopefully pick up the slack.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the music within Rewrite does not have the kick required to be meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nTake its opening tracks. The first one has some solid guitar playing in the beginning as well as a semi-mysterious vibe during its middle section. But, by the halfway point, the piece picks up without saying much or feeling as though it matters. The second OP is the same. Besides the background vocalists and the ending, its pop-rock composition, like that of the first OP, does not hold up as anything special.\\n\\n\r\nSame goes for the original soundtrack. The mysterious track that gets played at the very beginning of episode one and the relaxing flute piece are small standouts, but, in general, the OST sticks to more pop-rock and lots of piano. They simply do not do much beyond sounding right for the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe main ending track at least comes off as more thoughtful. The drums slightly overpower it, but the bassline near the start, a more whimsical approach (violin, piano, chimes, water-droplet-like sound-effects), the dip in the middle, more background vocalists, and the trailing whispers craft a pretty, hopeful piece that fits Rewrite\u2019s intentions.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also has a handful of other EDs such as \u201cKoibumi\u201d and \u201cSunbright\u201d which play only once (respectively in episode four which is Shizuru\u2019s episode and episode five which is Lucia\u2019s episode.) These have the same level of impact as the OPs and the OST. That is to say, almost none whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting ends up all right. Masakazu Morita as Kotarou is playful when speaking with everyone around him (especially Yoshino). Saya Shinomiya as Chihaya takes part in her first major anime role. And same goes for Risa Akari as Lucia whose growl exudes her personality well.\\n\\n\r\nBut a negative shout-out does go to Kana Hanazawa as Kagari. Her occasional \u201cscreams\u201d near the end of the season were odd and unfitting, taking away from the scenes rather than adding to the drama.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI liked this one more so in the first half than the second half for two main reasons.\\n\\n\r\nOne, the slice-of-life direction. Kotarou \u201csaving\u201d Tomoko from the trash, Lucia\u2019s tsundere tendencies, and Shizuru having a dream with jumbled dialogue were fun scenes. Nothing amazing, but I was smiling and chuckling.\\n\\n\r\nContrast that with the second half which prioritizes the drama and the action more. I didn\u2019t care for Akane\u2019s plight within Gaia, and Shizuru fighting against monsters with her dual knives didn\u2019t interest me. In fact, my favorite moments from the second half were slice-of-life ones again. Kagari yelling \u201cAdios!\u201d as Kotarou runs away with her under his arm and Sakuya basically dying because Kagari belittles his exquisite coffee were much more entertaining to me than the main dish.\\n\\n\r\nTwo, the higher character density. Despite how strange the presentation of the events is due to the Kotarou-interacts-with-them-one-at-a-time format, it was still fun to see the show switch between them now and again. Kagari is a cute character that fills the void, but, without the others around as much, it just wasn\u2019t as fun.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I understand that the narrative needed to separate them almost completely. But, on a personal level, when they\u2019re replaced by a lame Fogo-wielding villain and odd plots involving a wheelchair-bound, on-her-deathbed woman who listens to some creepy choir, I can\u2019t say I agree with the decision.\\n\\n\r\nRewrite fails to begin in the right way. The story cannot nail its different elements. Many of the characters are not treated with care. And the music does not contribute much to the scenes in which it plays. Hopefully this season\u2019s continuation was given the rewrite memo several times over.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, while the continuation will provide more details, VN-esque interactions, the unengaging plot, and the poor attempt at a friend-based theme make this first season too problematic\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, nice character designs, okay artistic direction, and okay actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Shizuru and Lucia are rushed, and Kotori is mishandled, but Akane plays the role of puppet, and Kotarou at least has a few experiences along the way\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, bad OPs, bad EDs, bad OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, slice-of-life moments were fun, but not much else was\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "I actually enjoyed this anime's first 3-4 episodes. To be honest, this would've made a better Slice of life with powers than having the actualy story. I mean it is just terrible. The plot was okay, generic but still okay but the plot elements and execution were retarded. I mean the monsters are seriously out of place from the art style.\r\nFirst off, you have this girl who I really liked then they just turn her into (SLIGHT SPOILER) a panty wearing assassin. She actually looks like a dominatrix at that point.\r\nThe highest score I gave was the Characters (8) since I genuinely find their interactionsinteresting and funny. If the characters were built upon more i.e if this was stretched to 24+ episodes I could have cared about the plot let alone the characters.\\n\r\nThe characters had somewhat interesting background but was never really expanded on. Each consecutive episode that built up characters was done for one character per episode and this style doesn't really feel natural. It felt like...\\n\\n\r\n...This anime was rushed, no it was rushed. Like Akame ga Kill but worse because the story went so quick that I stopped caring about the characters. The main plot was the focus on later episode which is basically Kotarou and Kagari, Gaia and Guardian, and I really didn't care if everyone died anymore because I just didn't feel any sense of loss from any of them. It was about saving the world now.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and background were okay but the CG was awful. Sound did good and fitted with the theme for each scene. But I can't enjoy this if the story is awfully set out.\\n\r\n*SPOILERS*\\n\r\nI'd just like to point out the Kotarou has 0 balls by not being able to save everyone. I mean why couldn't you have just- I won't get into it but it's so annoying.\\n\r\n*END OF SPOILERS*\\n\r\nI usually research about the ending of anime and see people's thoughts on it but this was soo bad that I didn't even bother. Not bad as in because something bad/sad happens but bad as in 'this doesn't make any sense but it's no longer worth my time' bad.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Key has missed the mark. As a key fanatic, nothing disappoints me more than having to write that sentence. Despite much anticipation, Rewrite failed to deliver anything close to Key\u2019s previous anime adaptations and this, at a high level, is why:\r\n-\tThe character build up was rushed. Key anime typically take 24 episodes to develop characters and ensure that the audience is emotionally invested in them. Rewrite dedicated no more than 6 episodes to developing the five heroines, so no one cares about them.\r\n-\tThe magic realism came too hard, too fast and was inappropriately timed. I felt like I was watching a less interesting version ofa Fate franchise anime. (Fate is a great series, so if you\u2019re going to compete with it you need to get it right.)\\n\\n\r\n-\tThe theme was too obviously pushed. Each Key VN has a theme. Clannad was family. LB! was friendship. Rewrite couldn\u2019t have shoved the environmental theme any further down your throat. Beyond feeling patronising, this screen time came at the direct cost of plot development.\\n\\n\r\n-\tThere was no closure. Whilst this is ok if done to provoke an emotional response from the audience (ie Evangelion), I honestly didn\u2019t feel attached enough to the characters to care about the ending. Honestly, I had no idea that the anime had ended at episode 13, and was still hoping that an episode 14 would start to add gravity to the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, you can leave your tissues at home.\\n\\n\r\nI should point out that I have yet to play the VN, so I don\u2019t know if these issues were the result of a poor production studio or Key itself. \\n\\n\r\nWhilst I am a fan of Tanaka (whose previous work includes VN Cross Channel), the anime felt the absence of Maeda as the main scenario writer.  By comparison with Angel Beats and Charlotte (two of Maeda\u2019s other 13 episode pieces), Rewrite demonstrated much more initial potential and delivered much less impact. \\n\\n\r\nGiven the amount of source material, Rewrite should have been capable of achieving the same scale as Little Busters, but the universe felt so much smaller.\\n\\n\r\nThe only conclusion that I can draw is that Key was too distracted by juggling the Rewrite anime adaptation and the Planetarian movie to pay detailed attention to either. \\n\\n\r\nI really, really want to like Rewrite, so I\u2019ll probably play the VN in an attempt to prove to myself that it wasn\u2019t Key\u2019s fault after all. That somehow, they had just been negligent this time, and the promise of a re-adaptation could well be on the cards (remember Kanon 2006?). \\n\\n\r\nI can now see why Rewrite didn\u2019t have a corporate presence at Comiket 90.",

            "content": "Rewrite as an anime is a mixed bag, one part typical Key, one part trying to be something bigger, one part cliche.\r\nRewrite is another list of animes done by Key yet is another anime NOT done by Kyoto Ani, instead taking up by 8Bit (Grisaia no Kajitsu) and along with the 1 hour first episode special, LA thought Rewrite might be another Grisaia no Kajitsu and really...that's what LA got, just add in Grisaia no Rakuen and you get Rewrite. \r\nOk, so for that statement to make more sense to you, let's just move onto the plot.\r\nReally with what the premise and poster gives you,it's sort of gives you a typical harem plot with a perverted anime main protagonist with the occult club as a base to make \"goofy comedic hijinks\".....it does...until you remember what the first episode gives us. Really the cliche and \"typical Key\" part comes to the first half of Rewrite. The first half of Rewrite gives us a sorta \"get to know the setting and main protagonist\", the main protagonist Kotarou Tennouji voiced by Masakazu Morita is your typical perverted snarky main protagonist you see in Key and at first he's a pretty bland main character, as for the harem, they are your typical harem fair, the childhood friend of Kotori Kanbe voiced by Chiwa Saito, Lucia Konohana voiced by Risa Asaki the clean freak tsundere, Shizuru Nakatsu voiced by Keiko Suzuki, the precocious mature loli, Chihaya Ootori voiced by Saya Shinomiya the ditz and Akane Senri voiced by Eri Kitamura the occult club president and \"Ribbon Girl\" voiced by Kana Hanazawa who has a link to Kotarou and really LA had two favourite characters in Rewrite, Akane and Lucia and LA will go into detail a bit later. But for the first half, because the setting and premise makes them very cliche and stereotypical of visual novel fair, the only exceptions really go to Lucia and Shizuru as we get their character development arcs during this.\\n\\n\r\nIt's where it comes to the halfway point where things really change and all these wild plot threads come together. The anime really gets it's foot into gear and gets to the \"one part something bigger\" LA said at the start of the review, because of this, it goes into HUGE spoiler territory, if you want the short of this, the something bigger goes into either trying to save the world or destroy it with the occult club members divided because of it, it's also because of this we get to see Akane and Chihaya's deal and reasoning to the Occult Club and this last half of the anime is why LA liked Lucia and Akane, Akane for her character development and fleshing out the plot, Lucia because she became a badass. The last half also finally brings us who this Ribbon Girl is and the obvious hints as to who she is and even she gets a bit of character development (it makes sense as this anime is based on her route).\\n\\n\r\nIf anything the last half of the anime focuses on both the world building in which Kotarou didn't see from his typical highschool days as well as bring into light that his \"normal highschool days aren't as what they seem\". The world building does get REALLY serious to the point of \"world destruction\" and can be either a mood whiplash from the highschool hijinks or you'll like it taking this turn. LA however really liked how they ramped this up and as to how the main cast are ALL affected by this (and develop them at the same time). \\n\\n\r\nThe overall problems with this anime from both sides of the plot is this, it has filler episodes with typical cliche visual novel fair, cliche characters that do evolve their characters though Kotarou is the only exception due to his \"justice\" beliefs and wanting to protect his occult club members, sure he develops himself but in a very cliche way and is a more spectator for the majority of the anime and really Kotarou is the biggest crux to this story, you either think he's cliche and boring or you see his struggle. The other problem is that due to the change in tone Rewrite has it has some rather inconsistent pacing which can be rushed or slower than usual.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is by fair from decent but it's not horrible either, heck even the CGI monsters are typical and wildly weird looking but not to the point of being outright horrible. The animation on it's character designs from the anime poster alone shows us it has some decent vibrantly bright character designs. Really the animation is all over the place even if the animation has no errors or problems to it. 8Bit is trying but it's obvious the animation isn't the best element to the anime and can be easily another flaw in Rewrite.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting be all means is decent across the board, LA didn't really like any voice actor in general as all their vocals were typical fair, but if you had a gun to LA's head, LA would pick LA's favourite characters, Eri Kitamura as Senri and Risa Asaki as Lucia. Not much to talk about in the voice actor department..NEXT!\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was rather depressing to say the least, LA won't spoil at all, but it felt like fate couldn't be changed for all these characters which lead to this.......\"ending\". Thankfully there is a second season in the works which can hopefully work to it's advantage, but for a *cough* bad *cough* end it was abrupt and outright depressing.\\n\\n\r\nRewrite as LA said is a mixed bag and for a visual novel adaptation by Key but NOT done by Kyoto Ani but that's the least of it's problems, Rewrite has it's strengths and obvious weakness shown throughout this and there isn't much LA can say about this adaptation, it's mediocre at best, poorly handled at worse and the second season announcement, LA realize why they are doing that, but for the first season, it doesn't help with this \"route's\" adaptation if the final scenes of Rewrite is anything to say.  Mediocre is all LA can say, it's not horrible or great either...it could have been better.",
