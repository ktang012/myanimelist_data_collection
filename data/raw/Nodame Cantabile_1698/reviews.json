            "content": "Gyabo!\r\nI'm not sure why, but for some reason I've found myself reviewing certain franchises in reverse order. Then again, given the nature of Nodame Cantabile and its heroine Noda Megumi, maybe doing things in a not so normal manner is the way to go.\r\nFor those of you who don't know the series, Nodame Cantabile is based on the bestselling manga of the same name by Ninomiya Tomoko, and while I do like that particular work, the anime is a little bit special in that it's one of the rare occasions where the adaptation is as good as, or in this case better than, the original.\r\nWe'lltalk about that in a moment though.\\n\\n\r\nNow, many people have been raving about the current Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood series because of how faithful it is to the manga, but what many people seem to have forgotten is that there were already a few shows around that were almost completely true to their manga counterparts (and that didn't include much in the way of filler episodes) - Genshiken, Air Gear, History's Strongest Disciple and Nodame Cantabile to name but a few. In addition to this, many of the long running shounen franchises like Bleach, Naruto, One Piece, etc, generally  stay true to the manga for much of the main story, but have a tendency to provide \"anime original\" tales and filler episodes too.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of what one may think of a given show though, the surprising thing is that many faithful reproductions of the original manga are pretty decent, especially if the source material is good. When the tale is something like Nodame Cantabile though, then something special happens, something that doesn't happen very often in anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs with the manga, the story follows the \"adventures\" of the eccentric musical genius Noda Megumi, and her love interest, the handsome Chiaki Shinichi. The two meet by complete accident and Nodame quickly falls in love.\\n\\n\r\nWhat follows is, well, a roller coaster of laughs, many of which you won't see coming.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike many other romantic comedy anime, the action in Nodame Cantabile doesn't take place in a high school but instead centres around Momogaoka College of Music, and the difference in not only the mentality and personality of the characters, but the overall approach to the story and plot, is actually quite telling. When one watches the series, it becomes obvious that the characters are no longer children, and while they may not yet be out of full time education, their attitudes to life, the world, and to other people, are actually very different from what one encounters in the hordes of high school romantic comedies around.\\n\\n\r\nNow one of the main issues when it comes to adapting a manga is that of pacing, in particular how the plot flows from one episode to the next, and from one story arc to the next. With manga, as with anything written, the pacing is dictated by the reader, whereas with anime the pacing is already there, and it's up to the director to find the balance so that viewers and fans of the original work will warm to the adaptation. Thankfully, Kasai Kenichi (Honey & Clover, KimiKiss Pure Rouge, Major), managed to get the formula very close to what many viewers find acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, some of you may be confused by all this talk about pacing issues, but there's actually a good reason for bringing it up. Many shows can get by when the pacing is a little bit off from what you would prefer (Bleach, for example, with it's annoying recaps at the beginning of each episode), however Nodame Cantabile is a special case as problems with pacing and timing would have had disastrous effects on one's enjoyment of the show, and the reason for this is because the series lives, and dies, by its music.\\n\\n\r\nEarlier I mentioned that this anime is one of the rare occasions where the adaptation is better than the mange, and the reason for this is because of the music. Where the manga made do with track names and examples of written scores, actually hearing the music played in the anime brings the whole series to a new level. While there are a number of thematic tracks on offer, the heart and soul of Nodame Cantabile are the various pieces of classical music that are played throughout the series, whether it be solo or with an orchestra. In addition to this, unlike other classical music based anime like La Corda D'Oro ~Primo Passo~ and Piano no Mori, as well as the more pop/rock style shows like K-On, Beck, etc, one of the things that sets this series, indeed the whole franchise, apart is the aspect of musical appreciation.\\n\\n\r\nConfused? Well it's fairly easy to explain. One of the aspects of Nodame Cantabile that can heavily influence whether one enjoys the series or not is whether you, the viewer, actually listen to, and appreciate, the music itself. People may find that in order to better understand the character's passion for music, they will in turn listen to the track in a way that they may not have done with other shows, and while this may not seem obvious to most at first, a good question to ask come the end of the series is whether your opinion of classical music has improved over the course of the series. Nodame's antics may help things along with a good dose of comic relief, but the music is the glue that holds everything together.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the heavy musical emphasis, one would be forgiven for thinking that something was sacrificed in order for the whole thing to work. It's surprising then that Nodame Cantabile is actually pretty close to the manga in terms of plot and story, and although some alterations to the tale do occur, these are barely noticeable as they don't really contribute to any major changes in the plot or characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow, while the music is a hugely important factor when deciding if one will enjoy Nodame Cantabile, one other aspect will determine whether you love the series or not - the characters.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike many other romantic comedies the show has opted for a slightly more whimsical approach to love, life and relationships, and the characters are generally the epitome of this ethos. Noda Megumi (the titular Nodame), is not simply an eccentric musical genius, she is also thoroughly otaku, has a tendency to stalk her love interest, and hates cleaning. Chiaki, on the other hand, is a talented but arrogant musician who is widely regarded as the \"prince\" of the college. \\n\\n\r\nWhat sets this series apart from other romantic comedies is the manner in which the characters are used. While the two leads may be the focus of the show, there is considerable development on the part of several other supporting characters as they strive to become better musicians, and in keeping with the sentiments of the franchise, this never really occurs in the way one expects.\\n\\n\r\nActually, at heart Nodame Cantabile is simply a different take on the \"Beauty and the Beast\" format, with classical music and a bit of role reversal thrown in for good measure. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, there's nothing beastly about the looks, although there is a slight \"cartoon\" element to the facial features of the characters, something which is used to good effect during the funny moments. The overall design of the characters however, errs on the side of realism in respect of their movements, and while there's an over-the-top element to the actual animation of their movements during certain scenes, the majority of the time the characters move how one would expect a normal person to move.\\n\\n\r\nThe backdrops and settings are pretty well realised for the most part, although there is a watercolour feel to some of the scenery, and the colour palette seems more understated than in most other anime. The combination is strangely elegant in its own way, and makes the visual comedy and parodies of typical shoujo manga scenes funnier for some reason (but that may just be me). \\n\\n\r\nThe one issue I do have with the animation is this - why on earth choose such bad CG for the orchestrral scenes. Granted the animation is technically astute when it comes to finger movements and hand positions, but the overall execution is poor, and does not mesh well with the general feel of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons why I was attracted to this series is because I like classical music, however even I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Nodame Cantabile. The series plays fast and loose with the typical perception that such music is staid and proper, and the comedy is often surprising in both its accuracy and  its execution. Much of the humour is easily accessible to those with no knowledge of music, especially Nodame's notorious \"Fart Song\" and \"Moja Moja Suite\". This strange but well executed combination of classical music and comedy is a far cry from other shows, and the approach is far more tongue in cheek than one might initially expect. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to this, the depiction of student life is easily on a par with the like of Moyashimon and Genshiken, with everything that entails too. It's nice to see students doing things that students would actually do (like going out as a group and getting hammered).\\n\\n\r\nGiven the current glut of high school romantic comedies, Nodame Cantabile is a breath of fresh air because of its more mature yet whimsical take on love and life.",

            "content": "\"Let's go have some fun by playing some music.\"\r\nNodame Cantabile follows the lives of Chiaki, Nodame and an assortment of other musically talented characters attending Japan's top music university. Throughout their studies they encounter any number of trials and tribulations as their undying passion for the art grows evermore, and through each other they learn to appreciate music and performance in a whole different light, while also discovering true romance and what it is they want out of life.\r\nThe story is handled in such a mature, hard-hitting, ever so relatable way. A romantic, musically-focused plot about ardour in and outside of a relationship, Nodame Cantabileis not just for instrumentalists, romantics and music fans, but for doubters, dramatics and anyone who has ever had a passion. It's a relatable series with realistic characters, thoughtful dialogue and worldly themes of uncertainty, struggle and infatuation; as enjoyable and funny as it is heartbreaking and frank. It's well structured, wonderfully written and superbly developed. The plot has a real sense of purpose, there's genuine progress in the characters and just as many light-hearted, warm, fuzzy, humorous and loveable moments to be had as there is dramatic twists, heart-wrenching drama and eye-popping musical set pieces.\\n\\n\r\nAs with the plot, this exceptional quality and superb writing - which I should attribute a great deal to Tomoko Ninomiya as the author of the source material, along with the anime staff - is ever-present in the characters. The main characters - Chiaki and Nodame - are an always-interesting duo, and certain members of the supporting cast are extremely well matured; there's large amounts of progression not only in terms of their personality, but also in their actions and motivations. The characters feel very 'real' - even Nodame's sometimes outlandish behaviour never wears thin - they're down-to-earth, relatable, likeable and memorable creations, flawlessly complementing the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs a series focused on classical music, the sound department utulise many of the famous maestros, from Rachmaninoff to Bach. When the characters aren't performing or practicing, Matsutani Suguru provides the score, which blends seamlessly with the vintage classical tone of the famous compositions, while also adding a variety of more up-tempo, lighthearted tracks for comedic scenes. It's of particular note that, as the series progresses and introduces orchestras and large scale performances, the staff don't shy away from committing lengthy compositions to the screen. An episode of Nodame Cantabile has a run-time of twenty-two minutes, but during episodes which feature an orchestral performance, often nearly half or a third of that time the backing track will consist solely of a single arrangement. The staffs dedication and reluctance to cut corners with the music is admirable. Allowing the compositions to play for so long offers audiences a beauty and experience a sample would fail to execute. The music is Nodame Cantabile is handled with care and executed to perfection.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the series' only let-downs is in the animation. Despite committing to such lengthy compositions that beautifully eat away at a large portion of an episodes run-time, the animation becomes very stagnant and disappointing during the performance sequences. An orchestra is usually extremely lively, the conductor is filled with energy and there are constant bursts of movement, but this is often not depicted in Nodame Cantabile. Instead, audiences are presented with many panning shots of still frames, with only a small number of animated sequences in-between; this sadly sucks much of the life and excitement out of the performances. The rest of the animation is generally very fluid, however, and the sequences that do depict the motions of an instrument are beautifully done. The art style evokes well Niniomiya's manga; it has a very soft tone, pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile is a sensational, all-around compelling watch, not only for its masterful depictions of love, life and the beauty of music, but also for its comedic aspects. It's at times a lighthearted series, full of laughs and humour with precise comedic timing and intelligent punchlines. The hilarity never overstays its welcome, however, as the drama often takes the reins with full force, creating an abundance of memorable, affecting and emotive television. Nodame Cantabile is an ultimately moving series, with a completely fascinating story and spellbinding characters, depicting romance - in more ways than one - as beautiful as the classics themselves. It's an extremely admirable creation; certainly one of the genres best and an absolutely outstanding anime production.",

            "content": "I've seen my fair share of music anime, but this is the first time the musical genre has been my first love: classical music.\r\nSTORY - \"Work hard and you'll achieve your dream!\" It's a very cliche and often-used storyline, right? Well, yes. Yes, it is, but that hardly means that the subsequent series has to be old and tiresome. I've said before that the best stories take something that's been done a thousand times already and somehow manage to tell it in a way that's better and more interesting. In a genre dominated by high school drama, Nodame Cantabile steps it up and uses collegestudents, something I'd love to see happen more often. The storytelling happens in a mostly slice-of-life format, but it doesn't shy away from progressing significantly in time -- weeks pass, months pass, whole seasons and school years pass, and it's great to be able to follow the characters for these longer periods of time, especially since it emphasizes the fact that change and progress take both hard work and time.\\n\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile is very focused for a slice-of-life series in that almost all of the characters are very serious and motivated by their goals; there are notably few subplots that veer away from the main points. I think this can make it a bit more attractive to people that are generally bored by a wandering plotline, but it's pretty easy to get engaged in this series regardless. Reading summaries for Nodame Cantabile can only bring skepticism and doubt considering the frequency of the main plot, but watching it? I was charmed by episode one.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - Without a doubt, most of Nodame Cantabile's appeal is in its characters. Though it feels a little odd to use the adjective on him, Shinichi Chiaki is definitely gar: all the girls want him, and all the guys want to be him (actually, wait, some of the guys want him too). This most likely includes the members of the audience! He's a genius at what he does and furiously motivated; everywhere he goes, people throw themselves at his feet and do everything in their power to push him forward. You're compelled to cheer for him every step of the way. It's funny sometimes how that much charisma can make it through the screen, but it's there, and it's because despite Chiaki's exceeding excellence at everything, he remains a very accessible character. His weaknesses are just as glaring and significant as his strengths, and they're what balance him out. It's easy to imagine yourself in Chiaki's shoes.\\n\\n\r\nNodame, strangely enough, is very much the same. She's crazy, quirky, wild, and questionable, but once again, she's very human. Her antics are never so over-the-top that they're utterly unbelievable, and her hopes and dreams are notably muddled alongside her classmates' -- something a lot of people can also relate to. The differences between Nodame and Chiaki made them perfect foils, and it was really fun watching all the drama and interaction between the two. Despite the frequency of Nodame's claims on Chiaki, I really felt like this was one of the least forced-feeling romances I've ever seen. At no point did their relationship feel cheap, contrived, or overly convenient. Because so much time passes during the series, the relationship felt like it progressed at a much more natural place; it was great (and adorable).\\n\\n\r\nAll of the support characters are nice in their own way, and I don't think there was a single one I disliked. One of the reasons I loved that this series features college-aged students is the fact that they can all drink, smoke, and have sex and it isn't shocking or scandalous! It also added a nice bit of insight into the lives of Japanese college students and their hilarious nightlifes (clubs, arcades, and karaoke!) when they aren't busy studying. \\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - Nodame Cantabile has a pretty damn simple and generic art style, but in that simplicity, it's hard to find anything to pick at. The only thing that stands out for me in the character design is that many characters look like they're perpetually blushing, which is a little confusing at times -- once I got used to it though, it really wasn't that big of a deal.\\n\\n\r\nThe most obvious critique of the animation in this series comes from the numerous still-frames used in the dozens of playing and concert montages. As an anime about music, there's obviously a lot of music-playing involved. Especially in scenes involving entire orchestras, the animation is minimal to none -- nine out of ten times you see a flute, a clarinet, an oboe, a french horn, or a cello, the players' arms and fingers aren't moving. The ratio is slightly improved for violin, and the piano gets the most attention with moving fingers maybe 40% of the time. It's understandable though; after all, animating individual fingers playing instruments with many keys is incredibly difficult, especially for the piano, when they make a huge effort to animate the actual notes that are being played.\\n\\n\r\nAside from piano, where we're sometimes lucky enough to get ten to twenty measures of music at a time, most instruments are only shown being played for seconds at a time, and it's often CG. This makes the rendering of the instrument perfectly accurate and shiny (especially the clarinets and oboes), and I loved catching those sniplets of action in between the panning shots. There are a lot of still shots, but I do think what they do show us is worth it. There is one concert near the beginning of the series that's about half an episode's worth of still montages, but that's the worst of it -- as the series progresses, there's gradually more and more actual playing. :3\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - Ah, classical music! And of such a nice variety too! I was happy to see that the selection of music in Nodame Cantabile represented more than just the select few scores and piano pieces known by the general public. Most of the composers are still familiar, but there are also lesser-known names such as Debussy, Ravel and Sarasate. Unfortunately, as much as I do love classical music, I don't have a trained enough ear to be able to tell whether or not the music played in the series was tailored specifically for it -- for example, when characters supposedly play a piece poorly, I really can't tell. When characters supposedly improvise and don't play exactly what the piece dictates, I can't tell. \\n\\n\r\nI would think that a vast majority of the pieces would be professionally recorded pieces borrowed for the series though, and that they're all free of glaring errors. (I just can't imagine that they'd budget the money required to hire an entire orchestra to mess up.) Still, at least some of the piano solos (the Moja Moja Suite? The improvised piano version of some made-up show?) had to have been recorded for the show. Overall, all of the music is very pleasing to listen to and well-performed. Maybe you don't be moved to tears like the characters are, but if you're even a mild fan of classical music, you'll be fine. :)\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - Seki Tomokazu and Ayako Kawasumi both do a great job with their leads. As both characters go through a full range of emotions, their voices had to match up appropriately, and they did! Especially for a character like Nodame, who habitually puts up one front while fostering other thoughts and feelings inside, it was really important that she have a good voice. The rest of the characters all had pretty nice voices as well, though no others really stood out to me as being particularly notable.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - As a longtime fan of classical music, an amateur pianist, and a former clarinetist, Nodame Cantabile was both inspiring and nostalgic. It made me want to play more piano, and it made me really miss playing the school band or orchestra. It was educational, giving insight into the world and careers of classical musicians, and it was touching, allowing for a window in the lives of some very believable characters. It was hilarious and very silly at times, but I don't think it ever crossed the line into over-the-top territory. Even for those who aren't huge, huge fans of classical music, I think this series has enough merit to warrant a taste, and for those who are fans, you definitely don't want to miss this series. I already can't wait to move onto the sequel. :3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Personally, I think Nodame Cantabile is in a league by itself when it comes to chemistry between characters.\r\nYou can compare it to tons of anime that has that general theme of \"practice hard and keep trying and reach for your goals\"... but that wouldn't give you the whole picture.  Each person of the central core of characters is so unique and distinct and finely tuned that it brings the idea of knowing a character to a whole new level.  By the end of the series, you know their goals, their motivations, their attitude, their style, their history... and at the center of allthese rich, amazing characters are Nodame and Chiaki: the child-like, natural savant without an iota of discipline and the despairing, rigid genius of music royalty who has lost the forest for the trees.  Once you buy into the premise that they're both incredibly talented, you find out that they've both been pushed to opposing extremes -- somewhat by choice, somewhat by circumstance -- and over the course of 23 episodes, you can see how they slowly influence each other's lives and music in a way that's realistic and beautiful and charming and heartwarming... how they bring out the best in each other.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also really refreshing to have main characters in a romance who aren't your typical strong-assertive-type meets meek-pushover-type.  Nodame and Chiaki each have their individual strengths and weaknesses.  He's incredibly arrogant and impatient and rigid and controlling.  And she's so hapless and quirky and irresponsible and oblivious and... dirty.  They both are very attached to their own way of doing things and they both kind of just... bulldoze over each other.  When you put them in a room together, sparks just fly.  ...And it's really, really fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI'm kind of a sucker for guys like Chiaki anyway, but I don't think I'd be the only one to find his relationships with everyone funny and endearing... for some reason, the way he takes care of Nodame is just really funny.  \\n\\n\r\nThe other thing I really liked about the show was the music.  Just amazing music; amazing understanding of music and amazing use of music.  I really enjoyed getting to see the development of certain pieces of music from the first run-through to the final performance.  I'm not a musician myself and I know next to nothing about classical music or orchestras, so I thought it was a fascinating look at the work and the dedication and everything that goes into the performances.  And to my layman's eyes, the imagery that they use to illustrate the feel and the flavor of the individual pieces was incredibly lovely and insightful (see: the ripples at the beginning of the Rachmaninoff piece and the pink flower petals during the oboe concerto).  It made me feel like I had been missing out on something amazing all my life -- that's how good of a job they do in expressing the passion and devotion to music in these characters.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, visually, I got a little tired of the pans across the stunned audience member shots... but most of those scenes was about listening to the piece more than anything anyway.  They also tend to do a lot of panning over stills in general, but the pros far, far, far outweigh any cons, so it's pretty easy to not care about that sort of thing.\\n\\n\r\nI could probably nitpick a little about the plot and such if those things bothered me at all while watching the show... but they really didn't, mainly because... well, did the show even have a plot?  The &quot;action&quot; of the story is so... inconsequential, that complaining about how something happens is like... missing the whole point of the show.  So it's probably enough to say that if you're looking for something that's about what happened or what to do next, Nodame Cantabile might not interest you so much.  Frankly, almost nothing actually &quot;happens&quot; except for the mundane or the completely to-be-expected.  If you're looking for a show that really seems to enjoy getting to know this group of people and the passion they have in common... this is something you absolutely cannot miss.\\n\\n\r\nI really can't say enough good things about this show; just watch it!! =) =) =)\\n",

            "content": "What can I say about Nodame Cantobile? It was one of those anime that you can\\'t help but enjoy. It managed to tell a fun story in which each of the characters try to accomplish what they want out of life with a careful mix of humor and drama.\r\nOne of the main draws, I felt, is the believability of the characters. You will not find a perfect guy surrounded by other perfect people with wild personalities. You will, instead, find people who you could probably relate to. Each has his or her own strengths and weaknesses. The character drawings are also top notch. Again, theyjust have a sense of realism to them that often goes unnoticed. Even the animations and setting gel well together (though I think they overused the &quot;vertical blue lines&quot; expression).\\n\\n\r\nThe story was a nice break from other anime I have seen. All of the characters are trying to make their way in the world of music. They all struggle for success, which is a good lesson to viewers. Even the romance between the two main characters, Chiaki and Noda, integrates itself well. Nothing is overdone to the point of boredom, and each character has his or her role to play. The ending makes you wish for more, but it does it well enough so that you would not complain. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in it is great. The character interactions will make you chuckle more than a few times, especially between Noda and Chiaki. Their relationship is almost a mockery.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are great, as is to be expected in an anime about classical music. The full orchestra pieces sound fantastic, and it is not uncommon for me to have Nodame Cantobile running in the background of my computer just for the music, especially in the last few episodes. The character voices are also well picked and never get annoying.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I thought this anime came pretty darn close to perfect. I rather wish they would have used more than just the &quot;blue lines&quot; as the embodiment of sickness and had more movement during the musical pieces, but these are minor trifles. This anime was great and I recommend it to almost everyone (except maybe those who revel in blood and violence. You will see none of that in Nodame Cantobile.)",

Humour is ok, but hits you repeatedly over the head with a very obvious, familiar hammer. Animation consists of a lot of panning over stills and simple, abstract backgrounds. However, the male lead is intriguing, ambitious and flawed. The setting is also quite romantic and exotic to the average viewer. The show could at least have been enjoyable if not for its most fatal fault -- a female lead who is stereotypically brainless, romance-obsessed, unambitious, strident, and one-dimensional.\r\nIt all just got very boring, very fast.",

            "content": "Introduction\r\nNodame Cantabile is love at first sight.  From the very first episode, you notice it is something special.  Not only does it entertain, but it also inspires passion, appreciation for beauty, and transports you to your own personal paradise.  If I could, I would give this anime an 11 because I cannot and will not compare it to any other anime. \r\nStory\r\nThe story is deep yet not complicated enough to detract you from the main plot.  An arrogant and talented college student with both ambition and passion chases his dream of being a conductor with the help of other young musicianswho are inspired by his talent and charm.  The pace is just right; the story continues to push forward but gives you enough time to reflect and rejoice in the moment.  It does not try to overpower the anime, but lets the other elements like the music shine right through.  \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile surpasses every other anime I have ever seen in this category.  The whole anime is a work of art.  They know how to bring music to life in the anime and build suspense with the intensity of emotion displayed in the audience and musician's faces.  You become part of the show when you watch this anime and they do a great job of expressing music with artistic imagery and interpretation.  The opening and ending were my favorites.  The opening does a great job of energizing you with its uplifting tempo and catchy melody and makes you feel like you are hearing the beach boys yet the lyrics match the anime perfectly.  The 2nd ending was one of my favorite endings of all time as it seemed like the perfect way to descend from the paradise the anime elevated me to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nAs for the characters, the hero, Chiaki, seems to carry the weight of the world on his back yet he never misses a step and continues to persevere.  He's not perfect, he has character flaws such as his temper and arrogance as well as some major weaknesses like his fear of flying and sailing.  However, his weaknesses make his character more believable and admirable.  He's the passionate hero we all long to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNodame, the female lead, is the fun, quirky character who plays opposite to Chiaki.  Their contrasting styles and personalities make the anime very interesting and entertaining to watch.  Although, I wouldn't say that there is much romantic development between the two as they do not even kiss during the entire series.  However, the viewers don't seem to mind because this anime is a lot more than its story, characters, art, and animation.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nTo really appreciate this anime, you have to be able to perceive the beautiful flow and mixing of the elements.  The characters could not flourish without their passion for music and unique backgrounds.  The animation could not be a masterpiece without the wondrous marriage of art and music.  Together, they all create a beautiful symphony that could not be enjoyed piecemeal.  \\n\\n\r\nTry to let yourself go when you watch this, close your eyes from time to time and feel the music rushing through your veins and you will be sure to feel goosebumps as you imagine the feelings and emotions that the characters were motivated by.  \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nThose who are easily swept off their feet by the sound of classical music, seek characters who entertain and surprise you, and have an open mind and soul will truly benefit from watching this anime.  If you approach this anime in the right mindset, its beauty will penetrate you like an arrow that strikes you at the heart.  And when you wake up, you will come as close to heaven as you can possibly get.  No matter what your tastes, you will probably find something to like about this anime.",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile is strange in some regards. It has a good story, full of excellent music, but the transition into the anime medium is a rocky and half-hearted one.\r\nYou'd think such a boundless medium as anime would be perfect to accompany some of the timeless symphonies of Schubert or Beethoven, but alas, Nodame gets the short end of the stick in their animation budget. Countless still-frame pans and awkward CG hands for the musical pieces detract from the quality of the scene. It's really better to just close your eyes and take it in, rather than look at the screen while Chiaki and Nodame areperforming. Outside performance scenes, the animation is respectable enough, but it's subdued and bland so much that nothing leaves a visual impression.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Nodame Cantabile's strongest aspect is by far the music, and it right well should be. This is a show that revolves around music and it would be an embarrassment to have anything of lesser quality. The music for Nodame highlights the setting of the series with an array of familiar classic pieces. Though the OP, ED and BGM variations of both are original, they accentuate scenes and the series very well. There's little if anything to complain about here.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, a show entirely about music might get tiresome. Why not just put on a Brahms CD instead? Well, Nodame Cantabile is not entirely about music, but the story it tells is far from as perfect as the music. The problem here is that the series, and therefore probably the manga it was based on, does not have a given direction for the first several episodes. It constantly switches tangents in a wildly unstable way up until the halfway mark when it settles on a direction and runs wonderfully with it. If only this first season could have started as well as it ended.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, fortunately, is told through two painstakingly unique characters. Both Nodame and Chiaki have multiple facets to their lives and personalities, so much that there are times that hating them is natural and others where you can't help but love them. In short, they are as human as anime characters come. No one else is quite like them, and I certainly wouldn't be surprised if there were real life bases for the two of them. Supporting characters are a different story. Often they are one-characteristic personalities, though there are exceptions like Strasemann. Unfortunately, most supporting characters disappear as quickly as they appear, or simply fade into the background. Once one shines, they are promptly disposed of. It's a little disheartening given how wonderful the leads are.\\n\\n\r\nThough Nodame has many faults and is far from the perfection it's MAL rating leads one to believe, it is a solid but conventional story as told by two very memorable characters with a timeless soundtrack. Portions of this series are outstanding, while other sections just seem to drag. Your experience, if the other reviews have anything to say about it, may differ. From where I stand though, Nodame is just a good story done well. Nothing more and nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Nodame Cantabile an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "\"Where words leave off, music begins.\"\r\n               - Heinrich Heine\r\nThe anime that's been remade into movies in several different countries countless number of times: Nodame Cantabile. What makes Nodame Cantabile so good? It's beauty. The growth of two rather immature adults is artfully done not only in their relationship, but their personalities as well. The romance in this anime was well handled, and I don't know (besides Kaichou) an anime that I wanted the main characters to get together so badly. Furthermore, the addition of absolutely beautiful classical music was ravishing: includedmasterpieces composed by Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Rachmaninoff, Debussy, and Schubert. The music not only added feelings, and enjoyment to the series but also showed just how music impacts (people) the characters and relationships in the series. I felt as though I were there at a live performance concert of famous magicians; the feeling was magical. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is basically about Chiaki Shinichi, who is one of the most talented musicians in the world. However, his ambition to become a conductor and study under the renowned Sebastiano Viera puts him at odds with his piano teacher, Etou. Chiaki\u2019s fear of flying prevents him from leaving Japan to become Viera\u2019s student. After being dropped from Etou\u2019s class, which leads to Chiaki also being dumped by his girlfriend, Tagaya Saiko, Chiaki meets a bizarre, messy girl, Noda Megumi (who insists on being called \u201cNodame\u201d), a piano student under Chiaki\u2019s new teacher. Chiaki doesn\u2019t like Nodame, but is strangely drawn to her; on the other hand, Nodame almost instantly falls in love with Chiaki. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the anime was wondrous and each minor detail about what happens behind the scenes, what characters feel, how they develop were all skillfully executed. \\n\r\nThe character development was well done as well, I could definitely relate to Nodame, with her crush on Chiaki, and then the development to come. The music in the anime is the best music in anime, why? Because, they incorporated world wide famous classical pieces in, and the anime's music itself was beautiful as well; Hence the anime being about the beauty of Music and how it incorporates in our everyday life. I'd definitely recommend this anime to EVERYONE.",

            "content": "~!~ WARNING: Some spoilers may be present ~!~\r\nAh... such a wonderful pick out of a random selection...\r\nIf you were like me, you were going through lists upon lists of anime to watch and, mostly likely if you are reading this, stumbled on this series. Now, I must admit, I was reluctant to watch this at first. I knew nothing of the manga nor the anime. I passed the chance to watch this quite a few times. However, as soon as I sat down and witnessed the first episode, I was eager to see the next episode growing more excited to see one after another.\r\nNodame Cantabileis an anime that isn't exactly like your ordinary anime. You'd struggle to find any kind of cliche within it unless you nit-picked the characters. It's an anime that you are unsure to watch at first as you aren't use to the style or how it presents itself. Once you do, though, it's almost gloriously perfect.\\n\\n\r\n~ Story 9/10 ~\\n\r\nThe story is excellent. As soon as you begin, you are dropped into a college school of musical arts where students learn the finesse of classical music and piano. Shinichi Chiaki is one of those students who happens to have issues obtaining his true goals from phobias along with his own personality and his main goal: becoming a conductor.\\n\r\nOur other protagonist, Megumi Nodame, is also a piano student at the same school. Her goals are not as high as Chiaki's, but are very humble and almost comical while being heartwarming as she first strives to be a kindergarten teacher. Both these characters meet by their talents for music and become glued at first meeting.\\n\r\nI wont tell much, but the story has so much influence from music. Classical and other forms of music literally litter each episode beautifully. The story would be nothing if not for for this crucial part. Although it seems weird to talk about music for a story, it's more of something you have to see for yourself to understand why it's important.\\n\r\nThe story buries down to the two striving to accomplish their goals while dealing with personal issues, family, and their own thoughts of what they want. If you enjoy a touching story dealing with a growing romance that's always consisting of humor and sometimes drama, this anime is worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\n~ Art 9/10 ~\\n\r\nThe art style to the anime isn't ordinary but almost feels important for the entirety. Each character you come across seems to be designed to show off their personality. In fact, subtle to blunt symbolism can be found quite often as the story progresses. The art is heavily touched, however, when it comes to the music scenes themselves. The instruments are detailed and displayed well within their style. The animation is normal without anything special, yet never seems to go too askew or clumsy which is important.\\n\\n\r\n~ Sound 10/10 ~\\n\r\nOH BOY!\\n\r\nYou expected this, didn't you? How could an anime about music have poor sound?\\n\r\nYou'd be surprised that there is anime that, yes, does supply poor sound sometimes. However, the soundtrack is marvelous in this. The opening and ending theme is quite enjoyable. The character's voice actors do well to portray personality through tone and dialogue. The music, however...\\n\r\nThere are scenes within Nodame Cantabile where the main characters and many others will play songs from instruments of a wide variety. You will hear piano classics, orchestras, singing, and many other relatives to the classical genre. They will last for minutes on end, yes, but the scenes are astonishing and great to listen to ESPECIALLY if you are a fan of classical music.\\n\\n\r\n~ Character 8/10 ~\\n\r\nEach person will have a main trait so the humor can be made. Even with that, the characters also display deeply in themselves around these edges and become quite detailed during the serious moments.\\n\r\nShinichi is a serious person and even more serious when it comes to music. He is arrogant, blunt, and insensitive while not realizing it (or not caring to be sensitive). Shinichi's pros reside with his growth in the story as he matures in his skill and personality. His greatness all falls down to music and his skill of being a perfectionist at everything. He's marvelous at piano and violin, and picks up conducting so fast with such skill that even professional music critiques are surprised that such a young man has such talent. His greatest skill displays from his accuracy as he can listen to the smallest of details in an orchestra.  Shinichi is naive numerous times but has his moments where he seems so caring and kind. His character is one where you will find yourself cringing at your computer, getting aggravated by his aggressive personality, and smiling while maybe even surprised by his touching nature.\\n\r\nNodame is your typical, goofy character. The first time you will meet her, it already shows from her silly piano playing and face she makes as she plays. Many people in the story wonder why she even bothers playing piano, mock her skill, and even insult her from her personality. She is quite the odd person as her social skills can prove to be bubbly yet awkward. She doesn't understand importance as her goals can be simple while her lifestyle is odd. She rarely cleans and plays the piano as she pleases without caring to be accurate. She can sometimes lack common sense or intelligence in scenes because of this which only makes her more charming. As much as she is a goof, pervert, lazy person, Nodame is a lovely character and seems to be the character that really pulls the anime altogether. She has an amazing skill when it comes to the piano being able to accurately play music that she only has to hear and can even add her own style and notes to it. Throughout the anime, you'll find that she's almost like Mozart for many reasons.\\n\r\nThe background characters are also pleasing when they show up, being unique and nicely placed. Some are average and some are odd. Either way, as you watch, you'll find yourself paying attention to these characters quite easily and even grow to like them. If not, you will surely love the two main characters and their antics throughout the story.\\n\r\nI would have given this section a 9/10 if it wasn't for the characters lacking a bit. All too often I felt as if the characters weren't expressive or shocking enough. They seemed too flat at times and possibly even predictable. This is rare, however, and overwhelmed by the fact of the characters changing over time as if aging.\\n\\n\r\n~ Enjoyment 9/10 ~\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile does not fail when it comes to blending it's finely tuned points. It's comedy is childishly humorous and sometimes intelligently funny. It never seems too misplaced and adds a great rendition to the episodes. The drama isn't extremely heavy at times but very serious at other moments. The comedy, drama, and romance tie together perfectly without intertwining and making a terrible mess of everything.\\n\r\nThat said, the anime is so enjoyable. It's not your typical anime. You wont find random fight scenes with characters beating each other with violins. You wont find odd harems out of nowhere. It's normal and great to watch. Each episode has its own importance. It never really gets boring and even has this feeling of progression. I've had anime where I could easily skip an episode or two and not miss anything. Here, you can't do that and might even feel ashamed just to do so.\\n\r\nIf you had ANY intention of watching this anime at all,\\n\r\ngive the first few episodes a try atleast just to see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile pulls off this kinda thing where you watch it and it stands out from other animes you've seen. Perhaps it's the characters with their personalities, skills, and personal issues. Maybe it's the wonderful soundtrack that leaves every episode having a great tune. Maybe it's the art and animation that's simple yet pleasing. Could be the story that has something great and impressively divine.\\n\r\nWho knows. It's a wonderful romance tale of two people who you learn much about and grow to love while witnessing them become almost gods of the classical music genre. The series is great every single episode without being too much or too little and leaves you satisfied with at the end of this season. Not an anime you'd push aside without notice or kinda enjoy, but an anime you'd ponder in thought over even after being finished with it. You wont be able to settle with one episode if you enjoy it and even becomes addicting with it's light story.\\n\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile is worth the watch for its many aspects. If you thought about it, give it a watch. You wont be disappointed and will even find yourself hunting down the sequel seasons just to progress further into the story and characters.",

            "content": "Nodame.  She just captured my heart entirely and left me glowing inside and out.\r\nNodame Cantabile is a story of musicians, Chiaki Shinichii and Noda Megumi, striving to overcome memories that haunt them.  \r\nThe story is simple since this is a slice of life genre, it deals more of what life of a musician is all about, especially musicians with bad memories.  I scored 9 on the story because even though the plot is simple, the realism in it is admiring.\r\nAt first glance, my impression of the art is \"Honey and Clover?\"  When I checked, both animations have the same animators, J.CStaff.  I thought, &quot;hmmmm...&quot;  The use of light colors was amazing.  They even made it to the point where everything is proportional.  The drawback is, I cannot distinguish the faces of the characters.  Some of the minor characters have the same facial features, making it difficult who is who.  What I love on the animation is how the hands, fit into the notes of the music.  It is not just a bunch of random drawings of people sitting on pianos, playing violins and performing in orchestras, but the hands play exactly what the music portrays.  Their animation cannot fool the eyes of a musician.  Although timing the animation and the music is hard, I believe, but I wish they could do more of those (a personal opinion because I love watching the hands of musicians playing their instruments rather than watching them perform from afar).\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also perfect.  I just wished though that I knew the pieces played so that I could judge that they did add notes unto the piece when the story says so.  But as a classical music lover, it is definitely outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nI love the characters in the anime.  Megumi, the fun loving, childish pianist while Shinichii the strict, perfectionist jack-of-all-music-trades, clash as opposite characters. But despite the irony, they fit together snuggly.  The growth of the characters was clearly shown when both tried to overcome their past to strive for a better future.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed watching this series.  Definitely a top list in my &quot;rewatch series.&quot;  It gives comedy and romance a different perspective at one time.  I wasn't able to help myself at giggling at the silly antics of Megumi and the iron attitude of Shinichii while also falling in love on their relationship and struggles.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like nothing-of-the-absurd types of anime like Honey and Clover, Nodame Cantabile should definitely be on your list and a top at that. \\n\\n\r\nI'm going now, out to get my own DVD copy of this series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPoof!",

            "content": "A quite funny argument you might find occasionally in defense of a work is the saying \u201cyou watched it wrong\u201d, implying that any criticism the person might have to the series in question comes from having watched it with the wrong mindset. While I find particularly silly that one would primarily assume such case about someone else\u2019s opinion when facing criticism to a beloved work, since it\u2019s a very pretentious attitude, it doesn\u2019t seem unlikely that a circumstance like that can happen. That was the issue I faced when I began watching Nodame Cantabile, an anime I started with the expectation of being a straightand pure romance, a genre that I\u2019m especially attracted to, as some of my favorites might have hinted. While romance is an important aspect of the anime, I soon came to realize it wasn\u2019t the focus of the story. Nodame Cantabile is instead a story about the passion for music and perseverance for the art, with romance being relevant, but secondary.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters\\n\\n\r\nIf you are by any chance sick to death of the high school setting (I\u2019m not) you can relax with this one, because Nodame Cantabile takes place at a music College, where the characters are adult enough to be thinking about meaningful aspects of life, like the pursuit of a career or marriage, and not be obnoxiously shy around the idea of sex, but still enrolled in a setting that requires them to go through a similar routine to that of a high school anime. Except the playing at orchestras part, obviously. There\u2019s frankly not much I can comment about the progression without addressing it as it relates to the characters, so let\u2019s get to them.\\n\\n\r\nChiaki is the main and best character of the series. He\u2019s focused, hardworking and dedicated to his dream of becoming a conductor, which reflects on his skills as a musician, that make him widely respected among his college mates. Only these attributes, however, could make him an unbearable Mary Sue, so he also features quite pertinent flaws that are obvious even to those who admire him. He\u2019s impatient, has a slight superiority complex and, at the beginning, is quite persistent about interpreting music strictly the way it\u2019s written. His character arc is focused first of all in understanding the human aspect of playing a song, taking into consideration when to be bossy and when to let loose and understand the impetus of the musician, as well as the heart of the song. Perhaps the only misstep of his development would be when, halfway through the story, the series brings more of his life outside of music, expanding his relationship with his family, an aspect which, unfortunately, is cut short and not given the depth it deserves, when the rest of his arc is so competently conducted.\\n\\n\r\nNoda Megumi, or Nodame, as she is commonly called, is the main female lead and a complete air-head. She is a talented pianist, but unlike Chiaki, displays a carefree play style and attitude. Being blunt, Nodame is the weaker end of the character line-up of the series. She seems to have barely any agency or meaning to Chiaki\u2019s character in the first arc, with a clearly one sided dynamic in regards to the romance for most of the duration of the anime. After witnessing Chiaki play on a College event is that she realizes the difference in skill between them and the plot hints at a possible development to her character, just to quickly revert her back to normal, an event that seems to be fairly recurrent until the conclusion, when she finally takes measures into improving as a musician. She is actually a character that would benefit from being placed in high school, as in this instance her immaturity and behavior would be coherent with the setting. Nearing the conclusion, more of her past is laid out to the viewer, although lacking the depth and sense of weight that would give it stronger impact.\\n\\n\r\nNext in line is Stresemann, an experienced and reputed conductor with a womanizing habit, very loose work ethics and irresponsible behavior. Right after his introduction, Stresemann gives barely any reason to support why he would be a competent conductor, let alone a renowned one, up until the second quarter, when he takes a stronger role as an agent of the story, by taking Chiaki under his guidance, bringing more attention to his talent, as well as helping him take the stick off his ass and open up as a musician. Through his influence is that Chiaki first notices the importance of not simply being an authoritarian leader and taking into consideration the state of the musicians working under his baton.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing up on the characters that mean something, there\u2019s Mine, a violinist and Chiaki\u2019s friend. He is a very proactive character, responsible for the idea of forming an orchestra under Chiaki\u2019s leadership after several students graduate and is incredibly passionate about keeping that orchestra alive, taking decisions for that matter that highlight the quality of his character. His influence over the plot and Chiaki\u2019s character is not overbearing, but easily noticeable, being for the most part stronger than that of Nodame herself.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining figures have varying degrees of depth to them, but generally light effect in the plot besides being placeholders for meaningful contextual positions within the narrative. This may sound like a criticism, but it isn\u2019t, their job is to help move the story in small pieces according to their purpose within the orchestra and their personalities have meaning defined by what they extract from the main characters or in how they perceive the dynamic among them, and, frankly, being restricted to those positions is just fine, as attempting to delve deeper into their lives could potentially derail the story from its main focus. Speaking of which: the anime keeps itself steadily centered around Chiaki\u2019s growth as a musician as he sediments his name as a talented conductor in the eyes of the more experienced and famous figures of the industry. His path is portrayed in believable manner, as his connections to people who can bring him attention help spread his name, but it\u2019s his talent that wins them over. Near the end, once he has enough ground to make riskier decisions for his future, the anime shifts its gaze to Nodame. It\u2019s at this point that the romance actually develops to a conclusive end, although it lacks more of the nuance that would make the transition to a full romantic relationship warranted.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the visuals, Nodame Cantabile is generally weak. Taking aside the purposefully bland color pallet, character designs tend to be very samey in the overall structure (long faces, small eyes, wide and expressive mouths, etc) and the level of detail applied to them is decent, effective in giving them personality and making them distinguishable, but overall far from impressive. For the portions where they play any instrument, the series makes use of CGI, which is surprisingly well-implemented. It\u2019s used to give the characters fluid movement, syncing really well with the music, and it\u2019s colored in fairly seamless fashion, in order to avoid making such scenes disconnected from the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe highlights of the presentation, as expected, reside on the sequences where the music is center-frame. Originally, the performance bits center more of the physical aspect of playing or in the character\u2019s small growth at that instant, so the relation between the music and the visuals is treated in very bland fashion. After a bunch of people start to fall in love the presentation develops to show a bit more care into enriching the musical performances, inserting more personality between the song and visuals. The flare added by this integration helps to better hide the technical shortcomings of the series in these scenes specifically, although the usage of still frames continues to be a blatant and frequent annoyance.\\n\\n\r\nGiving the main theme of Nodame Cantabile, it\u2019s to be expected that the series would feature some striking classical pieces from composers like Brahms, Mozart and Schubert. The pieces are, off course, celebrated works, so the only possibility that might derail your enjoyment is if you happen to dislike classical music. This does, however, create a disconnect in the case the audience is not versed in music of this variety: many scenes have characters asserting about the quality of the performance or making criticism to the musicians, frequently using terminology related to music so if you don\u2019t have knowledge of the art to that degree, discerning how exactly one performance is better than the other is unlikely to happen. These sequences are clearly meant to be enjoyed by people to are knowledgeable of classical music, as the average viewer will have the minutia fly over their heads. Like me.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Ramblings\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s go back a bit to the subject I talked about in the intro and ask: how to define what is to \u201cwatch something the wrong way\u201d? I believe that is a simple issue of approach. It\u2019s hard to define, previously to watching or reading any given work, what is the appropriate mindset to be in, which can lead to disappointing first impressions. The bigger issue, though, is if the viewer refuses to accept that the work is something different and stays in that mindset throughout the work, leading to an unfair judgement of its qualities and flaws.. In the case of Nodame Cantabile, though, it wasn\u2019t hard to realise early on that I was approaching the series through the wrong angle and then change it, so I believe my judgement for the remainder of the series was in line with what it was trying to convey.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the ending result was a really good show I can\u2019t shake off the feeling that the prototype for something even better was there, but the series misses opportunities to achieve that level and rise to a truly great or excellent work. In many occasions it felt like there were much better characters in need of some spotlight, but those characters were overshadowed by Nodame\u2019s quirks, which could be fairly entertaining in their own right, but that time could be better spent in legitimate character growth, either for Nodame or the sidecast. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I surely believe the show is a good recommendation, but one can benefit from being mindful of what they are going to find. Being eclectic doesn\u2019t hurt anyway!",

            "content": "I have to admit, I was very worried about this. I ended up putting off watching it for two weeks, even. It's all because I know absolutely nothing about music, especially the classics. If it sounds good, I'll listen to it. Doesn't matter to me what the instruments are or how long it took to perfect. \r\nWhen I found Nodame Cantabile, I was intrigued, but hesitant. I figured this was an anime that required knowledge of classical music, the instruments and how an orchestra operates. \r\nI watched the first episode and I was hooked, spending a day and a half watching all of the episodes,delighted to find that all the knowledge I thought I would need wasn't required. What this anime does best is showing and telling all about the music world, but it doesn't leave you out. If you don't know the flute you were made to practice with in second grade from a piccolo, it doesn't actually matter. See, I probably fucked up that analogy right there, because I don't know shit about instruments. My point is, this anime doesn't try to be high-collar, where only the musicians of the world would ever get the smallest intricacy. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters carried this story, especially Noda and Chiaki. Their dynamic is ... interesting to say the least. Chiaki is a perfectionist and Noda, well, she's a slob, and by all means these two should be at each others' throats - the dynamic just shouldn't work - but it does. They are exactly what the other needs in order to grow. They play off each other really well and become more ... human (especially in Chiaki's case). \\n\\n\r\nChiaki learns from Noda that he shouldn't chase after perfection because it's the imperfections that make something great; Noda learns passion, willpower and courage from Chiaki. \\n\\n\r\nWithout Noda, Chiaki would never have been able to conduct the orchestra as well as he does because he'd never connect with the musicians. In fact, if he had continued to be insensitive I have no doubt the orchestra would've walked out on him.\\n\\n\r\nNoda's problems get a bit more of the focus; she's very talented, playing a song perfectly because she \"played it by ear\" meaning all she had to do was listen to it to get it, though she has difficulty playing it without putting her own unique style into it, earning her many a slap from her teachers. But past issues dulled her ambition to go pro, until she meets Chiaki, who continuously inspires her to do better and be better, though she does still have her inhibitions. \\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime, and I'm sad that this portion of the story is over; it was so much fun!",

            "content": "Nodame Cantibile is a lighthearted and comedic anime about one of my favorite hobbies, music.  At first I was hesitant to explore the series due to my lack of appreciation for the classical genre, but what I found in Nodame Cantibile was more than just music.  This was a coming of age story of sorts, with a feel good plot line and characters full of passion, all battling their own internal struggles to be better musicians.  It\u2019s definitely a nice change of pace and a must see for any slice of life fan, or enthusiast of music in general.\r\nI don\u2019t have anymajor complaints about the story in this series, but at the same token, I wasn\u2019t necessarily blown away.  For the entire 23 episodes, viewers follow Nodame and Chiaki, both students at the same Japanese music school as they grow both as individuals and through their musical talents.  The added atypical romance subplot was interesting, as an awkward attraction exists between them (well, mostly just Nodame).  Boy meets neighbor girl.  Girl turns out to be weird as hell.  Girl thinks boy is a handsome prince.  Girl is the metaphoric rain man of piano.  Boy finds girl oddly intriguing.  Romance ensues.  It\u2019s a unique and cute story that blossoms into a tear filled happy ending.  What can I say, I like the mushy stuff too.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps my favorite aspect of Nodame Cantibile was the music.  As a longtime drummer myself, I could definitely relate to the amount of stress and competition the various characters encounter to get through music school.  They\u2019re constantly practicing and trying to get the competitive edge on their adversaries, waiting for that one lucky break to launch them into the music elite category.  All the musical appreciation by no means indicates that you have to be an aficionado to enjoy the show, as I had a few friends start the show with me, all of us remarking on how pleasant it was.  \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I really enjoyed the comedy in this series.   It rarely, if ever, felt forced.   And on top of that, I always enjoyed the blunt reactions Chiaki had toward Nodame\u2019s advances on him.  There were also some really cheeky moments between characters in the orchestra as well as a witty harem aspect to Chiaki himself.  He was always making snide comments about the various girls he was repelling on a daily basis.  It was nice to see a harem that was caught up in the mix himself.  The writers also did a great job with the dialogue, being well placed and purposeful at almost every instance.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed both main characters in this anime.  Chiaki is a perfectionist, never use to failing, but at the same time having to deal with the struggles of wanting to be a conductor but being stuck in a piano major.  Chiaki works through the series trying to find himself, striving to be the conductor of his very own orchestra, while battling deep dwelling inner demons and coping with high school life.  Nodame is a perplexing girl who is generally messy and sometimes acts childish, but has an almost sixth sense when it comes to playing the piano.  I did like how whimsical and free she acted during the show, and how she would often enter trances when she was focused on something so intensely.  She even had the pleasure of Chiaki being her neighbor, so of course she made him cook her meals and often referred to herself as \u201cthe wife\u201d.  Nodame\u2019s internal struggles were also unique and helped adequately explain why she was the way she was\u2026 it was quite an interesting past to uncover.  I wish there were more female leads like her, with a nonconforming personality and goofy one liners; she really was a pillar in making this story as strong as it was.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast was filled in nicely as well.  Mise was a wacky rock star who was tamed and disciplined by the unprecedented talent of Chiaki.  Stresseman posed as an odd but effective mentor for Chiaki, even though he had some problems controlling himself with the ladies\u2026 The rest of the S and Rising Star Orchestra members played their roles well and added to the overall completeness of the cast.  The character development was pretty decent overall for a relatively short 23 episode anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is typical for a mid 2000\u2019s anime, but I think I would\u2019ve enjoyed some more vibrant colors in the scenery and backdrops due to the jovial nature of the show.  Also, while the piano hand shots were accurate and smooth, when the orchestra would play the scene would often show stills of the musicians vice their actual hand movements on each instrument.  Nonetheless, this was only a minor complaint.  The characters were well designed, and I really think that Nodame\u2019s bright gleaming eyes fit with her expressive personality.  Chiaki\u2019s messed up hair and slender face added to his harem believability.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected, the sound in Nodame Cantibile is top notch.  I\u2019m not entirely sure what directions or influences the creator had for this show, but they were musically accurate and spectacular.  Each rendition of Schubert, Mozart and Beethoven was magical in its own sense, and made the anime very pleasant to just close your eyes and listen to.  I also really thought the intro added a burst of energy and excitement to the show, enticing the viewer with what was to come.  I personally watched the series in Japanese and thought the voice acting (particularly Nodame\u2019s) was superb.\\n\\n\r\nNodame Cantibile is a show that I would recommend to just about anyone.  I was looking for a nice change of pace after watching some more serious shows and I got just what I was asking for.  Lots of great comedy, a cheerful and believable romance and a soundtrack for pure enjoyment make this anime one I will not soon forget.",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile is an anime I truly love, but my honest opinion is it does not deserve a 10/10 despite how enjoyable it was.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nMain story is about the egotistical Chiaki who is a master at both the Violin and Piono, but he is going to music school with the dream of one day becoming a famous conductor. His only problem is he feels the only way to achieve that dream is to study in Europe, but unfortunately he is phobic of both air travel and sea travel keeping him land locked in Japan. One day he depressingly gets wasted and passes out outside ofhis neighbor Nodame's apparent... he wakes up in a filthy unorganized house, but being charmed by the beautiful music she is playing~ The emotion she puts in her music changes him forever. Despite Chiaki's cruel character and Nodame's Eccentricities they become good friends and work to improve their music together.  \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story goes it was primarily centered on the character's development and practicing their music. Most of the series there was no real &quot;Goal&quot; accept they wanted to get better and the Protagonist Chiaki one day wanted to study abroad. The lack of much plot development gives this story only a 7/10, but there was alot of comedy and the music is a very nice touch. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was a little off. It reminded me of that &quot;water color&quot; look from other anime like honey and clover, but it kind of detracted from the overall look of the anime since during the music scenes all you can really do is look and listen. It wasn't devastatingly bad, but it was distracting at parts. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is what made this anime truly amazing. Every episode they play classical music that really makes you appreciate it in a way you may not have before. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters were developed very nicely and had many original character attributes; especially Nodame. The side characters lacked enough development, but it didn't matter that much in the end since the two main characters were sufficient. The only real problem with the characters is the confusing unjustified development at the very end... There just wasn't enough in the story to support the character emotions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere were some flaws, but it was truly enjoyable to watch, lots of Lulz and great music. Great characters as well. While it hasn't revolutionized the Shoujo genre it was very nice to watch and not too fluffy.",

            "content": "Is it really possible for music and slice of life to mix with romcom and still produce something worth watching? The answer to that question is simply Nodame Cantabile. \r\nAlthough some may ask, \"Kirby, what the heck are you doing watching romcoms?   You're losing your manhood in the josei genre!\" I have to politely disagree. Being a huge music lover, this series drew me in with promises of classical genius and musicality, and it delivers. Oh, it does! Now here are my categorical reviews\r\nStory: 9- Definitely a refreshing story fit for any gender. Story follows a genius music student with an arrogant outlooktowards others due to his superiority and musical control. He meets a ditzy piano student in the school and the unthinkable happens! A bit slow in pacing but you get to love the music from each character's viewpoint. Additionally, humor is one of the bright spots in this romcom as well with not too over the top humor but rather comical moments that let you chuckle and laugh out loud at other times. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7- Art is nice at times but the grave 3-D hands and animations are turn offs. You'll know what I'm referring to when you look at their hand animations. Fortunately, the animators actually took the painstaking effort to animate the piano, violin, and other instruments playing which saved the score. Something rarely seen in other animes. Otherwise, the animations of the characters and buildings etc. were decent but not mind-numbing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10- If you appreciate the music of an anime as much as I do, then you will not be let down. Incredible song selections with diverse instrumentation are some of this animes shining spots. Each song is also done with minute detail to incorporate the animation and conducting along with tempo and beat. Truly masterfully done!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9- Although put off at first at some character's distant appeal and cold stance, closer into the series, you understand their motives and reasons for acting the way they do. You simply fall in love with some of the characters throughout this series not because of their immediate appeal, but because of their dedication to an art and craft that envelops you with passion.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10- Definitely enjoyed Nodame Cantabile. Any music appreciator, romcom lover, or even someone looking for a wholesome talented cast is welcome to try out this anime. In the words of Nodame, \"GYABOOO\" and onto the next season we go!",

            "content": "Even though the lead character is a male, the presentation and themes of this show to me managed to pull off the elements of an old school shoujo. I&rsquo;d say something on the lines of Ace wo Nerae, Rose of Versaille and Garasu no Kamen. Granted this anime is not in the league of those 3, but I felt the charms of those classics as I got more into this. The concept of a classical music anime may either interest you or not. But I feel regardless of the presented medium, I feel this is something you have to give a chance. Though it lacksaction, fan service, and sex or anything like that, which is a great thing sometimes, it has comedy and class. Which is something you rarely see combined together nowadays in any country&rsquo;s entertainment. All the characters are likeable in their own rights and I feel you can relate to them as the series progresses. In the end, it&rsquo;s a story about truly finding what you want to do and how far you can take it.\\n\\n\r\nGranted Chiaki&rsquo;s characteristics are more typical of Shounen Jump titles, he&rsquo;s still portrayed in a realistic manner and if anyone is his worst critic, it&rsquo;s himself. In a lot of ways, we are a lot like Chiaki, but in some ways, we have also felt we have known someone like Nodame. Some other characters may come across as stereotypical like Stresseman as this old skirt chasing perverted master who is mostly in martial arts anime, the genre of music freshens this kind of character and is well balanced when you can actually take him seriously.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the style is simple but yet tolerable. It&rsquo;s nothing really too generic, but nothing really ground breaking, but still something you can distinct after viewing. I&rsquo;ve read very little of the manga and all I can say is it is pretty faithful to it. There&rsquo;s nothing over the top like hair of fashion or anything like that, so you&rsquo;re getting a more realistic approach. The eyes aren&rsquo;t too big and the faces aren&rsquo;t too pointy. The characters really don&rsquo;t look too foreign. Whenever an orchestra scene is set in, close ups of the instruments are in an interesting rendering of CG with realistic detail. The orchestra is in sync but I feel there are too many instances where they rely on still shots paintings when playing songs, which can be good and bad. Good reasons are so that you can concentrate on the music, bad reasons is because of the intention of Chiaki wanting to be a conductor and you really don&rsquo;t see his style of conducting in a physical approach. It&rsquo;s also nice to see an orchestra play which I will address in my review of the live action adaptation more in depth. \\n\\n\r\nNow time to talk about the heart and soul of this anime, the music. The in-show soundtrack naturally of course consists of the use of classical music by Beethoven and Mozart. I like how the anime gives you an in depth look at the back-story of how the music came about and how it should be expressed. When you finally get to listen to the song after learning the proper information, you can finally appreciate the music in that sense if you had no prior knowledge of that song or songwriter. I do have criticisms of the execution of the music, but I&rsquo;m saving that for my review of the live action. The opening and ending themes are catchy and capture the spirit and other qualities of this anime 100%. I like the first ending theme Konna ni Chikaku de by Crystal Kay. I&rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of her.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also superb. I felt that Chiaki&rsquo;s character was truly tailor made for his seiyuu, Seki Tomokazu, a man that I have noted in virtually a lot of my reviews and a name you should know if you watch them. The way I described him should tell you that he is fit to play this role. Of course Stresseman is portrayed as one of those characters who have a broken Japanese accent like Apachi from Kenichi, but it lacked a certain kind of charisma and enthusiasm. Nodame is played by Kawasumi Ayako, the voice of Natsuki from Initial D truly captured the characteristics of her as well. And the majority of the cast members were guys I couldn&rsquo;t recognize, but I felt they did enough, but I just don&rsquo;t felt they had the same presence as the cast in the live action. \\n\\n\r\nAs I have noted throughout this review, there is a live action version to Nodame Cantabile. As a matter of fact, this anime came out a season after the live action did and I watched them simultaneously just to keep my mind fresh and see how they executed them. Personally, I liked the live action a whole lot better.",

            "content": "This series has been a real chore, and I really didn't anticipate it to be so. \r\nI am a college music major with a focus in music composition. I perform music of this sort and ultimately compose it as well. I'm immersed with the culture of a music school and can relate to many of the aspects of musicianship represented in this anime. However, this series has been agitating me for reasons primarily unrelated to the theme itself. The leading characters are painfully annoying, the snobbery and elitism within their respective institution gives musicianship a bad name, and the story is about as slow asJanuary molasses. Let's look at this story in depth shall we? \\n\\n\r\nChiaki is a pretentious piano student at Japans most prestigious music school. Though he has studied piano for quite some time, his real dream is to be an orchestral conductor. Whilst aiming for this objective, he ultimately makes some unexpected new friends, namely Nodame, a fellow piano major. Nodame and Chiaki serve to be quite different from each other in not only their social demeanor, but also their musical interpretations. Chiaki is a man of the book and abides by the rules of a pieces respective composer. For Chiaki, music isn't so much meant to be felt individually, but instead should be calculated, rigid and in perfect correlation with the music on the page. Nodame feels the music and plays from her heart. Often times, she has her eyes closed while playing piano to further express herself. Such actions to her do not serve to be a disservice to the composers of old. For her, the composers wrote their music not to merely be performed, but to be felt, personalized and expressed. This story summation, upon looking at it sounds like it could make for a fantastic anime. Two social and artistic opposites find themselves involved in each others lives. It's a common story model that can make for very good, or sometimes very bad stories. Let me explain why I feel like it tends to at times fall into the latter. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime isn't horrible. However, I'd argue that it's characters for the most part are awful. This story, with all of its potential often times falls flat because of the nature of the characters. Chiaki embodies everything that I hate about musical elitism. He's calloused, arrogant, narcissistic and suppresses individual creativity. He as a character is supposed to be this way, yet it doesn't make him any less painful to watch with every episode. I have a feeling he may come around and realize he's an asshole to everyone around him, yet his demeanor peeves me to no end and probably will for as long as I watch this series. Nodame is no better. She might actually be worse. Annoying, clingy, brainless... yet extremely talented. I will give it to Nodame, that she is the more interesting of the two main characters, yet she drives me crazy. Musically speaking, I can relate to her. We both feel the music and play from our hearts, not always the music on the page. What frustrates me about Nodame though is that I have yet to see a deep side of her. She's always chasing Chiaki, eating his food, and making a scene. I don't have any problem with Nodame really doing these things. But I want to know WHY she is the way she is. I want to know her story. I want her to understand that one shouldn't force themselves upon respective love interests, and I want to see her call out Chiaki when he's being a douche bag!! It is probably this last sentiment that irks me most of all. Nodame sees no wrong with Chiaki, he's always the perfect sage, the good guy as opposed to someone who needs to be balanced out and humbled. Nodame's lack of intervention in this area serves to only further give the connotation that she has no depth and acts much like a school girl who falls in love with a guy because he's hot or good at a respective hobby. \\n\\n\r\nThe minor characters vary in their interest. Stresseman is a conductor at the school, and he's super creepy. I like a lot of his sentiments musically speaking, and I wish the show would put less stock into his fetishes and held grudges. Mine is a violinist and my favorite character in the series. He's exactly like me in that he loathes the elitism of classical musics hierarchy and recreation-ally enjoys listening to rock, metal and other adrenaline pumping genres. I forget the name of the timpani player girl... but she has a mustache, and an afro... and I really would like to know her story. I don't necessarily frown upon these external qualities she exhibits, but I'd love to know WHY they are a part of her as a character. \\n\\n\r\nLong story short, I've really been struggling to get into this anime. The characters are angering and the story itself seemingly takes a backseat to the unfunny relational dichotomy of Nodame and Chiaki. I can understand the audience that likes this series, but I'm just not sold on it at all. I'm going to give it some more time in the hopes that I can share in the sentiments of this seemingly vast fan base. However, this series hasn't lived up to the hype at all thus far. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Gyabo!\r\nI'm not sure why, but for some reason I've found myself reviewing certain franchises in reverse order. Then again, given the nature of Nodame Cantabile and its heroine Noda Megumi, maybe doing things in a not so normal manner is the way to go.\r\nFor those of you who don't know the series, Nodame Cantabile is based on the bestselling manga of the same name by Ninomiya Tomoko, and while I do like that particular work, the anime is a little bit special in that it's one of the rare occasions where the adaptation is as good as, or in this case better than, the original.\r\nWe'lltalk about that in a moment though.\\n\\n\r\nNow, many people have been raving about the current Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood series because of how faithful it is to the manga, but what many people seem to have forgotten is that there were already a few shows around that were almost completely true to their manga counterparts (and that didn't include much in the way of filler episodes) - Genshiken, Air Gear, History's Strongest Disciple and Nodame Cantabile to name but a few. In addition to this, many of the long running shounen franchises like Bleach, Naruto, One Piece, etc, generally  stay true to the manga for much of the main story, but have a tendency to provide \"anime original\" tales and filler episodes too.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of what one may think of a given show though, the surprising thing is that many faithful reproductions of the original manga are pretty decent, especially if the source material is good. When the tale is something like Nodame Cantabile though, then something special happens, something that doesn't happen very often in anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs with the manga, the story follows the \"adventures\" of the eccentric musical genius Noda Megumi, and her love interest, the handsome Chiaki Shinichi. The two meet by complete accident and Nodame quickly falls in love.\\n\\n\r\nWhat follows is, well, a roller coaster of laughs, many of which you won't see coming.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike many other romantic comedy anime, the action in Nodame Cantabile doesn't take place in a high school but instead centres around Momogaoka College of Music, and the difference in not only the mentality and personality of the characters, but the overall approach to the story and plot, is actually quite telling. When one watches the series, it becomes obvious that the characters are no longer children, and while they may not yet be out of full time education, their attitudes to life, the world, and to other people, are actually very different from what one encounters in the hordes of high school romantic comedies around.\\n\\n\r\nNow one of the main issues when it comes to adapting a manga is that of pacing, in particular how the plot flows from one episode to the next, and from one story arc to the next. With manga, as with anything written, the pacing is dictated by the reader, whereas with anime the pacing is already there, and it's up to the director to find the balance so that viewers and fans of the original work will warm to the adaptation. Thankfully, Kasai Kenichi (Honey & Clover, KimiKiss Pure Rouge, Major), managed to get the formula very close to what many viewers find acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, some of you may be confused by all this talk about pacing issues, but there's actually a good reason for bringing it up. Many shows can get by when the pacing is a little bit off from what you would prefer (Bleach, for example, with it's annoying recaps at the beginning of each episode), however Nodame Cantabile is a special case as problems with pacing and timing would have had disastrous effects on one's enjoyment of the show, and the reason for this is because the series lives, and dies, by its music.\\n\\n\r\nEarlier I mentioned that this anime is one of the rare occasions where the adaptation is better than the mange, and the reason for this is because of the music. Where the manga made do with track names and examples of written scores, actually hearing the music played in the anime brings the whole series to a new level. While there are a number of thematic tracks on offer, the heart and soul of Nodame Cantabile are the various pieces of classical music that are played throughout the series, whether it be solo or with an orchestra. In addition to this, unlike other classical music based anime like La Corda D'Oro ~Primo Passo~ and Piano no Mori, as well as the more pop/rock style shows like K-On, Beck, etc, one of the things that sets this series, indeed the whole franchise, apart is the aspect of musical appreciation.\\n\\n\r\nConfused? Well it's fairly easy to explain. One of the aspects of Nodame Cantabile that can heavily influence whether one enjoys the series or not is whether you, the viewer, actually listen to, and appreciate, the music itself. People may find that in order to better understand the character's passion for music, they will in turn listen to the track in a way that they may not have done with other shows, and while this may not seem obvious to most at first, a good question to ask come the end of the series is whether your opinion of classical music has improved over the course of the series. Nodame's antics may help things along with a good dose of comic relief, but the music is the glue that holds everything together.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the heavy musical emphasis, one would be forgiven for thinking that something was sacrificed in order for the whole thing to work. It's surprising then that Nodame Cantabile is actually pretty close to the manga in terms of plot and story, and although some alterations to the tale do occur, these are barely noticeable as they don't really contribute to any major changes in the plot or characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow, while the music is a hugely important factor when deciding if one will enjoy Nodame Cantabile, one other aspect will determine whether you love the series or not - the characters.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike many other romantic comedies the show has opted for a slightly more whimsical approach to love, life and relationships, and the characters are generally the epitome of this ethos. Noda Megumi (the titular Nodame), is not simply an eccentric musical genius, she is also thoroughly otaku, has a tendency to stalk her love interest, and hates cleaning. Chiaki, on the other hand, is a talented but arrogant musician who is widely regarded as the \"prince\" of the college. \\n\\n\r\nWhat sets this series apart from other romantic comedies is the manner in which the characters are used. While the two leads may be the focus of the show, there is considerable development on the part of several other supporting characters as they strive to become better musicians, and in keeping with the sentiments of the franchise, this never really occurs in the way one expects.\\n\\n\r\nActually, at heart Nodame Cantabile is simply a different take on the \"Beauty and the Beast\" format, with classical music and a bit of role reversal thrown in for good measure. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, there's nothing beastly about the looks, although there is a slight \"cartoon\" element to the facial features of the characters, something which is used to good effect during the funny moments. The overall design of the characters however, errs on the side of realism in respect of their movements, and while there's an over-the-top element to the actual animation of their movements during certain scenes, the majority of the time the characters move how one would expect a normal person to move.\\n\\n\r\nThe backdrops and settings are pretty well realised for the most part, although there is a watercolour feel to some of the scenery, and the colour palette seems more understated than in most other anime. The combination is strangely elegant in its own way, and makes the visual comedy and parodies of typical shoujo manga scenes funnier for some reason (but that may just be me). \\n\\n\r\nThe one issue I do have with the animation is this - why on earth choose such bad CG for the orchestrral scenes. Granted the animation is technically astute when it comes to finger movements and hand positions, but the overall execution is poor, and does not mesh well with the general feel of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons why I was attracted to this series is because I like classical music, however even I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Nodame Cantabile. The series plays fast and loose with the typical perception that such music is staid and proper, and the comedy is often surprising in both its accuracy and  its execution. Much of the humour is easily accessible to those with no knowledge of music, especially Nodame's notorious \"Fart Song\" and \"Moja Moja Suite\". This strange but well executed combination of classical music and comedy is a far cry from other shows, and the approach is far more tongue in cheek than one might initially expect. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to this, the depiction of student life is easily on a par with the like of Moyashimon and Genshiken, with everything that entails too. It's nice to see students doing things that students would actually do (like going out as a group and getting hammered).\\n\\n\r\nGiven the current glut of high school romantic comedies, Nodame Cantabile is a breath of fresh air because of its more mature yet whimsical take on love and life.",

            "content": "\"Let's go have some fun by playing some music.\"\r\nNodame Cantabile follows the lives of Chiaki, Nodame and an assortment of other musically talented characters attending Japan's top music university. Throughout their studies they encounter any number of trials and tribulations as their undying passion for the art grows evermore, and through each other they learn to appreciate music and performance in a whole different light, while also discovering true romance and what it is they want out of life.\r\nThe story is handled in such a mature, hard-hitting, ever so relatable way. A romantic, musically-focused plot about ardour in and outside of a relationship, Nodame Cantabileis not just for instrumentalists, romantics and music fans, but for doubters, dramatics and anyone who has ever had a passion. It's a relatable series with realistic characters, thoughtful dialogue and worldly themes of uncertainty, struggle and infatuation; as enjoyable and funny as it is heartbreaking and frank. It's well structured, wonderfully written and superbly developed. The plot has a real sense of purpose, there's genuine progress in the characters and just as many light-hearted, warm, fuzzy, humorous and loveable moments to be had as there is dramatic twists, heart-wrenching drama and eye-popping musical set pieces.\\n\\n\r\nAs with the plot, this exceptional quality and superb writing - which I should attribute a great deal to Tomoko Ninomiya as the author of the source material, along with the anime staff - is ever-present in the characters. The main characters - Chiaki and Nodame - are an always-interesting duo, and certain members of the supporting cast are extremely well matured; there's large amounts of progression not only in terms of their personality, but also in their actions and motivations. The characters feel very 'real' - even Nodame's sometimes outlandish behaviour never wears thin - they're down-to-earth, relatable, likeable and memorable creations, flawlessly complementing the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs a series focused on classical music, the sound department utulise many of the famous maestros, from Rachmaninoff to Bach. When the characters aren't performing or practicing, Matsutani Suguru provides the score, which blends seamlessly with the vintage classical tone of the famous compositions, while also adding a variety of more up-tempo, lighthearted tracks for comedic scenes. It's of particular note that, as the series progresses and introduces orchestras and large scale performances, the staff don't shy away from committing lengthy compositions to the screen. An episode of Nodame Cantabile has a run-time of twenty-two minutes, but during episodes which feature an orchestral performance, often nearly half or a third of that time the backing track will consist solely of a single arrangement. The staffs dedication and reluctance to cut corners with the music is admirable. Allowing the compositions to play for so long offers audiences a beauty and experience a sample would fail to execute. The music is Nodame Cantabile is handled with care and executed to perfection.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the series' only let-downs is in the animation. Despite committing to such lengthy compositions that beautifully eat away at a large portion of an episodes run-time, the animation becomes very stagnant and disappointing during the performance sequences. An orchestra is usually extremely lively, the conductor is filled with energy and there are constant bursts of movement, but this is often not depicted in Nodame Cantabile. Instead, audiences are presented with many panning shots of still frames, with only a small number of animated sequences in-between; this sadly sucks much of the life and excitement out of the performances. The rest of the animation is generally very fluid, however, and the sequences that do depict the motions of an instrument are beautifully done. The art style evokes well Niniomiya's manga; it has a very soft tone, pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile is a sensational, all-around compelling watch, not only for its masterful depictions of love, life and the beauty of music, but also for its comedic aspects. It's at times a lighthearted series, full of laughs and humour with precise comedic timing and intelligent punchlines. The hilarity never overstays its welcome, however, as the drama often takes the reins with full force, creating an abundance of memorable, affecting and emotive television. Nodame Cantabile is an ultimately moving series, with a completely fascinating story and spellbinding characters, depicting romance - in more ways than one - as beautiful as the classics themselves. It's an extremely admirable creation; certainly one of the genres best and an absolutely outstanding anime production.",

            "content": "I've seen my fair share of music anime, but this is the first time the musical genre has been my first love: classical music.\r\nSTORY - \"Work hard and you'll achieve your dream!\" It's a very cliche and often-used storyline, right? Well, yes. Yes, it is, but that hardly means that the subsequent series has to be old and tiresome. I've said before that the best stories take something that's been done a thousand times already and somehow manage to tell it in a way that's better and more interesting. In a genre dominated by high school drama, Nodame Cantabile steps it up and uses collegestudents, something I'd love to see happen more often. The storytelling happens in a mostly slice-of-life format, but it doesn't shy away from progressing significantly in time -- weeks pass, months pass, whole seasons and school years pass, and it's great to be able to follow the characters for these longer periods of time, especially since it emphasizes the fact that change and progress take both hard work and time.\\n\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile is very focused for a slice-of-life series in that almost all of the characters are very serious and motivated by their goals; there are notably few subplots that veer away from the main points. I think this can make it a bit more attractive to people that are generally bored by a wandering plotline, but it's pretty easy to get engaged in this series regardless. Reading summaries for Nodame Cantabile can only bring skepticism and doubt considering the frequency of the main plot, but watching it? I was charmed by episode one.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - Without a doubt, most of Nodame Cantabile's appeal is in its characters. Though it feels a little odd to use the adjective on him, Shinichi Chiaki is definitely gar: all the girls want him, and all the guys want to be him (actually, wait, some of the guys want him too). This most likely includes the members of the audience! He's a genius at what he does and furiously motivated; everywhere he goes, people throw themselves at his feet and do everything in their power to push him forward. You're compelled to cheer for him every step of the way. It's funny sometimes how that much charisma can make it through the screen, but it's there, and it's because despite Chiaki's exceeding excellence at everything, he remains a very accessible character. His weaknesses are just as glaring and significant as his strengths, and they're what balance him out. It's easy to imagine yourself in Chiaki's shoes.\\n\\n\r\nNodame, strangely enough, is very much the same. She's crazy, quirky, wild, and questionable, but once again, she's very human. Her antics are never so over-the-top that they're utterly unbelievable, and her hopes and dreams are notably muddled alongside her classmates' -- something a lot of people can also relate to. The differences between Nodame and Chiaki made them perfect foils, and it was really fun watching all the drama and interaction between the two. Despite the frequency of Nodame's claims on Chiaki, I really felt like this was one of the least forced-feeling romances I've ever seen. At no point did their relationship feel cheap, contrived, or overly convenient. Because so much time passes during the series, the relationship felt like it progressed at a much more natural place; it was great (and adorable).\\n\\n\r\nAll of the support characters are nice in their own way, and I don't think there was a single one I disliked. One of the reasons I loved that this series features college-aged students is the fact that they can all drink, smoke, and have sex and it isn't shocking or scandalous! It also added a nice bit of insight into the lives of Japanese college students and their hilarious nightlifes (clubs, arcades, and karaoke!) when they aren't busy studying. \\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - Nodame Cantabile has a pretty damn simple and generic art style, but in that simplicity, it's hard to find anything to pick at. The only thing that stands out for me in the character design is that many characters look like they're perpetually blushing, which is a little confusing at times -- once I got used to it though, it really wasn't that big of a deal.\\n\\n\r\nThe most obvious critique of the animation in this series comes from the numerous still-frames used in the dozens of playing and concert montages. As an anime about music, there's obviously a lot of music-playing involved. Especially in scenes involving entire orchestras, the animation is minimal to none -- nine out of ten times you see a flute, a clarinet, an oboe, a french horn, or a cello, the players' arms and fingers aren't moving. The ratio is slightly improved for violin, and the piano gets the most attention with moving fingers maybe 40% of the time. It's understandable though; after all, animating individual fingers playing instruments with many keys is incredibly difficult, especially for the piano, when they make a huge effort to animate the actual notes that are being played.\\n\\n\r\nAside from piano, where we're sometimes lucky enough to get ten to twenty measures of music at a time, most instruments are only shown being played for seconds at a time, and it's often CG. This makes the rendering of the instrument perfectly accurate and shiny (especially the clarinets and oboes), and I loved catching those sniplets of action in between the panning shots. There are a lot of still shots, but I do think what they do show us is worth it. There is one concert near the beginning of the series that's about half an episode's worth of still montages, but that's the worst of it -- as the series progresses, there's gradually more and more actual playing. :3\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - Ah, classical music! And of such a nice variety too! I was happy to see that the selection of music in Nodame Cantabile represented more than just the select few scores and piano pieces known by the general public. Most of the composers are still familiar, but there are also lesser-known names such as Debussy, Ravel and Sarasate. Unfortunately, as much as I do love classical music, I don't have a trained enough ear to be able to tell whether or not the music played in the series was tailored specifically for it -- for example, when characters supposedly play a piece poorly, I really can't tell. When characters supposedly improvise and don't play exactly what the piece dictates, I can't tell. \\n\\n\r\nI would think that a vast majority of the pieces would be professionally recorded pieces borrowed for the series though, and that they're all free of glaring errors. (I just can't imagine that they'd budget the money required to hire an entire orchestra to mess up.) Still, at least some of the piano solos (the Moja Moja Suite? The improvised piano version of some made-up show?) had to have been recorded for the show. Overall, all of the music is very pleasing to listen to and well-performed. Maybe you don't be moved to tears like the characters are, but if you're even a mild fan of classical music, you'll be fine. :)\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - Seki Tomokazu and Ayako Kawasumi both do a great job with their leads. As both characters go through a full range of emotions, their voices had to match up appropriately, and they did! Especially for a character like Nodame, who habitually puts up one front while fostering other thoughts and feelings inside, it was really important that she have a good voice. The rest of the characters all had pretty nice voices as well, though no others really stood out to me as being particularly notable.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - As a longtime fan of classical music, an amateur pianist, and a former clarinetist, Nodame Cantabile was both inspiring and nostalgic. It made me want to play more piano, and it made me really miss playing the school band or orchestra. It was educational, giving insight into the world and careers of classical musicians, and it was touching, allowing for a window in the lives of some very believable characters. It was hilarious and very silly at times, but I don't think it ever crossed the line into over-the-top territory. Even for those who aren't huge, huge fans of classical music, I think this series has enough merit to warrant a taste, and for those who are fans, you definitely don't want to miss this series. I already can't wait to move onto the sequel. :3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Personally, I think Nodame Cantabile is in a league by itself when it comes to chemistry between characters.\r\nYou can compare it to tons of anime that has that general theme of \"practice hard and keep trying and reach for your goals\"... but that wouldn't give you the whole picture.  Each person of the central core of characters is so unique and distinct and finely tuned that it brings the idea of knowing a character to a whole new level.  By the end of the series, you know their goals, their motivations, their attitude, their style, their history... and at the center of allthese rich, amazing characters are Nodame and Chiaki: the child-like, natural savant without an iota of discipline and the despairing, rigid genius of music royalty who has lost the forest for the trees.  Once you buy into the premise that they're both incredibly talented, you find out that they've both been pushed to opposing extremes -- somewhat by choice, somewhat by circumstance -- and over the course of 23 episodes, you can see how they slowly influence each other's lives and music in a way that's realistic and beautiful and charming and heartwarming... how they bring out the best in each other.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also really refreshing to have main characters in a romance who aren't your typical strong-assertive-type meets meek-pushover-type.  Nodame and Chiaki each have their individual strengths and weaknesses.  He's incredibly arrogant and impatient and rigid and controlling.  And she's so hapless and quirky and irresponsible and oblivious and... dirty.  They both are very attached to their own way of doing things and they both kind of just... bulldoze over each other.  When you put them in a room together, sparks just fly.  ...And it's really, really fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI'm kind of a sucker for guys like Chiaki anyway, but I don't think I'd be the only one to find his relationships with everyone funny and endearing... for some reason, the way he takes care of Nodame is just really funny.  \\n\\n\r\nThe other thing I really liked about the show was the music.  Just amazing music; amazing understanding of music and amazing use of music.  I really enjoyed getting to see the development of certain pieces of music from the first run-through to the final performance.  I'm not a musician myself and I know next to nothing about classical music or orchestras, so I thought it was a fascinating look at the work and the dedication and everything that goes into the performances.  And to my layman's eyes, the imagery that they use to illustrate the feel and the flavor of the individual pieces was incredibly lovely and insightful (see: the ripples at the beginning of the Rachmaninoff piece and the pink flower petals during the oboe concerto).  It made me feel like I had been missing out on something amazing all my life -- that's how good of a job they do in expressing the passion and devotion to music in these characters.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, visually, I got a little tired of the pans across the stunned audience member shots... but most of those scenes was about listening to the piece more than anything anyway.  They also tend to do a lot of panning over stills in general, but the pros far, far, far outweigh any cons, so it's pretty easy to not care about that sort of thing.\\n\\n\r\nI could probably nitpick a little about the plot and such if those things bothered me at all while watching the show... but they really didn't, mainly because... well, did the show even have a plot?  The &quot;action&quot; of the story is so... inconsequential, that complaining about how something happens is like... missing the whole point of the show.  So it's probably enough to say that if you're looking for something that's about what happened or what to do next, Nodame Cantabile might not interest you so much.  Frankly, almost nothing actually &quot;happens&quot; except for the mundane or the completely to-be-expected.  If you're looking for a show that really seems to enjoy getting to know this group of people and the passion they have in common... this is something you absolutely cannot miss.\\n\\n\r\nI really can't say enough good things about this show; just watch it!! =) =) =)\\n",

            "content": "What can I say about Nodame Cantobile? It was one of those anime that you can\\'t help but enjoy. It managed to tell a fun story in which each of the characters try to accomplish what they want out of life with a careful mix of humor and drama.\r\nOne of the main draws, I felt, is the believability of the characters. You will not find a perfect guy surrounded by other perfect people with wild personalities. You will, instead, find people who you could probably relate to. Each has his or her own strengths and weaknesses. The character drawings are also top notch. Again, theyjust have a sense of realism to them that often goes unnoticed. Even the animations and setting gel well together (though I think they overused the &quot;vertical blue lines&quot; expression).\\n\\n\r\nThe story was a nice break from other anime I have seen. All of the characters are trying to make their way in the world of music. They all struggle for success, which is a good lesson to viewers. Even the romance between the two main characters, Chiaki and Noda, integrates itself well. Nothing is overdone to the point of boredom, and each character has his or her role to play. The ending makes you wish for more, but it does it well enough so that you would not complain. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in it is great. The character interactions will make you chuckle more than a few times, especially between Noda and Chiaki. Their relationship is almost a mockery.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are great, as is to be expected in an anime about classical music. The full orchestra pieces sound fantastic, and it is not uncommon for me to have Nodame Cantobile running in the background of my computer just for the music, especially in the last few episodes. The character voices are also well picked and never get annoying.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I thought this anime came pretty darn close to perfect. I rather wish they would have used more than just the &quot;blue lines&quot; as the embodiment of sickness and had more movement during the musical pieces, but these are minor trifles. This anime was great and I recommend it to almost everyone (except maybe those who revel in blood and violence. You will see none of that in Nodame Cantobile.)",

            "content": "Introduction\r\nNodame Cantabile is love at first sight.  From the very first episode, you notice it is something special.  Not only does it entertain, but it also inspires passion, appreciation for beauty, and transports you to your own personal paradise.  If I could, I would give this anime an 11 because I cannot and will not compare it to any other anime. \r\nStory\r\nThe story is deep yet not complicated enough to detract you from the main plot.  An arrogant and talented college student with both ambition and passion chases his dream of being a conductor with the help of other young musicianswho are inspired by his talent and charm.  The pace is just right; the story continues to push forward but gives you enough time to reflect and rejoice in the moment.  It does not try to overpower the anime, but lets the other elements like the music shine right through.  \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile surpasses every other anime I have ever seen in this category.  The whole anime is a work of art.  They know how to bring music to life in the anime and build suspense with the intensity of emotion displayed in the audience and musician's faces.  You become part of the show when you watch this anime and they do a great job of expressing music with artistic imagery and interpretation.  The opening and ending were my favorites.  The opening does a great job of energizing you with its uplifting tempo and catchy melody and makes you feel like you are hearing the beach boys yet the lyrics match the anime perfectly.  The 2nd ending was one of my favorite endings of all time as it seemed like the perfect way to descend from the paradise the anime elevated me to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nAs for the characters, the hero, Chiaki, seems to carry the weight of the world on his back yet he never misses a step and continues to persevere.  He's not perfect, he has character flaws such as his temper and arrogance as well as some major weaknesses like his fear of flying and sailing.  However, his weaknesses make his character more believable and admirable.  He's the passionate hero we all long to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNodame, the female lead, is the fun, quirky character who plays opposite to Chiaki.  Their contrasting styles and personalities make the anime very interesting and entertaining to watch.  Although, I wouldn't say that there is much romantic development between the two as they do not even kiss during the entire series.  However, the viewers don't seem to mind because this anime is a lot more than its story, characters, art, and animation.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nTo really appreciate this anime, you have to be able to perceive the beautiful flow and mixing of the elements.  The characters could not flourish without their passion for music and unique backgrounds.  The animation could not be a masterpiece without the wondrous marriage of art and music.  Together, they all create a beautiful symphony that could not be enjoyed piecemeal.  \\n\\n\r\nTry to let yourself go when you watch this, close your eyes from time to time and feel the music rushing through your veins and you will be sure to feel goosebumps as you imagine the feelings and emotions that the characters were motivated by.  \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nThose who are easily swept off their feet by the sound of classical music, seek characters who entertain and surprise you, and have an open mind and soul will truly benefit from watching this anime.  If you approach this anime in the right mindset, its beauty will penetrate you like an arrow that strikes you at the heart.  And when you wake up, you will come as close to heaven as you can possibly get.  No matter what your tastes, you will probably find something to like about this anime.",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile is strange in some regards. It has a good story, full of excellent music, but the transition into the anime medium is a rocky and half-hearted one.\r\nYou'd think such a boundless medium as anime would be perfect to accompany some of the timeless symphonies of Schubert or Beethoven, but alas, Nodame gets the short end of the stick in their animation budget. Countless still-frame pans and awkward CG hands for the musical pieces detract from the quality of the scene. It's really better to just close your eyes and take it in, rather than look at the screen while Chiaki and Nodame areperforming. Outside performance scenes, the animation is respectable enough, but it's subdued and bland so much that nothing leaves a visual impression.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Nodame Cantabile's strongest aspect is by far the music, and it right well should be. This is a show that revolves around music and it would be an embarrassment to have anything of lesser quality. The music for Nodame highlights the setting of the series with an array of familiar classic pieces. Though the OP, ED and BGM variations of both are original, they accentuate scenes and the series very well. There's little if anything to complain about here.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, a show entirely about music might get tiresome. Why not just put on a Brahms CD instead? Well, Nodame Cantabile is not entirely about music, but the story it tells is far from as perfect as the music. The problem here is that the series, and therefore probably the manga it was based on, does not have a given direction for the first several episodes. It constantly switches tangents in a wildly unstable way up until the halfway mark when it settles on a direction and runs wonderfully with it. If only this first season could have started as well as it ended.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, fortunately, is told through two painstakingly unique characters. Both Nodame and Chiaki have multiple facets to their lives and personalities, so much that there are times that hating them is natural and others where you can't help but love them. In short, they are as human as anime characters come. No one else is quite like them, and I certainly wouldn't be surprised if there were real life bases for the two of them. Supporting characters are a different story. Often they are one-characteristic personalities, though there are exceptions like Strasemann. Unfortunately, most supporting characters disappear as quickly as they appear, or simply fade into the background. Once one shines, they are promptly disposed of. It's a little disheartening given how wonderful the leads are.\\n\\n\r\nThough Nodame has many faults and is far from the perfection it's MAL rating leads one to believe, it is a solid but conventional story as told by two very memorable characters with a timeless soundtrack. Portions of this series are outstanding, while other sections just seem to drag. Your experience, if the other reviews have anything to say about it, may differ. From where I stand though, Nodame is just a good story done well. Nothing more and nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Nodame Cantabile an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "\"Where words leave off, music begins.\"\r\n               - Heinrich Heine\r\nThe anime that's been remade into movies in several different countries countless number of times: Nodame Cantabile. What makes Nodame Cantabile so good? It's beauty. The growth of two rather immature adults is artfully done not only in their relationship, but their personalities as well. The romance in this anime was well handled, and I don't know (besides Kaichou) an anime that I wanted the main characters to get together so badly. Furthermore, the addition of absolutely beautiful classical music was ravishing: includedmasterpieces composed by Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Rachmaninoff, Debussy, and Schubert. The music not only added feelings, and enjoyment to the series but also showed just how music impacts (people) the characters and relationships in the series. I felt as though I were there at a live performance concert of famous magicians; the feeling was magical. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is basically about Chiaki Shinichi, who is one of the most talented musicians in the world. However, his ambition to become a conductor and study under the renowned Sebastiano Viera puts him at odds with his piano teacher, Etou. Chiaki\u2019s fear of flying prevents him from leaving Japan to become Viera\u2019s student. After being dropped from Etou\u2019s class, which leads to Chiaki also being dumped by his girlfriend, Tagaya Saiko, Chiaki meets a bizarre, messy girl, Noda Megumi (who insists on being called \u201cNodame\u201d), a piano student under Chiaki\u2019s new teacher. Chiaki doesn\u2019t like Nodame, but is strangely drawn to her; on the other hand, Nodame almost instantly falls in love with Chiaki. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the anime was wondrous and each minor detail about what happens behind the scenes, what characters feel, how they develop were all skillfully executed. \\n\r\nThe character development was well done as well, I could definitely relate to Nodame, with her crush on Chiaki, and then the development to come. The music in the anime is the best music in anime, why? Because, they incorporated world wide famous classical pieces in, and the anime's music itself was beautiful as well; Hence the anime being about the beauty of Music and how it incorporates in our everyday life. I'd definitely recommend this anime to EVERYONE.",

            "content": "~!~ WARNING: Some spoilers may be present ~!~\r\nAh... such a wonderful pick out of a random selection...\r\nIf you were like me, you were going through lists upon lists of anime to watch and, mostly likely if you are reading this, stumbled on this series. Now, I must admit, I was reluctant to watch this at first. I knew nothing of the manga nor the anime. I passed the chance to watch this quite a few times. However, as soon as I sat down and witnessed the first episode, I was eager to see the next episode growing more excited to see one after another.\r\nNodame Cantabileis an anime that isn't exactly like your ordinary anime. You'd struggle to find any kind of cliche within it unless you nit-picked the characters. It's an anime that you are unsure to watch at first as you aren't use to the style or how it presents itself. Once you do, though, it's almost gloriously perfect.\\n\\n\r\n~ Story 9/10 ~\\n\r\nThe story is excellent. As soon as you begin, you are dropped into a college school of musical arts where students learn the finesse of classical music and piano. Shinichi Chiaki is one of those students who happens to have issues obtaining his true goals from phobias along with his own personality and his main goal: becoming a conductor.\\n\r\nOur other protagonist, Megumi Nodame, is also a piano student at the same school. Her goals are not as high as Chiaki's, but are very humble and almost comical while being heartwarming as she first strives to be a kindergarten teacher. Both these characters meet by their talents for music and become glued at first meeting.\\n\r\nI wont tell much, but the story has so much influence from music. Classical and other forms of music literally litter each episode beautifully. The story would be nothing if not for for this crucial part. Although it seems weird to talk about music for a story, it's more of something you have to see for yourself to understand why it's important.\\n\r\nThe story buries down to the two striving to accomplish their goals while dealing with personal issues, family, and their own thoughts of what they want. If you enjoy a touching story dealing with a growing romance that's always consisting of humor and sometimes drama, this anime is worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\n~ Art 9/10 ~\\n\r\nThe art style to the anime isn't ordinary but almost feels important for the entirety. Each character you come across seems to be designed to show off their personality. In fact, subtle to blunt symbolism can be found quite often as the story progresses. The art is heavily touched, however, when it comes to the music scenes themselves. The instruments are detailed and displayed well within their style. The animation is normal without anything special, yet never seems to go too askew or clumsy which is important.\\n\\n\r\n~ Sound 10/10 ~\\n\r\nOH BOY!\\n\r\nYou expected this, didn't you? How could an anime about music have poor sound?\\n\r\nYou'd be surprised that there is anime that, yes, does supply poor sound sometimes. However, the soundtrack is marvelous in this. The opening and ending theme is quite enjoyable. The character's voice actors do well to portray personality through tone and dialogue. The music, however...\\n\r\nThere are scenes within Nodame Cantabile where the main characters and many others will play songs from instruments of a wide variety. You will hear piano classics, orchestras, singing, and many other relatives to the classical genre. They will last for minutes on end, yes, but the scenes are astonishing and great to listen to ESPECIALLY if you are a fan of classical music.\\n\\n\r\n~ Character 8/10 ~\\n\r\nEach person will have a main trait so the humor can be made. Even with that, the characters also display deeply in themselves around these edges and become quite detailed during the serious moments.\\n\r\nShinichi is a serious person and even more serious when it comes to music. He is arrogant, blunt, and insensitive while not realizing it (or not caring to be sensitive). Shinichi's pros reside with his growth in the story as he matures in his skill and personality. His greatness all falls down to music and his skill of being a perfectionist at everything. He's marvelous at piano and violin, and picks up conducting so fast with such skill that even professional music critiques are surprised that such a young man has such talent. His greatest skill displays from his accuracy as he can listen to the smallest of details in an orchestra.  Shinichi is naive numerous times but has his moments where he seems so caring and kind. His character is one where you will find yourself cringing at your computer, getting aggravated by his aggressive personality, and smiling while maybe even surprised by his touching nature.\\n\r\nNodame is your typical, goofy character. The first time you will meet her, it already shows from her silly piano playing and face she makes as she plays. Many people in the story wonder why she even bothers playing piano, mock her skill, and even insult her from her personality. She is quite the odd person as her social skills can prove to be bubbly yet awkward. She doesn't understand importance as her goals can be simple while her lifestyle is odd. She rarely cleans and plays the piano as she pleases without caring to be accurate. She can sometimes lack common sense or intelligence in scenes because of this which only makes her more charming. As much as she is a goof, pervert, lazy person, Nodame is a lovely character and seems to be the character that really pulls the anime altogether. She has an amazing skill when it comes to the piano being able to accurately play music that she only has to hear and can even add her own style and notes to it. Throughout the anime, you'll find that she's almost like Mozart for many reasons.\\n\r\nThe background characters are also pleasing when they show up, being unique and nicely placed. Some are average and some are odd. Either way, as you watch, you'll find yourself paying attention to these characters quite easily and even grow to like them. If not, you will surely love the two main characters and their antics throughout the story.\\n\r\nI would have given this section a 9/10 if it wasn't for the characters lacking a bit. All too often I felt as if the characters weren't expressive or shocking enough. They seemed too flat at times and possibly even predictable. This is rare, however, and overwhelmed by the fact of the characters changing over time as if aging.\\n\\n\r\n~ Enjoyment 9/10 ~\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile does not fail when it comes to blending it's finely tuned points. It's comedy is childishly humorous and sometimes intelligently funny. It never seems too misplaced and adds a great rendition to the episodes. The drama isn't extremely heavy at times but very serious at other moments. The comedy, drama, and romance tie together perfectly without intertwining and making a terrible mess of everything.\\n\r\nThat said, the anime is so enjoyable. It's not your typical anime. You wont find random fight scenes with characters beating each other with violins. You wont find odd harems out of nowhere. It's normal and great to watch. Each episode has its own importance. It never really gets boring and even has this feeling of progression. I've had anime where I could easily skip an episode or two and not miss anything. Here, you can't do that and might even feel ashamed just to do so.\\n\r\nIf you had ANY intention of watching this anime at all,\\n\r\ngive the first few episodes a try atleast just to see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile pulls off this kinda thing where you watch it and it stands out from other animes you've seen. Perhaps it's the characters with their personalities, skills, and personal issues. Maybe it's the wonderful soundtrack that leaves every episode having a great tune. Maybe it's the art and animation that's simple yet pleasing. Could be the story that has something great and impressively divine.\\n\r\nWho knows. It's a wonderful romance tale of two people who you learn much about and grow to love while witnessing them become almost gods of the classical music genre. The series is great every single episode without being too much or too little and leaves you satisfied with at the end of this season. Not an anime you'd push aside without notice or kinda enjoy, but an anime you'd ponder in thought over even after being finished with it. You wont be able to settle with one episode if you enjoy it and even becomes addicting with it's light story.\\n\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile is worth the watch for its many aspects. If you thought about it, give it a watch. You wont be disappointed and will even find yourself hunting down the sequel seasons just to progress further into the story and characters.",

            "content": "Nodame.  She just captured my heart entirely and left me glowing inside and out.\r\nNodame Cantabile is a story of musicians, Chiaki Shinichii and Noda Megumi, striving to overcome memories that haunt them.  \r\nThe story is simple since this is a slice of life genre, it deals more of what life of a musician is all about, especially musicians with bad memories.  I scored 9 on the story because even though the plot is simple, the realism in it is admiring.\r\nAt first glance, my impression of the art is \"Honey and Clover?\"  When I checked, both animations have the same animators, J.CStaff.  I thought, &quot;hmmmm...&quot;  The use of light colors was amazing.  They even made it to the point where everything is proportional.  The drawback is, I cannot distinguish the faces of the characters.  Some of the minor characters have the same facial features, making it difficult who is who.  What I love on the animation is how the hands, fit into the notes of the music.  It is not just a bunch of random drawings of people sitting on pianos, playing violins and performing in orchestras, but the hands play exactly what the music portrays.  Their animation cannot fool the eyes of a musician.  Although timing the animation and the music is hard, I believe, but I wish they could do more of those (a personal opinion because I love watching the hands of musicians playing their instruments rather than watching them perform from afar).\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also perfect.  I just wished though that I knew the pieces played so that I could judge that they did add notes unto the piece when the story says so.  But as a classical music lover, it is definitely outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nI love the characters in the anime.  Megumi, the fun loving, childish pianist while Shinichii the strict, perfectionist jack-of-all-music-trades, clash as opposite characters. But despite the irony, they fit together snuggly.  The growth of the characters was clearly shown when both tried to overcome their past to strive for a better future.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed watching this series.  Definitely a top list in my &quot;rewatch series.&quot;  It gives comedy and romance a different perspective at one time.  I wasn't able to help myself at giggling at the silly antics of Megumi and the iron attitude of Shinichii while also falling in love on their relationship and struggles.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like nothing-of-the-absurd types of anime like Honey and Clover, Nodame Cantabile should definitely be on your list and a top at that. \\n\\n\r\nI'm going now, out to get my own DVD copy of this series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPoof!",

            "content": "A quite funny argument you might find occasionally in defense of a work is the saying \u201cyou watched it wrong\u201d, implying that any criticism the person might have to the series in question comes from having watched it with the wrong mindset. While I find particularly silly that one would primarily assume such case about someone else\u2019s opinion when facing criticism to a beloved work, since it\u2019s a very pretentious attitude, it doesn\u2019t seem unlikely that a circumstance like that can happen. That was the issue I faced when I began watching Nodame Cantabile, an anime I started with the expectation of being a straightand pure romance, a genre that I\u2019m especially attracted to, as some of my favorites might have hinted. While romance is an important aspect of the anime, I soon came to realize it wasn\u2019t the focus of the story. Nodame Cantabile is instead a story about the passion for music and perseverance for the art, with romance being relevant, but secondary.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters\\n\\n\r\nIf you are by any chance sick to death of the high school setting (I\u2019m not) you can relax with this one, because Nodame Cantabile takes place at a music College, where the characters are adult enough to be thinking about meaningful aspects of life, like the pursuit of a career or marriage, and not be obnoxiously shy around the idea of sex, but still enrolled in a setting that requires them to go through a similar routine to that of a high school anime. Except the playing at orchestras part, obviously. There\u2019s frankly not much I can comment about the progression without addressing it as it relates to the characters, so let\u2019s get to them.\\n\\n\r\nChiaki is the main and best character of the series. He\u2019s focused, hardworking and dedicated to his dream of becoming a conductor, which reflects on his skills as a musician, that make him widely respected among his college mates. Only these attributes, however, could make him an unbearable Mary Sue, so he also features quite pertinent flaws that are obvious even to those who admire him. He\u2019s impatient, has a slight superiority complex and, at the beginning, is quite persistent about interpreting music strictly the way it\u2019s written. His character arc is focused first of all in understanding the human aspect of playing a song, taking into consideration when to be bossy and when to let loose and understand the impetus of the musician, as well as the heart of the song. Perhaps the only misstep of his development would be when, halfway through the story, the series brings more of his life outside of music, expanding his relationship with his family, an aspect which, unfortunately, is cut short and not given the depth it deserves, when the rest of his arc is so competently conducted.\\n\\n\r\nNoda Megumi, or Nodame, as she is commonly called, is the main female lead and a complete air-head. She is a talented pianist, but unlike Chiaki, displays a carefree play style and attitude. Being blunt, Nodame is the weaker end of the character line-up of the series. She seems to have barely any agency or meaning to Chiaki\u2019s character in the first arc, with a clearly one sided dynamic in regards to the romance for most of the duration of the anime. After witnessing Chiaki play on a College event is that she realizes the difference in skill between them and the plot hints at a possible development to her character, just to quickly revert her back to normal, an event that seems to be fairly recurrent until the conclusion, when she finally takes measures into improving as a musician. She is actually a character that would benefit from being placed in high school, as in this instance her immaturity and behavior would be coherent with the setting. Nearing the conclusion, more of her past is laid out to the viewer, although lacking the depth and sense of weight that would give it stronger impact.\\n\\n\r\nNext in line is Stresemann, an experienced and reputed conductor with a womanizing habit, very loose work ethics and irresponsible behavior. Right after his introduction, Stresemann gives barely any reason to support why he would be a competent conductor, let alone a renowned one, up until the second quarter, when he takes a stronger role as an agent of the story, by taking Chiaki under his guidance, bringing more attention to his talent, as well as helping him take the stick off his ass and open up as a musician. Through his influence is that Chiaki first notices the importance of not simply being an authoritarian leader and taking into consideration the state of the musicians working under his baton.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing up on the characters that mean something, there\u2019s Mine, a violinist and Chiaki\u2019s friend. He is a very proactive character, responsible for the idea of forming an orchestra under Chiaki\u2019s leadership after several students graduate and is incredibly passionate about keeping that orchestra alive, taking decisions for that matter that highlight the quality of his character. His influence over the plot and Chiaki\u2019s character is not overbearing, but easily noticeable, being for the most part stronger than that of Nodame herself.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining figures have varying degrees of depth to them, but generally light effect in the plot besides being placeholders for meaningful contextual positions within the narrative. This may sound like a criticism, but it isn\u2019t, their job is to help move the story in small pieces according to their purpose within the orchestra and their personalities have meaning defined by what they extract from the main characters or in how they perceive the dynamic among them, and, frankly, being restricted to those positions is just fine, as attempting to delve deeper into their lives could potentially derail the story from its main focus. Speaking of which: the anime keeps itself steadily centered around Chiaki\u2019s growth as a musician as he sediments his name as a talented conductor in the eyes of the more experienced and famous figures of the industry. His path is portrayed in believable manner, as his connections to people who can bring him attention help spread his name, but it\u2019s his talent that wins them over. Near the end, once he has enough ground to make riskier decisions for his future, the anime shifts its gaze to Nodame. It\u2019s at this point that the romance actually develops to a conclusive end, although it lacks more of the nuance that would make the transition to a full romantic relationship warranted.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the visuals, Nodame Cantabile is generally weak. Taking aside the purposefully bland color pallet, character designs tend to be very samey in the overall structure (long faces, small eyes, wide and expressive mouths, etc) and the level of detail applied to them is decent, effective in giving them personality and making them distinguishable, but overall far from impressive. For the portions where they play any instrument, the series makes use of CGI, which is surprisingly well-implemented. It\u2019s used to give the characters fluid movement, syncing really well with the music, and it\u2019s colored in fairly seamless fashion, in order to avoid making such scenes disconnected from the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe highlights of the presentation, as expected, reside on the sequences where the music is center-frame. Originally, the performance bits center more of the physical aspect of playing or in the character\u2019s small growth at that instant, so the relation between the music and the visuals is treated in very bland fashion. After a bunch of people start to fall in love the presentation develops to show a bit more care into enriching the musical performances, inserting more personality between the song and visuals. The flare added by this integration helps to better hide the technical shortcomings of the series in these scenes specifically, although the usage of still frames continues to be a blatant and frequent annoyance.\\n\\n\r\nGiving the main theme of Nodame Cantabile, it\u2019s to be expected that the series would feature some striking classical pieces from composers like Brahms, Mozart and Schubert. The pieces are, off course, celebrated works, so the only possibility that might derail your enjoyment is if you happen to dislike classical music. This does, however, create a disconnect in the case the audience is not versed in music of this variety: many scenes have characters asserting about the quality of the performance or making criticism to the musicians, frequently using terminology related to music so if you don\u2019t have knowledge of the art to that degree, discerning how exactly one performance is better than the other is unlikely to happen. These sequences are clearly meant to be enjoyed by people to are knowledgeable of classical music, as the average viewer will have the minutia fly over their heads. Like me.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Ramblings\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s go back a bit to the subject I talked about in the intro and ask: how to define what is to \u201cwatch something the wrong way\u201d? I believe that is a simple issue of approach. It\u2019s hard to define, previously to watching or reading any given work, what is the appropriate mindset to be in, which can lead to disappointing first impressions. The bigger issue, though, is if the viewer refuses to accept that the work is something different and stays in that mindset throughout the work, leading to an unfair judgement of its qualities and flaws.. In the case of Nodame Cantabile, though, it wasn\u2019t hard to realise early on that I was approaching the series through the wrong angle and then change it, so I believe my judgement for the remainder of the series was in line with what it was trying to convey.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the ending result was a really good show I can\u2019t shake off the feeling that the prototype for something even better was there, but the series misses opportunities to achieve that level and rise to a truly great or excellent work. In many occasions it felt like there were much better characters in need of some spotlight, but those characters were overshadowed by Nodame\u2019s quirks, which could be fairly entertaining in their own right, but that time could be better spent in legitimate character growth, either for Nodame or the sidecast. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I surely believe the show is a good recommendation, but one can benefit from being mindful of what they are going to find. Being eclectic doesn\u2019t hurt anyway!",

            "content": "I have to admit, I was very worried about this. I ended up putting off watching it for two weeks, even. It's all because I know absolutely nothing about music, especially the classics. If it sounds good, I'll listen to it. Doesn't matter to me what the instruments are or how long it took to perfect. \r\nWhen I found Nodame Cantabile, I was intrigued, but hesitant. I figured this was an anime that required knowledge of classical music, the instruments and how an orchestra operates. \r\nI watched the first episode and I was hooked, spending a day and a half watching all of the episodes,delighted to find that all the knowledge I thought I would need wasn't required. What this anime does best is showing and telling all about the music world, but it doesn't leave you out. If you don't know the flute you were made to practice with in second grade from a piccolo, it doesn't actually matter. See, I probably fucked up that analogy right there, because I don't know shit about instruments. My point is, this anime doesn't try to be high-collar, where only the musicians of the world would ever get the smallest intricacy. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters carried this story, especially Noda and Chiaki. Their dynamic is ... interesting to say the least. Chiaki is a perfectionist and Noda, well, she's a slob, and by all means these two should be at each others' throats - the dynamic just shouldn't work - but it does. They are exactly what the other needs in order to grow. They play off each other really well and become more ... human (especially in Chiaki's case). \\n\\n\r\nChiaki learns from Noda that he shouldn't chase after perfection because it's the imperfections that make something great; Noda learns passion, willpower and courage from Chiaki. \\n\\n\r\nWithout Noda, Chiaki would never have been able to conduct the orchestra as well as he does because he'd never connect with the musicians. In fact, if he had continued to be insensitive I have no doubt the orchestra would've walked out on him.\\n\\n\r\nNoda's problems get a bit more of the focus; she's very talented, playing a song perfectly because she \"played it by ear\" meaning all she had to do was listen to it to get it, though she has difficulty playing it without putting her own unique style into it, earning her many a slap from her teachers. But past issues dulled her ambition to go pro, until she meets Chiaki, who continuously inspires her to do better and be better, though she does still have her inhibitions. \\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime, and I'm sad that this portion of the story is over; it was so much fun!",

            "content": "Nodame Cantibile is a lighthearted and comedic anime about one of my favorite hobbies, music.  At first I was hesitant to explore the series due to my lack of appreciation for the classical genre, but what I found in Nodame Cantibile was more than just music.  This was a coming of age story of sorts, with a feel good plot line and characters full of passion, all battling their own internal struggles to be better musicians.  It\u2019s definitely a nice change of pace and a must see for any slice of life fan, or enthusiast of music in general.\r\nI don\u2019t have anymajor complaints about the story in this series, but at the same token, I wasn\u2019t necessarily blown away.  For the entire 23 episodes, viewers follow Nodame and Chiaki, both students at the same Japanese music school as they grow both as individuals and through their musical talents.  The added atypical romance subplot was interesting, as an awkward attraction exists between them (well, mostly just Nodame).  Boy meets neighbor girl.  Girl turns out to be weird as hell.  Girl thinks boy is a handsome prince.  Girl is the metaphoric rain man of piano.  Boy finds girl oddly intriguing.  Romance ensues.  It\u2019s a unique and cute story that blossoms into a tear filled happy ending.  What can I say, I like the mushy stuff too.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps my favorite aspect of Nodame Cantibile was the music.  As a longtime drummer myself, I could definitely relate to the amount of stress and competition the various characters encounter to get through music school.  They\u2019re constantly practicing and trying to get the competitive edge on their adversaries, waiting for that one lucky break to launch them into the music elite category.  All the musical appreciation by no means indicates that you have to be an aficionado to enjoy the show, as I had a few friends start the show with me, all of us remarking on how pleasant it was.  \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I really enjoyed the comedy in this series.   It rarely, if ever, felt forced.   And on top of that, I always enjoyed the blunt reactions Chiaki had toward Nodame\u2019s advances on him.  There were also some really cheeky moments between characters in the orchestra as well as a witty harem aspect to Chiaki himself.  He was always making snide comments about the various girls he was repelling on a daily basis.  It was nice to see a harem that was caught up in the mix himself.  The writers also did a great job with the dialogue, being well placed and purposeful at almost every instance.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed both main characters in this anime.  Chiaki is a perfectionist, never use to failing, but at the same time having to deal with the struggles of wanting to be a conductor but being stuck in a piano major.  Chiaki works through the series trying to find himself, striving to be the conductor of his very own orchestra, while battling deep dwelling inner demons and coping with high school life.  Nodame is a perplexing girl who is generally messy and sometimes acts childish, but has an almost sixth sense when it comes to playing the piano.  I did like how whimsical and free she acted during the show, and how she would often enter trances when she was focused on something so intensely.  She even had the pleasure of Chiaki being her neighbor, so of course she made him cook her meals and often referred to herself as \u201cthe wife\u201d.  Nodame\u2019s internal struggles were also unique and helped adequately explain why she was the way she was\u2026 it was quite an interesting past to uncover.  I wish there were more female leads like her, with a nonconforming personality and goofy one liners; she really was a pillar in making this story as strong as it was.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast was filled in nicely as well.  Mise was a wacky rock star who was tamed and disciplined by the unprecedented talent of Chiaki.  Stresseman posed as an odd but effective mentor for Chiaki, even though he had some problems controlling himself with the ladies\u2026 The rest of the S and Rising Star Orchestra members played their roles well and added to the overall completeness of the cast.  The character development was pretty decent overall for a relatively short 23 episode anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is typical for a mid 2000\u2019s anime, but I think I would\u2019ve enjoyed some more vibrant colors in the scenery and backdrops due to the jovial nature of the show.  Also, while the piano hand shots were accurate and smooth, when the orchestra would play the scene would often show stills of the musicians vice their actual hand movements on each instrument.  Nonetheless, this was only a minor complaint.  The characters were well designed, and I really think that Nodame\u2019s bright gleaming eyes fit with her expressive personality.  Chiaki\u2019s messed up hair and slender face added to his harem believability.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected, the sound in Nodame Cantibile is top notch.  I\u2019m not entirely sure what directions or influences the creator had for this show, but they were musically accurate and spectacular.  Each rendition of Schubert, Mozart and Beethoven was magical in its own sense, and made the anime very pleasant to just close your eyes and listen to.  I also really thought the intro added a burst of energy and excitement to the show, enticing the viewer with what was to come.  I personally watched the series in Japanese and thought the voice acting (particularly Nodame\u2019s) was superb.\\n\\n\r\nNodame Cantibile is a show that I would recommend to just about anyone.  I was looking for a nice change of pace after watching some more serious shows and I got just what I was asking for.  Lots of great comedy, a cheerful and believable romance and a soundtrack for pure enjoyment make this anime one I will not soon forget.",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile is an anime I truly love, but my honest opinion is it does not deserve a 10/10 despite how enjoyable it was.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nMain story is about the egotistical Chiaki who is a master at both the Violin and Piono, but he is going to music school with the dream of one day becoming a famous conductor. His only problem is he feels the only way to achieve that dream is to study in Europe, but unfortunately he is phobic of both air travel and sea travel keeping him land locked in Japan. One day he depressingly gets wasted and passes out outside ofhis neighbor Nodame's apparent... he wakes up in a filthy unorganized house, but being charmed by the beautiful music she is playing~ The emotion she puts in her music changes him forever. Despite Chiaki's cruel character and Nodame's Eccentricities they become good friends and work to improve their music together.  \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story goes it was primarily centered on the character's development and practicing their music. Most of the series there was no real &quot;Goal&quot; accept they wanted to get better and the Protagonist Chiaki one day wanted to study abroad. The lack of much plot development gives this story only a 7/10, but there was alot of comedy and the music is a very nice touch. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was a little off. It reminded me of that &quot;water color&quot; look from other anime like honey and clover, but it kind of detracted from the overall look of the anime since during the music scenes all you can really do is look and listen. It wasn't devastatingly bad, but it was distracting at parts. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is what made this anime truly amazing. Every episode they play classical music that really makes you appreciate it in a way you may not have before. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters were developed very nicely and had many original character attributes; especially Nodame. The side characters lacked enough development, but it didn't matter that much in the end since the two main characters were sufficient. The only real problem with the characters is the confusing unjustified development at the very end... There just wasn't enough in the story to support the character emotions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere were some flaws, but it was truly enjoyable to watch, lots of Lulz and great music. Great characters as well. While it hasn't revolutionized the Shoujo genre it was very nice to watch and not too fluffy.",

The music was wonderful, the art was good, and the rest of the characters were funny and held certain interests. Nodame killed all hope of me ever enjoying this show.",

            "content": "Is it really possible for music and slice of life to mix with romcom and still produce something worth watching? The answer to that question is simply Nodame Cantabile. \r\nAlthough some may ask, \"Kirby, what the heck are you doing watching romcoms?   You're losing your manhood in the josei genre!\" I have to politely disagree. Being a huge music lover, this series drew me in with promises of classical genius and musicality, and it delivers. Oh, it does! Now here are my categorical reviews\r\nStory: 9- Definitely a refreshing story fit for any gender. Story follows a genius music student with an arrogant outlooktowards others due to his superiority and musical control. He meets a ditzy piano student in the school and the unthinkable happens! A bit slow in pacing but you get to love the music from each character's viewpoint. Additionally, humor is one of the bright spots in this romcom as well with not too over the top humor but rather comical moments that let you chuckle and laugh out loud at other times. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7- Art is nice at times but the grave 3-D hands and animations are turn offs. You'll know what I'm referring to when you look at their hand animations. Fortunately, the animators actually took the painstaking effort to animate the piano, violin, and other instruments playing which saved the score. Something rarely seen in other animes. Otherwise, the animations of the characters and buildings etc. were decent but not mind-numbing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10- If you appreciate the music of an anime as much as I do, then you will not be let down. Incredible song selections with diverse instrumentation are some of this animes shining spots. Each song is also done with minute detail to incorporate the animation and conducting along with tempo and beat. Truly masterfully done!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9- Although put off at first at some character's distant appeal and cold stance, closer into the series, you understand their motives and reasons for acting the way they do. You simply fall in love with some of the characters throughout this series not because of their immediate appeal, but because of their dedication to an art and craft that envelops you with passion.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10- Definitely enjoyed Nodame Cantabile. Any music appreciator, romcom lover, or even someone looking for a wholesome talented cast is welcome to try out this anime. In the words of Nodame, \"GYABOOO\" and onto the next season we go!",

            "content": "Even though the lead character is a male, the presentation and themes of this show to me managed to pull off the elements of an old school shoujo. I&rsquo;d say something on the lines of Ace wo Nerae, Rose of Versaille and Garasu no Kamen. Granted this anime is not in the league of those 3, but I felt the charms of those classics as I got more into this. The concept of a classical music anime may either interest you or not. But I feel regardless of the presented medium, I feel this is something you have to give a chance. Though it lacksaction, fan service, and sex or anything like that, which is a great thing sometimes, it has comedy and class. Which is something you rarely see combined together nowadays in any country&rsquo;s entertainment. All the characters are likeable in their own rights and I feel you can relate to them as the series progresses. In the end, it&rsquo;s a story about truly finding what you want to do and how far you can take it.\\n\\n\r\nGranted Chiaki&rsquo;s characteristics are more typical of Shounen Jump titles, he&rsquo;s still portrayed in a realistic manner and if anyone is his worst critic, it&rsquo;s himself. In a lot of ways, we are a lot like Chiaki, but in some ways, we have also felt we have known someone like Nodame. Some other characters may come across as stereotypical like Stresseman as this old skirt chasing perverted master who is mostly in martial arts anime, the genre of music freshens this kind of character and is well balanced when you can actually take him seriously.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the style is simple but yet tolerable. It&rsquo;s nothing really too generic, but nothing really ground breaking, but still something you can distinct after viewing. I&rsquo;ve read very little of the manga and all I can say is it is pretty faithful to it. There&rsquo;s nothing over the top like hair of fashion or anything like that, so you&rsquo;re getting a more realistic approach. The eyes aren&rsquo;t too big and the faces aren&rsquo;t too pointy. The characters really don&rsquo;t look too foreign. Whenever an orchestra scene is set in, close ups of the instruments are in an interesting rendering of CG with realistic detail. The orchestra is in sync but I feel there are too many instances where they rely on still shots paintings when playing songs, which can be good and bad. Good reasons are so that you can concentrate on the music, bad reasons is because of the intention of Chiaki wanting to be a conductor and you really don&rsquo;t see his style of conducting in a physical approach. It&rsquo;s also nice to see an orchestra play which I will address in my review of the live action adaptation more in depth. \\n\\n\r\nNow time to talk about the heart and soul of this anime, the music. The in-show soundtrack naturally of course consists of the use of classical music by Beethoven and Mozart. I like how the anime gives you an in depth look at the back-story of how the music came about and how it should be expressed. When you finally get to listen to the song after learning the proper information, you can finally appreciate the music in that sense if you had no prior knowledge of that song or songwriter. I do have criticisms of the execution of the music, but I&rsquo;m saving that for my review of the live action. The opening and ending themes are catchy and capture the spirit and other qualities of this anime 100%. I like the first ending theme Konna ni Chikaku de by Crystal Kay. I&rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of her.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also superb. I felt that Chiaki&rsquo;s character was truly tailor made for his seiyuu, Seki Tomokazu, a man that I have noted in virtually a lot of my reviews and a name you should know if you watch them. The way I described him should tell you that he is fit to play this role. Of course Stresseman is portrayed as one of those characters who have a broken Japanese accent like Apachi from Kenichi, but it lacked a certain kind of charisma and enthusiasm. Nodame is played by Kawasumi Ayako, the voice of Natsuki from Initial D truly captured the characteristics of her as well. And the majority of the cast members were guys I couldn&rsquo;t recognize, but I felt they did enough, but I just don&rsquo;t felt they had the same presence as the cast in the live action. \\n\\n\r\nAs I have noted throughout this review, there is a live action version to Nodame Cantabile. As a matter of fact, this anime came out a season after the live action did and I watched them simultaneously just to keep my mind fresh and see how they executed them. Personally, I liked the live action a whole lot better.",

            "content": "This series has been a real chore, and I really didn't anticipate it to be so. \r\nI am a college music major with a focus in music composition. I perform music of this sort and ultimately compose it as well. I'm immersed with the culture of a music school and can relate to many of the aspects of musicianship represented in this anime. However, this series has been agitating me for reasons primarily unrelated to the theme itself. The leading characters are painfully annoying, the snobbery and elitism within their respective institution gives musicianship a bad name, and the story is about as slow asJanuary molasses. Let's look at this story in depth shall we? \\n\\n\r\nChiaki is a pretentious piano student at Japans most prestigious music school. Though he has studied piano for quite some time, his real dream is to be an orchestral conductor. Whilst aiming for this objective, he ultimately makes some unexpected new friends, namely Nodame, a fellow piano major. Nodame and Chiaki serve to be quite different from each other in not only their social demeanor, but also their musical interpretations. Chiaki is a man of the book and abides by the rules of a pieces respective composer. For Chiaki, music isn't so much meant to be felt individually, but instead should be calculated, rigid and in perfect correlation with the music on the page. Nodame feels the music and plays from her heart. Often times, she has her eyes closed while playing piano to further express herself. Such actions to her do not serve to be a disservice to the composers of old. For her, the composers wrote their music not to merely be performed, but to be felt, personalized and expressed. This story summation, upon looking at it sounds like it could make for a fantastic anime. Two social and artistic opposites find themselves involved in each others lives. It's a common story model that can make for very good, or sometimes very bad stories. Let me explain why I feel like it tends to at times fall into the latter. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime isn't horrible. However, I'd argue that it's characters for the most part are awful. This story, with all of its potential often times falls flat because of the nature of the characters. Chiaki embodies everything that I hate about musical elitism. He's calloused, arrogant, narcissistic and suppresses individual creativity. He as a character is supposed to be this way, yet it doesn't make him any less painful to watch with every episode. I have a feeling he may come around and realize he's an asshole to everyone around him, yet his demeanor peeves me to no end and probably will for as long as I watch this series. Nodame is no better. She might actually be worse. Annoying, clingy, brainless... yet extremely talented. I will give it to Nodame, that she is the more interesting of the two main characters, yet she drives me crazy. Musically speaking, I can relate to her. We both feel the music and play from our hearts, not always the music on the page. What frustrates me about Nodame though is that I have yet to see a deep side of her. She's always chasing Chiaki, eating his food, and making a scene. I don't have any problem with Nodame really doing these things. But I want to know WHY she is the way she is. I want to know her story. I want her to understand that one shouldn't force themselves upon respective love interests, and I want to see her call out Chiaki when he's being a douche bag!! It is probably this last sentiment that irks me most of all. Nodame sees no wrong with Chiaki, he's always the perfect sage, the good guy as opposed to someone who needs to be balanced out and humbled. Nodame's lack of intervention in this area serves to only further give the connotation that she has no depth and acts much like a school girl who falls in love with a guy because he's hot or good at a respective hobby. \\n\\n\r\nThe minor characters vary in their interest. Stresseman is a conductor at the school, and he's super creepy. I like a lot of his sentiments musically speaking, and I wish the show would put less stock into his fetishes and held grudges. Mine is a violinist and my favorite character in the series. He's exactly like me in that he loathes the elitism of classical musics hierarchy and recreation-ally enjoys listening to rock, metal and other adrenaline pumping genres. I forget the name of the timpani player girl... but she has a mustache, and an afro... and I really would like to know her story. I don't necessarily frown upon these external qualities she exhibits, but I'd love to know WHY they are a part of her as a character. \\n\\n\r\nLong story short, I've really been struggling to get into this anime. The characters are angering and the story itself seemingly takes a backseat to the unfunny relational dichotomy of Nodame and Chiaki. I can understand the audience that likes this series, but I'm just not sold on it at all. I'm going to give it some more time in the hopes that I can share in the sentiments of this seemingly vast fan base. However, this series hasn't lived up to the hype at all thus far. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

So ill just write this like i really want to..\r\nI feel like i've watched anime for too long... I've honestly seen all the shows i really want to see. I never have the feeling of \"Damn, this show is amazing, and i even have other amazing shows qued up for later!\" No. Its more like; wait shit im reviewing Nodame Cantabile lets go\r\nSo i've seen quite a few Romance/Music Animes, and for some reason they're just never bad. Thinkabout it: Shigatsu, Sakamichi no Apollon, White Album 2, White album original series (no), So hey,, Nodame Cantabile has got to impress me RIGHT?\\n\\n\r\nI guess it had its fair share of qualities, but for this exact series, im going to have to make a twist in my super serious review. Lets split things into two parts: Music part, and Romance part.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: You know what im super tired off? When you watch any type of competitive anime like sports, music or just action we always follow some clich\u00e9 ass underdog maincharacter who just gains immense amount of skills througout the show. Not here tho. We have this super talented musician god who is already about to turn pro. Were not seeing him grow better then everyone else, cause he already is. Kind of like \"Soma\" from \"Food Wars\", but thats a different story for a different day. \\n\r\nOh, and yeah; the music is good.\\n\\n\r\nROMANCE: As sick and tired i am of super cliche romance comedy animes, i actually found some qualities in this one..... After tons of digging super deep.. So let's see. What do you need to make a good RomCom anime? Very entertaining characters. Check (i mean jesus dont tell me u dont rofl every time Nodame goes GUYAA) A relationship that is actually developing. Che... no im already out of qualities. This is why i hate writing reviews... Animes suck man..\\n\\n\r\nI just realized something. You know when you trying to score your completed shows, and MAL says like: 10 (MASTERPIECE) 9 (SUPERGOOD) and those things... like rank 6 ish is named GOOD.. but when a show a 6 as ranking, its frikkin dogpoop man.. kind of makes me hard to rank this one... god damnit im going to sleep.",

            "content": "A Music Performance Majors view on Nodame.\r\nI am only going to write this review for this particular season, but what I have to say applies to the entire series as a whole. Nodame Cantabile was a series I was a little reluctant to watch since it dealt with classical music, and even though JC Staff's shows are pretty much my anime crack (not necessarily my fav studio, but I am easily addicted to a lot of their shows), and Nodame had the best ratings on this website from JC Staff shows, I put off watching it for quite some time. After watching the first episode,however,  I started thinking to myself \"why had I taken so long to start watching this?\"\\n\\n\r\nI was amazed at how accurate this show was to real music student life. The characters represent a fairly accurate (although anime version) slice of musicians' personalities from my own personal experience. I can honestly say that most musicians are not gay, but there are certainly a higher ratio in comparison to other career study fields, and most musicians have eccentricities. There also tend to be two types of musicians, the talents, and the workaholics. A talented musician tends to have a lot of trouble focusing on one thing until its perfect since they are used to doing everything at an accelerated pace and are not used to having difficulty learning things. Nodame is this kind of character. She has an amazing talent as a pianist but has a very difficult time staying focused and learning to control her playing. I found these types of details to be extremely insightful having finished a music performance degree myself, I was surprised at how accurate this show was at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is all masterpieces by the masters. In real life you would never see so many of these pieces performed back to back as there is just such a large volume of classical music. Since this is TV, I can't really complain that they didn't play anything remotely obscure in the entire series, but if this inspires anyone to see a concert it is unlikely that you will see any two of the pieces in this show played in the same concert. That aside, I was blown away by the fact that when the musicians are supposed to suck, the music actually reflects that. This means that for the purposes of this show they got a professional orchestra to make the mistakes that the conductors have to correct! Usually, in music TV shows they just have someone say that it sucks without having any actual audible mistake.\\n\\n\r\nClassical music has long been used as the primary medium for manipulating emotions in cinema, and this show also does this superbly. Without the music I probably would not have shed a single tear watching this, but it is near impossible for any audiophile to avoid.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all I gave Nodame Cantable a 9 as I consider it to be as good as this show could have been, there is nothing in the series that really makes it groundbreaking, but it is definitely what I would consider a must see show for anyone who likes comedy, romance, and of course music!",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile is a mature and beautiful romance (with some surprisingly silly and lighthearted moments) that somehow manages to avoid most of the annoying clich\u00e9s!\r\nLET'S GET INTO IT.\r\n~Art~\r\n     The art was probably this show's weakest point. Most of the time, it was just....ADEQUATE. Whenever someone is playing an instrument, the art changes to a 3D/CG style to better show the precise movements. While the piano-playing, for example, WAS impressively accurate and intricate-looking in this style, the change was noticeable and a bit jarring. Also, some angles just didn't work as well as others.\r\n     Though, you also haveto take the year that this was created into account. Sure, it was only 2007, but anime art has made pretty big strides since then! The \"average\" was a lot lower back then. Shows like Clannad, Shuffle!, and Lovely Complex were also all 2007, and looked pretty similarly rough by today's standards. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough, I must say, some of the animation in the show's opening is particularly wonderful, and matches well with theme. Altogether, the art certainly was NOT terrible, so, with all of the other sections of this review being so positive, the art likely won't affect my overall score by much. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\r\n     It's pretty clear that this is a music-based show. If you can't stand Classical music, you may want to stay away from this one. One episode in particular has literally 10 straight minutes of performance and facial expressions, with no dialogue. If you even TOLERATE Classical, though- I guarantee that at least one or two of the songs will captivate you.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED (which aren't Classical music) were pretty great in my opinion too!\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\r\n     Our main couple in this show, Nodame and Chiaki, are just wonderful. Nodame's character was very different from what I was expecting, in a good way. She brings a lot of lightness and fun to the atmosphere, without ever being truly annoying or overbearing. Chiaki, on the other hand, is not really a people person. It's pretty obvious that he has a hard time putting his feelings into words. He's almost always either looking gloomy or extremely focused. So, together the two make a very nice, entertaining balance. The whole \"OH BOY, these two people are opposites but are somehow falling for each other!\" concept is by no means original, but this show pulls it off so well that you barely notice.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a pretty large and colorful cast of side characters as well! There are quite a few new names in the second half of the show, so try to stay focused and match names to faces or you may get a little mixed up.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that hurts this section for me is that, at times, Chiaki can come off as a bit of an asshole. I know he's stressed, and is a very closed-off person, BUT COME ON BE NICE DAMN IT. Don't get me wrong, though. I know he means well. Overall, all the characters were great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~Plot~\\n\r\n     The plot was hugely important in making this show a 10 for me. Many romance shows (particularly 24-episode ones) tend to be extremely predictable, and also pretty darn slow. Here's a graph I made to show how these shows normally work:\\n\\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bKu4cXU.png\\n\\n\r\n     Usually, you can see that middle arc of despair coming from a mile away, and when you're IN it, you know it's going to take absolutely forever to clear up. That's what happens when you try to fill 24 episodes with nothing but petty ridiculous relationship drama.\\n\\n\r\n     In the best anime romances of all time, it's almost impossible to draw a simple graph. There are so many side-stories and captivating situations happening that you don't even notice the time passing. A good example of that style of storytelling is Clannad. This show felt very similar in that respect. I never knew what was coming next, the drama never dragged on, and everything just felt right. When the drama does come, it's beautiful, but clear and realistic. I couldn't ask for more from the  plot. The excellent comedy is just icing on the cake.\\n\\n\r\nPlot - 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\r\n     I've been HUGE on listening to and creating music for as long as I can remember, so the themes and dramatic concepts that revolved around music really resounded with me. I ended up watching this whole show in one sitting, which is very rare for me. If I could give this section an 11, I would.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n~Overall~\\n\r\n     If you're looking for mature and realistic romance, don't pass this one up. In this case, \"mature\" certainly doesn't mean dull and colorless. There are countless lighthearted and silly moments thrown into the drama to make this a show you'll never forget. While the art may not be spectacular, the beauty of everything else overshadows that shortcoming twice over. Even if you're a bit skeptical, give this show a try. The first episode alone will likely be enough to reel you in and never let you go.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile was originally a manga by Ninomiya Tomoko. I've never been exposed to her work before so I don't quite know what to expect. I do know that it won the 2004 Kodansha manga award for best shoujo manga, so I'm hoping that's a good sign. I'll just have to watch through it and see. \r\nThe story is pretty basic. There's a music student named Chiaki who can't travel overseas due to an acute fear of both boats and planes, even though he'd like to study music in Europe. He lives next door to a piano student named Noda Megumi or Nodame who findshim passed out by the door one evening and decides to bring him inside her apartment to let him sleep in the comfort of the indoors... surrounded by comforting filth. The two quickly become linked when Chiaki starts taking lessons from the same instructor as Nodame and she quickly falls in love with him. You follow the two of them as they pursue their mutual love of music and as their relationship grows. It's a simple story but it's well written. The synopsis really doesn't do it justice since quite a bit happens in their academic, personal and musical lives. There's always an obstacle for one, if not both, of them to pass and it keeps things interesting. That being said, I did have one issue with the story, and no, it's not the way the romance is done. Contrary to certain misconceptions, I don't just mindlessly hate all het romances in anime. Just those that are poorly written. This one, I honestly liked. Chiaki and Nodame aren't going to make my top fifteen couples, but I did like their relationship. No, my problem is with the pacing. There are quite a few situations that drag on longer than they needed to and a few at the very end that were rushed. No, it isn't a major problem but it's enough of one to merit mention. \\n\\n\r\nSince the story is pretty simple, this anime really needs interesting characters to work. Does it provide them? I'd have to say yes. The major characters are interesting and have some really dynamic and some funny interactions. Chiaki and Nodame especially are well developed. The primary supporting characters, Mine and Masumi, are also interesting. The more minor characters are really the issue. A lot of them get very little development or personality. Although I'm not going to hold that against the series too much since it deals with orchestras and, as such, has to have a lot of characters. What I will hold against the series is the character of Stresemann. While I don't have a major issue with dirty old men in media on principal, it does bother me when they get away with harassment and borderline molestation without any real problems. Stresemann is one of those characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is really detailed and impressive, mostly. The only issue I really had with it was that they do some bizarre stuff with facial expressions. I've mentioned this before, but it was in another review that not everyone's necessarily seen so I'll repeat it. This convention doesn't bother me when it's used sparingly, but Nodame Cantabile doesn't show any kind of restraint with its use and the result is that it loses any impact that it may have had otherwise and it just ends up getting slightly annoying. \\n\\n\r\nThe actors do well in their roles. Especially Seki Tomokazu and Kawasumi Ayako. My only real problem with the cast is that there are a few Deutsch lines and the actors clearly don't have a good grasp of Deutsch. So these lines just don't sound good. Admittedly, that's a pretty minor issue. The music... the music is amazing. When they're trying to make it sound off, it sounds off and when they're doing scenes where it all comes together, it sounds incredible. The music is so astounding that it almost makes the series worth watching by itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. There's no yuri to be found in this. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Nodame Cantabile is an 9/10. It's an amazing series. I have a few gripes but they're minor when compared with everything that the series does well. If you're a fan of classical music, romance, or slice of life series, I would definitely suggest giving this one a try.",

            "content": "___________________________________________ Review the 5th\r\nChihuahua Review(short&sweet): A musical, HIGH quality romance with lots of memorable moments. \r\n------------------------------>In Depth Review:<------------------------\r\nSTORY: The theme to this anime is CLASSICAL MUSIC. The main charcter Chiaki is a piano major with a dream of conducting. Along his journey, filled with phobias and doubt, to his goal he meets many UNIQUE musical players including Nodame. The story here was amusing and addictive. This was probably a result of the amazing depth each character had and their many interactions with one another. I consider this to be one of the top tier animes around with such amazing character and music.  \r\nART: Theartstyle is nice and is definately better than the one posted for the anime. The characters were smooth and well drawn although i'd have to say one was sort of hideous. XD The part of the animation that people may no have liked was the still frames when the orchestra was playing. It wasn't too bothersome but it was dissapointing to not see animation in an anime especially during a key part. But i cant help respect the animators choices.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The sound was the key aspect of the show. There wasn't the same 3-5 songs playing throughout the show but, a cornacopia(alot)^_^ of songs from the classical genre. The OP and ED were some of my favorite op's and ed's and i'd say i only skipped them 1or2 times. Nodame Cantabile introduced me to some great classical pieces and allowed me to imagine older music performed by younger artists, making me realize that classical is still popular and out there. I may not be converted to a true classical fan but i wont complain if i ever hear it playing again.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The characters were all enjoiable and kept me laughing with their crazy antics. Don't get me wrong though, there was also a bunch of drama resulting from failure, childhood trauma, and lack of self confidence. The characters were all believable with all the realistic trials any college student would probably experience at one time or another. Especially surprising was how each character had their own worked out background, and this included some of the supporting cast. I'd be amazed if you couldnt relate to at least one aspect or problem of their lives. \\n\\n\r\nENJOIMENT: I enjoied this anime a lot and i'm so glad there is a second season since i didn't really feel enough closure at the end. This is addictive and if it wasnt for my trip to New Orleans i couldve finished it in two days.^_^ I might make this a 10 if the sequel really finishes this anime strongly.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Even with debatable animation scenes there were too many other great characteristics and lovable characters(Nodame) &gt;_&lt;. I dont really see a reason not to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: If you like a better yourself romance or classical music watch this. If you like this then watch Itazura na Kiss, Nana, or Beck.\\n\\n\r\nIf you dissagreed OR agreed fully with me on anything feel free to message me and discuss it. Always fun. @_@\\n\\n\r\nWoofWoof(Gyaaabo)",

            "content": "When i first red about this anime, the only thing i could think of is how much of a drag this was gonna be if it was just about romance from a girls perspective.\r\nBut jesus christ, was i wrong. Nodame Cantabile was fantastic, as male who doesn't really interest himself in the romance genre this turned out to be one darn good rollercoaster. I will also be reviewing this anime as a whole here, as it will also give you some impression of what to expect in the latter 2 seasons. But for now please enjoy the review!\r\nThe story, which i didn't expect, is actuallyviewed from two perspectives: From our female main character Nodame and the male main character Chiaki. The story itself is about Chiaki, a prodigy muscian, who has followed music his whole life and ended up in Japan for some crucial circumstance and is therefor unable to leave. He is a piano majorist in a japanese college, but who aims at a greater hight: Becoming a conductor. He is so good at the piano that he doesn't sense the purpose of continuing down that track, until he meets a certain woman who plays the piano extremly magical by being able to express herself in her playstyle. Their fate has now intertwined and the story of two young souls that chase their musical dreams undergoing hardships and laughter, begin.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around so much more than you would think, first of all this is an anime about music as a whole. Not only as something you listen to, but something you express and live with. This anime is literally about musicians and their hardships, not only in music, but in their life. The anime faces the reality of what happens two those who presue the career and are good, and those who have to train to obtain perfection in their art. \\n\\n\r\nArt is actually a good descriptive word for the whole anime, the music that is played is beutiful and expresses every character in a glorious way. Let's not forget that there is still romance here, but it is connected through music between our two main characters. There is also quite some comedy in this, and it's actually pretty funny!\\n\\n\r\nThe story develops slowly at first, but it takes up. The capturing point for me in this anime, is not only the music that is transcribed, it's the characters. The liveliness, the hardships they face, the way they interact, everything is relatable and in a good way. The characters are interesting and have each their own sellingpoint and story that develops throughout the series. It's been a long time since i have enjoyed characters to this degree, because all of them feel alive and have their purpose.\\n\\n\r\nI could have gone on and on about how much there is to love about this anime(pun intended), but the fact is that it gets tiresome and kinda repetetive towards the end. Even though, this can easily be overcome by the sensational characters and their characteristics that keeps pulling you back to watch more. The bond between our two main characters is especially fascinating and keeps you on your toes you often go to wonder, damn what will happen next episode?\\n\\n\r\nI am not easily swayed by animes that are not driven by some psychological aspect, but this lighthearted and extremely compassionate anime was just too good to let go. It got me hooked, i needed to watch the next episode, and i felt that it really conveyed what it means and everything there is to being a muscian. Especially what this anime did right was its two asepcts of bonds, the one between characters, and the one between characters and music.\\n\\n\r\n Overall i give it a 7, it's just that good. If it was not for some tiring or repeatable parts in the later segements of the anime and other seasons, i would definitivly have given this a solid 9. Cheers guys! \\n\\n",

            "content": "If you are a lover of romantic-comedy anime, or not, this is an anime that will surely shake up your stomach! Obviously,I prove it myself: D\r\nI'll tell you a little. I first got to know through a bookstore in my country. Initially I did not like it, why? At that time I was aged 8-9 years, my taste buds are still choppy. I immediately put it, 'I'm not interested'.\r\nWhen it was released, I was thinking of trying to watch. Of course I did not have much expectations from this anime. But it seems in my opinion this does not last long. This anime is ananime that broke my theory, my mindset and give a loud slap in my face.\\n\\n\r\n\"Do not judge something from it's cover\" -this phrase fit for a description of what happened. I'm serious, This anime is different from what I imagined. It is about quality.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about this anime? The first is a story that is incredible, remarkable and entertaining. Shorter, tells the story of a pair of men and women who take the same music school. They play different musical instruments, and the dream is different. Although there is a struggle Chiaki who would want to be a conductor, do not worry, comedy is always ready to make you laugh out loud. Even if not a funny scene, I always laugh.\\n\\n\r\nan additional point of this anime is Seiyuu (VA). Seiyuu here supports the anime goes well, more alive and excited. Then, when you after watching Kimi ni Todoke you fall in love with the opening song. This one, too. The song is lovely and cheerful.\\n\\n\r\nDo you think the romantic story always ends tragically? No, this anime teaches love is beautiful. Even at a hard time, they are encouraging.\\n\\n\r\nInnocence, confidence and joy of the protagonist, 'Nodame' is the wheel that makes this story goes, with Chiaki also have a role in it. The premise is promising, I did not comment about the art, though I also did not like it. But the important thing is 'how you enjoy this anime'.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime will exclude your mindset. And will carve a smile on your face. My final assessment, enjoyment: 10/10.\\n",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile makes you enjoy music to the fullest.Even if you are not a fan of the classical music,you will love this anime.Nodame Cantabile is a adapation of the manga by Tomoko Ninomiya,which was first published in 2001,in Kiss magazine.The name \"Nodame Cantabile\" refers at \"Cantabile\" which is a musical term meaning literally \"singable\" or \"songlike\" (in Italian). For later composers, particularly in piano music, cantabile indicates the drawing out of one particular musical line against the accompaniment. Nodame is actually the penname of Noda Megumi, the main female character of the story. \"Nodame Cantabile\" in my opinion indicates the ability of Noda Megumi toplay the piano more freely than others usually play,because the cantabile movement would be slower and more free-form to contrast with the structured and generally faster cabaletta.\\n\\n\r\nThe story:\\n\r\n-Begins with the main male character named Shinichi Chiaki which is a very talented  Conservatory student but also has a critic and natsy personality.He has painful memories from his childhood,when he was twelve he experimented a plane crush .From here is his phobia of flying by plane.He also has a fobia to travel by ship.Because of this he can't leave Japan anymore,to return to his teacher,Viera-sensei.Having a hard time to be the student of Kouzou  Etoh,he  abandons his teacher.He also separates from his girlfriend, Saiko.\\n\r\nNow Chiaki is at a difficult period of his life:Will he abandon music,too? \\n\r\nNo,because here appears Noda Megumi,a talented piano player,but also a lazy,dull, blockhead, unskilled, incapable, inefficient person.She has a habbit of playing by ear, in a cantabile style,by memorize her favorite songs,mostly invented by her.She is very childish,innocent and warm-hearted girl.She brings Chiaki back his feelings for music,like a sweet spring breeze.\\n\r\n                                                                       Score:10\\n\\n\r\nThe Art:\\n\r\n-This anime has a very balanced, simple, warm and crystalline art.The art is like a mirror,an accompaniment  for the beautiful songs,played by the symphonic  orchestra.The art gives peaceful feelings,mysterious and wonderful feelings.The decors are subtile and nuanced. The characters's design is realistic, and not excessive (as in normal shoujo animes).The characters are beautiful but without to be seen as \"bishoujos or bishounes\".They also have very expressive facial expressions,and mimics.The bodys  echilibrate beautiful with the atmospher,creating beautiful symmetry.\\n\\n\r\n                                                                       Score:10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound:\\n\r\n-Nodame Cantabile, with sections of music by Rachmaninov, Liszt, Brahms, Gershwin, Beethoven, and Chopin that are performed by the characters in the series. The performers included the Vienna Philharmonic, London Symphony Orchestra, and Berlin Philharmonic. The anime include works by Beethoven, Rachmaninov, Gershwin, Liszt, Mozart, Debussy, Ravel, and Richard Strauss that are performed by characters.\\n\r\nThe seiy\u016b Ayako Kawasumi,also plays piano in the real life.I heard some of the pieces of the composers like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig Von Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Antonio Vivaldi, Johann Sebastian Bach,but I enjoyed to hear them more in the anime as OST-s than in real life,they had something \"fresh\" about them,more sweet and tangible, a real  delightfullness for someone's ears.I felt  like I was thrown in alternative space,with a heavenly music.\\n\\n\r\n                                                                       Score:10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n-The main characters and the interaction between them is a joy for the watcher.The anime is a beautiful,subtile contrast between humor,amusement and drama .\\n\r\nEven if Shinichi Chiaki is sometime bossy and cinic,he has a good sense of music (and people).He is a also a good cook and has a funny personality.He can encourages people with talent and helps them to achieve their goals.He is also perfectionist and more critical of himself than with others.\\n\r\nMegumi Noda is a very complex character,she hides herself in her dream world and childish fantasizes,runs away from everything she doesn't like and disagree with.She is a glutton when it comes to food and Chiaki.She is stubborn and lazy.In her childhood she had problems with her proffesor 's tough and exigent  way of teaching.\\n\r\nBut her optimism and courage is remarkable. Tomoko Ninomiya did a very good job creating this characters.\\n\\n\r\n                                                                       Score:10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n-This anime is a must see,a master piece which is one of the greatest animes made in 2007.\\n\\n\r\n                                                                       Score:10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Score: 10.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review ever made,I quite enjoyed making it ^^ .",

            "content": "These days, I often feel that slice of life is a very much misunderstood genre. Back in the days of \"NieA Under 7\" and \"Beck\", it seemed to be a little talked about subgenre of \"drama\". But a few years ago, for reasons unknown to me, it suddenly exploded into mainstream popularity to the extent that it's now totally eclipsing its parent genre, with anything and everything being (often wrongly) labelled as \"slice of life\". The small subgenre of genuine slice of life anime however, has always been, in my experience, one of the most consistent genres. They are the kind of anime that dealswith the mundane, anime that are often contemplative reflections of various, often under-appreciated aspects of daily life.\\n\\n\r\n...and then there's \"Nodame Cantabile\" (and its sequels), a slice of life set in a classical music conservatory. \"Nodame Cantabile\" is to slice of life anime what the great J.S.Bach is to Baroque music. Just as Bach took the various aspect of Baroque music and brought them to their ultimate form, \"Nodame Cantabile\" takes the various aspects of slice of life and combines them into into a show that's raises the bar for the genre. It's funny and entertaining without resorting to the forced humour of \"Honey and Clover\", it's passionate about its subject matter without the exclusiveness of \"Genshiken\", and it's thought provoking and inspiring without the heavy-handedness of \"Planetes\". And as someone who's learning piano, it's a series that's really helped fuel my interest not only in piano, but classical music in general (so I might be a tad biased :D [/disclaimer]).\\n\\n\r\n[ Warning: I kind of got a bit carried away while writing this and ended up with a rather in depth character analysis section. So be warned that this review contains spoilers regarding the direction of the character development ]\\n\\n\r\n\"Nodame Cantabile\" is not just for classical music enthusiasts (I certainly wasn't one... at least not when I started this anime), there's plenty of other things such as the fabulous character interactions that makes it an awesome watch for the general audience. The storyline isn't completely sensible, but while its occasional use of comedy to progress the story marks it out as one of the more quirky and perhaps less realistic slice of life series, there is no doubt that the values conveyed and the way with which it goes about conveying them are definitive slice of life stuff. It contains plenty of food for thought, as themes such as self improvement and questions concerning ambitions and talent are cleverly woven into the very fabric of the story.\\n\\n\r\nTake for example Chiaki, one of the two protagonists of the series. It's obvious from the start of the show that he's a hugely talented musician and can play the violin incredibly well despite being a piano major. Of course, people often has this misconception that things must be come easily to people like him, that these kinds of people hardly need to practice etc, and this is exactly what Mine (a violin student) thought when he's just getting to know Chiaki. But it turns out Chiaki is good on the violin because he'd put in a sickening amount of practice on it prior to entering the academy, where he chose to learn piano precisely because he wasn't as skilled at it. And this is astounding if you think about it, because it completely goes against people's natural instincts, which is pick their strongest subject to study. The fact that Chiaki is willing to take his weakness head on to turn it into his strength is an indication of his incredible drive and commitment. And eventually, Mine begins to appreciate that the secret behind Chiaki's success is not just talent, noting that: \"He is amazing, but he's backed up by his hard work.\" In contrast, the other protagonist Nodame, who is also very talented, is lounging around at the bottom of the class with the stragglers, and this really effectively hammers home the message that there's simply no substitute for honest hard work.\\n\\n\r\nChiaki may work incredibly hard, and may possess incredible musical talent, but he soon finds that sometimes this still isn't enough. His ultimate goal is to become a conductor, and his interactions with various orchestras make up a significant part of the series, throwing up some extremely interesting character interaction and development. The main point of interest here is how Chiaki get to grips with this new role. Despite being fully prepared, and despite being so talented to the extent that he can hear the fault of every instrument in the orchestra (which is an incredible feat itself), he still struggled initially to keep things under control and get them to produce the sound he's looking for. Gradually, he learns that conducting is not just about the music and the technical stuff, the human factor is also very important - getting everyone to gel and striking a balance between being critical of the faults in the performances and keeping the players' morale up all combine to make the task a mammoth one. I know next to nothing about conducting (other than the fact that it's supposed to be ridiculously hard), but I find the scenarios in \"Nodame Cantabile\" to be extremely believable. If you ever thought conducting should be easy with some guy just waving a baton around, this would almost certainly change your opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThough undoubtedly a romantic comedy, \"Nodame Cantabile\" is relatively light in this aspect, and the romance that is contained in the show has everything to do with music. It's because of her music that Nodame is first able to catch the attention of Chiaki. However it's also because of the music that's there's a gulf separating them. Chiaki's lofty goals means that he's unwilling be anchored by the lack of ambition shown by Nodame, for whom music is initially nothing more than just a fun thing to do. The series' romance revolves around this idea that unless Nodame start taking her music more seriously, Chiaki would soon be heading to a place she can't follow. And though Chiaki's efforts to drag her upwards does have some effect, it would take a lot more than a small change in attitude for them to not drift apart at some point in the future.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is not limited to the romance. Chiaki's constant strive for excellence inspires not only Nodame, but also stragglers like Mine to take a more serious, disciplined approach to learning music, and consequently they are gradually able to understand and appreciate better the intentions of the composer in the pieces they play. But what's perhaps more remarkable is that influences are mutual - Chiaki is already incredibly good at the start of the series, but there's still plenty of things for him to learn about music from the straggler students. In particular, his contact with Nodame's wild, untamed talents enables him to take a more complete view of music - it helps him to look beyond his strict, by-the-score methods and realise the value of individuality of musical expression. This ties in with the development that his general personality undergoes: because of his interactions with Nodame and with his first orchestra etc, we see him gradually changing from the cold, aloof perfectionist at the start to a much more warm and understanding person by the end.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think it can be denied that \"Nodame Cantabile\" is an anime that radiates an infectious enthusiasm for classical music, so it's only fitting that I talk a bit (read: extensively) about the music in the series. It should come as no surprise that classical music is omnipresent within the series. The music performed by the students of the conservatory are obviously all from this genre, but the background instrumentals also contain (often tongue-in-cheek) arrangements of famous pieces such as Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\" and Tchaikovski's \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\". There are also some nice BGM's that I don't recognise which may be classical music that I'm not familiar with. And though the OP's and ED's aren't classical pieces, there are some connections to classical music even there: the lyrics of the wildly catchy opening theme \"Allegro Cantabile\" features heavy usage of terms from classical music (as you can see from its title); the second ending theme, plain though it may be, also begins with a really nice violin/piano intro that makes for a blissfully \"fade in\" music as each episode comes to an end. (The first ending theme is pretty forgettable, but hey - you can't have everything :P) The music that are performed by the students in the series deserve special mention, because a phenomenal effort has been made to tailor most if not all the performances to suit the context in which the performance took place. [Note: If you want to know more about this, I've dedicated a whole section to analysing this aspect. I've put it at the end of the review so as to not bore the readers who aren't interested in this stuff.]\\n\\n\r\nOf course, all of this leads to a potential problem - though it's easy to like \"Nodame Cantabile\" even if you're not into classical music, it's a completely different kettle of fish if you hate classical music, especially given that there are long periods, especially towards the end of the series, where you just get a piece of music being performed and not much else happening. This may also bore a not-so-patient viewer who's not that into the music being performed, though it's not something you can really fault the anime for - it's obviously very passionate about classical music after all, and so it's kind of expected that it would invest some time into showing the performances. For those who don't have a knee jerk negative reaction to classical music, it's easy to be caught up in the anime's passion. In particular, I find the characters' thoughts on a piece of music when it's being performed to be an integral part of enjoying the music of \"Nodame Cantabile\". The \"flower garden\" of Beethoven's \"Spring\", the very graceful and \"pink\" Mozart Oboe Concerto, and the piano play of the Rachmaninoff piano concerto that \"illuminates like the morning light in a bottomless ravine\"... the well written commentry often combine with the music to form an immersive, spine-tingling atmosphere that effortlessly drew me in, especially during the performances. Often, the audience reactions may be a little exaggerated, but by that point I'd be so taken in by the atmosphere that the exaggerated reactions only added further to the mood. \"Nodame Cantabile\" can also be quite enlightening with regards to the music being played, often providing insight and background information about the music that really encriched the experience - it's a show that obviously knows its stuff. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I feel like I've gushed for long enough already. If you love drama, if you love music, or if you want to be inspired, then \"Nodame Cantabile\" has my highest recommendation.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nFor those who are interested, here's some extra information on the music used in Nodame Cantabile that I picked up. Before I begin, I should give a little background about myself (just so you know how large a grain of salt to take with my opinions on this :P) The first time I watched this series was soon after I started (re-)learning piano at the ripe old age of 24 (I did learn for a couple of years starting when I was about 4 or 5, but had completely forgotten everything by the time I started again). On my first watch, I often wondered whether how closely the music performed in the series matched the commentary made on it. Is the music really performed badly when characters say it sucks, and is it honestly good when they say it's good? It all sounded fine to me! Coming back to this series over two years later with more piano practice under my belt and having listened to many of the pieces found in the show, I now have a better idea about the music performed. So basically my level of expertise isn't very high - I can probably pick up more than a casual listener, but anyone who's studied a bit of classical music would probably know a lot more than I.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, for pieces that gets played properly in \"Nodame Cantabile\", I STILL can't really tell exactly how good they are, because the quality is far enough above the average homemade youtube video performance by random people with usernames along the lines of z0MG1337_pIaNisT that I'm not really in a position to judge. However, for pieces I'm sufficiently familiar with, I can at least verify that when a character (usually Chiaki) points out that there is a mistake in the performance, then there definitely is a corresponding mistake in the music that is used for that scene. More impressively, one of the main characters Nodame is supposed to be a very talented but eccentric (not always in a good way) pianist, and on my second viewing I was actually able to hear some of the eccentricity in her playing. In particular, her playing of the 2nd movement of Beethoven's famous \"Pathetique Sonata\" is very distinctive. The piece is supposed to be a sombre, gloomy one, but Nodame plays the left hand part in an almost stoccato like way, and the whole piece is given a bouncing, frolicking interpretation that is a perfect reflection of her own personality.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as unbelievable as all this already is, I'd assumed that the same effort is not applied to the orchestral performances, since getting a proper orchestra to perform and tailor their mistakes to the anime would be far more effort than tailoring solo/duet pieces. Also, I could not really tell any difference between the repeated performances of these pieces during the various orchestra rehearsal sessions in the anime. Upon listening to the sound track of the show though, I was shocked to discover that I'd completely underestimated \"Nodame Cantabile\". For example, there're several tracks dedicated to a single section of an orchestral piece, and just listening to the music by itself allowed me to focus and detect some messiness in the performances, but here's the surprising thing - these tracks are all subtly different! They must have been used for the different rehearsal sessions I was referring to! This really is phenomenal, jaw dropping attention to detail. Seems like they've pulled out all the stops when making \"Nodame Cantabile\"... and what a splendid piece of work it turned out to be.",

            "content": "Before watching Your Lie In April, I didn't ever have any interest in anime where the focal point was music. So, with how much I enjoyed that anime, I decided to give Nodame Cantabile a try. From the very first episode, I knew I was going to enjoy it.\r\nStory: As the story mostly revolves around Chiaki's amazing talent as a pianist, violinist, and ultimately his goal of becoming a conductor, I think it was really great to watch his development into the man he wants to become. Nodame, the woman with a wild style of playing the piano is the only person who seems capableof matching Chiaki, in her own way. The development of these two and the supporting characters in this story is very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is pretty good. There's nothing terrible about it, and the attention to detail on all of the instruments is pretty damn impressive. The character art is funny, and decent as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: It's an anime about music, so as expected, the sound is outstanding. All of the OST for the anime is some version of classical music, and then all of the music pieces in competitions etc are a beauty to listen to. I seriously want to go to Orchestra one day now.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Chiaki and Nodame are both great characters with their own aspirations, fears, and backstories. Additionally, there are so many supporting characters with interesting personalities and skills in music that it's pretty difficult to ever find time to grow bored with this series. I'm hoping to these characters return in Nodame Cantabile: Paris-hen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I laughed a lot. Really enjoyed all of the live music presentations, and actually even found myself tearing up listening to how intense some of the music was as well. Definitely, DEFINITELY need to visit an orchestra someday.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A solid 8 for sure. Really good anime series, worth watching for sure.",

            "content": "Lesson 1: Anime\r\nTotal Episodes; 23+1 Summer special. A new (11 episode) season to come October 9th, 2008. (Airing at the moment.)\r\nGenres; Classical Music, Comedy, Slice of life, Romance\r\nSimilar animes with music as a theme are for example 'BECK: Monogolian Chop Squad' and 'Piano no Mori'.\r\nOpening/Ending;\r\nOP- Suemitsu & The Suemith - Allegro Cantabile\r\nAn exciting and mood bringing opening. It starts with the main characters and later shows the scene's with objects or instruments that are involved in the series. It's a colourful and joyful opening song.\r\nED 1- Crystal Kay - Konna ni Chikaku de...\r\nWith the same art as in the opening it has an ordinary endingwith Chiaki the main character and a weird mongoose walking the piano keys.\\n\r\nED 2- Suemitsu &amp; The Suemith &ndash; Sagittarius\\n\r\nAgain, the same art that is colourful and plain. It shows some piano's twirling round with the main characters later on them.\\n\\n\r\nLesson 2: Manga\\n\r\nAuthors; Ninomiya, Tomoko (Story &amp; Art)\\n\r\nChapters; 124 &ndash; ongoing\\n\r\nPublished; July 10th 2001 to &hellip; (Hiatus?! Mangaka had a baby! Cheers!)\\n\r\nSerialization; Kiss\\n\\n\r\nLesson 3: Plot - 9.5/10\\n\r\nThe son of a famous pianist, Chiaki Shinichi is a 3rd year piano student at the Japanese Momogaoka Music Academy and has a dream to become a conductor. He has a passion for classical music, plays the violin and piano wonderfully and can hear the differences between a good or bad musician. One day he meets someone he actually has never seen before. Her name is Noda 'Nodame' Megumi, who is a 2nd year piano student at the same school. He is disgusted by her sloppiness and attitude but fascinated by her playing. Before he even knew it, he is drug into her rhythm. As the story continues, he meets up with more 'weirdo' students and his father's rival, and perverted famous conductor, Stresemann.\\n\\n\r\nLesson 4: Characterization - 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are well thought out and have their own traits. Nodame is a special case and is characterized by her being annoying towards some people, very sloppy and shouting all kinds of phrases like 'gyabo' or 'mukya'. Every character within the series experiences growth, not only in skill, but in character as well. Throughout the series you get enough air time per character to know how they respond to certain events and story development. Expressing emotions and thoughts are shared with the viewer and give a good impression or explanation about the character. Every character is unique in it's own way and has an important role in the series.\\n\\n\r\nLesson 5: Anime animation &amp; Music - 8.5/10\\n\r\nThe animation is plain and simple, not that different from most anime series out there. Scenery, character drawings and animations are very good. Character interaction is greatly done and sometimes gives a humorous effect. The orchestra's playing is well put together, but is lacking mostly, which reduces the enjoyment of that moment or scene where it was the most important. (Definitely improved in Nodame Cantabile: Paris-hen!) The selling point of the series is classical music. If you like classical music you might enjoy the series, but keep in mind that there are other parts of the series that get attention. The music selection is not just limited to famous piano composers but also contains other instrument's composers. It is really thought out and researched. One can actually learn some parts of World music history. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Schubert, Liszt, Stravinsky and Brahms are some of the few composers that are talked about throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nLesson 6: Manga art - 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is clean and understandable, not messy nor over exaggerated. It is mostly focused on the characters interaction between one another, barely any extra art. Buildings, orchestra's and other scenery are well drawn and has a realistic, impressive look. Actions or movements are well shown and give the reader a good idea of what is going on without giving the impression that it is just to fill gaps. The structure and lay out of the manga is flexible and simple to understand. Text bubbles, music notes and other sound-related items are well placed over the series, being correctly used. The cover pages are varied with different characters and multiple instruments. If you see the oldest and newest chapter, you will notice slight to no difference in the drawings.\\n\\n\r\nLesson 7: Personal review - 9.5/10\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile has become one of my favourite series. I strongly recommend it to anyone, even if you dislike the genre slice of life or classical music. The whole theme gives it's own feeling and is pretty unique amongst animes and mangas. The further you get in the series and get to know the characters, the more you wish there was more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nLast Lesson: Overall - 9/10",

            "content": "I thought the overall story was very good, but in the first season I thought the animators were kind of lazy. There were so many static scenes that were only kept moving by the sound. I also thought some shots were reused a lot. Although giving life to classical music could be really hard in an anime that centers on music, I still thought those kinds of scenes bring down an otherwise good anime. But looking at it the other way around, the first season is a good base/set-up for the next two seasons. It showed how good the musicality of the characters are, howimportant music is to them, and maybe not a lot but good enough background checks.  Overall, the anime was fun and consistent. The next two seasons were a whole lot better though, especially the finale. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime (all 3 seasons) was also especially interesting for me because it was the first shoujo/josei anime I\u2019ve noticed (since I\u2019m only noticing these things recently) that it was the male protagonist that narrates the story, hence we can look into his thoughts. There were no annoying musings of the heroine. The heroine was strong and weird. Although she\u2019s somehow completely dependent on the male protagonist, she\u2019s also independent \u2013 really weird. Those stuff adds to the consistency points of the story because it was really impossible to read the heroine\u2019s mind \u2013 that is if there was even something that goes around her head. \\n\\n\r\nThere were also more comedy than romance, but when there is romance, it can really tug your heartstrings. And by telling it from the male point of view who is kind of a tsundere and who doesn\u2019t say much, it\u2019s seriously more effective. \\n",

It took me back to when i was in the orchestra and rekindled my passion for my clarinet! This anime is heart warming,the characters are funny and lovable. The animation style is very soft and detailed. There's a constant background of harmony and peace regardless of what's going on.I'm sure the classical music has a lot to do with that.Just like the soft colour tones and animation style, there are subtle hints of a deeper story.This seasonhas made me want to know more about Nodame and Chiaki characters.The main thing about this anime is that is fun and extremely addictive, after the first few episodes. If You like classical music, witty humour, diverse characters with huge egos all wrapped up in everyday life at a japanese music university,then this is for you.",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile is about a talented male musician who aspires to be a conductor and how his life change when he met a wired female pianist who has unnaturally good piano skills.\r\nThe story was different from your usual music anime as it was more to the classical side. I think that the story is realistic to some extent and it gives a good insight into the music industry.On another note, the romance is not so evident, it does have some but not as much as your high school anime or lovestory. The focus is more on the lives of the two of them and howthey progress in the music industry. But it is still quite captivating thanks to the character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was ok,not the best i've seen but still reasonable,since i'm not so big on the artwork of anime i don't really mind so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was excellent. Not just the opening and ending songs but the pieces played in the anime are very melodious and entrancing.SO if you like classical music this is a must watch for you. Plus they don't play the same pieces all the time like in other music anime, it is usually different for each episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are portrayed extremely well and the flash backs bring out the drama and sentiment in the show, and express the fact that hardship id part of the road to glory and perfection. The character development in this story of both male and female leads is extraordinary and evident. but the lack of focus on the supporting characters makes it a little less realistic and a bit bias,but i guess it was necessary for the character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime had a good deal of comic relief and this made it quite enjoyable, i especially love nodame and her extremely fast speed at playing the piano.The synergy that is displayed between the two character also makes it quite entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nSO if you love classical music or an anime where the characters go through drastic changes with some romance then this anime is for you, but dont keep you hopes high on the romance, but be sure that there is a reasonable amount of drama.",

I mean seriously, just the enjoyment itself is really quite thrilling. But, before I get to the good stuff I'll start to with the weak parts of the anime so I could end with a good note. \r\nI gotta say, the only thing that I didn't like about the anime are the characters. I would say that this anime did a much better job at portraying that genre of \"slice of life\" better than a lot of the anime I'veseen (I've seen a lot, but I haven't reviewed all, yet). But, sometimes it gets carried away. I mean I get that it's anime, but I would have want it to be a little bit more settled, especially when it came down to the part where Nodame high kicks Chiaki. PRICELESS! But she didn't need that big jump because to be honest I jump high, but you gotta be a wickedly high jumper to do that. Though, this DOES NOT affect my thoughts on Nodame, or any of the other characters! Seriously, this anime is just so good!\\n\\n\r\nNow as for the awesomeness of this anime, I can't even begin to tell you how great this anime is. But, here are just a few things I really enjoyed about it. First of all, like I said, the genre part of \"slice of life\" was on the spot. You can feel like it might just happen to anyone, except the part if you're going be like Chiaki... Also Nodame-chan's POV is very mysterious and can be fun to play along because it feels like she's just like any hormonal girl who's in a one-sided love. \\n\\n\r\nOver all a solid 9, still looking for that 10... \\n\\n\r\nUntil then, this is Usa-chan man (BunnyMafia) waving good-bye.\\n",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile is a music anime, centered around music prodigy Chiaki Shinichi and his neighbor, the titular Nodame, Noda Megumi. It spans several years' worth of their lives, starting from mid-university until after graduation and the formation of their plans for adult life.\r\nIt explores the world of classical music institutions and the hubbub surrounding them, and sheds light into how such talented people might find gainful employment, all while developing and interacting characters without too much unnecessary drama.\r\nIt's not a high-school anime by any means. The characters are not high-school kids, and it shows. They are young adults, with their thoughts full of the futureand their plans for it, but still not having lost the drive and luster of youth.\\n\\n\r\nMusic anime are easy to get behind. Unlike other forms of art being used as mediums for such stories, music is probably the easiest to present on an anime series, and it often works to draw people in. Classical music might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I guarantee that even for those people, Nodame Cantabile will be enjoyable, as the series balances the music sections with plot, character advancement and interaction and comedy rather well.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the series hits several of my personal things I enjoy watching. Chiaki, arguably the protagonist, is a capable young man, prodigious but not hilariously, stereotypical ingenius and perfect at everything like you often see on manga/anime. He has his own faults and mistakes that he has to strive to correct, and he does so in a realistic manner and with the help of people around him. He's capable, reasonable, opinionated and flawed. Just my kind of character.\\n\\n\r\nNodame, conversely, is none of those things. Well, except flawed. She balances precariously on the scale of ridiculouslness, with arguably success. She's eccentric; unclean, talented at piano but unorthodox in her way of learning and playing. Still, it works for the story. Nodame and her character play a major role in the story, as much as Chiaki, but her randomness is never pushed into our face as if it's character trait worth admiring, which I respect. Her character arc is arguably more defined than Chiaki's, who knew what he wanted and how to get it. Nodame is troubled, and has to work with some phobias, indecision and bad habits. It all plays out beautifully in the 23 episodes of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, is, as expected, superb. Though a person more educated in classical music would probably pick out a lot more of the subtle differences in the various scenes, there is enough commentary by the characters that we get a pretty good idea of what's going on, and honestly it's just a joy to listen to most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary cast is not weak, but not particularly strong either. We get to follow several somewhat interesting characters and see their progression in the world of music over time, and we are introduced to some interesting families and people, but in the end the secondary cast fails to draw interest without the presence of either of the lead characters in the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is okay. Good, without being particularly groundbreaking. One of my main gripes with the series is that Chiaki is a conductor, but we never actually see him DO any conducting. Just one or two frames with him in a pose and the assumption that he is conducting really, really hard. Conversely, the piano and other instrumental parts are animated a lot better, with details as regarding finger movements, etc.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a good anime with a coherent and well-paced plot, decently animated, with (mostly) mature characters, striving to bring their dreams to fruition against various issues and problems. A touch of drama here and there, an abundance of humor and, most importantly, lots and lots of good music.\\n\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "When I first began this anime and have gone through a couple of reviews, my expectations were high and my reality was low. I began this anime and thought of it very differently and expected it to be annoying, however it turned out to be even better than I expected. However at the time I was turning down many animes and decided to remain devoted to this one- there was something special about it.\r\nThis is not one of your typical stories, in which two beautiful, talented beings fall in love at first sight and live happily ever after. This is a story which develops twodistinct characters, and brings them together in a very weird way. What I liked about Nodame Cantabile is that things never became very intimate. When relationships develop slowly, I feel as if they are much more precious, and that is why I enjoyed this very much. I personally loved Nodame's character development the most. One might think of her as immature and annoying at the beginning, yet her character slowly and steadily compels the audience to fall head over heels for her. She is eccentric, yet fascinating. Meanwhile, Chiaki is a very inspirational role-model. He stays faithful to his goals and remains ambitious and determined, disregarding relationships with others. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I also loved about Nodame Cantabile was the appreciation of music. Although I have not watched many animes yet, I was able to observe that they brought in many great musical pieces and even make me become infatuated with the orchestras. They didn't cut them, but instead took time to create tension and suspense, and show the serious and more passionate side to several characters. \\n\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile also teaches you valuable lessons, as I suppose many great animes tend to do. It manifests the importance of working hard for the things you love, and being persistent. I liked this because it gives the whole anime value and significance, and how the characters approach their struggles made me inspired and I even began going to practice piano again for the past few weeks. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot think of something I disliked about this anime. I enjoyed it thoroughly and there never seemed to be a moment of boredom. The art seemed odd at first, but I didn't mind later after a couple of episodes because of all of the other features. I think that this is an anime for anyone whom loves music, comedy, drama, and -and of course, must have patience. If you have a heart, even a small cold one, give Nodame Cantabile a go.",

            "content": "A total opposite! NODAME CANTABILE (roughly translated as THE GENTLE SONG OF NODAME) is the exact opposite of La Corda D&rsquo;oro. The plot is more well-laid, the characters are realistic and most importantly the realism is totally noteworthy! I simply adore it through and through.\r\nWhat triggers me to watch this anime is when I was browsing for La Carda D&rsquo;oro&rsquo;s review on the internet. And then, one of the reviews mentioned this anime and it is stated that the anime is good. Right after reading that, I downloaded the first 5 episodes of the anime and I have forgotten about them ever since.\r\nYesterday, while Iwas &lsquo;digging into&rsquo; my lappy I just realised that there are 5 episodes of Nodame Cantabile that I have downloaded and I watched it. At first I was a tad sceptical but when I watched them (the episodes) I instantaneously addicted to this anime (what&rsquo;s new?! Heheheh)!\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I love this anime is because it is comical, funny and yet the theme is rather profound and endearing. There is a hint of love and romance however it is exhibited towards the end of the episodes. And the most important of all, the portrayal of the characters is also impeccable and flawless. I adore the portrayal of the protagonist, Chiaki Shinichi. He is portrayed as someone who is musically blessed, frank and rather helpful. However, he is a bit insecure about his 'weaknesses'. The other protagonist, Noda Megumi (Nodame) is the exact opposite of Chiaki however, she complements him in every single way. She is very candid, childlike and driven.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the classical numbers used in this anime are also captivating and mesmerizing. They are Brahms', Mozart&rsquo;s, Beethoven&rsquo;s, Dvor&aacute;k's, Rachmaninoff's, Schubert's, Liszt's and the list goes on. It&rsquo;s a definitely a must-watch anime! BTW, in case you are wondering, 'cantabile' means 'a gentle and singable song'.",

            "content": "I recommend Nodame Cantabile to those who like comedy, classical music and have a certain degree of maturity, as this is a Seinen/J\u00f4sei anime.\r\nNodame\u00b4s Cantabile main characters are Shinichi Chaiki and Noda Megumi (NodaMe:) ), two piano students with completely differents personalities and goals. Chiaki is a perfeccionist, somewhatb insensitive person, who dreams of becoming a conductor, but is afraid of traveling by plane or boat, what leaves him isolated in Japan. Nodame is a cheerful person, infantile, and with great potential, who plays music in he own way (she plays always in Cantabile, that is as if the music is a song, adding andtaking notes to what the music she is playing). Although Nodame is talented she doesn\u00b4t wants to become pro, instead she desires to become a Kindergarten Teacher.She is also Chiaki neighbor and fall in love with him. This is the basis of the story.\\n\r\nThe real history begins after some episodes that introduce minor characters, as Mine(a violoinist), with the arrival of Franz von Stresemann, a famous conductor, who selects Chiaki as assintent conductor of Orchestra S, a recently founded Orchestra with students picked personnaly by Stresemann. Since Stresemann is a playboy who spends his time in clubs, \"chasing skirts\", Chiaki becomes the main conductor of Orchestra S. The next episodes are basically, Chiaki trying to control his perfeccionist nature, sometimes called Demon/Devil Chiaki, a concert performed by Orchestra S and the founding of a new orchestra which is conducted by Chiaki. At the same time, Nodame begins to understand that if she wants to be with Chaiki she must become a pro and began training to a Competition... which lead to a series of events that i can\u00b4t talk in a review since it would be spoiling too much :)\\n\\n\r\nOne strong point of Nodame Cantabile is the soundtrack, especially The excerpts of classical pieces of Mozart,Rachminoff,Listz,Beethoven and Brahams(Ii maybe forgotting some other compositors); the opening song and the first ending are also very good, but the second ending is weaker in my opinion; the OST is also great, contributing to the mood.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point is the artwork, on which I must say that I as surprised with the work that as been done with the finger moviments and hand positions of the characters while playing the music.\\n\\n\r\nThe Third strong point is the comical way in which he series is presented and the character development of Chiaki, Nodame and Stresemann.\\n\\n\r\nBut since perfection in this world is rare, or even non-existent, Nodame Cantabile also has some weak points. From those weak points there is oneespeccially annoying, which would be the non-development of some interesting supporting characters and plots, like the relationship between Mine and Kiyora. \\n\\n\r\nTaking everything in account, Nodame Cantabile is a anime that will certainly make you laugh with his special humour, but will also charm you with loots of really,really good classical music and a romantic history who focus in the relationships between the several characters.",

            "content": "Possibly the most appropriate anime for (elitist) classical music fans - if you are one of them, this anime will disappoint less than other animes involving classical music. Additionally, if you are a casual listener of music, this anime is a wonderful medium in which you can slowly develop your appreciation of classical music. \r\nThe one thing that sets it aside from most is the effort put into animating the musicians as they are playing the music - they are very accurate in mimicking where performers' hands and fingers should be when they are performing the pieces.\r\nThe only quip that one might have is whena performance is praised, that it can be difficult to find what might be so significant about that performance that generates such a reaction from its audience. At least in the real world we have several classical musicians vying to make the concert stage, but the pure subjectivity of music means that just being able to achieve some kind of success is much more difficult than the anime suggests.\\n\\n\r\nThe uniqueness of the female protagonist is certainly a striking factor that gives the anime its appeal, since it represents an extreme example of one dedicated to classical music in a very different way, in contrast to a typical hardworking and committed male protagonist. Their clashing but also their interaction with each other is a central theme of the series and its sequels as they continually move forward.\\n\\n\r\nTo any casual viewers: this is a great way to slowly include classical music into your listening collection, as often a colouristic or historical description of the pieces are included, allowing one to really get a feel for and understand what classical music seeks to express.",

I can't help feeling a little lone.\r\n   In these five days, Nodame Cantabile made part of my life and I must say it's the first time that it happens with an anime. \r\n  It's almost as if I was there when Chiaki met the heroine for the first time when she was playing Beethoven's Piano Sonata No.8 or when he played Rachmaninov in the school's concert.\r\n I often found myself in Chiaki's apartment, where Nodame plays her passionate music whilewaiting for the dinner. And I laugh so much at her funny, weird personality that irritates our short-tempered main character.\\n\r\n For the last five days, I was practicing really hard on piano, trying to get in their level and play with them.\\n\\n\r\n The key of this anime, for me, was not the music, nor the plot (though they were REALLY good). For me, the characters' personality is what makes you to enter in their world. While it alternates between the comedy of the graduate student's life and the perfectionism in the world of classical music, the anime will make you feel as if you make part of the story (or at least it feels like it to me).\\n\\n\r\n But the most difficult to accept is that it's over. I will no more travel to Momogaoka College of Music to watch Nodame and Chiaki playing Mozart together. But I know that when I calm down,  the days we spent together will always be in my memory, Nodame's music will not leave me so early.\\n\\n\r\n That is what Nodame Cantabile represents to me.\\n",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile Review (all three seasons)\r\noverall: 7.75\r\nPlot(8): Cantabile\u2019s events aren\u2019t ever too jarring or spectacular, or particularly suspenseful, but the story and sequencing of events are used well to interact with the characters. Relationships and inner worlds are developed using the plot, and vice versa, which is satisfying in the end. In addition, the plot leads the viewer on to the next episode without being overly \u201ccliffy\u201d. Cantabile displays a realistic portrayal of life and its happenings though the story. The plot also serves as a good framework for the overall narratives that are woven through Cantabile.\r\nstory: 7.5 interaction/support of characters: 9 narrative: 8\r\nCharacters(9): Characterdevelopment is where this series shines. There was a deeper look given to most characters, and many characters where developed even without a peek into their thoughts through the goings-on of the episodes. The struggles and solutions each character went through felt real and, as a student, very relatable. Almost nothing felt contrived or heavy-handed. Most, in a sense, felt like \u201creal\u201d people. Nodame in particular goes through huge changes. One very good point of the character development is that for most characters in the spotlight, the various facets of their individual persons was shown. No one is just a cheery fool all the time, though that may be what they default to most of the time. The characters and their interactions felt realistic yet still maintained a degree of originality.\\n\\n\r\ndevelopment: 10 originality: 7 realistic-ness: 8.5\\n\\n\r\nExecution(9): A bit of a vague category, but here I judge everything else. The sound in this musically entrenched anime was good\u2013not once did I feel it detracted from the show. In fact, the arrangements of all the different pieces of classical music are delightful. I find myself really liking classical music now, whereas before I only tolerated the most famous pieces despite my musical inclinations. Well, that or just listening to metal versions of Mozart and the like. The voice acting is on par. Cantabile does many things well, and it all comes together in an inescapable harpoon that pierces your heart and reels you in. It is subtle, yet incredibly enchanting. All in all, Cantabile does \u201clive up to its potential\u201d almost always, even if it\u2019s in ways the viewer does not expect. I would say that while the \u201creluctant boy meets overexcited girl\u201d starting point is not exactly original, it doesn\u2019t detract from the wonderful execution of their romance. To be honest, my only qualm with Cantabile is the somewhat loose ending of the series\u2013rushed and out of character when one considers the excellent episodes that preceded it. I\u2019m not opposed to an \u2018open\u2019 ending, but it was almost like a preview episode\u2026in my opinion even if one leaves the ending open, it should at least be tied up a little more with the two most important characters, both individually and together.\\n\\n\r\nsound: 10 \u201cpotential\u201d: 8.5 originality: 8\\n\\n\r\nArt(4.75): To be honest, I avoid a lot of anime because of the art. I\u2019m an artist myself, so I guess I\u2019m just strict when it comes to animation and illustration. While I loved the series, I cannot give Cantabile a good art score. However, in light of what I just said, this speaks to the strength of the plot, characters, and execution of Cantabile. I absolutely blazed through it all despite the painful art at times. What is so painful about it? The entire first season lacks animated orchestral shots. An orchestra\u2019s movement is part of their presentation; it actually hurts Cantabile when all we see are stills every time people are playing instruments together. They hardly animate the conductors, even. There are only shots\u2013well coordinated shots\u2013of piano playing, and usually just arms/body + piano, or fingers+keys. When it\u2019s another instrument, they use mediocre CGI. Or stills. There are so many stills it feels like a slideshow at points, and gets quite tiresome. The second season is a step up only because they use CGI to animate the orchestras, but due to the CGI\u2019s conspicuousness the viewer is left wanting still. If Cantabile was animated like Shingeki no Kyojin, it would be even better than it is now in every aspect. But it\u2019s not. Unfortunately, the anime medium is also only used in trivial ways most of the time. Cantabile could easily have been a TV show(which I\u2019m pretty sure it is). Overall, the art detracts from the show when music is involved. While the art is not necessarily bad, due to the musical nature of the show it ends up detracting from everything else.\\n\\n\r\nsupport of plot: 5 use of medium: 5 addition to show: 4",

            "content": "A slice of life, romantic comedy at heart...but this series does so much more than what other series in this genre strive to be.  An immensely popular series in Japan, this music anime is a must watch for everyone, even those uninterested in this genre or musical animes.\r\nStory:  From the start, this series sucks you in with it's simple yet deep story with intriguing characters and nice touches of comedy.  The comedic aspect of this series never seems to be forced or out of place, but complements the story and characters amazingly well.  Too many animes nowadays spoon feed you thecomedy when it's unnecessary to it's demise, but Nodame Cantabile has the right amount of comedy all at the right places.  When it's serious, you are touched emotionally and when it's funny, you are literally LOL'ing.  The story is simple...about 2 utterly opposite kinds of music students who meet eachother and how their relationship evolves.  Through the ups and downs, you are always hooked and invested emotionally in this series and are always cheering for the characters.  Sometimes simple is the best.  A whimsical, relatable series which does not disappoint at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  To be honest, the art is nothing special...at least for the 1st season.  That's not to say it's not well drawn.  The characters are all nicely drawn and the environment while simple, gets the mood across.  By today's standards, this anime is average.  However, the emphasis they place on the accurate depictions of the musical instruments is amazing.  In the 2nd season, when they show the musicians playing their instruments, the movements that they make are life like.  The animations of the characters playing the piano are fully fledged out in most cases and it is awe inspiring to see that they put so much work into these parts.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Amazing!  Many music anime fail to actually implement music into their anime to its full potential.  But Nodame Cantabile does...and does so beautifully.  Even if you're not a classical music fan, this anime will turn you into one.  The scenes with the music are nicely done to immerse you into the moment.  People who play instruments will particularly enjoy this and inspire you. The voice acting is top notch as well as there are some famous actors that voice the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  What differentiates a truly great anime from the average anime are the characters.  This is even more true for slice of life animes, for the characters are what drives the scenes and the whole series.  I find many animes nowadays to just be fan service and utterly lacking in character originality and development.  Not the case for Nodame Cantabile.  From the beginning you find yourself caring and wondering more and more about the 2 lead characters Chiaki and Nodame.  Both are flawed, immature, naive characters...yet there is something admirable about them that makes you care.  The development of these two are nicely paced and never seem unnatural.  Never before in a series have I found myself wanting these two to be together as a couple.  Chiaki is a strong lead character...Nodame likewise is a very interesting, strong character.  Neither is the stereotypical \"damsel in distress\" kind of character where one saves the other..both are solid leads coping with their own issues and trying to get through life.  The relationship between them is a give and take, with both contributing an equal amount to their development.  \\n\r\nPerhaps one downside are the supporting characters.  In this series, they aren't fleshed out as much as your would like them to be.  The other characters' developments and relationships don't really matter much, and while they are likable...in the end they don't really matter.  The supporting characters are exactly what they are meant to be...just support Chiaki and Nodame's story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a great anime and a must watch for everyone.  The relationship between Chiaki and Nodame is very refreshing.  If you really hate classicial music, then perhaps some scenes might seen a little too drawn out.",

            "content": "Nodame cantabile is a wellspring of fun and excitement. Chiaki Shinichi plays the Tsukkomi, the straight man, keeping the story relevant and the symbol to which we can relate to. Noda Megumi plays the Boke, the fool, entertaining us from start to finish. The duo creates an almost perfect balance of dramatic exchange and comedic relief for the series. That being said, I felt that Noda Megumi was lacking as a character as well as relevance to the plot.\r\nThe plot is driven by Chiaki's desire to become an aspiring conductor. Chiaki makes for the perfect medium for the plot, as there is never a dullmoment in his life. Chiaki might be a genius, but he works twice as hard to get what he wants. While Chiaki has his fair share of successes, he also has his share of failures. I truly felt anxiety when Chiaki was faced with a challenge. And whenever Chiaki pulled through I was there rooting for him. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough, I enjoyed the simple premise, However, I could not find myself enjoying this series until after episode 5. It was a chore to get through the beginning, as it felt like each episode was simply throwing a Boke at us until one of them stuck. Nodame Cantabile's attempt at giving character development to minor characters was mostly unwarranted and misplaced.The time could've been used to build Megumi's character rather than those minor characters. Megumi's engagement with Chiaki were mostly comic relief while her relevance to the plot were essentially nil. Megumi's role could've been filled with basically any other girl that was already swooning over him. Later in the season, they introduce Megumi to a plot solving ability that is never revisited. While it does keep Megumi relevant, it is by all means cheap.\\n\\n\r\nThe series has some beautifully painted backgrounds. The backgrounds such as Chiaki's apartment or the piano rooms being revisited gives the impression of being there. At a glance, Ninomiya/Shimamura's character designs look simple. However, the casual clothes they wore reflected their personality and vice-versa. The animation on the other hand lacks vibrance. The energy from the events stem mostly from the character themselves and the actions they take. 3D instruments make up for time but are truly noticeable contrasted by the water colored  character and backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nTomokazu Seki truly encompasses the character of Chiaki. His energetic outbursts to the ridiculous characters make him just as funny, if not funnier, than his comedic counterparts. His nonchalant speech displays how charming he his. Even more so when he speaks with melancholy and frustration. I never thought I could hear Ayako kawasumi sound so outrageous. If Noda Megumi's speech wasn't already crazy enough, for fans of Fate/Stay Night like me, to hear Saber scream out phrases like \"Gyabon\" or \"Bukya\" is drop dead hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun watching Nodame Cantabile. Once I got passed the first 5 episodes, I couldn't find a good spot to stop watching. To me it spells that the story progresses at a reasonable pace. At the time of writing this review, I've finished watching all 3 seasons. I truly feel that the first season was the weakest of the 3. I highly recommend people to watch through Nodame Cantabile because I believe that the true story begins in Paris.",

It is a refreshing and unique style of romance because it has no formalities. Noda Megumi and Chiaki Shinichi did not put labels to their relationship, they just go with the flow of romance but it shows through the story. The way it is narrate is very different from what I watch from other romance anime, it came from the perspective of a guy since most of romance narration begun in a heroine. Even if you don'thave a background in classical music the anime explains it simple and you will not be bored. The characters are lovable and introduced well, even the extras. Noda Megumi is one of the unpredictable characters I've watched. I like the naive, cheerful and outgoing character of Nodame. The art of characters and scenery is classic and simple, but the anime did it best to make a 3D for playing the piano and conducting. The seiyuu did a quality voice acting, they did a good work to give life to the characters, especially to the gyabo and mukya of Nodame. The opening and closing song is also good. Overall, I am entertained in this anime. I especially like how it ends. I recommend this for the people who start watching anime.",

            "content": "This anime comes from Studio J.C. Staff and with director Kenichi Kasai. Both were involved with the successful slice of life anime Honey and Clover. In terms from a general perspective, both of those anime share similarities. However, it is in fact how great and developed the characters are which makes the difference in an anime like this from being great such as Honey and Clover or terrible like Nanaka 6/17 (2003).\r\nNodame Cantabile is a story about two piano students. One is the immensely talented Chiaki Shinichi who is seemingly great at everything music from violin to piano to even conducting. The other is thebubbly free spirit in Noda Megumi with the nickname Nodame. She is the crux of the show while the story does follow Chiaki and his journey towards becoming a great conductor while in college, competitions, and putting together fantastic performances. After a few instances occur at the start, Chiaki is somehow always drawn to Nodame. She on the other hand immediately falls in love with him. Thus, with two polar opposite personalities, creates very good comedy from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not just Chiaki and Nodame as characters that mold the show. Even the vast amount of side characters come together very well. They all have incredible chemistry with each other and the story somehow incorporates the development of each characters goals throughout. However, as with a large cast, there were numerous and almost too many characters that would either contribute nothing, or have such a bit role they quickly come and go and float away. It was fairly often a character would come, get a bit of backstory and perspective from their view and then never seen again after that episode. \\n\\n\r\nNodame as a character is fantastic and has all the proper development in the world. Her struggle to find why she enjoys the piano to overcoming past demons is why she is the shows best character and the viewer just cannot help but root for her and her happiness. Chiaki on the other hand suffers from typical male anime personality. He is perfect in almost every way from his enormous family given talent to even being rich. His one character flaw is even solved way too conveniently for the sake of the story.\\n\\n\r\nComedy hits very well and even better than in Honey and Clover because this show never tries to be totally serious. Naturally the music is littered with fantastic classical pieces, but the CG is all over the place and utterly jarring at times. Nodame Cantabile is a fantastic music anime with everything there for an enjoyable experience.\\n",

The girl cat, Nodame is a fun & goofy piano player who jokes around all the time but has a very genuine heart and love for piano\u2014 just as Chiaki does. \r\nIf you asked me to give you a reason why I love Nodame Cantibile I wouldn't be able to give you just one. The story was relaxing and playful, but it could alsobe serious at times. & when it would get serious... Boy would it hit deep. There is a lot of comedy and there are a lot of different types of characters who keep the show interesting. The comedy isn't so much so that it undermines some of the more serious moments though, as I've seen that happen in other anime before. \\n\\n\r\nNodame Cantibile will take you on a ride and you'll follow Chiaki and Nodame as they have to overcome obstacles and face new challenges and get over their fears. Whether it's sacrificing something for someone you love or taking the leap of faith and not looking back.. The characters go through a lot and you get to follow along on their journey of self discovery. Great music and musical performances accompanied by colorful harmonies of flowers and energy that was just amazing fun to watch and listen to.\\n\\n\r\nA must watch for lovers of romance, music, and goofy comedy\u2014 but it is a show that will have it's moments & will tug at your heartstrings...

And I would like to say that i do not regret doing so :) and now it is one of my top 5 favourite anime as of 2011.\r\nOne thing I loved the most was the comedy genre which had me laughing atleastonce in each episode. Nodame just had me laughing so hard with her randomness and every time Chaika would have to displine her - LMHO (Laughed My Head Off). \\n\\n\r\nBut on a more serious note, the slice of life genre I would say was mainly potrayed with Nodame and Chaika's relationship. We see it develop as Chaika kinda becomes Nodame's tutor which is even more hilarous because of they less compatibility. Together with the other parts of the story, you just can not fail to enjoy some part of the anime; whether it be the comedy, romance, slice of life or the classical music aspect.",

This is my first review, so please bear with me as I try to sort out my thoughts.\r\nNodame Cantabile is a very enjoyable and humourous slice of life anime.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in classical music and piano. It is inspiring and motivational, showing that hard work can bring you anywhere.\r\nThe soundtrack in this anime is excellent. It is a case where I find the adaptation is actually better than the manga simply because the manga lacks music. The soundtrack really brings the entire anime to life if you area fan of classical music. For me, the animation was not the best (because it was made in 2007), but the backgrounds and character designs were well done. The characters are lovable and quirky. The main characters Chiaki and Nodame adventure through hardships and roller-coasters of laughs, joy, as well as sorrow and tears. It is a beautiful anime with so much emotion. I find myself laughing one moment and then in tears the next.\\n\\n\r\nI was drawn to this series because I love music and have been learning piano for years. I was pleasantly surprised at the outcome and truly adore this series. What I love about Nodame Cantabile is how relatable it is from a music student's perspective. I feel like I really understand the characters and their feelings throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nI know this anime is old, but if you haven't seen it yet,  please give it a try!",

            "content": "This is about the story of a person who knows absolutely nothing about classical music (and who constantly listens to electronic music) and his journey with this magical series known as Nodame Cantabile.\r\n***************** Overall ********************\r\nIt has been a good 9 years since the production of this anime, it is a long time indeed, but there is just something about this anime that I cannot fully explain, in a good way. Normally, classical music only appear in anime series when the MC enters the house of his rich friend, or when characters with high social status appear. In other words, classical music becomes the thing thatcreates a distance between the viewer and these characters (or surroundings). Words like extravagant, over-the-top, infinite wealth often hover around this genre of music in terms of its usage. However, with this series, these pieces, one after another, is used to communicate with the viewers. These characters are not your prince and princesses, they resonate somewhere within you. Often, they fill your heart with warmth. Classical music, it has seem, became more like a window through which we can escape into our imaginations and feelings. The previous notions I had about them being cold, and perhaps superficial, has faded away.\\n\\n\r\nSo then why should you give up some of your time for these 24 episodes? \\n\\n\r\nIt is quite simple, really. It has been quite some time since I last find myself immersed in a series that is neither overly rushed, nor overly boring due to its length. In fact, it almost appears as if these 24 episodes have the effect of 50 episodes in some other series. Less action and round-the-bush drama, and more subtlety and good story telling. This subtlety is in terms of character growth, character development and the conveying of the message behind this series. If you want to peacefully enjoy a series that will still somehow manage to send chills down your spine and warm your heart, this is honestly quite the perfect series for you.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, this series delivered something rarely ever delivered by other series: actually impacting the viewers with music, and music alone. No need to fear, there is no 30 minutes concerts in here, but just a couple of minutes every once in  a while. These couple of minutes, however, is enough to make you appreciate classical music so much more, and for you to immerse yourself in some epic pieces that has lived on for decades, if not centuries.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, behind these pieces, the series carry a few messages that I find quite inspirational.\\n\\n\r\n***************** Life Lessons?? *******************\\n\\n\r\nFirst of: just be you. In this series, we are introduced to many different and unique characters. They may be (very) weird, but somehow, you can still relate to them. The message here is: you really don't have to be the best at everything to be the best of yourself. As much as Chiaki is very much successful thanks to his (super duper) high ability in playing the piano, violin and also conducting, I dare argue that Megumi, in her own way, is just as impressive a character. And even though she is really bad at being neat, or at cooking, she manages to find happiness is what she does and what she likes: playing the piano. Chiaki, on the other hand, only manages to realize this thanks to Stresemann (when he told Chiaki to just enjoy playing music during performances instead of worrying too much).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is where character development really kicks in. Throughout the series, Megumi slowly comes to terms with her ability. It is a process of recognition. Since the beginning, she already knew that she learns particularly fast by ears, but has yet to recognize her incredible skills. By the end of the series, she agrees to try her best to enter a school in Paris. However, unlike Chiaki, I feel that Megumi does not aim or ultimately want to be the best in the world. Instead, she came to terms with her skills and has accepted that she is a very gifted pianist (thanks to both her talent and hard work). Hence, her agreement to want to study abroad is more about wanting to discover how far her skills and hard work can take her, and not about chasing a dream. Of course, it is also because Chiaki is going to Europe as well. But unlike Chiaki, even if she is not chasing the sun, she is just as strong and impressive. The moral of the story? If you fear being too unrealistic (or being let down by your hopes) to want to be the best, try believing in your own ability and work up from there. At least, that is what I took away from this series. \\n\\n\r\n************** Romance *******************\\n\\n\r\nAs far as relationships in this series go, it takes quite the unique direction. What can I say...this series is a lot more real. Say bye bye to the cliches of your ordinary series, and hello to more.....ordinary relationship developments?! This series feature a very unlikely couple (to quote Misty Chronexia) but progresses their chemistry and closeness really smoothly. This series allows us to see how, slowly but surely, their fate, lives and future becomes intertwined with one another. It is like seeing a pair of dancers slowly becoming one. I am not really good with words, but I will say this much: it is awesome, and you will sincerely want to support them :)\\n\\n\r\n************** Some last comments ***************\\n\\n\r\nThis series feature quite the daily-life-type plot. However, the characters and music of this series is what makes it so special, as if telling us that there is always a way to make out everyday lives special and interesting as well. Its art is really good in my opinion for a series that is about to celebrate its first decade. It really is not disappointing at all. Sound? Well, do I really have to answer this?! Very good, of course. This combination gives rise to a very enjoyable series which I highly recommend if you want a peaceful (yet not slow or boring) and solid series.\\n\\n\r\nPS: I am giving classical music a try and am listening to Brahms as I write this. I am honestly surprised that I would one day enlighten my ears with this genre, considering that I listened to electronic music usually. It just speaks to how impressive this series is! \\n",

            "content": "\"The indications of the maestro, should be subtle and at the same time great.\" - Chiaki \r\nNodame Cantabile can be summed up in the above phrase: simple and great. In addition to a romantic comedy, it's a story about music and people. It\u00b4s how wonderful this art can act in someone's life. This is what the work is all about. A good story with good characters wrapped in classical music. Soundtracks go without saying. Do I need to quote the geniuses of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, Chopin and other masters of music? Another point that deserves attention is the realism of the anime regarding the lifeof a musician. The difficulties, the study, the dream of a career. All very well addressed during the course of the story. Even cartoon comedy works well here. The discipline of Chiaki and the spontaneity of Nodame bring a good dynamic in scene, the relationship being a fundamental and very fun point in the plot.\\n\r\nMy only caveat is about economic animation. I understand for the sake of cost, letting the music play while the transition of images occurs is acceptable, but I really wish I had seen more of the instruments played on the scene. However, this does not detract from the brilliance and merit of the work. Nodame Cantabile is like classical music: simple and great.",

TBH THIS SHOW DOES A OK GOOD JOB OF PUTTING ENJOYMENT OF SOMETHING VS WORK IN PERSEPCTIVE. they definitely don't capitalize on it enough, but nodame's character is basically all about \"why should i play if it's not fun?????\" and that's so neat!!!! that's also a huge issue in literature, w/ the literary fiction vs genre fiction debate. anyway, if u have time, watch it, it's a decent commitment.  ONLY GIVING A TEN FOR NODAME THE OTHER CHARACTERS I DO NOT CARE ABOUT AT ALL NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.",

            "content": "First impression of the anime is an arrogant character with a monkey tailing him confessing her love all over but as you get past that the beautiful music comes to light with a nice story and outshines all the annoyance. \r\nThe story is well made although in some ways it might feel like you have to go over the first wall and go through some episodes before you get the real feel for it. At least that was how i felt as i watched it. It has a good pace and doesn't try to drag something too long but at the same time it doesn'ttry to rush things that shouldn't be rushed. Combined with the rich musical story that comes through as you hear about different pieces it makes you enjoy it even more. The story makes you want to know how far everything can get and makes you want to listen to the next piece of music that comes with it. \\n\\n\r\nIn this anime its not strange that the sound or music is what brings it up to the greatest height. Not only do we here one or two instruments but we here an entire orchestra filled great music from all kinds of composers. As i said earlier the story you get from some of the pieces adds to this and makes it even more enjoyable to listen to. And the music isn't always one or the other. Its an variation of all kinds from the most enjoyable to the saddest ones. \\n\\n\r\nSo to our main actors in this anime and First is Noda Megumi. At first some might be annoyed and think what am i even seeing but its her musical abilities and her sometimes interesting personality that makes it fun watching her as she aims around hoping to find out what she wants with her studies. \\n\r\n2nd is our male main character chiaki shinshi who at first sounds like a snob who things most people around him is either mediocre or just suck in general. Although in his case he got the talent and effort to back his words up although hes a weird character at times. \\n\r\nThe combination of the two main characters is sometimes weird so if someone asks me what is even happening between those two then i frankly cant say one or the other. Although thats the first impression it gets better as both characters shows how they rely on the other although they might not do so on consciously. There is a hidden beauty in that relaitonship that is sometimes rare to find although somtimes it gets too much and i found myself irritated mostly at Noda or nodame but also at chiaki. \\n\\n\r\nSo for me this is a very classical anime in every sence of the word. Its not without flaws but the music and the well done serious and good sides keeps coming up whenever you feel you want to despair over the idiocy that this anime shows at times. I loved the music story , i loved the music so that made up for an anime that at times i was afraid was becoming a manzai ( comedy duo). \\n\\n\r\nOverall i thought it was a very good anime but with flaws that crept up. Not only small flaws but flaws that almost made me want to not watch it. Example being as said earlier the stupidity of the main characters and sometimes feeling like i watch a circus performance for than a music anime intended to show classical music. Those reasons are why i gave it a 8. It leans on a 9er but its far away from in my opinion to be called a masterpiece. If your looking for an anime that has classical music in its almost purest form i highly recommend this anime although with its flaws its still an anime i would recommend to anyone with an interest in classical music. Just be ready that there will be times were you think if it gets too much then just remember the music that comes and it will be fine.",

            "content": "First of all, I never write reviews. I read them religiously though so that I can avoid animes that are a waste of time. Today I am writing because I am so upset with the high ratings of this anime.\r\nThis may be biased, but honestly, I was on a romance spree and I happened to find this anime in that \"category\". After reading reviews - I decided to give it a try (though I did not like the art style right off the bat).\r\nI adored \"Your lie in April\" though I am not a huge fan of musical animes, I bawled my eyes out forthat one.  It opened my horizons to the possibilities of music based anime. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, this anime ruined it for me.\\n\\n\r\nIf I wanted to watch an Orchestra online, I would go and do so. This was listening to classical music and seemingly recycled freeze frames of them playing over it. Boring! But I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt so I watched it until the end. I WANTED ROMANCE, DAMN IT. And it gave me a LITTLE something in the last episode but BARELY.  The music was beautiful, though classical is not my music taste, I can still appreciate it.  I just wish they added more story and less scenes of them \"playing\". \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a romance fix, it wasn't funny and it really just drowned on. If you are someone looking for a good romantic anime - Lovely Complex had me squealing~  (though that anime also had its downfalls, it was hilarious and made my heart race and... they kiss, it was majestic). \\n\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile was far from exciting and I wish I didn't watch it as it was 20 something episodes. Life = wasted.\\n\\n\r\nBut at least it's still not as bad as Chobits.",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile review (mild spoilers)\r\nThe Plot:\r\nThe plot is very weak because it's like picking up a comic where Batman is fighting the Joker and that's it,  we know that Batman wants to stop the Joker and put him in Arkham but we don't know the full story and it's a little weak on it's own. \r\nWhat I Like:\r\n-The Animation, the animation is very good, I don't what to say other than \"I like it\"\r\n-The Use of Classical, sounds weird I know but hear me out, instead of making their own fully original soundtrack, they used classical music for setting the tone, wether for comedyor drama they use classical music which is good in an anime about classical music. \\n\r\n-How it Revolves Around an Orchestra, it revolves around a whole orchestra and classical music as a whole not just one or two instruments.\\n\r\n-Two Characters, I only really like Chiaki and Mine. Chiaki grew from someone who was really unlikable for the first 6 episodes to someone I actually like but when he slips up, while realistic, makes him slightly less likable and Mine was enjoyable since the 3rd episode.\\n\r\n-The Sound, the whole sound design in general is very good.\\n\r\nWhat I Don't Like:\\n\r\n-The Stills, the animation is good but underused, in the orchestra performances they use stills, it gets better in the later eps but I still think the amount of stills are a problem.\\n\r\n-Most Characters, besides Chiaki and Mine, all the other characters are unlikable or annoying. Nodame started to get development at ep 15 but she is ultimately still annoying.\\n\r\n-The Plot, it isn't really that interesting, it doesn't really have a reason to keep me interested other than Chiaki who took 6 episodes to become likable. Chiaki does have a goal but even then it's not enough to keep me interested.\\n\r\n-How Much I Understand, because Nodame Cantabile is about conducting, it should teach me enough so I understand what the character is doing but not so much it feels like a textbook, Nodame Cantabile does neither, I came out with the same amount of knowledge as I had going in, the worst part about it is that I learnt that there is an instrument called a Oboe that you have to make the reed for but I didn't learn anything about conducting.\\n\\n\r\nIt's strange, I have listed more positives than negatives but I don't like it, it's well made which is why it's a 7 but I just don't like it personally.\\n\r\nI would say there's nothing interesting but I stayed till the end so I like to think of it like a snack: there isn't anything to fill you up or make you feel satisfied but it sustains you until dinner.\\n",

            "content": "How to describe the first season of this series?\r\nWell, if we go ahead and check my overall result, then it is a Good show.\r\nNow, normally, when pointed to make a review, anybody's initiative is to give the \"essence\" of the product. Somehow, trying to amuse the reader, without giving a full taste of it, or finding a strongly resourceful way to prove it is actually awful and, of course, during the whole experience, the reviewer didn't connect positively, so the same will happen to you. Still, the chance gets to anybody. Being said, there are reasons to love, like, or just show straight hate regardingthis.\\n\r\nDo you know the formula of most sports anime? Create interaction between characters, exhibiting how good the sport actually is by making it look complex through a series of challenges presented as if anybody in the game had superpowers, progressing and evolving alongside the story. Nodame (Anime) is similar, believe it or not, but has a more realistic vibe to it. No, there is no such thing as crazy artwork to support a confront - there are none. What does exist are musical performances, and the music really does the trick. What about the complex exploration of music? Well, the first step to understand that is the location of the action. The characters play music as students in a University. Also, they have been studying music for a few years there. So, not only do you follow mature people (not that much, unfuckingfortunately), they aren't playing just for fun. It is not a \"Sorry, I played the wrong note. Hahaha.\" case. Here, things are serious (not that much - anime has had its horrible clich\u00e9s for a long extension, now). This complex state is developed, thanks to these components, by different pieces, the search of perfection, musical theory and the moving road of life (you need to remember: it is also a romance story). In the end, music is the cause, the dilemma, yet the fascinating thing that will make you want to get closer to its foundations.\\n\r\nThe other good side is the comedy (more mature - still a somewhat childish, though), the drama between characters and their inner-self, as well as the fresh way time, places, situations are explored, something a bit uncommon in this industry's achievements - here, a procedure more honest (sometimes). But this may also be a bad news - every time a new take is done regarding anything, there are always mixed emotions.\\n\r\nThe sound is another part to be careful about. Most of what you will hear are shortened versions of classical and neoclassical music. Orchestra and piano may not be your thing...\\n\r\nLast thing to report, well... is the story. During the streaming time you probably won't have a problem with it. But, once finished, you will look back and say to yourself \"Anime...\".\\n\r\nConcluding, Nodame Cantabile isn't about what you accomplish. It is about the unknown paths you take in life.\\n",

The characters are fantastic, have great chemistry, and feel realistic - even though they can be over-the-top at times. There is representation of multiple sexualities, and even a trans (ish? maybe?) character.\r\nThen Stresemann is introduced. Boob-grabbing, womanizing Stresemann. The plot and character chemistry all go down from there, unfortunately. The anime became more plot-based, rather than character based, from there on out. So it wasn't very satisfying for me.\r\nI loved the realistic art style of the characters (if I had started up just one more anime to find itoverloaded with moe, I swear to god). Unfortunately, however, the orchestral scenes themselves were very flat. They were often just still frames and weird pans of abstract art. You can see the budget.\\n\\n\r\nBut those first few episodes. They redeem everything.\\n\\n",

I loved the art, I don't always see anime that looks like that, but it made me want to get out my sketchbook.  Characters are their own individuals with their own problems and how they get through it is overall enjoyable.  Nodame is just one the most amazing characters I haveever seen, it's hard not to like her at all!  Overall this is one that you have got to see.  Now I want to go see an actual live orchestra :)",

            "content": "I just finished this anime and I felt a real pressing need to review it right away. It's about an arrogant but truly talented pianist and violinist named Chiaki whom, due to childhood circumstances, is unable to travel abroad to pursue his music. He remains in grad school in the hopes of one day being able to be a conductor for an orchestra. He meets an unruly but gifted pianist named Noda Megumi (Nodame for short) who happens to be his next door neighbour and a student in the same university. This hilarious and breathtaking anime goes into the story of their relationship and thedevelopment of their talents as musicians, as well as the friends and colleagues they meet along the way. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is my first music-centered anime and I must say it was captivating. It shows the hard work, perseverance, discipline and passion of musicians in a very realistic but also humorous way. Not once did I ever find myself dosing off or distracted. The storytelling was effective without being flashy or unrealistic, which I really appreciated. It did not need a heavy amount of drama or comedy elements to make it captivating. I also really appreciated the ending, as everything tied together very nicely. If this was a single season only I still would have rated it highly but because there are more seasons, I believe it deserves a perfect score. I am looking forward to SO MUCH MORE. If you enjoy stories such as Skip Beat, where a character is underestimated but has immense hidden talent, you will thoroughly enjoy watching Nodame. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art to me was adequate in most areas but what made me give it a 9/10 was the animation/drawing of the instruments. When the instruments were being played (particularly the violin and the oboe) they looked so real I felt as if I could reach into the screen and touch them. This made the performance scenes that much more enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 11/10\\n\r\nIf it was possible to score as such I would. The music in this anime is absolutely breathtaking. There were multiple moments of awe and teary eyes watching and listening to the characters perform. I expected a lot from a music anime but it went above and beyond my expectations....It really made classical music seem romantic and exciting but also cool and kind of hipster too :P. It seriously increased my appreciation for the arts. Ohhh and the opening theme is very catchy as well :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe main characters of Nodame and Chiaki were developed just the right amount for the story they were telling. I loved both of their personalities, especially in combination as they make a great duo. What I really appreciated was the development of many supporting characters. They might not have spent a lot of time with them but at the end as a viewer, I believed and shared each of their passions for their craft after seeing their characters unfold. I also really appreciated the different personalities of the characters. The main and supporting characters all had something that made them unique, which also helped me appreciate their musical performances. What I appreciated the most was the emphasis that as talented as any of these individuals seemed, it came with hard work, even with Nodame (as gifted as she is). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 \\n\r\nThere is not much more I can say about this anime without being repetitive. It was a joy to watch; really amplifying my love for music but also really making me care about the characters. I am looking forward to watching the next 2 seasons and reviewing those as well. This is definitely a unique anime worth watching and I believe it has a little something for everyone.",

            "content": "If you've ever played a musical instrument you'll love this anime.\r\nNodame Cantabile has so many things going for it, even with a story you've heard many times before. \r\nMain protagonist Chiaki has always dreamed of becoming a conductor and studying under his idol Viera. After a terrifying plane ride to his mother in Japan, Chiaki is left with an overwhelming phobia of flying. This leaves him unable to fully realize his dream of studying with Viera\u2014or even to simply study abroad. Resigning himself to the fact that he's stuck in Japan, he studies different instruments in effort to understand them better while still secretly yearningto be a conductor. \\n\\n\r\nAfter growing somewhat bitter, and with a bit of a superiority complex, Chiaki overhears a wonderful piano melody that captivates his attention. Later Chiaki discovers that the person responsible for the melody is none other than his scatterbrained next-door neighbor Nodame. Nodame is every bit Chiaki's opposite, free-spirited, unrestrained, outgoing, and also unbelievably messy. No... not just messy... horrendously FILTHY. \\n\\n\r\nChiaki gets roped into cleaning her apartment, cooking meals for her, and coaching her at piano\u2014subsequently developing a reluctant affection for her that he denies at every opportunity. There are also a plentiful amount of other colorful characters in this series. Mine the violinist, Masumi the timpanist, and of course perverted conductor Stresseman, to name just a few.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is pleasant, nothing too over-the-top spectacular. However, the animation for the character's hands and movements while playing each individual instrument is given special attention, and it really shows. Additionally, the humorous moments are given very cute flourishes that are reminiscent of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nSound. This is where the anime really shines. Not only do they pick some of the best classical compositions, they also elaborate on why each one is notable. They give each piece detail and perspective. I love the two different ways Mine and Chiaki view \"Spring\". I love how much time is put in to tell you about each piece of music. The sounds of each instrument are wonderful, the accuracy of each instrument when it's out of tune, as well as how differently Chiaki and Nodame play a piece on piano. I could go on forever, there's just so much RIGHT with how this series does sound. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters. Again, each individual character is likable with their own distinct personality. They're memorable, they're enjoyable, and all of them assist the main protagonist's growth throughout the series. You're able to really remember each character with vivid clarity. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Supremely enjoyable. It has a very refreshing balance to the overall story, and there's not a single dull moment. You never find yourself bored, or getting 5 episodes in and then forgetting about it. You can watch it from start to finish with ease, and even find yourself wanting to go back and re-watch it. \\n\\n\r\nMy only nitpick with the series, which is very common in anime, is that everyone is in love with the main character Chiaki. I mean, they think this guy is a musical god. They either love and idolize him, or they hate him based upon jealousy and envy. It doesn't really seem necessary, and doesn't add to the story in the slightest. But honestly that's just nitpicking at this point.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a watch, you'll be glad you did! \\n\\n",

Its an excellent rendition of classical music made for the modern era to enjoy. \r\n  Character, art and story are each crafted exceptionally. A bit slideshowish during the musical performances, which i usually look down upon, but it helped me enjoy the music with out the distraction of flashy animation. The hand-drawn, painted art and overall art did a wonderful job of expressing different emotions and details. And of course the two maincharacters are so easily lovable. The contrast between the Nodame and Chiaki is humorous yet beautiful. \\n\\n\r\n  It's not often you come across such a wonderful story filled with growth, humour drama, and so many more elements all wonderfully blended together.\\n\\n\r\nA perfect must watch series for anyone! 10/10",

            "content": "Alright this is my first review but I felt obligated to do it because I am an aspiring classical musician and this show is all about classical music.\r\nAnyways down to business. There are plenty of good reviews of this anime so I'll keep this fairly short and stick to what I know. First off I want to say I was very skeptical about watching this show. Usually anything that deals with classical music for the masses is done poorly and they often use extremely popular and over played pieces. I'm very happy to say this is not the case in Nodame Cantabile. I was continuouslypleased and surprised right up until the very end at the diversity of the pieces they chose. I was possibly even more excited at the recordings used for all the playing. Although not easily noticeable, when the orchestra/person paying was supposed to be making mistakes I could tell that there were mistakes, even if it wasn't exactly the mistakes they were supposed to be. Also whenever they had a big performance of a piece the recording used is always very good quality. I should mention though that they never play a piece all the way through. However seeing as many classical pieces are 10+min long, symphonies being 30+min, it just wouldn't have been practical to try and fit entire pieces in, there wouldn't have been any story. As far as animation is concerned they use a lot of still pictures for performances and such. They did animate the playing sometimes, especially near the end, but it was mostly still shots. Although this may seem like a bit of a let down it was certainly easier than trying to animate all of the musicians movements. I feel that if they would have done this it would wind up taking away from the accuracy of this show which is pretty much spot on. I was very happy about how they managed to capture what it's like to really be an aspiring classical musician. I don't think there was ever a time in the show that I found myself thinking something like \"that's not what happens in the real world\". The show did have it's fair share of prodigies but it was still well within the realm of believability. In the end I started this anime expecting to hate it and I wound up loving it. For anyone who is a classical musician or really likes classical music you need to watch this now. Even if you're not a big classical music buff though there is still plenty to be enjoyed and I highly recommend it.",

Several people had already recommended it, but I was a little reluctant since I'm a musician and I give much attention to musical details.\r\nAnyway I gave it a try... and I loved it!! Even though I'm only in the beginning I am loving everything about it so far: the way theseries speaks of Music in general is pure genius; the way the music takes different traits when payed by different characters is overwhelming!\\n\\n\r\nNodame Cantabile portraits perfectly the dream of a musician who wants to become more than he is, his hardships, his thoughts when playing, studying and listening to music: it is actually very realistic. The art is also very good and the story captivating enough to keep me glued to the screen every episode.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend it!",

You will appreciate classical music if you never give this style a chance.\r\n-Art, the art its simple but i dont thing is anything really important in an anime like this. But dont worry, when they are playing the piano or in an orchestra its really nice to watch.\r\n-Sound, i dont have nothing to say, if you see my user name you will see that i am a huge fan ofthis kind of music so when i watched this anime i feel sooooo good. The ost that this anime has (own creation) its nothing special but dude, you have masterpieces.\\n\r\n-Character, I think the characters are really nice. Chiaki is not the traditional \"anime boy\", he is a man, an adult, and he will decide like you are not used it. \\n\r\nNodame is really good too, she is not the traditional \"anime girl\" aither. You will fond of everyone.\\n\r\n-Enjoyment, amazing, i like \"slow animes\" and Nodame Cantabile is super with that. I've seen how they make music, i've seen how their relationship change, etc... I realy enjoy this anime and i felt really sad when i finished all the seasons =(\\n\r\n-Overall, if you are not a little girl (or a little boy) anymore like me (+20), and you want to watch more animes for your age this will be perfect. You will watch something more realistic, funny, emotional and with the best music. i recommend this anime to all of you ;)",

            "content": "It\u2019s very rare for musical type of series to be famous considering that not everyone is fond of music. So it\u2019s to be expected that there would be a very few viewers who will genuinely appreciate such genre. I strongly believe that it would be an extreme challenge to create such one.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming!\r\nABOUT THE STORY\r\nThe series is about different people with different ambitions and the only thing that everyone has is music. The story revolves around students in a music university and how they struggle to achieve their dreams in the music industry.\r\nLike I said, I believe that with the type ofgenre it would definitely be a challenge as so viewers can really appreciate the series. In this case, the production manages to create such series which not only Japanese viewers can appreciate but in overseas, too. Which I think is such a success. I believe it\u2019s very refreshing considering I am personally not quite excited at the beginning because though I am in love with music, musical type of series is not really my cup of tea. Before I realized it, I was already amazed with almost every episode. The fact that it\u2019s not only about music but also about people\u2019s lives, decisions, dreams, and problems are what makes the series even more amazing. Plus, the whole series is packed with lots of laughter so you will really enjoy every moment of it. Oh, and there is also romance though I think the series is more about the people\u2019s lives rather than the love story of the main characters. I am not that knowledgeable with classical music, though I have few personal favorites, I strongly believe that it made the series with a refreshing and different touch from others. I absolutely think that music or soundtracks are very important to any type of stories. Be it movies or series, music can always give a huge impact to the flow of story and delivers it to any type of viewers. \\n\\n\r\nABOUT THE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nThough the two lead characters are both musically talented, they approach music in a very different way. Chiaki is the type who\u2019s genuinely talented that everyone knows. He considers music in a serious way and dreams of becoming someone in the music industry someday much like your typical person with a talent. On the other hand, Nodame is the type who approaches music in her own way where she considers it a fun thing and unlike Chiaki she never considered becoming a professional someday. This is something that in fact common in real life where people expect you to become someone because of your talent and consider it a waste of talent if you\u2019re not planning on becoming professional. Now, this is where the conflict comes between them and Nodame have to decide whether to treat music straight on or else she can\u2019t be with Chiaki. I honestly think that Nodame is way better than Chiaki and they should just leave her alone. It\u2019s really irritating when a person pushes their beliefs with you and I even consider it an insult if they would say that it\u2019s a waste of talent. At the end of the day, if you\u2019re not really enjoying what you are doing then it\u2019s absolutely wrong. In life, more than fame, more than dreams, more than everything else, it is still way more important that you love what you are doing.\\n\\n\r\nABOUT THE ANIMATION and SOUND\\n\r\nAnimation was not that fabulous but it worked for the type of story. Let\u2019s not forget that the music was beautifully done. Even the voice of Nodame was so perfect for her character with all the Mukyas and Gyabos. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it more than I expected. Definitely looking forward to the Paris Chapter.\\n",

            "content": "This show has so many ups and downs for me that's it's hard to write about without sounding overly praising or overly damning. The basic premise isn't particularly mind-blowing, but the execution is so solid that I couldn't help but fall in love with the series and it's quirky characters.\r\nThe anime has two basic plots: the romance plot between the two main characters and then a subplot about the philosophy of music, how the music industry works, and how musicians see their art. The subplot isn't as high brow as I'm making it sound, but it is sufficiently deep to provoke thought about deeper subjectseven if the series itself isn't bold enough to dive quite that deep.\\n\\n\r\nThe main appeal of this series for me is the music. As a musician who has played the trumpet and piano for the past 20 years, the story and characters really resonated with what I've experienced in my life. The pieces of music presented in the series are some of the most well known and oft-played pieces by aspiring musicians (and orchestras). They are competently played and wonderful to listen to. The link between the music and plot is usually significant and adds weight to the performances that appear in most episodes. Characters playing music takes up a significant percentage of any particular episode's screen time, so if you totally off-put by classical music this would be a series to pass on.\\n\\n\r\nRather than write separate reviews for the other series, I'd just like to elaborate on the the Paris and Finale sequels that follow, so someone who wants to watch the show to completion will know what to expect. I felt like the plot got more full of filler as the series went on, which is why I only gave the show an 8/10. If the show had been 24-26 episodes (in total including the sequels) and resolved the plot in that time, I probably would've enjoyed it more, but it drags its feet too much in the middle for my taste and does the time-honored anime trope of causing silly misunderstandings between the romantic characters that then gets resolved an episode or two later. If three or four of those plot elements had been removed the series would've been 10 episodes shorter and much less annoying in the middle. Many of these \"misunderstandings\" seem to have been built to show how insecure Nodame was, but I think the point was sufficiently clear after the first 1 or 2.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I still thoroughly enjoyed the show and would recommend it to fans of romance, comedy, and/or music.",

I would recommend you to watch it if you look for something with good comedy, romance too, and if you like classical music.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nThe story was well-made. It has ups and downs. You never get bored, because there are different problems, and the way characters over-come the difficulties is nice.\r\nArt(7/10)\r\nIt was different from what i've seen before, but sometimes i didn't feel good when the scene of playing an instrument was only an image or two. It felt like there was no movement at all. Still, it was original.\r\nSound(8/10)\r\nClassical music everywhere. The classical musicwas very well-chosen, but the openings were not a big deal.\\n\r\nCharacter(10/10)\\n\r\nAll the character had a good development.

            "content": "Sometimes you see a series you can't help yourself but write a review as it stands out from the rest and Nodame Cantabile is one of those.\r\nNodame Cantabile is about Shiniji Chiaki an arrogant music student at Japan's best music school and is from an eminent musical family is a perfectionist who demands high standards from others as well as himself with ambitions to be a conductor. He is heading for a bright feature in classical music and has a wealthy and suitable girlfriend.\r\nThis all changes after an argument with his teacher and he is relegated to the lower class of his year and isdumped by his girlfriend. Leaving the music school is hears an extraordinary yet undisciplined performance on the piano and it turns out it is Megumi Noda who prefers to be called Nodame. She is an messy girl who lives next door to Chiaki and decides that Chiaki is her boyfriend. Chiaki's life is turned upside down as he takes it upon himself to get Nodame disciplined enough to fulfill her potential.\\n\\n\r\nMy friend's wife went to a top music school and after going to some of their parties I found that people like how Chiaki was in the beginning do exist at music schools. Arrogant enough to be convinced of their brilliance and eager to criticise others flaws.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways Nodame Cantibile is like a high school romance like Toradora or even Kimi ni Todoke with two people meeting with one looking after the other and growing as people whilst receiving advice from an irresponsible adult. In this case the irresponsible adult is Milch Stresemann an genius conductor yet an outrageous pervert who has come to Japan to find the love of his youth.\\n\\n\r\nChiaki's problems turn out to be a blessing in disguise as he learns from his other students in the lower class how to enjoy the music and not take it too seriously and from Stresemann that to be a conductor you have to show humility and appreciate the orchestra's work and limits. With Nodame's support he is able to overcome his family problems and fear of flying to progress his career abroad. If only he could appreciate Nodame. Nodame on the other hand learns that to succeed in life you have to be disciplined and at some point what you really want from life.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters complement Chiaki and Nodame really well and the series allow these characters to develop as people as well even throwing in another chalk and cheese romance.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is outstanding with most of it from the Nodame Orchestra. The series also explains the music with what each piece is about and why a piece is being played so badly so you are not confused why Chiaki gets angry or what is wrong with Nodame's piano playing.\\n\\n\r\nLike all the best romance anime's it is the personal growth of the characters that make the series work but as good as it is it slows a bit in the middle so it loses a mark but it is still more than enjoyable.",

            "content": "Nodame is one of  my favorite animes. Here's why:\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nNodame Cantabile has just enough plot quirk to keep you intrigued as these characters take their emotional journeys. The story is your basic opposites attract plot for the most part. But, what is an aspiring classical conductor to do when he's afraid to fly (or sail) to Europe where destiny beckons and is instead landlocked in Japan? What do the fates have in store? This is a major point of the plot and it flows together rather well up to its resolution.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nSimple character art, but not off-putting. The best part that makes this a10 for me is probably the CG usage with the instrument close-ups. Some of Chiaki's CG conducting ventured a little into uncanny valley at times, but it did not detract terribly. This overall made what could have been bland (to some) orchestral scenes \"sing\". \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWell, obviously given that this is an anime about classical music students, the music is the driving force. Of course, the music was absolutely beautiful in this anime. (My personal favorite is Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No.2, but all of it was perfect). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\n In Chiaki, the aspiring conductor, you have your good looking, talented, intelligent guy that everyone (even the guys) want...but he's a perfectionist to a fault thus doesn't really relate well with others. Enter Nodame, the aspiring...kindergarten teacher...who is unkempt, chaotic and of average intelligence...but she plays amazing (albeit \"sloppy\") classical piano by ear/memory with all of the vim and vigor she has for life and love. The supporting characters were fleshed out and they complimented the main cast well. For example, there's a great moment during the S-Oke's first performance between Mine and Chiaki. You'll have to watch it to see. I think it'd be hard not to smile.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nYour mileage may vary on this, and I think it depends heavily on your tolerance for classical music. Again, this is an anime about aspiring classical musicians, so there are many many scenes at recitals, concerts, competitions etc... The characters are well developed however and if any anime can convert a non-believer in classical music, this is the one. With just about every  piece presented, there is information and background given by Chiaki's inner voice that makes it all more understandable to the viewer. There is however, great humor and great drama between the characters. You really feel for them and want them to succeed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n",

Being the first part of the threequels, it really set up the foundation. What I enjoyed most about the series, however, was the intricate use of music as the centerfold for all aspects of character and plot development, expressing the personalities and plot artifacts without ever needing to explicitly \"say\" anything. Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No.2 Mvt.1 was played during the a period of plot with tension, contemplation, frustration, despair, and hope - much like the song itself.\r\nThe use of the music as both a plot enhancer and foresightfurther brought out the richness of the music, and being a musician myself, I can't help but feel the warm tingly sensation that is Nodame Cantabile.",

            "content": "2. The story is quite straightforward. A person who chases his dreams and obstacles he faced. It is also quite factual about the life of a musician, Eg needs luck.\r\nThe art is normal but the sound is great for the music played. It is quite clear and they are able to execute the  minor mistakes of music done by the characters (Noticed by the sharp ears of main char or professionals). However, they did not use any background music to enhance the atmosphere of story which makes it a bit dull.\r\nThe enjoyment is ok as it is unique. It's comedy scenes are not usuallyfunny (or not funny enough) and can be extreme or stupid to be funny, Eg, chiaki (main char) strangles nodame with rope (main char)\\n\\n\r\nYou can also notice the lack of animation. Showing only the picture of some concert scenes and static shocked or surprised faces.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt may not had even deserves an 8/10 score if it wasnt because of the anime uniqueness and some increase in enjoyment later.",
