            "content": "Open endings, don't you just hate them? It's okay when a sequel is made but nothing of the sort is even planned. This is something Zexecs keeps doing, examples of this are Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu, Chrome Shelled Regios and of course this series, Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi. However this series lacks a lot of things that the two other series listed above have.  It doesn't leave you wanting for more like the other two.\r\nThe story is a mess. For a series that is only twelve episodes long, it jumps from place to place a lot. Although the events do have somesort of connections to each other, they seem to come out of nowhere. Even though there are a lot of things happen, the plot hardly goes anywhere.  Almost everything that happens is not interesting or memorable. The ending does set itself up for a sequel but here\u2019s the problem, when has Zexecs ever created a sequel to anything? The answer to that question is never, and it\u2019s not just this anime produced by Zexecs that has an ending like this. They have produced a number of anime that don\u2019t have a conclusive ending.  However despite having a lot of negatives, the series does have some positives to it. The plot does have some uniqueness to it and it is not as predictable as one may think.  The creativeness was there and if the series had been executed better who knows, the plot may have been interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAny series that can develop characters well in 12 or 13 episodes deserves applause because that isn\u2019t a lot of time to really give any character any deep development. Like many other series of that length, it falls short in the character department.  The main male protagonist isn\u2019t very bright, he just dives head first into any given situation without thinking anything out. He is nearly immortal but nearly dies on numerous occasions because of his own recklessness but without his reckless nature nothing interesting would happen so it\u2019s understandable to why they made the character this way. He also doesn\u2019t develop much through-out the series, he remains almost unchanged from the beginning to the end of the series. At least he isn\u2019t oblivious or spineless. He does realize the love triangle that he is in even though it is blatantly obvious. The female characters don\u2019t develop much either and they can also get pretty annoying with how clingy they are. They have no depth to their character. The side characters aren\u2019t that much better either, none of the characters really stand out and aren\u2019t memorable at all but since the series was only 12 episodes long, we can\u2019t really expect much.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is colorful is say the least. Every character has a different hair color and some have more than one hair color but it looks like they got lazy with the character designs, they look very basic, nothing popping out and two of them even look the same. The animation is pretty average, not bad but not outstanding either, it looks like something you would expect from any other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty average too.  Nothing special, the opening is fast which gets you pumped and the ending is very sweet. Both are catchy but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\n The genre of the anime gives the creators a lot of flexibility and because of that, there is a certain degree of expectation. It can be entertaining but at the end of the day the series just falls flat on its face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the series is very unique but it is lacking in many areas and negatives really overshadow the positives.\\n",

            "content": "I don't really understand what was in the author mind when he did that anime.It's like he started with a story ,a strong story with a big plot and all...And then finally choose to rush over it and turn the anime into a school-life/harem/fanservice one.Not that I'm complaining about that ,I love school-life ,harem and fanservice :3 .But damn...Don't do that like that ! It's like you plan to watch Lord of the Ring for the first time and when you do it it is : \r\n*first hour* \"Frodon ,you have to destroy the ring.Go to the Mount Doom and throw it into that damnlava so we can screw Soron !\"\\n\\n\r\n*Later* \"Hey Frodon ! Wanna go to the pool?\" \"F-Frodon-chan...I..I lo..Lov\" \"Waaah ! Frodon-san ,it's so nice that we're all at the beach for the summer break !\"\\n\\n\r\nDisturbing right?...Well ,that's more or less the same thing with Kuro Usagi.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the first episodes it is plot after plot after plot after plot ! Everything go ultra supra fast ! Like \"This guy is an enemy ! But finally he's good ! Now he'll help us against this guy ! And now this guy is not really the worst one ! But we have to take care of that one !...Well finally we've deal with that one so let's take care of...Oh already deal with it ,okay...But Aaaah ! Take care of the PROPHECY !!!\" And after that...\"Oooh pool party ,yay ! Loli-chan ,wait for meeee ! Aaaah the beach is so nice ,let's go swim all together !\"...Wait what?!\\n\\n\r\nOkay okay I'll stop it here and I'll try to make it more clear.What I try to say is that this anime is made on the wrong side.Normally on those kind of animes things go that way :\\n\\n\r\n1 - The hero is an idiot ,he's useless ,but he want to grow stronger for protecting his nakama.Childhood friend love him.The new girl love him too.He want to protect both of them and prepare for a hard training.\\n\\n\r\n2 - Plot incoming ! As our hero start to train for becoming stronger ,we have the plot who slowly start to appear.Mysterious enemies slowly show their face and are conspire against the hero because they want something from one of the girl ,but you don't know what or why.\\n\\n\r\n3 - Fanservice time ! Of course ,the plot is in preparation and our hero is in training ,what do we need for making everyone wait and more or less enjoy this waiting? Fan service ! Boobs ,bikini or nude scene where every characters get together at the same place at the same time with no fucking good reason just so we can have a lot of funny ,ecchi scene.\\n\\n\r\n4 - The hero became stronger ,but it's not enough and as he try to protect the so wanted girl ,he fail miserably and the girl is finally taken by the bad guys.So the hero ask X mysterious person for a special training so he can be even more stronger ,but that training contain risk but our hero don't give a fuck about risk so he do it because he want to save the girl !\\n\\n\r\n5 - The hero became even more stronger ,beat the bad guys ,save the girl ,which is about to confess or really confess her love to him.The other girl is jealous and do the same.The hero can't choose between both ,both get angry ,everyone laugh ,the end.\\n\\n\r\nThat's how everythings go normally is those kind of anime.But in this one it's the opposite.We start directly with a plot ,and a new one ,and a new one ,and a new one again.First you ear about a dangerous \"demon\" or so who was linked to Himea.So you think that this one is the bad guy.But at the same time Himea is hunted by a bad guy ,Hinata ,getting out of nowhere like a wild Garen get out of the bushes and start raping everyone wih some creepy god-like magics ,so you think that this one is the main bad guy and that the \"demon\" you heard about earlier will be the main menace later.And...No.Hinata is the bad guy for one episode ,after he disappear and sometimes make some cameo here and there (Seriously I though it was Stan Lee sometimes.).\\n\\n\r\nTwo episodes later ,the \"demon\" appear.Yea ,so soon.But you learn that it's not a demon but something different linked to Himea.But don't care too much about it because it disappear one episode later and a new plot come in !...Which is over one episode later again.And now you ear about something called Tenma which clearly when the ass of Himea ,lie he really REALLY want it that badly !..But after a little conversation he doesn't care anymore about Himea ,he just care about a Prophecy (Oh god how many time did I heard that word in that anime which never gave any information about it !).And finally ,as you begin to heard about the prophecy more often ,Hinata make a new cameo for saying \"Hi ,I know much more about the prophecy than you lol !\" than disappear.And now ,they tell you that the prophecy is coming...Everything is ready for that...Everyone is here just as keikaku...And now?...Fanservice time ! O.O No really ,it's totally that.Half of the anime it's \"plotting time\" and the other half it's \"fan service #WeDon'tCareAboutTheStory #Yolo time\".So ,my examination :\\n\\n\r\nStory (5) : A lot of mysteries ,a lot of plots ,a lot of questions and...Nothing.The story started greatly and is rushed like hell ,at a point that it's hard to clearly understand everything because it goes just too fast for that.And finally nothing is answered ,the prophecy is coming but apparently nobody care ,the hero go for some training at the end but we don't know why.Everyone wanted Himea but now nobody care about her and we don't know why.So yea ,the story is rushed and confused and it's sad because it had a big potential ,but wasted.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8) : Artwork is great I have to admit it ,the characters are high quality and a special attention was made for the hairs because all girls have multicolor hairs.Special mention for Himea hair who apparently are full of fireflies...That's the only explanation I have about all those white moving spot she have everywhere in her hair !\\n\\n\r\nSound (6) : Not bad ,not awesome ,it's fair.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7) : A Useless MC ,a childhood friend ,an immortal vampire witch with fireflies in her hair ,a dark-emo \"I-Hate-Everyone\" black haired guy ,a loli with a kind of catgirl style (*-*).That's the casting.But I have to say that when I say \"Useless MC\" I really mean it for this one.On most shonen the MC is useless at the beginning and at the end he's Chuck Norris.But nah ,here he start useless and finish useless ,even as he train he continue to be useless and to be saved by Himea or Emo-boy and his loli.But anyway ,useless MC put aside ,the group is a funny one and go well together so I can't really say that the casting is bad.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion :...Well...Dear author...The next time...Avoid the plot.Just do a Harem-style anime full of fanservice if it's what you wanted to do.And if not then start and FINISH your story.But don't do both when you plan to only do 12 episodes ,because you can't do both in 12 episodes !...Aaaah.Well...I think that this anime is not really bad ,but it's clearly not an awesome one.Watch it and make your own opinion ,I'm sure some peoples will hate it ,some will love it ,and some like me will be neutral.\\n\\n\r\nPS : Damn ,I sure have talked a lot ,sorry for that and...Waw...You really have read me to this point?...Really?...You sure have time to loose :3",

            "content": "After seeing the first 2 episodes, this anime is interesting to say the least. Though the main goal, or \"quest\" of the main character is uncertain as of yet, it is apparent that the story will unfold and blossom as the series goes on. \r\nStory:\r\nAs said before, the story looks a bit mysterious and yet intriguing at the same time, since the series is only on it's second episode, it's hard to say where the direction is headed, however, I will say this, the story if very suspenseful and makes the viewer want to watch another episode to see what will happen next. The storyis relatively simple, but is executed in a way that is easy to understand by illustrating details from the past, and how they affect the present situation. Hopefully the story will blossom into a wonderful flower of entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe characters seem relatively simple on the surface, but behind the friendly and welcoming exterior of the characters, is a mysterious past that can only be found out by continuing to watch the anime. I have high hopes for how the characters will be unraveled, and hope to learn what secrets they keep.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this series is pretty good, I'm not one for hair colors that are out of the ordinary like pink or sky blue, but for some reason, it tends to work in this series. The characters are well drawn, and the detailing on certain aspects of this anime are really well drawn, the art draws me in and intrigued me quite a bit. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is still in it's early stages, but i have a feeling that it will have a satisfying storyline as it progresses. It has a lot of the things i could ask for in an anime, dynamic characters with a mysterious past, well drawn detailing, a nice setting, the action of using magical spells for combat, and a storyline waiting to be unraveled by the viewer. I can't wait to see how this will unfold, and i recommend that you check out this anime, it certainly is  interesting for 2 episodes so far.",

            "content": "\"I will become stronger...\"\r\nThis was one of those animes that I just found while browsing My Anime List and stumbled upon the recommendation section. I ended up watching the first episode as soon as I found it, despite some of the slightly low-rated reviews I read about it. Now, the thing that stood out the most about this series wasn't the story, the characters, or even the fight scenes. No, it was how fricking colorful this anime was. Seriously, despite the amount of anime I've seen in the past, I have never seen such colorful hair on characters, like, ever. Without further ado, let's getthis review started, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nTo start off, let's get into the story. Upon first glance, this anime is supposedly about a vampire and a human, who met each other years ago. She fell in love with him, and granted him a power which allowed him to have 7 lives every 15 minutes.  It sounded interesting, but then stuff happened and the main girl got kidnapped and trapped in another dimension for years and years, while the human boy's memory was erased. Later on, once he enters High School, he somehow gains his memory back after being hit by a semi truck and healing his scattered limbs. He remembers the vampire girl, and he finds her once again. Then more stuff happens, and the story just gets more confusing as it goes on. To be honest, I still don't know what the main plot of this was supposed to be. All I know is that it felt kind of similar to pretty much every romance/echii/action anime out there. To sum it up, the story will not completely hook you onto the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the thing that caught my eye when first watching this was all of the colors. People's hair were multicolored, the sky was a completely abnormal color (never seen a sky turn bright purple and pink before), it was like I walked into a double rainbow and it suddenly started raining skittles everywhere. It was very strange, but it was decent quality. Most animes these days usually have pretty good art styles, so I was content.\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say about the voice acting. They played their roles well, and that's pretty much it. Sound effects were good, I liked the Opening and Ending songs. That's about it for anything sound related...\\n\\n\r\nI think out of all the characters in the show, the one that got on my nerves the most was Haruka. For those of you who have seen this, you will either be all like, \"Oh yeah, I totally agree with you\" or, \"What?! What about Mirai! She was way more annoying!\". To be honest, I liked Mirai a lot. She had loli written all over her, and I liked her energy and enthusiasm. But the thing I didn't like about Haruka was the fact that she couldn't let something go, even if it killed her. Obviously the 2 main protagonists are into eachother, but since she's into the main guy, she tries to steal him from Himea every chance she gets, and it got annoying. What's worse is that her entire class supported her. Other then that, I liked the main protagonist, Taito, he was pretty cool when he wanted to be. Gekkou was kind of a jerk at times, but he brought some pretty good comedy in the last episode, plus he knows how to handle weapons pretty well. Himea was probably my second favorite character out of the entire cast. With her love and compassion towards Taito, you can't help but root for her whenever you can.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the main question, did I enjoy watching this? The answer: meh... to be honest, the only reason I continued watching this was because I wanted to just get it finished so I could move on to more anime. I can't not finish an anime once I'm halfway through it, so overall, it was so-so. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone. I know everyone has mixed opinions about it and that we all can't agree on everything, but if you were to put this on your list, this might be kind of a last option once you get all the other important anime out of your way.",

            "content": "I first read the manga version of these way before it ever came out as an anime. The first 8 chapters, which I could find at the time, were very intriguing for me and when I heard that this will be an anime, I was very excited. I wasn't disappointed.\r\nStory:\r\nAs far as the story goes, I think it is as well as it could be put with a 12 episode anime. The idea in itself is very interesting and for all you vampire/zombie fans out there, this is a pretty good choice. However, I think the highlight of this series was not the story butrather the art.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was one of the higest quality I've ever seen. The only reason I'd give it a 9/10 is because I didn't like how the tips of characters with long hair had different color, which I think was an original touch but did not appeal to my taste. Other than that, the art was fantastic. The color, the effect, etc. it all was appealing to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty good as well. The opening and ending, wasn't the best but wasn't the worst as well. That aside, the background music fit each scene though they were using almost the same track for most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character is surprisingly cliched yet a bit different. We have our normal main character who is popular to his girls, and has a bit of perversion. Then we have the main heroine, who is actually not what most heroines would be. She is cutesy around the main character (the guy she likes) and is cold towards others, which I think was a nice touch. Next we have our usual childhood friend of the main character, who serves the purpose of jealousy as well as some role at the end. We also have the sub main character, who is arrogant and calls himself a \"genius\" and is of course, popular to all girls in his school. Then we have his partner, a loli, who happens to get quite a lot of panty shots from the very first episodes and does all the normal childish stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall I definitely think this anime is worth a try, mainly if you want a romance anime rather than an action-focused anime. The art is great, the story is fine, and it's all good!",

I can't honestly say this series is all that great, its not terrible but its not good either. The characters are alright, the story is non existent, I mean what the f**k is going on? The sounds and art are kinda overdone and you can see its pretty much the same as other shounen type shows. Nothing special aboutthe special effects, you'd have to download episodes to even remotely consider it eye candy, you stream it and its utter crap.\\n\\n\r\nThe reality is its generic and nothing good can be seen, nothing in my board made it past a 6.\\n\\n\r\nI feel it needed more, but I felt no need to continue on and thus dropped it off my list.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into the genre of the undead give this a watch, you might like it more than me.",

            "content": "The first two episode can get you hooked but then later on you might realized that this is just like almost any other story. Guy meets supernatural girl.. his life takes  a drastic change. Although in this story he has already met her  in the past except that his memory got alter and later remember. \r\nThe story is decent, not to bad, but also not to good. Well considering it is a 12 episode anime, they did a fair job of introducing the story and the characters. Where in episode 12 everyone already can get the sense of the producing trying to embedthe intention of there being a second episode since nothing is really solve. I guess it get the viewers to look forward to the work.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is pretty amazing. I like the way each and every character is displayed consider the personalities and attitude where could be referred to or closely related to other character is other anime.(at least it reminded me of them) What I don't like to much is how the white spot moving around in Saitohimea's hair, they may represent stars and letting people subconsciously know that she isn't human and all but at points it gets distracting. One distinctive feature about the art is the tips of each character's hair is a different color or a darker shading. \\n\\n\r\nSounding wise is pretty decent, the opening and ending are not the best to suit the anime but not to the point where it doesn't fit at all. Also they used almost the same track for the whole thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty much stock character where you have the general stupid main protagonist who later thinks for himself and wow the audience, then the self-loathing, genius friend with his loli girl. The main heroine who is rather very affectionate to the male protagonist which i find difference but rather enjoyable to watch and of course the jealous childhood friend who later takes on the rather evil side of the story but finds light in the darkness. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it a pretty good anime. The artwork is once again great. Story can get your irritated at time but this is an introduction to the anime, the main stuff comes in season 2 if there is one. And if your a fan of zombie, vampire and supernatural genres then this is a suggestion for you. \\n\r\nI'll end it off with a question: It still makes me wonder what does a rabbit has to do with this story, although they mentioned it in the last episode, and a displayed a hidden rabbit a few time. i don't get it. \\n\\n\r\nCiao for now~",

            "content": "Before I start I have to say this is my first review. I chose this anime for my first review simply because I can't find any anime right now that I have a clearer view on. I'm no gonna hate on this things, but I'm not gonna lie for it. When it comes down to it I have only two words for Itsuka Tenma \"What? and Why?\"\r\nStory 3/10\r\nThis is my biggest problem with Itsuka Tenma and what set me off. I came into this anime with high hopes, not so high that mediocrity would destroy my views but some expectations and I really tried tolike it but...yeah.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is rushed and has little to no depth at all. The main character is thrown into a world of magic and demons...how is this going on? He acquires magic power from a vampire...ok seems alright, his school is connected to a demon world that was not explained whatsoever...hmph and now its happy, happy relationship time while all of this is going down...LOGIC!, he and his classmate fight demons with magic he obtained from a book and a sword from...who knows where?and enemies that they fight because, well because their just there and I could go on with the rest but well you get what i'm saying. \\n\r\nSome people say its about them building their relationship and overcoming odds. Well if was about that I'm pretty sure they would put some logical frosting on this plot cake they call a relationship build, but no you put shounen strawberries and ecchi chocolate and you get this disaster.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty standard. I like the effect they put on Himea's hair but aside from that it was pretty good, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was basic, everything fit in to the background and the mood but nothing really stood out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were nothing special, none of them had any personality that stood out or we haven't seen before.\\n\r\nTaito - the common shounen male main character \"I have to become stronger to protect blah blah blah\" you know the drift.\\n\r\nHimea - the love sick puppy who needs her main character to save her even though he's hopeless.\\n\r\nGekkou - the douche who thinks he's better than everyone and he really ups the douche factor to 10.\\n\r\nMirai - the ecchi bait, who's just their to be stupid and act cute\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters aren't really worth mentioning because they just aren't.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I tried to look past the bland characters and lack of story, but the human mind can only take so much. Some people might enjoy it if they can look past its weak points, but I couldn't so I just quit it was slightly enjoyable but not enough make you want to come back.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of story, generic characters and normal everything else makes Itsuka Tenma a ball of wasted potential. I came in with high hopes but was let down.\\n\r\nOverall its a forced romance with an off-putting story and some decent fights.\\n\\n",

It has bits of romance/drama/school-life mixed in with an intriguing supernatural storyline. I really thought I had hit a diamond-in-the-rough under appreciated anime.\r\nBut, if you're like me, when episode 11 hits you start to feel like they just quit. The last 2 episodes were not very cohesive with the first 10, and for me it was blatantly distracting so that I couldn't take them seriously.\r\nThis anime is worth a watch, and it's pretty original in its own ways (seriously, it was pretty unique). However,I can see how it's score is justified after completing the last episode.\\n\\n\r\n If you have nothing else to watch, this could very well entertain you though. The last episode is set up like a bridge between a 1st and 2nd season, and if they ever actually made a 2nd season I would probably watch it.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps a little.\\n\\n\r\n*Update* Wow, I didn't realize how many trolls were on MAL. Hopefully they are watching the series a little before marking this Not Helpful entirely..",

            "content": "This is my first review... ever... but i hope you enjoy reading it and find it useful in some way. Everything here is merely my opinion so you may not agree with it. ENJOY!\r\nBrief Review: A quick summary for those that don't wish to spend too much time reading other people's opinions.\r\nStory 2/10: A shallow series of events that force our protagonists onwards. Uninteresting at best...\r\nArt 9/10: I loved the art. Not much to say here. Good art is good.\r\nSound 7/10: The OP and ED were meh-decent. The seiyuu did a nice job for all but one character... Saito Himea sounds very ... \r\nCharacter 2/10:Absolutely HORRIBLE. There is barely any character development for 10 episodes. You are expected to simply accept the character relationships as they come. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10: I watched all 12 episodes in one sitting. I had nothing better to do. It kept me entertained for a couple of hours. I could have done other things to waste my time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10: I'd recommend you watch this if you have time to waste. You may find shaving a puppy to be more worth your time. \\n\\n\r\nNot-So-Brief Review: Just like the above with more words. Seriously... a lot more words... SOME SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED EPISODE 1 :3\\n\\n\r\n  Imagine that you are on your way home after watching Shrek 8. When you arrive, a relative asks you what it was about. You proceed to tell him what it was about. \"This happened, that happened, he said, she said, the end\". That is what this anime is like.\\n\\n\r\n  Lets take a quick look at \"Le genre tag,\" shall we.\\n\r\n  First we have comedy, check. Lots of second-hand jokes that will make you smile if its your first time. A chunk of slapstick here and there and bam.\\n\r\n  Next we have ecchi, check.\\n\r\n  Shounen, check.\\n\r\n  Vampire & supernatural, check & check.\\n\r\n  Finally, Romance... half-check. I am not sure about this... The female lead loves the male lead. How do we know? Cause we are told on episode 1. Chickita 1 loves muchacho 1. We must accept it. Some serious romance dude... It's like an illness you never knew you had. Doctor says \"You are ill,\" you reply with \"Ok!\" You are not given the chance to ask what this illness is, where you may have gotten it, how long it might have been there... \\n\r\n  IT. JUST. IS. \\n\r\n \"But Stoooorm!! Stop exaggerating!\" Oook! We aren't just told the two leads are in love, we are also given a 1 minute slideshow of about 18 scenes of two children and two short 3 minute scenes. OH! and all of that was in the distant past that our protagonist had forgotten but suddenly remembers! WHOA! They totally deserve to be together. It's the next romeo and juliet i tell ya!\\n\\n\r\n  But enough about that... lets take a look at the characters.\\n\r\n  Lets start with the fact that the two females in-love with our male protagonist both have a multiple personality disorder. One of them loses it... She can also cook and will apparently make a good wife in the future. Oh she's a normal human that is pretty much loved by all EXCEPT by the male protagonist that she loves. Lets call her ForeverAloneGirl. \\n\r\n  The other female is the vampire. She's lived for 20,000 years. Has multiple personality disorder that endangers THE WHOLE WORLD. Acts like a sticky glop of mucus that cant stop saying \"I LUV U.\" \\n\r\nOh, she also threatens to kill anyone who hurts the male protagonist. She is the one who injects our main hero with fancy juice that makes him fancy and she does it for a selfish reason... OH, and im just guessing here... but i think she's supposed to be all moe moe... She can't cook or do anything a normal wife is expected to do in the anime world... but atleast she can kill stuff! Lets call her Trololololol. \\n\r\n  Now we have the male lead. Our muchacho of le hour. Our head huncho. He's our village cliche. Guy wants to protect everyone, no problem with that. Guy starts out weak and tries to get stronger, no problem with that. Guy remembers he loves some small girl from 9 years ago and that she's waiting for him so he runs back to her and is all lovey dovey with her cause we are told that this is how it must go so that the makeshift story can somehow work, BIG PROBLEM THERE. Lets call him... troll bait. \\n\r\n  Now we look at our other male protagonist who does not deserve any attention at all... He is our badass, strong, jerk off that thinks he's everything but when it really counts he's just some weak little egotistical wannabe. Lets call him... Alice.\\n\r\n  Finally, we have our loli. Obnoxious little loli. Victim of 3/4th the animes ecchi. Honestly, i think she's just there for her underwear... OH! she can zap stuff while shouting \"Biri Biri\" which gets on my nerve... i have a reason for disliking it... nuff said. Lets call her shaved pears.\\n\r\n  There is a constant stream of random people popping up and getting in the way for almost no reason. Characters F, G, H, I, J & K are just tossed into the mix because we need to focus on someone to cover up the fact that there is no story.\\n\r\n  Now then... how do these characters develop? well, for 83.33% of the anime they don't develop. They remain as they are. Then things change and they become stronger/less annoying/interesting/whatever, but the anime ends before we can even begin to appreciate these changes. \\n\\n\r\n  TO THE ART!!!\\n\r\n  The art was lovely. Characters were nicely drawn. Their movements were fairly smooth and didn't seem choppy. Backgrounds where detailed. The colors where vibrant. The lighting often complimented the atmosphere and the mood. I would have gladly given this a perfect score if more effort was put into the effects. The same effects are used over and over and over.\\n\\n\r\n  Then we has Le Sound. As i stated previously... the Seiyuu did a good job with all but one character and i don't really think it's the Seiyuu's fault. This is another potential perfect score if it wasnt for that meddling vampire girl... The opening and ending were nice and they seemed to fit nicely with the anime and the art. But that annoying vampire girl... GAH! i feel bad for the seiyuu, she has tainted her Curriculum vitae.\\n\\n\r\n  To end this big wall of text... This anime would be something i suggest you add to the very bottom of your to-watch list. It should be the anime you watch when you have absolutely NOTHING better to watch. When you have absolutely NOTHING better to do. Possibly if you are feeling suicidal, watch this for encouragement (not for staying alive though). \\n\\n\r\nFinal score 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI hope you found my review useful or at the very least enjoyed it.\\n",

I will be writing about the anime Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi (A Dark Rabbit has Seven Lives), an I think it is very well done except for a few minor tweaks. First of all, I really liked the romance in it, so if you're like me and love drama, I highly recommend it. If not, there is still a lot of action. All characters have backstories, but this is a good and bad thing. Some characters have backstories that may be confusing or unimportant. But overall, theanime has a little of each genre, and I recommend it to all you otakus! My next review will probably be on Dragon Crisis, so if you are interested in watching it, stay tuned!",

            "content": "Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi. An extremely poor excuse for an anime. There are many things that can go wrong with an anime. This one happened to pretty much nail all of them on the head.\r\nStory: If i had to describe the story of this anime in one word it would be \"confusing\". You would have to be Sherlock Holmes to follow this anime. The story stays straight for the first two episodes, making it fairly easy to follow along. Then it goes and doubles back on you in episode three, and again in episode four. It's as if the anime is trying to bea different story every episode. Like a child who wants to be not only a pirate, an astronaut, or a cowboy. Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi wants to be not only a love story, but a horror/mystery/multi-dimensional/demonic story as well. For a story to be truly good it has to pick a storyline and stick to it. This story seems to have a problem with that. Score: 1\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: The only redeeming factor about this anime is it's art and sound. It has fairly well drawn scenes and the sound is decent too. Score: 7, and 7(art and sound respectively)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters aren't cliche at least. However some of them, much like the story, can't seem to continue to be the same person for more than an episode or two. As for character development, if you consider the character changing their personality in an almost 180 degree direction, then yes. There is a lot of \"development\". Score: 2\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: There was no enjoyment from this anime at all. I had to force myself to watch as much as i did, which isn't all that much. I had to take a break several times throughout each episode to \"brighten up\" the stupendously bored mood from my mind. There isn't any kind of enjoyment to be had from this anime. Even if you're looking for anime that fails so bad that it's funny. This one just doesn't cut it. Score: 1\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If all you do is look at the synopsis for Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi then you might be excited to watch it. Only however until you start actually watching it. This anime has only one even remotely decent thing about it: art/sound. which doesn't count for much when everything else is terrible. Score: 2",

            "content": "So we step into the world of Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi....or as I'd like to call it, pure chaos. I honestly tried giving this anime a chance, as I am a fan of shoujou romance with fantasy aspects, which this anime claims to be.\r\nStory 2/10:\r\n             As the show first opens, we are shown the main protagonist, Taito. He has immortality due to his childhood friend-who-is-also-a-vampire. That's pretty much the basis of it and doesn't go much further than that. The show has no whole plot. There I said it. Throughout the entireshow I honestly had no idea of: what the heck was going on, who the enemy was, or if the main characters were actually going to get together officially or not. The show tries to pick up many different genres like romance, fantasy, action, harem, supernatural, and high school and it is poorly executed. It started off strong with the idea of giving this boy powers that were not as common (only have seven lives until perma-death), and the fact that a vampire girl with some strange pink-blue gradient hair was giving it to him (I feel that the fact that she was a vampire was long forgotten by the second episode). There's no main plot, but rather small mini stories throughout, that don't make a coherent story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10:\\n\r\n            The art in Itsuka Tenma is probably the only decent redeeming quality of the show. It's very atmospheric and can clearly portray the supernatural and mystical settings. It uses bold colors for common items, like changing the night sky and moon to bright pinks and purples, or even making the trees red and black. The female characters all had a unique gradient hair style which I found rather appealing. The male character designs are rather common, with features like extremely spiky hair and school uniforms.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10:\\n\r\n           Not much to really say here. The voice actors are fine as is the music. Nothing really irked me overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10:\\n\r\n          Welcome to where the show really falls flat. I don't really want to go into much detail, because if I do that I'll end up talking about it forever. There is not much more to the characters that can be described in a sentence, \"He wants to be strong to protect the girl he loves.\", \"She's lonely, but she has him and he will help her.\", \"He hates his brother and wants to defeat him.\", and \"She likes soda and to have fun\". Any other character is there purely to fill up the roster. The romance scenes are no more than the protagonists saying each other's names over and over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\\n",

I can't help get myself lost in this series.  So much that I intended to leave my homework on the side lines even as a high level college student.  Personally anyone who considers otherwide is very odd indeed.  Or maybe the story line is far too complicated for them.  It was a great watch and I enjoyed the music even more.  I was highly upset at the spot in which it ended, I figuredwith the climax raging and Liliath Ramiel finally being revealed they would reproduce  a second season.  I believe where it stopped is the only heart break.  Great love triangle story with a lot of respect and a lot of comedy.  I still cannot understand why people find the naked body such a perverted thing.  Better yet, since they arent really human why do you care if there drawn figures are exposed.  I'm sure no one is getting that much pleasure from a fwew clips, when really they are linked to the personality of the characters and become attached.  Some people will never appreciate the hard work that goes into a series liekt his.  With the plot winding and twisting every time you feel yuo understand the story, the only thing you can cling to is the love between Taito and Hiema, and it makes you pick sides throughout the story.  Interestingly enough the sides you pick seem to follow the way you want the story line to go.  Great for student in Highschool or beginning college-level students. Well done.",

            "content": "I'm a big fan of shows that stick to their guns. Shows that clearly know what they are and what they want to be. That tells me that the writers had a theme or plan in mind and put care into their work to make that plan happen. If the characters, theme, mood, setting and music all compliment each other, as far as I'm concerned not much else really matters.\r\nItsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi seems to struggle with the above. It's difficult to make out what this anime wants to be. \"Comedy\" is the first genre listed, but the anime's attempts at comedy are outof place in the darkish setting. As far as romance, there's a lot of it, but it's kind of monotonous. Scenes and characters seem to pop up out of nowhere with little explanation. There isn't much consistency throughout the series, other than everything being really pretty. \"Shiny darkness\" probably best describes it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much of any character development at all, despite the definite potential. Most of the relationships were formed before the series starts. Characters just seem to appear and there's very little background to them. This makes it difficult to feel any attachment to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is awkward and sometimes feels thrown in. I didn't really feel comfortable laughing at anything. There's an entire episode that comes out of nowhere that's dedicated to the comedic aspect of the show, when the episodes around it show no indication of comedy. This and a few other episodes seem to break the continuity of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the romance aspect, it's pretty cut and dried. As the story has little character development, the romantic development never gets very far either. The main characters are \"madly in love\" to start the series. Not much changes with that. It finishes on the same gear it starts on.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty intriguing, even if it's been done before. There are a few plot twists that might not be predictable. \\n\\n\r\nI did feel like the music and art compliment each other pretty well. There is a certain \"shiny darkness\" to the art that sets the mood. The music mostly consists of string orchestra that captures this shiny darkness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi has a decent story but doesn't have much coherence. The aesthetics on their own are nice to look at, but they're wasted on characters that don't match the depth of the art. And the most important factor: Was it enjoyable? I felt like watching it was a chore, and that's never a good thing.",

            "content": "This is probably the most let down i'v been from a show for a long time. This show suffers from one of the worst thing a show can suffer from. That is loss of potential.\r\nI'm hesitant to use the word worst. But this is definitely one of the weirdest structured shows. In the very first episode we are getting all these emotional scenes that just don't work. Because we don't know these characters at all so it's hard to feel sympathy them. I felt bad for the female who was stuck in a torture type of jail secluded from any interaction with anyone else waiting9 years for her only friend to come save her. Tell episode 5 we get stuff you would expect after tons of build up and already set world. But then we get episode 6 and then we get something i would expect from early on episodes. Not to long later we get more serious crap happening. With a not so great ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very iffy. The main male lead is a very bland and very cliche Japanese school boy in anime. But it's worse cause this dude is an idiot and if not even nice to his childhood friend who has a crush on him. He is constantly being dumb and making things more hard. The main female lead is actually interesting. She is a vampire that is meant to be such a strong person that she is feared by just about anyone besides maybe the gods in the world. Yet she rarely ever uses her power and always ends up looking like the typical school girl in need of help. It honestly got to the point i was very frustrated. The only reason she likes the main male lead is because she was lonely as a kid and he was the only one to do notice her. That's it not because of his personality or anything just because she had no one else to be loved by. That is one of the saddest things i'v seen in a anime and it's not intentional at all. As soon as she is free of the prison she clings to him for fear of being alone again.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is in all honesty really beautiful. Same goes along with character designs. They were nailed really well. Especially when i look at the gods of the world. Those designs feel original and creepy enough for how they should be. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple things i would like to write but i'll stop here so this doesn't turn into a big review. \\n\\n\r\nBut there is one thing i would like to mention. The OVA for this is worth mentioning. Sense most people tend to treat the OVA as a 13th episode i'm gonna give a review here. But that is honestly a funny OVA. I was not expecting it and i wish the rest of the show was like that. It is up there with my favorite OVA's.",

            "content": "Open endings, don't you just hate them? It's okay when a sequel is made but nothing of the sort is even planned. This is something Zexecs keeps doing, examples of this are Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu, Chrome Shelled Regios and of course this series, Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi. However this series lacks a lot of things that the two other series listed above have.  It doesn't leave you wanting for more like the other two.\r\nThe story is a mess. For a series that is only twelve episodes long, it jumps from place to place a lot. Although the events do have somesort of connections to each other, they seem to come out of nowhere. Even though there are a lot of things happen, the plot hardly goes anywhere.  Almost everything that happens is not interesting or memorable. The ending does set itself up for a sequel but here\u2019s the problem, when has Zexecs ever created a sequel to anything? The answer to that question is never, and it\u2019s not just this anime produced by Zexecs that has an ending like this. They have produced a number of anime that don\u2019t have a conclusive ending.  However despite having a lot of negatives, the series does have some positives to it. The plot does have some uniqueness to it and it is not as predictable as one may think.  The creativeness was there and if the series had been executed better who knows, the plot may have been interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAny series that can develop characters well in 12 or 13 episodes deserves applause because that isn\u2019t a lot of time to really give any character any deep development. Like many other series of that length, it falls short in the character department.  The main male protagonist isn\u2019t very bright, he just dives head first into any given situation without thinking anything out. He is nearly immortal but nearly dies on numerous occasions because of his own recklessness but without his reckless nature nothing interesting would happen so it\u2019s understandable to why they made the character this way. He also doesn\u2019t develop much through-out the series, he remains almost unchanged from the beginning to the end of the series. At least he isn\u2019t oblivious or spineless. He does realize the love triangle that he is in even though it is blatantly obvious. The female characters don\u2019t develop much either and they can also get pretty annoying with how clingy they are. They have no depth to their character. The side characters aren\u2019t that much better either, none of the characters really stand out and aren\u2019t memorable at all but since the series was only 12 episodes long, we can\u2019t really expect much.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is colorful is say the least. Every character has a different hair color and some have more than one hair color but it looks like they got lazy with the character designs, they look very basic, nothing popping out and two of them even look the same. The animation is pretty average, not bad but not outstanding either, it looks like something you would expect from any other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty average too.  Nothing special, the opening is fast which gets you pumped and the ending is very sweet. Both are catchy but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\n The genre of the anime gives the creators a lot of flexibility and because of that, there is a certain degree of expectation. It can be entertaining but at the end of the day the series just falls flat on its face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the series is very unique but it is lacking in many areas and negatives really overshadow the positives.\\n",

            "content": "I don't really understand what was in the author mind when he did that anime.It's like he started with a story ,a strong story with a big plot and all...And then finally choose to rush over it and turn the anime into a school-life/harem/fanservice one.Not that I'm complaining about that ,I love school-life ,harem and fanservice :3 .But damn...Don't do that like that ! It's like you plan to watch Lord of the Ring for the first time and when you do it it is : \r\n*first hour* \"Frodon ,you have to destroy the ring.Go to the Mount Doom and throw it into that damnlava so we can screw Soron !\"\\n\\n\r\n*Later* \"Hey Frodon ! Wanna go to the pool?\" \"F-Frodon-chan...I..I lo..Lov\" \"Waaah ! Frodon-san ,it's so nice that we're all at the beach for the summer break !\"\\n\\n\r\nDisturbing right?...Well ,that's more or less the same thing with Kuro Usagi.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the first episodes it is plot after plot after plot after plot ! Everything go ultra supra fast ! Like \"This guy is an enemy ! But finally he's good ! Now he'll help us against this guy ! And now this guy is not really the worst one ! But we have to take care of that one !...Well finally we've deal with that one so let's take care of...Oh already deal with it ,okay...But Aaaah ! Take care of the PROPHECY !!!\" And after that...\"Oooh pool party ,yay ! Loli-chan ,wait for meeee ! Aaaah the beach is so nice ,let's go swim all together !\"...Wait what?!\\n\\n\r\nOkay okay I'll stop it here and I'll try to make it more clear.What I try to say is that this anime is made on the wrong side.Normally on those kind of animes things go that way :\\n\\n\r\n1 - The hero is an idiot ,he's useless ,but he want to grow stronger for protecting his nakama.Childhood friend love him.The new girl love him too.He want to protect both of them and prepare for a hard training.\\n\\n\r\n2 - Plot incoming ! As our hero start to train for becoming stronger ,we have the plot who slowly start to appear.Mysterious enemies slowly show their face and are conspire against the hero because they want something from one of the girl ,but you don't know what or why.\\n\\n\r\n3 - Fanservice time ! Of course ,the plot is in preparation and our hero is in training ,what do we need for making everyone wait and more or less enjoy this waiting? Fan service ! Boobs ,bikini or nude scene where every characters get together at the same place at the same time with no fucking good reason just so we can have a lot of funny ,ecchi scene.\\n\\n\r\n4 - The hero became stronger ,but it's not enough and as he try to protect the so wanted girl ,he fail miserably and the girl is finally taken by the bad guys.So the hero ask X mysterious person for a special training so he can be even more stronger ,but that training contain risk but our hero don't give a fuck about risk so he do it because he want to save the girl !\\n\\n\r\n5 - The hero became even more stronger ,beat the bad guys ,save the girl ,which is about to confess or really confess her love to him.The other girl is jealous and do the same.The hero can't choose between both ,both get angry ,everyone laugh ,the end.\\n\\n\r\nThat's how everythings go normally is those kind of anime.But in this one it's the opposite.We start directly with a plot ,and a new one ,and a new one ,and a new one again.First you ear about a dangerous \"demon\" or so who was linked to Himea.So you think that this one is the bad guy.But at the same time Himea is hunted by a bad guy ,Hinata ,getting out of nowhere like a wild Garen get out of the bushes and start raping everyone wih some creepy god-like magics ,so you think that this one is the main bad guy and that the \"demon\" you heard about earlier will be the main menace later.And...No.Hinata is the bad guy for one episode ,after he disappear and sometimes make some cameo here and there (Seriously I though it was Stan Lee sometimes.).\\n\\n\r\nTwo episodes later ,the \"demon\" appear.Yea ,so soon.But you learn that it's not a demon but something different linked to Himea.But don't care too much about it because it disappear one episode later and a new plot come in !...Which is over one episode later again.And now you ear about something called Tenma which clearly when the ass of Himea ,lie he really REALLY want it that badly !..But after a little conversation he doesn't care anymore about Himea ,he just care about a Prophecy (Oh god how many time did I heard that word in that anime which never gave any information about it !).And finally ,as you begin to heard about the prophecy more often ,Hinata make a new cameo for saying \"Hi ,I know much more about the prophecy than you lol !\" than disappear.And now ,they tell you that the prophecy is coming...Everything is ready for that...Everyone is here just as keikaku...And now?...Fanservice time ! O.O No really ,it's totally that.Half of the anime it's \"plotting time\" and the other half it's \"fan service #WeDon'tCareAboutTheStory #Yolo time\".So ,my examination :\\n\\n\r\nStory (5) : A lot of mysteries ,a lot of plots ,a lot of questions and...Nothing.The story started greatly and is rushed like hell ,at a point that it's hard to clearly understand everything because it goes just too fast for that.And finally nothing is answered ,the prophecy is coming but apparently nobody care ,the hero go for some training at the end but we don't know why.Everyone wanted Himea but now nobody care about her and we don't know why.So yea ,the story is rushed and confused and it's sad because it had a big potential ,but wasted.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8) : Artwork is great I have to admit it ,the characters are high quality and a special attention was made for the hairs because all girls have multicolor hairs.Special mention for Himea hair who apparently are full of fireflies...That's the only explanation I have about all those white moving spot she have everywhere in her hair !\\n\\n\r\nSound (6) : Not bad ,not awesome ,it's fair.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7) : A Useless MC ,a childhood friend ,an immortal vampire witch with fireflies in her hair ,a dark-emo \"I-Hate-Everyone\" black haired guy ,a loli with a kind of catgirl style (*-*).That's the casting.But I have to say that when I say \"Useless MC\" I really mean it for this one.On most shonen the MC is useless at the beginning and at the end he's Chuck Norris.But nah ,here he start useless and finish useless ,even as he train he continue to be useless and to be saved by Himea or Emo-boy and his loli.But anyway ,useless MC put aside ,the group is a funny one and go well together so I can't really say that the casting is bad.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion :...Well...Dear author...The next time...Avoid the plot.Just do a Harem-style anime full of fanservice if it's what you wanted to do.And if not then start and FINISH your story.But don't do both when you plan to only do 12 episodes ,because you can't do both in 12 episodes !...Aaaah.Well...I think that this anime is not really bad ,but it's clearly not an awesome one.Watch it and make your own opinion ,I'm sure some peoples will hate it ,some will love it ,and some like me will be neutral.\\n\\n\r\nPS : Damn ,I sure have talked a lot ,sorry for that and...Waw...You really have read me to this point?...Really?...You sure have time to loose :3",

            "content": "After seeing the first 2 episodes, this anime is interesting to say the least. Though the main goal, or \"quest\" of the main character is uncertain as of yet, it is apparent that the story will unfold and blossom as the series goes on. \r\nStory:\r\nAs said before, the story looks a bit mysterious and yet intriguing at the same time, since the series is only on it's second episode, it's hard to say where the direction is headed, however, I will say this, the story if very suspenseful and makes the viewer want to watch another episode to see what will happen next. The storyis relatively simple, but is executed in a way that is easy to understand by illustrating details from the past, and how they affect the present situation. Hopefully the story will blossom into a wonderful flower of entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe characters seem relatively simple on the surface, but behind the friendly and welcoming exterior of the characters, is a mysterious past that can only be found out by continuing to watch the anime. I have high hopes for how the characters will be unraveled, and hope to learn what secrets they keep.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this series is pretty good, I'm not one for hair colors that are out of the ordinary like pink or sky blue, but for some reason, it tends to work in this series. The characters are well drawn, and the detailing on certain aspects of this anime are really well drawn, the art draws me in and intrigued me quite a bit. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is still in it's early stages, but i have a feeling that it will have a satisfying storyline as it progresses. It has a lot of the things i could ask for in an anime, dynamic characters with a mysterious past, well drawn detailing, a nice setting, the action of using magical spells for combat, and a storyline waiting to be unraveled by the viewer. I can't wait to see how this will unfold, and i recommend that you check out this anime, it certainly is  interesting for 2 episodes so far.",

            "content": "\"I will become stronger...\"\r\nThis was one of those animes that I just found while browsing My Anime List and stumbled upon the recommendation section. I ended up watching the first episode as soon as I found it, despite some of the slightly low-rated reviews I read about it. Now, the thing that stood out the most about this series wasn't the story, the characters, or even the fight scenes. No, it was how fricking colorful this anime was. Seriously, despite the amount of anime I've seen in the past, I have never seen such colorful hair on characters, like, ever. Without further ado, let's getthis review started, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nTo start off, let's get into the story. Upon first glance, this anime is supposedly about a vampire and a human, who met each other years ago. She fell in love with him, and granted him a power which allowed him to have 7 lives every 15 minutes.  It sounded interesting, but then stuff happened and the main girl got kidnapped and trapped in another dimension for years and years, while the human boy's memory was erased. Later on, once he enters High School, he somehow gains his memory back after being hit by a semi truck and healing his scattered limbs. He remembers the vampire girl, and he finds her once again. Then more stuff happens, and the story just gets more confusing as it goes on. To be honest, I still don't know what the main plot of this was supposed to be. All I know is that it felt kind of similar to pretty much every romance/echii/action anime out there. To sum it up, the story will not completely hook you onto the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the thing that caught my eye when first watching this was all of the colors. People's hair were multicolored, the sky was a completely abnormal color (never seen a sky turn bright purple and pink before), it was like I walked into a double rainbow and it suddenly started raining skittles everywhere. It was very strange, but it was decent quality. Most animes these days usually have pretty good art styles, so I was content.\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say about the voice acting. They played their roles well, and that's pretty much it. Sound effects were good, I liked the Opening and Ending songs. That's about it for anything sound related...\\n\\n\r\nI think out of all the characters in the show, the one that got on my nerves the most was Haruka. For those of you who have seen this, you will either be all like, \"Oh yeah, I totally agree with you\" or, \"What?! What about Mirai! She was way more annoying!\". To be honest, I liked Mirai a lot. She had loli written all over her, and I liked her energy and enthusiasm. But the thing I didn't like about Haruka was the fact that she couldn't let something go, even if it killed her. Obviously the 2 main protagonists are into eachother, but since she's into the main guy, she tries to steal him from Himea every chance she gets, and it got annoying. What's worse is that her entire class supported her. Other then that, I liked the main protagonist, Taito, he was pretty cool when he wanted to be. Gekkou was kind of a jerk at times, but he brought some pretty good comedy in the last episode, plus he knows how to handle weapons pretty well. Himea was probably my second favorite character out of the entire cast. With her love and compassion towards Taito, you can't help but root for her whenever you can.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the main question, did I enjoy watching this? The answer: meh... to be honest, the only reason I continued watching this was because I wanted to just get it finished so I could move on to more anime. I can't not finish an anime once I'm halfway through it, so overall, it was so-so. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone. I know everyone has mixed opinions about it and that we all can't agree on everything, but if you were to put this on your list, this might be kind of a last option once you get all the other important anime out of your way.",

            "content": "I first read the manga version of these way before it ever came out as an anime. The first 8 chapters, which I could find at the time, were very intriguing for me and when I heard that this will be an anime, I was very excited. I wasn't disappointed.\r\nStory:\r\nAs far as the story goes, I think it is as well as it could be put with a 12 episode anime. The idea in itself is very interesting and for all you vampire/zombie fans out there, this is a pretty good choice. However, I think the highlight of this series was not the story butrather the art.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was one of the higest quality I've ever seen. The only reason I'd give it a 9/10 is because I didn't like how the tips of characters with long hair had different color, which I think was an original touch but did not appeal to my taste. Other than that, the art was fantastic. The color, the effect, etc. it all was appealing to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty good as well. The opening and ending, wasn't the best but wasn't the worst as well. That aside, the background music fit each scene though they were using almost the same track for most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character is surprisingly cliched yet a bit different. We have our normal main character who is popular to his girls, and has a bit of perversion. Then we have the main heroine, who is actually not what most heroines would be. She is cutesy around the main character (the guy she likes) and is cold towards others, which I think was a nice touch. Next we have our usual childhood friend of the main character, who serves the purpose of jealousy as well as some role at the end. We also have the sub main character, who is arrogant and calls himself a \"genius\" and is of course, popular to all girls in his school. Then we have his partner, a loli, who happens to get quite a lot of panty shots from the very first episodes and does all the normal childish stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall I definitely think this anime is worth a try, mainly if you want a romance anime rather than an action-focused anime. The art is great, the story is fine, and it's all good!",

I can't honestly say this series is all that great, its not terrible but its not good either. The characters are alright, the story is non existent, I mean what the f**k is going on? The sounds and art are kinda overdone and you can see its pretty much the same as other shounen type shows. Nothing special aboutthe special effects, you'd have to download episodes to even remotely consider it eye candy, you stream it and its utter crap.\\n\\n\r\nThe reality is its generic and nothing good can be seen, nothing in my board made it past a 6.\\n\\n\r\nI feel it needed more, but I felt no need to continue on and thus dropped it off my list.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into the genre of the undead give this a watch, you might like it more than me.",

            "content": "The first two episode can get you hooked but then later on you might realized that this is just like almost any other story. Guy meets supernatural girl.. his life takes  a drastic change. Although in this story he has already met her  in the past except that his memory got alter and later remember. \r\nThe story is decent, not to bad, but also not to good. Well considering it is a 12 episode anime, they did a fair job of introducing the story and the characters. Where in episode 12 everyone already can get the sense of the producing trying to embedthe intention of there being a second episode since nothing is really solve. I guess it get the viewers to look forward to the work.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is pretty amazing. I like the way each and every character is displayed consider the personalities and attitude where could be referred to or closely related to other character is other anime.(at least it reminded me of them) What I don't like to much is how the white spot moving around in Saitohimea's hair, they may represent stars and letting people subconsciously know that she isn't human and all but at points it gets distracting. One distinctive feature about the art is the tips of each character's hair is a different color or a darker shading. \\n\\n\r\nSounding wise is pretty decent, the opening and ending are not the best to suit the anime but not to the point where it doesn't fit at all. Also they used almost the same track for the whole thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty much stock character where you have the general stupid main protagonist who later thinks for himself and wow the audience, then the self-loathing, genius friend with his loli girl. The main heroine who is rather very affectionate to the male protagonist which i find difference but rather enjoyable to watch and of course the jealous childhood friend who later takes on the rather evil side of the story but finds light in the darkness. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it a pretty good anime. The artwork is once again great. Story can get your irritated at time but this is an introduction to the anime, the main stuff comes in season 2 if there is one. And if your a fan of zombie, vampire and supernatural genres then this is a suggestion for you. \\n\r\nI'll end it off with a question: It still makes me wonder what does a rabbit has to do with this story, although they mentioned it in the last episode, and a displayed a hidden rabbit a few time. i don't get it. \\n\\n\r\nCiao for now~",

            "content": "Before I start I have to say this is my first review. I chose this anime for my first review simply because I can't find any anime right now that I have a clearer view on. I'm no gonna hate on this things, but I'm not gonna lie for it. When it comes down to it I have only two words for Itsuka Tenma \"What? and Why?\"\r\nStory 3/10\r\nThis is my biggest problem with Itsuka Tenma and what set me off. I came into this anime with high hopes, not so high that mediocrity would destroy my views but some expectations and I really tried tolike it but...yeah.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is rushed and has little to no depth at all. The main character is thrown into a world of magic and demons...how is this going on? He acquires magic power from a vampire...ok seems alright, his school is connected to a demon world that was not explained whatsoever...hmph and now its happy, happy relationship time while all of this is going down...LOGIC!, he and his classmate fight demons with magic he obtained from a book and a sword from...who knows where?and enemies that they fight because, well because their just there and I could go on with the rest but well you get what i'm saying. \\n\r\nSome people say its about them building their relationship and overcoming odds. Well if was about that I'm pretty sure they would put some logical frosting on this plot cake they call a relationship build, but no you put shounen strawberries and ecchi chocolate and you get this disaster.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty standard. I like the effect they put on Himea's hair but aside from that it was pretty good, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was basic, everything fit in to the background and the mood but nothing really stood out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were nothing special, none of them had any personality that stood out or we haven't seen before.\\n\r\nTaito - the common shounen male main character \"I have to become stronger to protect blah blah blah\" you know the drift.\\n\r\nHimea - the love sick puppy who needs her main character to save her even though he's hopeless.\\n\r\nGekkou - the douche who thinks he's better than everyone and he really ups the douche factor to 10.\\n\r\nMirai - the ecchi bait, who's just their to be stupid and act cute\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters aren't really worth mentioning because they just aren't.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I tried to look past the bland characters and lack of story, but the human mind can only take so much. Some people might enjoy it if they can look past its weak points, but I couldn't so I just quit it was slightly enjoyable but not enough make you want to come back.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of story, generic characters and normal everything else makes Itsuka Tenma a ball of wasted potential. I came in with high hopes but was let down.\\n\r\nOverall its a forced romance with an off-putting story and some decent fights.\\n\\n",

It has bits of romance/drama/school-life mixed in with an intriguing supernatural storyline. I really thought I had hit a diamond-in-the-rough under appreciated anime.\r\nBut, if you're like me, when episode 11 hits you start to feel like they just quit. The last 2 episodes were not very cohesive with the first 10, and for me it was blatantly distracting so that I couldn't take them seriously.\r\nThis anime is worth a watch, and it's pretty original in its own ways (seriously, it was pretty unique). However,I can see how it's score is justified after completing the last episode.\\n\\n\r\n If you have nothing else to watch, this could very well entertain you though. The last episode is set up like a bridge between a 1st and 2nd season, and if they ever actually made a 2nd season I would probably watch it.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps a little.\\n\\n\r\n*Update* Wow, I didn't realize how many trolls were on MAL. Hopefully they are watching the series a little before marking this Not Helpful entirely..",

            "content": "This is my first review... ever... but i hope you enjoy reading it and find it useful in some way. Everything here is merely my opinion so you may not agree with it. ENJOY!\r\nBrief Review: A quick summary for those that don't wish to spend too much time reading other people's opinions.\r\nStory 2/10: A shallow series of events that force our protagonists onwards. Uninteresting at best...\r\nArt 9/10: I loved the art. Not much to say here. Good art is good.\r\nSound 7/10: The OP and ED were meh-decent. The seiyuu did a nice job for all but one character... Saito Himea sounds very ... \r\nCharacter 2/10:Absolutely HORRIBLE. There is barely any character development for 10 episodes. You are expected to simply accept the character relationships as they come. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10: I watched all 12 episodes in one sitting. I had nothing better to do. It kept me entertained for a couple of hours. I could have done other things to waste my time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10: I'd recommend you watch this if you have time to waste. You may find shaving a puppy to be more worth your time. \\n\\n\r\nNot-So-Brief Review: Just like the above with more words. Seriously... a lot more words... SOME SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED EPISODE 1 :3\\n\\n\r\n  Imagine that you are on your way home after watching Shrek 8. When you arrive, a relative asks you what it was about. You proceed to tell him what it was about. \"This happened, that happened, he said, she said, the end\". That is what this anime is like.\\n\\n\r\n  Lets take a quick look at \"Le genre tag,\" shall we.\\n\r\n  First we have comedy, check. Lots of second-hand jokes that will make you smile if its your first time. A chunk of slapstick here and there and bam.\\n\r\n  Next we have ecchi, check.\\n\r\n  Shounen, check.\\n\r\n  Vampire & supernatural, check & check.\\n\r\n  Finally, Romance... half-check. I am not sure about this... The female lead loves the male lead. How do we know? Cause we are told on episode 1. Chickita 1 loves muchacho 1. We must accept it. Some serious romance dude... It's like an illness you never knew you had. Doctor says \"You are ill,\" you reply with \"Ok!\" You are not given the chance to ask what this illness is, where you may have gotten it, how long it might have been there... \\n\r\n  IT. JUST. IS. \\n\r\n \"But Stoooorm!! Stop exaggerating!\" Oook! We aren't just told the two leads are in love, we are also given a 1 minute slideshow of about 18 scenes of two children and two short 3 minute scenes. OH! and all of that was in the distant past that our protagonist had forgotten but suddenly remembers! WHOA! They totally deserve to be together. It's the next romeo and juliet i tell ya!\\n\\n\r\n  But enough about that... lets take a look at the characters.\\n\r\n  Lets start with the fact that the two females in-love with our male protagonist both have a multiple personality disorder. One of them loses it... She can also cook and will apparently make a good wife in the future. Oh she's a normal human that is pretty much loved by all EXCEPT by the male protagonist that she loves. Lets call her ForeverAloneGirl. \\n\r\n  The other female is the vampire. She's lived for 20,000 years. Has multiple personality disorder that endangers THE WHOLE WORLD. Acts like a sticky glop of mucus that cant stop saying \"I LUV U.\" \\n\r\nOh, she also threatens to kill anyone who hurts the male protagonist. She is the one who injects our main hero with fancy juice that makes him fancy and she does it for a selfish reason... OH, and im just guessing here... but i think she's supposed to be all moe moe... She can't cook or do anything a normal wife is expected to do in the anime world... but atleast she can kill stuff! Lets call her Trololololol. \\n\r\n  Now we have the male lead. Our muchacho of le hour. Our head huncho. He's our village cliche. Guy wants to protect everyone, no problem with that. Guy starts out weak and tries to get stronger, no problem with that. Guy remembers he loves some small girl from 9 years ago and that she's waiting for him so he runs back to her and is all lovey dovey with her cause we are told that this is how it must go so that the makeshift story can somehow work, BIG PROBLEM THERE. Lets call him... troll bait. \\n\r\n  Now we look at our other male protagonist who does not deserve any attention at all... He is our badass, strong, jerk off that thinks he's everything but when it really counts he's just some weak little egotistical wannabe. Lets call him... Alice.\\n\r\n  Finally, we have our loli. Obnoxious little loli. Victim of 3/4th the animes ecchi. Honestly, i think she's just there for her underwear... OH! she can zap stuff while shouting \"Biri Biri\" which gets on my nerve... i have a reason for disliking it... nuff said. Lets call her shaved pears.\\n\r\n  There is a constant stream of random people popping up and getting in the way for almost no reason. Characters F, G, H, I, J & K are just tossed into the mix because we need to focus on someone to cover up the fact that there is no story.\\n\r\n  Now then... how do these characters develop? well, for 83.33% of the anime they don't develop. They remain as they are. Then things change and they become stronger/less annoying/interesting/whatever, but the anime ends before we can even begin to appreciate these changes. \\n\\n\r\n  TO THE ART!!!\\n\r\n  The art was lovely. Characters were nicely drawn. Their movements were fairly smooth and didn't seem choppy. Backgrounds where detailed. The colors where vibrant. The lighting often complimented the atmosphere and the mood. I would have gladly given this a perfect score if more effort was put into the effects. The same effects are used over and over and over.\\n\\n\r\n  Then we has Le Sound. As i stated previously... the Seiyuu did a good job with all but one character and i don't really think it's the Seiyuu's fault. This is another potential perfect score if it wasnt for that meddling vampire girl... The opening and ending were nice and they seemed to fit nicely with the anime and the art. But that annoying vampire girl... GAH! i feel bad for the seiyuu, she has tainted her Curriculum vitae.\\n\\n\r\n  To end this big wall of text... This anime would be something i suggest you add to the very bottom of your to-watch list. It should be the anime you watch when you have absolutely NOTHING better to watch. When you have absolutely NOTHING better to do. Possibly if you are feeling suicidal, watch this for encouragement (not for staying alive though). \\n\\n\r\nFinal score 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI hope you found my review useful or at the very least enjoyed it.\\n",

I will be writing about the anime Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi (A Dark Rabbit has Seven Lives), an I think it is very well done except for a few minor tweaks. First of all, I really liked the romance in it, so if you're like me and love drama, I highly recommend it. If not, there is still a lot of action. All characters have backstories, but this is a good and bad thing. Some characters have backstories that may be confusing or unimportant. But overall, theanime has a little of each genre, and I recommend it to all you otakus! My next review will probably be on Dragon Crisis, so if you are interested in watching it, stay tuned!",

            "content": "Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi. An extremely poor excuse for an anime. There are many things that can go wrong with an anime. This one happened to pretty much nail all of them on the head.\r\nStory: If i had to describe the story of this anime in one word it would be \"confusing\". You would have to be Sherlock Holmes to follow this anime. The story stays straight for the first two episodes, making it fairly easy to follow along. Then it goes and doubles back on you in episode three, and again in episode four. It's as if the anime is trying to bea different story every episode. Like a child who wants to be not only a pirate, an astronaut, or a cowboy. Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi wants to be not only a love story, but a horror/mystery/multi-dimensional/demonic story as well. For a story to be truly good it has to pick a storyline and stick to it. This story seems to have a problem with that. Score: 1\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: The only redeeming factor about this anime is it's art and sound. It has fairly well drawn scenes and the sound is decent too. Score: 7, and 7(art and sound respectively)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters aren't cliche at least. However some of them, much like the story, can't seem to continue to be the same person for more than an episode or two. As for character development, if you consider the character changing their personality in an almost 180 degree direction, then yes. There is a lot of \"development\". Score: 2\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: There was no enjoyment from this anime at all. I had to force myself to watch as much as i did, which isn't all that much. I had to take a break several times throughout each episode to \"brighten up\" the stupendously bored mood from my mind. There isn't any kind of enjoyment to be had from this anime. Even if you're looking for anime that fails so bad that it's funny. This one just doesn't cut it. Score: 1\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If all you do is look at the synopsis for Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi then you might be excited to watch it. Only however until you start actually watching it. This anime has only one even remotely decent thing about it: art/sound. which doesn't count for much when everything else is terrible. Score: 2",

            "content": "So we step into the world of Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi....or as I'd like to call it, pure chaos. I honestly tried giving this anime a chance, as I am a fan of shoujou romance with fantasy aspects, which this anime claims to be.\r\nStory 2/10:\r\n             As the show first opens, we are shown the main protagonist, Taito. He has immortality due to his childhood friend-who-is-also-a-vampire. That's pretty much the basis of it and doesn't go much further than that. The show has no whole plot. There I said it. Throughout the entireshow I honestly had no idea of: what the heck was going on, who the enemy was, or if the main characters were actually going to get together officially or not. The show tries to pick up many different genres like romance, fantasy, action, harem, supernatural, and high school and it is poorly executed. It started off strong with the idea of giving this boy powers that were not as common (only have seven lives until perma-death), and the fact that a vampire girl with some strange pink-blue gradient hair was giving it to him (I feel that the fact that she was a vampire was long forgotten by the second episode). There's no main plot, but rather small mini stories throughout, that don't make a coherent story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10:\\n\r\n            The art in Itsuka Tenma is probably the only decent redeeming quality of the show. It's very atmospheric and can clearly portray the supernatural and mystical settings. It uses bold colors for common items, like changing the night sky and moon to bright pinks and purples, or even making the trees red and black. The female characters all had a unique gradient hair style which I found rather appealing. The male character designs are rather common, with features like extremely spiky hair and school uniforms.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10:\\n\r\n           Not much to really say here. The voice actors are fine as is the music. Nothing really irked me overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10:\\n\r\n          Welcome to where the show really falls flat. I don't really want to go into much detail, because if I do that I'll end up talking about it forever. There is not much more to the characters that can be described in a sentence, \"He wants to be strong to protect the girl he loves.\", \"She's lonely, but she has him and he will help her.\", \"He hates his brother and wants to defeat him.\", and \"She likes soda and to have fun\". Any other character is there purely to fill up the roster. The romance scenes are no more than the protagonists saying each other's names over and over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime was probably the best anime I have ever watched, and I've watched more animated series and movies than any one that i know.  I can't help get myself lost in this series.  So much that I intended to leave my homework on the side lines even as a high level college student.  Personally anyone who considers otherwide is very odd indeed.  Or maybe the story line is far too complicated for them.  It was a great watch and I enjoyed the music even more.  I was highly upset at the spot in which it ended, I figuredwith the climax raging and Liliath Ramiel finally being revealed they would reproduce  a second season.  I believe where it stopped is the only heart break.  Great love triangle story with a lot of respect and a lot of comedy.  I still cannot understand why people find the naked body such a perverted thing.  Better yet, since they arent really human why do you care if there drawn figures are exposed.  I'm sure no one is getting that much pleasure from a fwew clips, when really they are linked to the personality of the characters and become attached.  Some people will never appreciate the hard work that goes into a series liekt his.  With the plot winding and twisting every time you feel yuo understand the story, the only thing you can cling to is the love between Taito and Hiema, and it makes you pick sides throughout the story.  Interestingly enough the sides you pick seem to follow the way you want the story line to go.  Great for student in Highschool or beginning college-level students. Well done.",

            "content": "I'm a big fan of shows that stick to their guns. Shows that clearly know what they are and what they want to be. That tells me that the writers had a theme or plan in mind and put care into their work to make that plan happen. If the characters, theme, mood, setting and music all compliment each other, as far as I'm concerned not much else really matters.\r\nItsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi seems to struggle with the above. It's difficult to make out what this anime wants to be. \"Comedy\" is the first genre listed, but the anime's attempts at comedy are outof place in the darkish setting. As far as romance, there's a lot of it, but it's kind of monotonous. Scenes and characters seem to pop up out of nowhere with little explanation. There isn't much consistency throughout the series, other than everything being really pretty. \"Shiny darkness\" probably best describes it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much of any character development at all, despite the definite potential. Most of the relationships were formed before the series starts. Characters just seem to appear and there's very little background to them. This makes it difficult to feel any attachment to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is awkward and sometimes feels thrown in. I didn't really feel comfortable laughing at anything. There's an entire episode that comes out of nowhere that's dedicated to the comedic aspect of the show, when the episodes around it show no indication of comedy. This and a few other episodes seem to break the continuity of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the romance aspect, it's pretty cut and dried. As the story has little character development, the romantic development never gets very far either. The main characters are \"madly in love\" to start the series. Not much changes with that. It finishes on the same gear it starts on.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty intriguing, even if it's been done before. There are a few plot twists that might not be predictable. \\n\\n\r\nI did feel like the music and art compliment each other pretty well. There is a certain \"shiny darkness\" to the art that sets the mood. The music mostly consists of string orchestra that captures this shiny darkness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi has a decent story but doesn't have much coherence. The aesthetics on their own are nice to look at, but they're wasted on characters that don't match the depth of the art. And the most important factor: Was it enjoyable? I felt like watching it was a chore, and that's never a good thing.",

            "content": "This is probably the most let down i'v been from a show for a long time. This show suffers from one of the worst thing a show can suffer from. That is loss of potential.\r\nI'm hesitant to use the word worst. But this is definitely one of the weirdest structured shows. In the very first episode we are getting all these emotional scenes that just don't work. Because we don't know these characters at all so it's hard to feel sympathy them. I felt bad for the female who was stuck in a torture type of jail secluded from any interaction with anyone else waiting9 years for her only friend to come save her. Tell episode 5 we get stuff you would expect after tons of build up and already set world. But then we get episode 6 and then we get something i would expect from early on episodes. Not to long later we get more serious crap happening. With a not so great ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very iffy. The main male lead is a very bland and very cliche Japanese school boy in anime. But it's worse cause this dude is an idiot and if not even nice to his childhood friend who has a crush on him. He is constantly being dumb and making things more hard. The main female lead is actually interesting. She is a vampire that is meant to be such a strong person that she is feared by just about anyone besides maybe the gods in the world. Yet she rarely ever uses her power and always ends up looking like the typical school girl in need of help. It honestly got to the point i was very frustrated. The only reason she likes the main male lead is because she was lonely as a kid and he was the only one to do notice her. That's it not because of his personality or anything just because she had no one else to be loved by. That is one of the saddest things i'v seen in a anime and it's not intentional at all. As soon as she is free of the prison she clings to him for fear of being alone again.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is in all honesty really beautiful. Same goes along with character designs. They were nailed really well. Especially when i look at the gods of the world. Those designs feel original and creepy enough for how they should be. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple things i would like to write but i'll stop here so this doesn't turn into a big review. \\n\\n\r\nBut there is one thing i would like to mention. The OVA for this is worth mentioning. Sense most people tend to treat the OVA as a 13th episode i'm gonna give a review here. But that is honestly a funny OVA. I was not expecting it and i wish the rest of the show was like that. It is up there with my favorite OVA's.",

They try to glue it together with generic \"lol so funny\" or \"oh so srs for reelz\" characters. It just falls flat. You got your opener 2 part episode that seems o be going somewhere, then its over and we are handed another 2 parter where the lead female (himea) needsto confront the imaginary friends she made in her time confined in that cube thing from the previous 2 parter. the rest just goes down hill fast from an already luke warm start.... so I just gave it the wash and at the end a 1 was all it deserved. Unlikely to get a sequel.\\n\\n\r\nAll suspense is taken from our male leads (taito.... or taito taito taito ad nauseam from our wimpering female lead) ability to regenerate 5-6 times every 15 minutes..... I cannot even rightly recall because it is so inconsequential.... because he just dies like 5 times in 10 seconds then ~contrivance~ he makes it to the next regen interval. Rinse repeat.\\n\\n\r\nOur main female (himea or HIMEEEAGHHH as you will soon dread the male lead yelling her name SHUT UP kay thanks), is apparently super powerful or god damned pathetically weak and useless depending on how you look at it. She apparently has almost no power left, but is \"supposedly\" still super capable, but is always the damsel or sitting in the corner doing squat.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest are a slapdash mess of: \"comedy\" (if you want to label what she does comedy) nekomimi type who flashes her panties in every scene, a \"im serious and powerful oh wait i just got a pole up my ass\" jerk male character, a \"childhood friend\" (every school romance needs one?) who is there for one thing and that's it, spoiling it would spoil one of the later arcs and the entire use of the character, tomboy with candy in mouth female.... and others that are jut as useless and inconsequential.\\n\\n\r\nthe art is fine, all the female characters have a sort of two tone hair scheme going on, one color up top, another near the tips... and himea has this glowey orb stuff that is never questioned \"because anime\".... I actually do not like this style of character design... maybe im too old. You know the bobble head females (big head but mall everything else) but sensibly proportioned males? Anyways it is passable and fluid at most times.\\n\\n\r\nsound is fine, again there is nothing to really take home here.\\n\\n\r\nthis is the first anime in a while that i felt was a total waste of my time (that i finished)",

What I find astonishing is that they setup tons of plot points that they let drop throughout the series and then chose to make the last episode a trashy \"bathhouse\" episode that literally did nothing to wrap up the plot whatsoever. Please enjoy this fan-service so we get renewed because our terrible plot certainly isn't going to do it. \r\nThe characters range from likable and determined to annoying and frustrating. One thing I really liked is MC is basically a weakling with ahuge heart. He keeps trying to fight enemies and get stuff done but then gets wrecked and barely survives. One thing I really HATED was that they took what was a bit of a tragic love story and then turned it into a trashy harem thing in the last episode. This approach was done 100x better in Shakugan no Shana. EVERYTHING was done 100x better in that anime. In fact, instead of watching this just go (re)watch Shakugan no Shana, it is a far better anime that has a similar vibe.\\n\\n\r\nThe story could likely go somewhere awesome but they dropped so many plot points it would take a lot of work and they clearly aren't getting renewed. I didn't think it was awful but I can't really recommend watching it.\\n\\n\r\nStory 4 / Art 8 / Sound 6 / Character 7 / Enjoyment 5 / Overall 5",

I stumbled across this one on some site and thought, \"hey. looks like good art so why not?\" I loved the personalities of the characters, I loved the art, and the music was fair. I really thought this anime had potential, but it didn't go where I was expecting it to go. It could have been a much longer anime with so much more developed plot and neat ideas, but it was so deeply condensed that the timeline of the anime was all over and you reallyhad no clue what happened in between and why what was going on... was going on. It was really confusing, but at the same time, you wanted to see where it was headed. It started off well, but ended badly. I didn't think this anime was a bad idea, just not one that went where it could have gone.",

            "content": "Please note, there is a minor irrelevant spoiler about episode 12, which like i said is minor because the anime may as well have ended at episode 11.\r\nStory : 6\r\nThis anime had a somewhat decent start. The first few episodes were the hook. I took the bait and was rewarded by becoming filleted and cooked for dinner. Don't get me wrong, its not terrible, but if you start good you should end good as well in my opinion. After around episode 3 they started to just shove all kinds of things into the plot, none of which were ever addressed, because around episode 6 thestory degenerated into a lets go to the beach and do cliche things anime. Then a little extra action around 10-11, even though it had little to do with the storyline from before. Then episode 12.......oh god episode 12. basically everyone naked the entire show. the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art though....my eyes literally got wet from the colors penetrating my eyes. In a good way. Probably the reason I didnt have a problem continuing the story. Some things that should have had better quality did not, hence the 9 rating.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the ending to the first few episodes. sound was overall average though, nothing amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\\n\r\nVery average characters here. MC is an idiot and doesnt know how to reject someone. Girls still like him because they are unhealthily obssessed. Most chars backgrounds are nonexistant besides MC/himea.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 Due to the start that managed to pull me in I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning, and the 12th episode furthered my knowledge of science. Pretty characters is pretty much the only thing left to enjoy by that point, otherwise you probably need to bail.",

            "content": "Why not create a romance featuring lots of action, mix it with fantasy and add some odd characters? It may seem weird at first, I never saw one like this before... I liked it... Moreover, I can't understand why Itsuka Tenma got such bad overall ratings... It was one of those animes that kept me really hooked on each episode... Now I'm anxious for a possible second season, knowing that it is still ongoing!\r\nIt's all about Taito and Himea, basically... Both met each other a long time ago and Taito was the one that ended Himea's loneliness and suffering. A contract is made, followed bythe promise of eternal love, suddenly broken after those two got torn apart... An organization named \"Church\" was responsible for sealing the powerful vampire/witch and erase everything Taito knew about her. But a single memory from his past was enough to break the spell that kept Himea imprisoned and, once together again after so long, things would never be the same again...\\n\\n\r\nProtect a potencial menace to Earth, stop a terrible profecy and, still, share his love between two childhood friends... That's what Taito's life became after reuniting with Himea. Focus is separated on both battles and the romance itself, as fights against Church's and Magic Military Forces' occur, at the same time that the relationship between Taito and Himea is shown. Pretty good share of comedy and also basic fanservice included, fun is assured on this one!\\n\\n\r\nOverall art is impressive! Cool hairstyles for male protagonists and a gorgeous color gradient style on main female characters' hairs. Himea's one also had those nice light reflection effects, beautiful... There are a few different ED themes, however the best was the main one, great song!\\n\\n\r\nHimea had lost her faith on humankind, since many wanted her incredible powers, and a powerful spell was already prepared to destroy Earth completely. Taito's affection prevented that from happening and also made her believe there are good people out there... This world is full of disgusting humans... Standing next to someone special is the only way to see beauty on living in here...",
