There are sometimes after ED scenes so don't forget to watch'em. \r\nI'd give it a 7 on 10.\r\nFor those who are having second thoughts on watching it, please give it a try (like 4 episodes at least).

This in terms of outlook if not by moral values and social norms: what is and what is not the \"right\" thing to do. But enough about our politicians. Devils Line is a show about vampires and it sucks ass harder than any of its characters suck blood.\r\nThe story is just really great. Kaneki Ken's long lost vampire brother wants to drink human blood, but not because he is a pervert or hungry, but because if he does not, he turns into a monsterand will kill everyone and anyone surrounding him. Such a real hero this guy. With his moral values he is the real friend of humanity. Unfortunately, all humans are pretty much arseholes who be like \"oh no, your literally evils for succkins  blood.\" except this one girl who be like \"vampire prejudices are racistic and this guy dindu nuffin, btw, I also want to bang him.\". At first, I thought this was weird behavior because the dude is a rapist, stalker and murderer, but then it came clear that she is in fact acting like any internet-leftist would. With this mentality, our main dude is also the r e a l victim here. Amazing recapturing of the mindset, I guess? Then these two go on an epic journey. By epic journey, I mean 12 long episodes where absolutely nothing happens.\\n\\n\r\nFrom its core, Twilight the Animation.. oh sorry, I mean Devils Line, is some sort of 50 Shades of My Vampire Fetishes seinen anime which mainly looks like the combination of multicultural propaganda and Hollywood blockbuster action.... So basically, normal Hollywood blockbuster action. The drama writing on the other hand is so b class it's pointless to even criticize it because it is so obviously bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is just cool. I really like how that random hoe who does not have a personality had different colored hair than the other hoe who does not have a personality. Their voice actresses are also not the one and same person which makes telling them apart even easier. Thanks for that. The opening on the other hand is a masterpiece... at fooling people into thinking this show might actually not be utter garbage, which it is.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is not even ironically fun. It's so bad it's sad. Every vampire romance cliche and trope in one shell spiced with extra sharp edges. On top of that, it takes itself way too seriously for a show which so heavily relies on the given edge. If this show accomplished anything, it is how impressively bad and unenjoyable it is.",

            "content": "This is a preliminary review, watched only 5 episodes.\r\nBut I doubt it will get any better.\r\nThe worst part of this anime is its characters. The main girl has no personality to speak of. Only thing we know about her is that she is a college student, her eyes get wide every-time she sees the main vampire guy. She is basically a collection of generic responses that you would expect from the least developed girl in a badly written Dating Sim. Even those responses have been muted so much and have no real emotion behind them. I have never seen such a weak-willed character with absoluteabsence of agency. She is like an empty shell designed to stumble along wherever the plot takes her.\\n\\n\r\nThe main vampire is the generic dangerous vampire with a bleeding heart. He has an intense, raging, vampire hard-on for the main girl. His character is just a mish-mash of every conceivable trope that you can find in a \"Vampire Love interest\". He is an overprotective, aggressive, over-bearing, rapey, creepy, stalker (but we are supposed to consider him mysterious, tortured and kind).\\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship being the main focus is atrocious and is one red flag after the other. Their first encounter was somewhat rapey that made the girl \"smitten\". Then the vampire repeatedly shows up at girl's apartment balcony, watches her in her sleep, follows her on her way home, shows up at her college etc. The girl is completely Ok with this because those vampiric dark-circled eyes make her wet, I guess. All actions or sexual advances, by the vampire, towards the girl are neither resisted nor encouraged by the girl in any way. Her only response is staying still with her eyes widened. This makes the supposed \"Romantic\" scenes too uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nYou don't feel invested in characters at all, so whenever the plot kicks in you don't even care anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, animation and sound are Ok but barely. The action scenes are lackluster and poorly directed.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a bad Twilight rip-off with some Tokyo Ghoul like elements. It did have some potential, though. But extremely poor execution. If main characters and their relationship were better written then it could have been a decent dark romance. But what a waste of opportunity! considering we rarely, if ever, get to see a good anime romance with mature themes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has no redeeming quality whatsoever. Don't waste your time on it.",

            "content": "[SPOILER WARNING]\r\nSo far I'm really enjoying this story. Vampires live alongside humans but have to be super careful because they are stronger and can easily hurt humans and also go into frenzy and will rape and kill if they see blood. Naturally there is discrimination against them and harsh laws restricting their lifestyles because they are dangerous and it is very easy for them to lose control. Despite that vampires are essentially humans underneath and most just want to live their lives, go to work, fall in love, and not be hated by everyone.\r\nThe problem is how easy it is for them to go outof control and hurt someone and get hooked on blood sex and rock'n roll. The story being told is very interesting but it has been done before: Halfbreed police officer stuck between both sides falls in love with a regular human. That said some new twists get added onto the story that make it different than the other series that have covered the same outline. When the main character goes out of control and gives in to his vampire half those around him are actually in danger for one, and he isn't always in control; they really sell you on the struggle. Also while he is trying to regain control it isn't all epic action series \"the power of friendship will conquer all\" moments, there are sad pathetic \"better lock myself away\" moments that strike me as far more realistic than I've seen the situation depicted as in other series.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally this story is \"edgy\" but I think it has the right amount of edge and isn't just edgy for the sake of being edgy. They get the little touches right like making the main character look sleep deprived all the time because he isn't getting blood and not looking like a glittering prettyboy despite being a dangerous, starved, killing machine. I feel like they might be telling a tragic story for the sake of telling a tragic story and it may turn out that way but so far it has been pretty dang good so I'm in it for the ride to find out.\\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere and tone of this show fits a dark romantic thriller with berserk vampires blending in to the population. To describe the atmosphere as best I can I would say it reminds me of old detective stories where everyone is smoking heavily.\\n\\n\r\nOther than being worried in the future the show will cross over the finely walked line between gritty realism into \"edgy\"/\"stupid emo fantasy\" territory my only immediate problem with the show is I really have a hard time believing the female lead is anything other than a living fleshlight. In the first episode she gets some truly horrible news and she recovers from it almost immediately and seems to get on with her life just fine. (Spoilers for the first episode to follow) I feel like it is totally unrealistic to find out that your best friend has a crush on you and because you rejected him (even though you didn't actually dislike him) he went berserk and raped and murdered other women to avoid hurting you in his out of control state and not blame yourself for it. She neither blames herself for it nor her former best friend and one or both of those things should definitely be going on. To make matters worse she then falls for the guy that arrested her best friend. That's a whole new level of friendzoned. It just feels like other than being a nice girl that cooks a mean hotpot she has absolutely 0 personality. As it is still early in the show I hope this is something they expand upon in the future.\\n\\n\r\nThe male lead going after her becomes even more questionable as his female coworker is constantly flirting with him and has way more personality. She's a 10/10 future trollmom. Not to mention she is also a vampire so he wouldn't need to worry about seeing her blood and eating her alive one day or hurting her on accident. Sure the female lead is nice and the shy girl with big tits flavor of pretty but underneath the tropes there isn't even a skeleton. All she does is act shy and blush. (Spoilers for episode 2 to follow) She almost gets raped by a guy and guess what she does the entire time? Acts shy and blushes. I don't dislike the female lead because there really isn't anything to dislike but the partner clearly shows they can at least make a female with some personality so I really hope they develop her character in the future.\\n\\n\r\nRight now I'm giving it an 8/10 overall and suggest watching it if you like a good tragic romance story or gritty vampire thriller. It feels a lot like a cross between Blood+ and Psycho Pass (season 1).",

            "content": "! I have not read the manga and am judging the anime only !\r\n!! Contains spoilers !!\r\nFrom what I read before, this anime sounded fairly promising for the vampire genre. \"It\u2019s not your typical Twilight story\", they said. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s worse than that.\r\nThe first 15 minutes were decent, the art isn\u2019t my favourite but it\u2019s not something that ticks me off much. Then we have a few characters, one that we thought would be the main, then gets arrested 5 minutes later. And the best part: your local vampire cop sexually assaulting Tsukasa; the mc who, of course, falls in love with him andhas wet dreams each night. Just wonderful. And this while Tsukasa is \u201cafraid of men\u201d (I understand why after episode 2). Guess she just has a thing for half vampires.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t mind clich\u00e9 love stories, but uh, not this way. And let\u2019s not forget that our vampire cop is also a stalker and probably watches our round-eyed mc sleep, just like his cousin Edward.\\n\\n\r\nDon't spend your time watching this if you want something of decent quality. I have a hard time dropping a series I already started with so I'll suffer some more in your place.",

            "content": "I\u2019m just going to throw this out here. How many people actually enjoy series about humans and vampires these days? It felt like I haven\u2019t in ages. Devil\u2019s Line adheres to a exploration about the nature of humans and vampires in a modern world society. We got humans and vampires (otherwise, known as \u201cdevils\u201d) living in our everyday neighborhood. Coming into this show, Devil\u2019s Line felt like a copy-paste that I\u2019ve seen in many vampire theme shows before. It isn\u2019t anything special.\r\nThere\u2019s a joke out these days that falls in the line of \u201cstill a better love story that Twilight\u201d. Devil\u2019s Line does have vampiresand some romance elements after all. However, the show itself gives a more mature feeling that is beyond just teenage romance. What Devil\u2019s Line fails to do is make a story that stands out on its own. The story connects a vampire named Anzai together with a college student named Tsukasa Taira. She is saved by this mysterious character after being attacked by a vampire. It also turns out that Anzai is a vampire himself and has to control his bloodlust. The catch is that the show tests his nature as a vampire while also being hunted down by a vampire extermination organization known as the CCC. Sound familiar?\\n\\n\r\nNow the show itself does take itself quite seriously. I say this because there\u2019s hardly any jokes and most of that similar content relies on dark humor even when there\u2019s room to throw in those moments. In essence, you should expect a mature anime that deals with interspecies romance. The main characters, Anzai and Tsukasa are not much alike beyond just their origins. From the start, I can say easily that Anzai is a brooding man without much words. On the other hand, Tsukasa is a type of girl who is very open to others and isn\u2019t afraid to speak her mind. However, she is still very shy and not capable of dealing with dangers on her own most of the time. Anzai has to play the role of a protector in the series. It also puts Tsukasa in danger whenever the two are together because of his own bloodlust. The series adds tension and psychology nearly every episode as we see how he struggles to control his urges. I think on most part, it\u2019s a repetitive gimmick that most vampire series relies on these days. Series such as Vampire Knight and Tokyo Ghoul has done that before. Even real life popular drama TV has done so in the past such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer or The Vampire Diaries. They all carry the burden of a character having to deal with their inhuman nature. Devil\u2019s Line isn\u2019t too different as the show tests the water between Anzai and Tsukasa\u2019s relationship. Unfortunately, it fell flat because of how dry and empty it is. There\u2019s no doubt they have chemistry but their relationship feels unreal and I find it hard to root for them as a couple. The two are hardly compatible either because of their circumstances. It\u2019s a forbidden romance not meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nAs a story about two different races, you can definitely expect conflicts to erupt in their society. There are several episodes that involves Anzai being targeted in assassination-style operations. It seems members of the CCC aren\u2019t afraid to take any risks to kill vampires such as the case of sniper Zero Seven (Nanako Tenjo). As a main protagonist, you can definitely expect Anzai to be protected by plot armor. He\u2019s not going to drop like a fly even despite fighting against the odds. Anzai is definitely not \u201cOP\u201d though as he struggles to survive but to me, the show doesn\u2019t make his survivalist role any unique. The plot is stale as we don\u2019t learn too much about his character. There\u2019s definitely some background storytelling in the series for the main characters but none of them felt compelling. Tsukasa is also too human for a character that goes under little changes throughout the series. The only other character that may arouse curiosity would be Kohannes Kleeman, a mysterious white hair man. He appears in the show in later episodes and makes the audience wonder what his real intentions are. Unlike Anzai, he is quite blunt and behaves carefree around others. I\u2019d say that he is perhaps too honest to point where it\u2019s hard to tell whether he is telling the truth or lying. To me, Kleeman is an antithesis of Anzai. He is difficult to manipulate and always seems to be in control of himself. His behavior brings in a lighter side of the show although I really can't find that appealing. The show is still very moody and pushes the idea of a dark modern fantasy at every chance it gets.\\n\\n\r\nPlatinum Vision is a rather obscure studio that I don\u2019t think many fans are familiar with. Their previous work actually includes another vampire series called Servamp although that is far more lighthearted than this anime. Unfortunately, the overall animation quality is mediocre at best. This is my honest impression as the character designs looks generic to the core without any special features about them. The setting takes place in a modern city that you can find in just about any similar shows. Oh but you\u2019re wondering, what about the vampires? Do they look convincing? On the surface, the answer is yes but that doesn\u2019t make them stand out much. The characteristics of these vampires includes fangs and their bloodlust nature that feels like if you\u2019ve seen it once, you\u2019ve seen it all. There\u2019s also a lot of fan service that teases the relationship between Anzai and Tsukasa. Some episodes really flirts with the idea of whether they will or will not have sex. Thus, expect a lot of kissing and it leaves some to the imagination. There\u2019s not much censoring in terms of the graphic violence although isn\u2019t never really ventures into the gore territory.\\n\\n\r\nTo carry a show like this, you would definitely need some acceptable characters. Anzai and Tsukasa\u2019s voices are a total contrast of each other. Anzai sounds like one with little emotion while Tsukasa\u2019s voice sounds alive. On some instances, I wonder just how much the creator wanted us to accept them. In the meantime, the OST is mostly eerie with a melancholic quiet tune during some of the more emotional scenes. The theme songs are what people would easily designate as edgy. I don\u2019t like using that word around much but it is what it is.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching Devil\u2019s Line, I felt like walking out of a theater realizing I could have done something else better with my money. I can literally go around online and find another show under the \u201cvampire\u201d tag. To me, Devil\u2019s Line took the risk of trying to revitalizing the horror genre of interspecies relationship. What ends up happening is a show with few surprising twists but instead loses to underwhelming horror formulas. Maybe someday, we\u2019ll get a memorable horror series of where we can look back and say \u201cthat\u2019s pretty cool!\u2019",

Perhaps a bit, in order to strengthen the conviction that this title is yet another waste of time that you cannot recover \\n\\n\r\nThe premise sums up the concept of this schlock, a concept that has been done to death before and that was never fantastic to begin with.\\n\r\nVampire/ Devil or whatever the MC identifies as falls for bland walking plot device that is the female MC and he's facing struggles to maintain his humanity blah blah blah and we're supposed to rot for their awkward relationship , because it's so authentic and totally not forced for the sake of fitting the shoujo quota and wet some prepubescent girls, truly mature, innovative and not some cookie cutter romance! 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fairly well done, but who could care about it when anything else is plainly rubbish. 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, even in the sound department I have managed to loathe it, especially those nauseating sound effects like moans , groans , sobs that reminded me of a tortoise mating with a croc shoe (you could Google that to have an exact idea about what I'm referring to)\\n\r\nAs I've mentioned above, the opening is an uninspired borderline attack on titan attempt and doesn't even fit the thematic of the show, the choreography of the visuals makes no sense whatsoever.\\n\r\nNot that the voice acting would be the major flaw of this title, but the way the lines are delivered falls flat and makes the wannabe emotional moments embarrassing to witness. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters...exactly what I was talking about above , bland, generic, cannot sympathize with them , obnoxious and awkward to watch. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAs for the enjoyment, there wasn't any , not even a second , I'd rather stub my toe in the furniture every ten minutes than watch 20 minutes of this atrocity per week.\\n\r\nThere are a lot of bad shows out there , but this one tops them all through the fact that I cannot see a single positive in it, not even if I turn my brain off while watching , it's cringe worthy in every single way and deserves to be the punching bag of the season.",

            "content": "Personally, I would consider my standards quite high when it comes ratting a show, and I don't give 9/10 to just anything, but this show deserves it. \r\nLet's start with the story, vampires. Sounds pretty basic, one could even say it's a topic done to death. This is where the show gets it right. Vampires and devils were creatures that made you cry when you were a little boy/girl/other, they were scary, frightening, horrifying, one would even say spine-chilling. Looking back when I was a little child, there was nothing more scary then a pair of big fangs sticking from my uncles mouth. He usedto put fake fangs around and bite me all over, it really hurt like hell. I remember trying to tell me parents about it but they didn't believe me. Anyways, I digress. The show does a good job in portraying the dark world in which the story unravels, devils are threatening creatures and are something the characters are constantly reminded of. What I like particularly about this show and what really makes it stand out are the references. The thing I value in a show that focuses on references,(like Gintama for comedy example ) is that it awards people who pay attention. They get to experience the show in it's true fullest form. While people who just watch it halfheartedly miss out on half the experience. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are compelling and realistic, there is a lot of blood in this show, which only shows it's not advisable for young children to watch it. Without getting into spoilers, the main cast has an interesting dynamic which works off the dark setting. I won't call the show profound but I won't pretend It didn't make me stop and think about certain things.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is solid, nothing spectacular but nothing to laugh at. Same with the sound, it does it's job and while it's not something I would listen on my free time it did grow on me, especially the OP.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I think this show is pretty underrated, MAL scores really don't do it justice. And unlike the horrible Tokyo Ghoul:re, which is also airing this season and shares similar themes. Devils Line at least isn't laughably awful.",

            "content": "I think this is a show where we all have a common, itching thing going for it:\r\nAn awful Twilight-esque story with Tokyo Ghoul elements that are meshed in and didn\u2019t really fit well with bad to poor execution.\r\nDevil\u2019s Line tells the story that was founded on Twilight\u2026only that there\u2019s coherent but sometimes confusing or misunderstood storytelling, but nothing exciting nor engaging. It\u2019s the equivalent of \u201cHey, you\u2019re a vampire with your fang teeth and I\u2019m a normal girl, let\u2019s date!\u201d And that sums up how I felt with the entire premise of the series. Not to mention that they have added the police-like feel ofbetrayal and camaraderie just to get you invested in the series, and guess what? It added a tiny breath of fresh air, though I can tell that most people will not care for this, and for that, I will tell you to read the manga adaptation that\u2019s not as great, but you will understand what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nSo\u2026ok, human and vampire. What could go wrong? The answer? Anti-vampire groups, that\u2019s why! Most notably the CCC, who works as a police target group in disguise under the boss Kikuhara Kirio, monitoring the main group\u2019s vampire movements and executing what they feel is right of a vampire-free world. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters literally write the same story as Twilight, only that the former does it WAY better than what\u2019s found here. Tsukasa Taira is NOT the equivalent, but a dumbed-down version of Bella Swan, mute, expressionless, and there as a plot device to keep the story entertaining as its romance-supernatural genre can go. The same could be said for the MC vampire, Anzai Yuuki, a half-vampire, the dumb-down version of Edward Cullen, trying to control his half-demon, half-human powers and constantly breaks the mold for his police group (Public Safety Division 5 F Squad) into trying to live in a world that\u2019s Twilight (where humans and vampires can co-exist). Johannes Kleeman as a half-vampire, I\u2019d say he is only the handful of good characters that doesn\u2019t have a backstory, but yet is kind to everyone, is intelligent and is able to discern stuff very well. Other characters are generic, bland and uninteresting, the only one-liners I can say about characterization (if there was ever any to begin in the first place).\\n\\n\r\nI have never personally heard of the new studio Platinum Vision before, most particularly they made Servamp (with Brain\u2019s Base) and the spin-off from the Saiyuuki Reload series, but this anime just proves that just like many 2nd or 3rd rate studios, it falls in the category of being mediocre and bad. The manga-to-anime adaptation\u2026is quite frankly nothing more of good. I get it that the producers tried their best to replicate the manga, but try as hard as they can, it still falls short. The animation is less than Tokyo Ghoul quality, more so than ripping it off, it\u2019s bearable to watch but when the action gets heavy, RIP animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is another story in and itself. I get it that the setting has to be the super \u201cedgy\u201d feel, but they are only OK at best, nothing to write home about. Both the OP and EDs are unmemorable, but if I had to decide the good out of the bad, it will be Mamoru Miyano\u2019s ED that takes the icing on the cake. Action scenes feeling empty, there\u2019s not a ton of sound and sometimes poorly used.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of it all, is Devil\u2019s Line a worthy \u201cTwilight: The Animation\u201d? Certainly not, and it doesn\u2019t come close to touching anything that is noteworthy nor remembering about. I\u2019d guess for die-hard fans of Twilight, give this series a try and see how fast it sweeps you off so much that it becomes unwatchable. For people who earnestly thought this is a good anime, it\u2019s not, so break out of that trance already.\\n\\n\r\nWas it engaging? I\u2019d say no, and please don\u2019t waste your time if you desire decent quality-made shows.\\n",

            "content": "Yo, Anzai!  Four simple words: rub it out, man.\r\nSince the dawn of humankind, men have been dealing with unyielding pent-up sexual energy, matched only by those squeaking dolphins who use eels as fleshlights (look it up people!).  To prevent oneself from looking like a crazed, sex-driven \u201cvampire.\u201d  It is necessary to use thy hand to complete thy deed; thus, returning oneself to a state of poise, and level-headedness.   \r\nThat may sound a bit convoluted for an edgy, vampire love story resembling that which shall not be named *cough* Twighlight *cough*, but think about it: they spent twelve episodes with Anzaiavoiding or having limited/monitored contact with Taira, just because the dude couldn\u2019t control himself.  Not exactly original when it comes to the vampire medium, but they did manage to throw in a handful of interesting nuances to captivate the viewer\u2019s attention.  Whether or not those ideas worked, is another story altogether.\\n\\n\r\nTaking inspiration from today\u2019s outrage culture, Devil\u2019s Line injects an aggressive, militant public, who despises the presence of vampires in their society.  They shout, they scream, and they annoy a hell of a lot of people.  But it does provide an accurate representation of how people would react, when \u201cthreatened\u201d by a superior being.  That being said, what Devil\u2019s Line fails to do, is hone in on this aspect from the viewpoint of one of the victims.  Anzai\u2019s dad killed 10 innocent people when he entered his state of vampire-rage; however, we are only given a perspective of how he was provoked into this egregious act, by humans that killed his girlfriend.  Why not show the families that were affected by his \u201cblind\u201d atrocities, highlighting the odious nature of provoked vampires.  The way it is presented, more or less, makes an unequivocal assumption that all humans are vicious creatures, and vampires are ethical, pacifists, who only attack because of their predisposition for consuming blood.\\n\\n\r\nThe paucity of character development is a severe hindrance in this series.  With the exception of Anzai, everyone adheres to a formulaic routine, evaporating much of the intrigue from the viewer\u2019s perspective.  Anzai, however, displays a certain level of growth, especially when he shows affection towards Taira, forcing him to restrain himself from the fear of losing control.  The scene in the bedroom, when they are being monitored from the outside, exemplifies Anzai\u2019s internal struggle with himself, and how he must always maintain his concentration to inhibit his vampiric tendencies.  In addition, the scene where Taira force feeds Anzai with her own blood, demonstrates the dissociation Anzai feels when his vampiric-self seethes to the surface.  This sort of hints at the rage-blinders we all experience when our emotions assume the driver seat, and rationality gets thrown out of the window.  The anime, in my estimation, would have had better success if Taira\u2019s emotions were investigated with equal exploration.  It is understood that she is devoted to Anzai, but she seems too careless with her own personal safety around him.  Her love for him is unquestioned, but one has to wonder if someone in her position would really act this faithful when her arm is nearly bitten off.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, it\u2019s not a particularly bad series, it just fails to capitalize on its own conceptual themes.  Oddly enough, the series emulates Taira and Anzai\u2019s relationship: a gentle foreplay of emotions, but nothing substantial ever happens.",

            "content": "TL;DR:A combination of mysteries and romance,a nice mixture indeed\r\nPeople are refused to watch this show by judging the show from the beginning,saying that it's a rip-off Tokyo Ghoul,Twilight and containing a heavy amount of fan-service,but however I come to realise that this show is not that shallow,it eventually turns out pretty well and worth to expect.\r\n+Overall it feels realistic\r\n+some of the actions are pretty good\r\n+dark atmosphere is presented well\r\n+the conflicts are described pretty well\r\n+strong voice actors base\r\n+It's later revealed that there're some mysteries behind the incident\r\n-Rich story content,but the story presentation can be improved \r\n-characters can be described more,like the round-eye girl,named Tsukasa\r\n-inadequate soundtracks\r\nIn general,DevilsLine can be summed up within two subjects.\\n\\n\r\n1. The romance among the main characters,Tsukasa and Anzai.\\n\\n\r\n2. Conflicts among the vampires themselves and the relationship between humans and vampires \\n\\n\r\n-The romance\\n\\n\r\nRomance is probably one of the most exciting things in life,probably Tsukasa has the same feeling and she's a kinda shy type of person,who don't have much ideas about vampires and Anzai.Generally,people saying that the romance scenes are kinda awkward,but I think it's kinda realistic,since to a young-hearted girl,who don't have much experience in facing romance,it's pretty sure that she'll feel kinda nervous,like the scenes from the show,so I expected she don't have much feelings during romance moments.In fact,I feel the another way around,which I feel they're kinda realistic.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the events happened,the bond between Anzai and Tsukasa become stronger.They wanted to protect each other in several dangerous situations at all costs even though they're being restricted.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance is pretty well made and exciting,it doesn't conflict with the events happened and it developed through with the mysteries (which I will go through this later)\\n\\n\r\n-Conflicts\\n\\n\r\nIn Devils Line,humans may have bad feelings about vampires,since they can't control themselves when they see blood and may destroy people's life.Others may understand their needs and provide their needs,different people have different opinions about vampires in this show.On the other hand,vampires themselves also know some people have bad impression to them and feel worried,yet for Anzai,he's in love with Tsukasa,a human girl,which is pretty sure will have large conflicts among them.These are the features that this show has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nIt's later revealed that there're several mysteries about the settings itself,Anzai's co-workers and his past,(Who's controlling behind the scenes?What's Anzai's real character?),which I'm not going to spoil them,since it's relatively interesting and can't be explained in short.All I can say that it's very entertaining to resolve these questions one by one,especially for mystery anime fans.Devils Line did tried to explain the questions one by one throughout events and romance,an interesting combination indeed.In a nutshell,Devils Line surely has great character and story development,especially on Anzai.I'm surely that you'll find certain amount of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal opinions on the endings are pretty positive,although some people may find it unsatisfying,it does feel logical and realistic and I didn't find the ending bad,though it could be better if the mysteries can be resolved more completely at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThere're a few things I do think Devils Line can do better,like the story presentation.Although I just mentioned that Devils Line has lots of things to offer,it's in a relatively fast pace in several moments,probably because of the episode limit,it has to be done quickly.Also,at the end,though throughout events,the relationship between Tsukasa and Anzai developed well,I do think that Tsukasa isn't developed pretty well,especially about her personal past and her feelings about vampires before.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound are fine in this show.The colour visuals are well made in this show,this show is pretty good in portraying the dark scenes,but it'll be better if some of the actions can be done smoothly,rather than in a weird slow motion.They have a strong voice actors base,which is awesome for voice actors fans,but they don't have put much efforts on soundtracks,the amount of soundtracks in this show is pretty insufficient.Op and Ed are fine though.\\n\\n\r\nI could say that Devils Line isn't a masterpiece,but it did well in many aspects and satisfying the romance,mystery anime fans.Do give it a try for at least finishing half of the whole series and don't judge the book by its cover.Perhaps at the end,you maybe appreciated with this series.\\n\\n\r\nStory:7/10\\n\r\nAnimation:6.5/10\\n\r\nSound:7/10\\n\r\nCharacters:7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8/10\\n\r\nOverall:7/10 (B)",

I also was hoping to get more information on the main character and what happened to him in the past. So that was also a little unsatisfying.\r\nThe most entertaining part of the show for me personally was the relationship between the two main characters. I always enjoy when the guy is trying to control himself for his lady and is trying to protect her.\r\nI enjoyed the show throughout until it came to the ending. The ending was not really as good as I was hoping. Ibelieve it is still worth watching but know that the ending will be eh. But overall it was a good show.",

            "content": "Disclaimer; I haven't watched more than first few initial episodes at the time this is written in and it will not resemble a review. MAL doesn't have \"opinion\" tab and the forum is full of people lashing at each other so this is the only way to convey my \"feelings\". It will also be spoiler-free as I won't mention any specific events from the anime. I might end up using word \"shallow\" a lot. \r\nVery short TL;DR at the bottom, I do suggest to read it all if you wonder whether this show is worth your time. \r\nI pulled this show and wanted to watchit because of the theme. I love more adult-oriented shows with dark theme and proper romance, I also like vampire-ish themed shows. Another thing the show has going for itself are the voice actors and actresses, bunch of very good names. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is bad though and it isn't my opinion as I'd call it a statement/fact and I am going to vindicate what I just wrote.\\n\\n\r\n1. The supernatural(setting) and first episodes. The show throws you into a world with fictional elements as a main theme without explaining anything. This can in theory work if it's written/used well, the elements are explained as time passes (or not at all in some cases) to not dump everything on reader/viewer (and to keep the show/reading material mysterious) but it doesn't work here because they throw you into a world, hint at supernatural as \"urban legends, stories ...\" in conversations and then have those elements take literally 98% of the screen-time. You are blind and confused which completely destroys any bond you may be trying to build with the show (characters/story/lore/trivia). The writing is very very shallow, there is nothing to it, it is extremely rushed to a point where it starts making no sense which in connection to what I just wrote just...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters - Weird. Hell I'd even like the weird if they weren't just empty shells (no personalities, no explanation, no build up, no background fuuu). You aren't properly even introduced to them and that doesn't change as the episodes go on, you are basically as blind in episode 6 as you were before you even started watching. You get nothing and are supposed to care (and the shows acts like you care from the episode 1) just like with the theme/setting.\\n\\n\r\n2. Drama, romance and musical background. While the show does qualify as both drama and romance both aspects are completely hideous.\\n\\n\r\nDrama - the \"dramatic\" scenes are escalated from nothingness (and from the get-go) and you as a viewer are supposed to care but you rationally can't. You don't know what is happening, why is it happening, you don't know the characters that are taking part. As explained in first part, you know nothing about the world or anything else actually so how are you supposed to care about dramatic scenes? Rushed is too simple of a word n so is shallow.\\n\\n\r\nRomance - The show contains romance straight out from the beginning. There is no build up, you don't know the characters (and they don't know each other either btw) but are thrown into \"romantic\" situations which come out of nowhere without any sign or buildup. To make it even worse (and this applies to the drama part as well) the music (except op which is nice) completely ruins any and all scenes (as if they weren't ruined enough already). I have no idea whether the person picking the music and putting it in is a genius or an intern. To elaborate on that, the music and it's timing is horrible but on the other hand it completely fits the shallow writing and badly put together scenes. \\n\\n\r\nComedy - The show isn't labelled as comedy (although it seems to be one big joke) there is a comedy. There are \"funny\" situations to lighten the \"mood\" but I don't get why they are there, this show isn't supposed to be  rom-com with questionable humor. I will say though, that I did actually smile during those but that's only because Yoshitsugu's dry laugh makes me smile under any circumstances. \\n\\n\r\nVA - God bless the voice actors. The only good part of this but not even their hard work can redeem what this show is doing.\\n\\n\r\nTo give you a TLDR; The writing and composition are shallow and straight out horrible in all of their aspects which kills everything else. You are thrown into a world with characters and themes but the show fails to explain and establish a(ny kind of) connection. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all I just wrote I am not saying that people can't or shouldn't like it. Everyone is different and people like many things (good or bad, regardless of the quality) but that doesn't change quality of this show (or the things) but I feel like people take show rating here as an expression of their enjoyment which they shouldn't (as according to tool-tips it in no case should reflect that).\\n\\n\r\nSome people also compared this to twilight which is fair compaction actually. Speaking strictly about the movies, the quality of writing and composition is very similar (in a bad way). As I am writing this the \"average\" rating is 6.5, which according to MAL is between fine and good. This show is nor fine nor good, the only things I'd consider even average is the art and voice acting rest is bad/LQ.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't touched everything that can be said which may change if I turn this into full review. This was supposed to be very short to just give people heads-up (and to vent my thoughts), looking at it, it already is longer than expected. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT; This review has the show rated as 3(poor) while my personal rating has it rated as 4(bad), that is due to the difference in tool-tips. Also, if you aren't interested in the theme/VA or are looking for exceptional art you should personally count my ratings as 1 lover (dreadful/very bad).",

            "content": "Well, many people give this anime not so great rating and I can understand why, but my opinion on this anime is pretty different. (And my review has nothing to do with manga, because I have started to read it yet)\r\nAt first, I wouldn't compare this to any anime,- some people compare it to Tokyo Ghoul. Yes, when I read about this comparing and thought about it more, there are small things similar to TG. But the review shouldn't be based on 'It's better/worse than this anime', for sure not between Tokyo Ghoul and Devils Line,- both animes have many differences, both are original.\r\nThen yes,it's that type of anime, which isn't for everybody, not much people will like it. There are many reasons, why could you not like it, but contrariwise, you can find many reasons to like this anime too!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe plot can seem bit weird, unusual,- Actually is it. The relationship between Anzai and Tsukasa plays the main role in the story, especially in the beginning. Soon there is more and more action and dealing with other things, main characters' relationship is still important, but it isn't only about it already. I like it, but I acknowledge it's weaker part of anime, even last episodes were quite confusing for me. The last episode wasn't bad, maybe I could count that as end if it was just first season, but I think the plot went bit fast in the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI haven't been sure which rate should I give to art, but eventually,- 9/10 suits it well. I think it's great part of anime, it isn't perfect, but I have no problems with art, I very like it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to art. The sound doesn't contain I would remember for a long time, but also anything bad, so I am okay with it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, I know not everybody actually likes main character, Tsukasa. It's true that she is very common, has nothing special (except that she doesn't have any fear, can do anything), but she seems bit likeable for me. Sometimes even I stare, wondering how she could behave so calm, but that is probably only thing I don't like when it comes to Devils Line characters.\\n\r\nAnzai is great character, was interesting from the beginning and still there are many things I would like to know about him, so don't have any problem with him. Lee and support characters we can see aren't bad too, overall everyone is original in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHow I said, when I don't count last episodes that were more weird for me, I've been enjoying this anime. It has its charm, originality, that forced me to enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI have this rating only with few animes, but I feel, I should give this one 9/10 too. It isn't perfect, but I find it very interesting and I don't regret watching it at all.",

            "content": "When Devil's Line started airing, I definitely wanted to like it, but as it continued, it got harder and harder to make excuses for how mediocre it ended up. At first, watching Devil's Line felt kind of like a guilty pleasure, you know the kind you get when you're enjoying Twilight or something similar, but the pleasure bit faded as the show continued came to a conclusion. There were times that I considered dropping it, but I'm glad that I didn't. It wasn't that Devil's Line was terrible, it was just that it was inconsistently good. More on what I mean in a minute.\r\nTechnically speaking,Devil's Line was a bit of a mixed bag. Sometimes the animation was pretty solid, but other times, it was really choppy. I would love to say that the choppy bits were few and far between, but in reality, it was pretty consistent. That being said, it seemed to be isolated to mostly the beginning of the series, but it could be that I just got used to it's choppiness. The sound was strange too, especially when the someone went full \"Devil Mode\". I get what they were trying to accomplish with their sound mixing in those segments, but it ended up being less creepy in the way that they wanted and more creepy in an amusing way. However, the sound isn't all bad, most of the music was pretty good, especially then ending, which kept me going for a couple of those weird episodes towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nI'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy the premise of Devil's Line, especially since that's what drew me to it anyway. In fact, the themes of racism and segregation between Devil's and humans were the most interesting parts of the show. Unfortunately, those interesting themes got pushed to the side for a mediocre love story for most of the run-time. Not to say that Tsukasa and Anzai's dynamic wasn't interesting at first, but it got shallow and generic pretty quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major problems Devil's Line fell into had more to do with its overwhelming cast of side characters. And by that, I don't mean that there were countless side characters, but more that they were indistinguishable. Most of the designs were generic and they're referred to by name most of the time, which makes it extremely confusing, since you don't have a clear face to put with the name. Every time a side character's name was mentioned, I would struggle for a few minutes to figure out who they were talking about. Maybe I'm exaggerating this issue, but it certainly felt like they weren't doing a good job at making the designs unique enough to stand out, especially the police force characters.\\n\\n\r\nI think that illustrates Devil's Line's inconsistencies well enough, and I haven't even touched on the story at all. I won't go into detail, but I'll say that it's the same as everything else in this show, inconsistently good, with quite a bit of bad. I wouldn't not recommend Devil's Line, but I would definitely not tell anyone that it's a masterpiece. Your enjoyment depends on your interest in the relationship of the main characters and how much the premise and themes hold your attention. If those aren't enough, you aren't going to find much else.",

But with a twist. The vampires or Devils dont need to drink blood. But when they see your blood the want to rape/kill/drink you \r\nThis show ain't even bad, it just could have been so much better. \r\nStory 6: Its your average \"Oh there are bad creatures in this world ,but they arent actually bad\" anime and is kinda predictable. There were somewhat minor plot twist and which made the story a little bit better,  but I can't call it good yet. The romance is this show was trash, but hey, still a better love story then Twillight.  Sorry, but for the MC to almost have raped you is NOT a turn on(or it is, idk what you into)\\n\\n\r\nArt 7: The art was clean and kinda suitting for this kind of anime. It had some minor flaws, but is quitte good\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: LOVED the ending song and the OP aint even bad too. The music throughout the show was OK.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5: THe MC and his girl dont have no personality whatsoever. Nothing for them to actually stand out. They're relationship is build on plot and nothing really special. The only good thing about Anzai was that he had an interesting backstory, but that's kinda it. The Side characters were dope and Lee was a savage. If it wasn't for him i would give this 4 or 3.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8: I enjoyed the show though. It had action and the story was interesting. The romance was cute. Trash, but cute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7: Dont expect a lot from this anime, but if you look for Tokyo ghoul type of anime, but a little bit worse, this show is for you.

There are sometimes after ED scenes so don't forget to watch'em. \r\nI'd give it a 7 on 10.\r\nFor those who are having second thoughts on watching it, please give it a try (like 4 episodes at least).

This in terms of outlook if not by moral values and social norms: what is and what is not the \"right\" thing to do. But enough about our politicians. Devils Line is a show about vampires and it sucks ass harder than any of its characters suck blood.\r\nThe story is just really great. Kaneki Ken's long lost vampire brother wants to drink human blood, but not because he is a pervert or hungry, but because if he does not, he turns into a monsterand will kill everyone and anyone surrounding him. Such a real hero this guy. With his moral values he is the real friend of humanity. Unfortunately, all humans are pretty much arseholes who be like \"oh no, your literally evils for succkins  blood.\" except this one girl who be like \"vampire prejudices are racistic and this guy dindu nuffin, btw, I also want to bang him.\". At first, I thought this was weird behavior because the dude is a rapist, stalker and murderer, but then it came clear that she is in fact acting like any internet-leftist would. With this mentality, our main dude is also the r e a l victim here. Amazing recapturing of the mindset, I guess? Then these two go on an epic journey. By epic journey, I mean 12 long episodes where absolutely nothing happens.\\n\\n\r\nFrom its core, Twilight the Animation.. oh sorry, I mean Devils Line, is some sort of 50 Shades of My Vampire Fetishes seinen anime which mainly looks like the combination of multicultural propaganda and Hollywood blockbuster action.... So basically, normal Hollywood blockbuster action. The drama writing on the other hand is so b class it's pointless to even criticize it because it is so obviously bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is just cool. I really like how that random hoe who does not have a personality had different colored hair than the other hoe who does not have a personality. Their voice actresses are also not the one and same person which makes telling them apart even easier. Thanks for that. The opening on the other hand is a masterpiece... at fooling people into thinking this show might actually not be utter garbage, which it is.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is not even ironically fun. It's so bad it's sad. Every vampire romance cliche and trope in one shell spiced with extra sharp edges. On top of that, it takes itself way too seriously for a show which so heavily relies on the given edge. If this show accomplished anything, it is how impressively bad and unenjoyable it is.",

            "content": "This is a preliminary review, watched only 5 episodes.\r\nBut I doubt it will get any better.\r\nThe worst part of this anime is its characters. The main girl has no personality to speak of. Only thing we know about her is that she is a college student, her eyes get wide every-time she sees the main vampire guy. She is basically a collection of generic responses that you would expect from the least developed girl in a badly written Dating Sim. Even those responses have been muted so much and have no real emotion behind them. I have never seen such a weak-willed character with absoluteabsence of agency. She is like an empty shell designed to stumble along wherever the plot takes her.\\n\\n\r\nThe main vampire is the generic dangerous vampire with a bleeding heart. He has an intense, raging, vampire hard-on for the main girl. His character is just a mish-mash of every conceivable trope that you can find in a \"Vampire Love interest\". He is an overprotective, aggressive, over-bearing, rapey, creepy, stalker (but we are supposed to consider him mysterious, tortured and kind).\\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship being the main focus is atrocious and is one red flag after the other. Their first encounter was somewhat rapey that made the girl \"smitten\". Then the vampire repeatedly shows up at girl's apartment balcony, watches her in her sleep, follows her on her way home, shows up at her college etc. The girl is completely Ok with this because those vampiric dark-circled eyes make her wet, I guess. All actions or sexual advances, by the vampire, towards the girl are neither resisted nor encouraged by the girl in any way. Her only response is staying still with her eyes widened. This makes the supposed \"Romantic\" scenes too uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nYou don't feel invested in characters at all, so whenever the plot kicks in you don't even care anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, animation and sound are Ok but barely. The action scenes are lackluster and poorly directed.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a bad Twilight rip-off with some Tokyo Ghoul like elements. It did have some potential, though. But extremely poor execution. If main characters and their relationship were better written then it could have been a decent dark romance. But what a waste of opportunity! considering we rarely, if ever, get to see a good anime romance with mature themes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has no redeeming quality whatsoever. Don't waste your time on it.",

            "content": "[SPOILER WARNING]\r\nSo far I'm really enjoying this story. Vampires live alongside humans but have to be super careful because they are stronger and can easily hurt humans and also go into frenzy and will rape and kill if they see blood. Naturally there is discrimination against them and harsh laws restricting their lifestyles because they are dangerous and it is very easy for them to lose control. Despite that vampires are essentially humans underneath and most just want to live their lives, go to work, fall in love, and not be hated by everyone.\r\nThe problem is how easy it is for them to go outof control and hurt someone and get hooked on blood sex and rock'n roll. The story being told is very interesting but it has been done before: Halfbreed police officer stuck between both sides falls in love with a regular human. That said some new twists get added onto the story that make it different than the other series that have covered the same outline. When the main character goes out of control and gives in to his vampire half those around him are actually in danger for one, and he isn't always in control; they really sell you on the struggle. Also while he is trying to regain control it isn't all epic action series \"the power of friendship will conquer all\" moments, there are sad pathetic \"better lock myself away\" moments that strike me as far more realistic than I've seen the situation depicted as in other series.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally this story is \"edgy\" but I think it has the right amount of edge and isn't just edgy for the sake of being edgy. They get the little touches right like making the main character look sleep deprived all the time because he isn't getting blood and not looking like a glittering prettyboy despite being a dangerous, starved, killing machine. I feel like they might be telling a tragic story for the sake of telling a tragic story and it may turn out that way but so far it has been pretty dang good so I'm in it for the ride to find out.\\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere and tone of this show fits a dark romantic thriller with berserk vampires blending in to the population. To describe the atmosphere as best I can I would say it reminds me of old detective stories where everyone is smoking heavily.\\n\\n\r\nOther than being worried in the future the show will cross over the finely walked line between gritty realism into \"edgy\"/\"stupid emo fantasy\" territory my only immediate problem with the show is I really have a hard time believing the female lead is anything other than a living fleshlight. In the first episode she gets some truly horrible news and she recovers from it almost immediately and seems to get on with her life just fine. (Spoilers for the first episode to follow) I feel like it is totally unrealistic to find out that your best friend has a crush on you and because you rejected him (even though you didn't actually dislike him) he went berserk and raped and murdered other women to avoid hurting you in his out of control state and not blame yourself for it. She neither blames herself for it nor her former best friend and one or both of those things should definitely be going on. To make matters worse she then falls for the guy that arrested her best friend. That's a whole new level of friendzoned. It just feels like other than being a nice girl that cooks a mean hotpot she has absolutely 0 personality. As it is still early in the show I hope this is something they expand upon in the future.\\n\\n\r\nThe male lead going after her becomes even more questionable as his female coworker is constantly flirting with him and has way more personality. She's a 10/10 future trollmom. Not to mention she is also a vampire so he wouldn't need to worry about seeing her blood and eating her alive one day or hurting her on accident. Sure the female lead is nice and the shy girl with big tits flavor of pretty but underneath the tropes there isn't even a skeleton. All she does is act shy and blush. (Spoilers for episode 2 to follow) She almost gets raped by a guy and guess what she does the entire time? Acts shy and blushes. I don't dislike the female lead because there really isn't anything to dislike but the partner clearly shows they can at least make a female with some personality so I really hope they develop her character in the future.\\n\\n\r\nRight now I'm giving it an 8/10 overall and suggest watching it if you like a good tragic romance story or gritty vampire thriller. It feels a lot like a cross between Blood+ and Psycho Pass (season 1).",

            "content": "! I have not read the manga and am judging the anime only !\r\n!! Contains spoilers !!\r\nFrom what I read before, this anime sounded fairly promising for the vampire genre. \"It\u2019s not your typical Twilight story\", they said. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s worse than that.\r\nThe first 15 minutes were decent, the art isn\u2019t my favourite but it\u2019s not something that ticks me off much. Then we have a few characters, one that we thought would be the main, then gets arrested 5 minutes later. And the best part: your local vampire cop sexually assaulting Tsukasa; the mc who, of course, falls in love with him andhas wet dreams each night. Just wonderful. And this while Tsukasa is \u201cafraid of men\u201d (I understand why after episode 2). Guess she just has a thing for half vampires.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t mind clich\u00e9 love stories, but uh, not this way. And let\u2019s not forget that our vampire cop is also a stalker and probably watches our round-eyed mc sleep, just like his cousin Edward.\\n\\n\r\nDon't spend your time watching this if you want something of decent quality. I have a hard time dropping a series I already started with so I'll suffer some more in your place.",

            "content": "I\u2019m just going to throw this out here. How many people actually enjoy series about humans and vampires these days? It felt like I haven\u2019t in ages. Devil\u2019s Line adheres to a exploration about the nature of humans and vampires in a modern world society. We got humans and vampires (otherwise, known as \u201cdevils\u201d) living in our everyday neighborhood. Coming into this show, Devil\u2019s Line felt like a copy-paste that I\u2019ve seen in many vampire theme shows before. It isn\u2019t anything special.\r\nThere\u2019s a joke out these days that falls in the line of \u201cstill a better love story that Twilight\u201d. Devil\u2019s Line does have vampiresand some romance elements after all. However, the show itself gives a more mature feeling that is beyond just teenage romance. What Devil\u2019s Line fails to do is make a story that stands out on its own. The story connects a vampire named Anzai together with a college student named Tsukasa Taira. She is saved by this mysterious character after being attacked by a vampire. It also turns out that Anzai is a vampire himself and has to control his bloodlust. The catch is that the show tests his nature as a vampire while also being hunted down by a vampire extermination organization known as the CCC. Sound familiar?\\n\\n\r\nNow the show itself does take itself quite seriously. I say this because there\u2019s hardly any jokes and most of that similar content relies on dark humor even when there\u2019s room to throw in those moments. In essence, you should expect a mature anime that deals with interspecies romance. The main characters, Anzai and Tsukasa are not much alike beyond just their origins. From the start, I can say easily that Anzai is a brooding man without much words. On the other hand, Tsukasa is a type of girl who is very open to others and isn\u2019t afraid to speak her mind. However, she is still very shy and not capable of dealing with dangers on her own most of the time. Anzai has to play the role of a protector in the series. It also puts Tsukasa in danger whenever the two are together because of his own bloodlust. The series adds tension and psychology nearly every episode as we see how he struggles to control his urges. I think on most part, it\u2019s a repetitive gimmick that most vampire series relies on these days. Series such as Vampire Knight and Tokyo Ghoul has done that before. Even real life popular drama TV has done so in the past such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer or The Vampire Diaries. They all carry the burden of a character having to deal with their inhuman nature. Devil\u2019s Line isn\u2019t too different as the show tests the water between Anzai and Tsukasa\u2019s relationship. Unfortunately, it fell flat because of how dry and empty it is. There\u2019s no doubt they have chemistry but their relationship feels unreal and I find it hard to root for them as a couple. The two are hardly compatible either because of their circumstances. It\u2019s a forbidden romance not meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nAs a story about two different races, you can definitely expect conflicts to erupt in their society. There are several episodes that involves Anzai being targeted in assassination-style operations. It seems members of the CCC aren\u2019t afraid to take any risks to kill vampires such as the case of sniper Zero Seven (Nanako Tenjo). As a main protagonist, you can definitely expect Anzai to be protected by plot armor. He\u2019s not going to drop like a fly even despite fighting against the odds. Anzai is definitely not \u201cOP\u201d though as he struggles to survive but to me, the show doesn\u2019t make his survivalist role any unique. The plot is stale as we don\u2019t learn too much about his character. There\u2019s definitely some background storytelling in the series for the main characters but none of them felt compelling. Tsukasa is also too human for a character that goes under little changes throughout the series. The only other character that may arouse curiosity would be Kohannes Kleeman, a mysterious white hair man. He appears in the show in later episodes and makes the audience wonder what his real intentions are. Unlike Anzai, he is quite blunt and behaves carefree around others. I\u2019d say that he is perhaps too honest to point where it\u2019s hard to tell whether he is telling the truth or lying. To me, Kleeman is an antithesis of Anzai. He is difficult to manipulate and always seems to be in control of himself. His behavior brings in a lighter side of the show although I really can't find that appealing. The show is still very moody and pushes the idea of a dark modern fantasy at every chance it gets.\\n\\n\r\nPlatinum Vision is a rather obscure studio that I don\u2019t think many fans are familiar with. Their previous work actually includes another vampire series called Servamp although that is far more lighthearted than this anime. Unfortunately, the overall animation quality is mediocre at best. This is my honest impression as the character designs looks generic to the core without any special features about them. The setting takes place in a modern city that you can find in just about any similar shows. Oh but you\u2019re wondering, what about the vampires? Do they look convincing? On the surface, the answer is yes but that doesn\u2019t make them stand out much. The characteristics of these vampires includes fangs and their bloodlust nature that feels like if you\u2019ve seen it once, you\u2019ve seen it all. There\u2019s also a lot of fan service that teases the relationship between Anzai and Tsukasa. Some episodes really flirts with the idea of whether they will or will not have sex. Thus, expect a lot of kissing and it leaves some to the imagination. There\u2019s not much censoring in terms of the graphic violence although isn\u2019t never really ventures into the gore territory.\\n\\n\r\nTo carry a show like this, you would definitely need some acceptable characters. Anzai and Tsukasa\u2019s voices are a total contrast of each other. Anzai sounds like one with little emotion while Tsukasa\u2019s voice sounds alive. On some instances, I wonder just how much the creator wanted us to accept them. In the meantime, the OST is mostly eerie with a melancholic quiet tune during some of the more emotional scenes. The theme songs are what people would easily designate as edgy. I don\u2019t like using that word around much but it is what it is.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching Devil\u2019s Line, I felt like walking out of a theater realizing I could have done something else better with my money. I can literally go around online and find another show under the \u201cvampire\u201d tag. To me, Devil\u2019s Line took the risk of trying to revitalizing the horror genre of interspecies relationship. What ends up happening is a show with few surprising twists but instead loses to underwhelming horror formulas. Maybe someday, we\u2019ll get a memorable horror series of where we can look back and say \u201cthat\u2019s pretty cool!\u2019",

Perhaps a bit, in order to strengthen the conviction that this title is yet another waste of time that you cannot recover \\n\\n\r\nThe premise sums up the concept of this schlock, a concept that has been done to death before and that was never fantastic to begin with.\\n\r\nVampire/ Devil or whatever the MC identifies as falls for bland walking plot device that is the female MC and he's facing struggles to maintain his humanity blah blah blah and we're supposed to rot for their awkward relationship , because it's so authentic and totally not forced for the sake of fitting the shoujo quota and wet some prepubescent girls, truly mature, innovative and not some cookie cutter romance! 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fairly well done, but who could care about it when anything else is plainly rubbish. 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, even in the sound department I have managed to loathe it, especially those nauseating sound effects like moans , groans , sobs that reminded me of a tortoise mating with a croc shoe (you could Google that to have an exact idea about what I'm referring to)\\n\r\nAs I've mentioned above, the opening is an uninspired borderline attack on titan attempt and doesn't even fit the thematic of the show, the choreography of the visuals makes no sense whatsoever.\\n\r\nNot that the voice acting would be the major flaw of this title, but the way the lines are delivered falls flat and makes the wannabe emotional moments embarrassing to witness. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters...exactly what I was talking about above , bland, generic, cannot sympathize with them , obnoxious and awkward to watch. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAs for the enjoyment, there wasn't any , not even a second , I'd rather stub my toe in the furniture every ten minutes than watch 20 minutes of this atrocity per week.\\n\r\nThere are a lot of bad shows out there , but this one tops them all through the fact that I cannot see a single positive in it, not even if I turn my brain off while watching , it's cringe worthy in every single way and deserves to be the punching bag of the season.",

            "content": "Personally, I would consider my standards quite high when it comes ratting a show, and I don't give 9/10 to just anything, but this show deserves it. \r\nLet's start with the story, vampires. Sounds pretty basic, one could even say it's a topic done to death. This is where the show gets it right. Vampires and devils were creatures that made you cry when you were a little boy/girl/other, they were scary, frightening, horrifying, one would even say spine-chilling. Looking back when I was a little child, there was nothing more scary then a pair of big fangs sticking from my uncles mouth. He usedto put fake fangs around and bite me all over, it really hurt like hell. I remember trying to tell me parents about it but they didn't believe me. Anyways, I digress. The show does a good job in portraying the dark world in which the story unravels, devils are threatening creatures and are something the characters are constantly reminded of. What I like particularly about this show and what really makes it stand out are the references. The thing I value in a show that focuses on references,(like Gintama for comedy example ) is that it awards people who pay attention. They get to experience the show in it's true fullest form. While people who just watch it halfheartedly miss out on half the experience. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are compelling and realistic, there is a lot of blood in this show, which only shows it's not advisable for young children to watch it. Without getting into spoilers, the main cast has an interesting dynamic which works off the dark setting. I won't call the show profound but I won't pretend It didn't make me stop and think about certain things.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is solid, nothing spectacular but nothing to laugh at. Same with the sound, it does it's job and while it's not something I would listen on my free time it did grow on me, especially the OP.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I think this show is pretty underrated, MAL scores really don't do it justice. And unlike the horrible Tokyo Ghoul:re, which is also airing this season and shares similar themes. Devils Line at least isn't laughably awful.",

            "content": "I think this is a show where we all have a common, itching thing going for it:\r\nAn awful Twilight-esque story with Tokyo Ghoul elements that are meshed in and didn\u2019t really fit well with bad to poor execution.\r\nDevil\u2019s Line tells the story that was founded on Twilight\u2026only that there\u2019s coherent but sometimes confusing or misunderstood storytelling, but nothing exciting nor engaging. It\u2019s the equivalent of \u201cHey, you\u2019re a vampire with your fang teeth and I\u2019m a normal girl, let\u2019s date!\u201d And that sums up how I felt with the entire premise of the series. Not to mention that they have added the police-like feel ofbetrayal and camaraderie just to get you invested in the series, and guess what? It added a tiny breath of fresh air, though I can tell that most people will not care for this, and for that, I will tell you to read the manga adaptation that\u2019s not as great, but you will understand what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nSo\u2026ok, human and vampire. What could go wrong? The answer? Anti-vampire groups, that\u2019s why! Most notably the CCC, who works as a police target group in disguise under the boss Kikuhara Kirio, monitoring the main group\u2019s vampire movements and executing what they feel is right of a vampire-free world. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters literally write the same story as Twilight, only that the former does it WAY better than what\u2019s found here. Tsukasa Taira is NOT the equivalent, but a dumbed-down version of Bella Swan, mute, expressionless, and there as a plot device to keep the story entertaining as its romance-supernatural genre can go. The same could be said for the MC vampire, Anzai Yuuki, a half-vampire, the dumb-down version of Edward Cullen, trying to control his half-demon, half-human powers and constantly breaks the mold for his police group (Public Safety Division 5 F Squad) into trying to live in a world that\u2019s Twilight (where humans and vampires can co-exist). Johannes Kleeman as a half-vampire, I\u2019d say he is only the handful of good characters that doesn\u2019t have a backstory, but yet is kind to everyone, is intelligent and is able to discern stuff very well. Other characters are generic, bland and uninteresting, the only one-liners I can say about characterization (if there was ever any to begin in the first place).\\n\\n\r\nI have never personally heard of the new studio Platinum Vision before, most particularly they made Servamp (with Brain\u2019s Base) and the spin-off from the Saiyuuki Reload series, but this anime just proves that just like many 2nd or 3rd rate studios, it falls in the category of being mediocre and bad. The manga-to-anime adaptation\u2026is quite frankly nothing more of good. I get it that the producers tried their best to replicate the manga, but try as hard as they can, it still falls short. The animation is less than Tokyo Ghoul quality, more so than ripping it off, it\u2019s bearable to watch but when the action gets heavy, RIP animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is another story in and itself. I get it that the setting has to be the super \u201cedgy\u201d feel, but they are only OK at best, nothing to write home about. Both the OP and EDs are unmemorable, but if I had to decide the good out of the bad, it will be Mamoru Miyano\u2019s ED that takes the icing on the cake. Action scenes feeling empty, there\u2019s not a ton of sound and sometimes poorly used.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of it all, is Devil\u2019s Line a worthy \u201cTwilight: The Animation\u201d? Certainly not, and it doesn\u2019t come close to touching anything that is noteworthy nor remembering about. I\u2019d guess for die-hard fans of Twilight, give this series a try and see how fast it sweeps you off so much that it becomes unwatchable. For people who earnestly thought this is a good anime, it\u2019s not, so break out of that trance already.\\n\\n\r\nWas it engaging? I\u2019d say no, and please don\u2019t waste your time if you desire decent quality-made shows.\\n",

            "content": "Yo, Anzai!  Four simple words: rub it out, man.\r\nSince the dawn of humankind, men have been dealing with unyielding pent-up sexual energy, matched only by those squeaking dolphins who use eels as fleshlights (look it up people!).  To prevent oneself from looking like a crazed, sex-driven \u201cvampire.\u201d  It is necessary to use thy hand to complete thy deed; thus, returning oneself to a state of poise, and level-headedness.   \r\nThat may sound a bit convoluted for an edgy, vampire love story resembling that which shall not be named *cough* Twighlight *cough*, but think about it: they spent twelve episodes with Anzaiavoiding or having limited/monitored contact with Taira, just because the dude couldn\u2019t control himself.  Not exactly original when it comes to the vampire medium, but they did manage to throw in a handful of interesting nuances to captivate the viewer\u2019s attention.  Whether or not those ideas worked, is another story altogether.\\n\\n\r\nTaking inspiration from today\u2019s outrage culture, Devil\u2019s Line injects an aggressive, militant public, who despises the presence of vampires in their society.  They shout, they scream, and they annoy a hell of a lot of people.  But it does provide an accurate representation of how people would react, when \u201cthreatened\u201d by a superior being.  That being said, what Devil\u2019s Line fails to do, is hone in on this aspect from the viewpoint of one of the victims.  Anzai\u2019s dad killed 10 innocent people when he entered his state of vampire-rage; however, we are only given a perspective of how he was provoked into this egregious act, by humans that killed his girlfriend.  Why not show the families that were affected by his \u201cblind\u201d atrocities, highlighting the odious nature of provoked vampires.  The way it is presented, more or less, makes an unequivocal assumption that all humans are vicious creatures, and vampires are ethical, pacifists, who only attack because of their predisposition for consuming blood.\\n\\n\r\nThe paucity of character development is a severe hindrance in this series.  With the exception of Anzai, everyone adheres to a formulaic routine, evaporating much of the intrigue from the viewer\u2019s perspective.  Anzai, however, displays a certain level of growth, especially when he shows affection towards Taira, forcing him to restrain himself from the fear of losing control.  The scene in the bedroom, when they are being monitored from the outside, exemplifies Anzai\u2019s internal struggle with himself, and how he must always maintain his concentration to inhibit his vampiric tendencies.  In addition, the scene where Taira force feeds Anzai with her own blood, demonstrates the dissociation Anzai feels when his vampiric-self seethes to the surface.  This sort of hints at the rage-blinders we all experience when our emotions assume the driver seat, and rationality gets thrown out of the window.  The anime, in my estimation, would have had better success if Taira\u2019s emotions were investigated with equal exploration.  It is understood that she is devoted to Anzai, but she seems too careless with her own personal safety around him.  Her love for him is unquestioned, but one has to wonder if someone in her position would really act this faithful when her arm is nearly bitten off.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, it\u2019s not a particularly bad series, it just fails to capitalize on its own conceptual themes.  Oddly enough, the series emulates Taira and Anzai\u2019s relationship: a gentle foreplay of emotions, but nothing substantial ever happens.",

            "content": "TL;DR:A combination of mysteries and romance,a nice mixture indeed\r\nPeople are refused to watch this show by judging the show from the beginning,saying that it's a rip-off Tokyo Ghoul,Twilight and containing a heavy amount of fan-service,but however I come to realise that this show is not that shallow,it eventually turns out pretty well and worth to expect.\r\n+Overall it feels realistic\r\n+some of the actions are pretty good\r\n+dark atmosphere is presented well\r\n+the conflicts are described pretty well\r\n+strong voice actors base\r\n+It's later revealed that there're some mysteries behind the incident\r\n-Rich story content,but the story presentation can be improved \r\n-characters can be described more,like the round-eye girl,named Tsukasa\r\n-inadequate soundtracks\r\nIn general,DevilsLine can be summed up within two subjects.\\n\\n\r\n1. The romance among the main characters,Tsukasa and Anzai.\\n\\n\r\n2. Conflicts among the vampires themselves and the relationship between humans and vampires \\n\\n\r\n-The romance\\n\\n\r\nRomance is probably one of the most exciting things in life,probably Tsukasa has the same feeling and she's a kinda shy type of person,who don't have much ideas about vampires and Anzai.Generally,people saying that the romance scenes are kinda awkward,but I think it's kinda realistic,since to a young-hearted girl,who don't have much experience in facing romance,it's pretty sure that she'll feel kinda nervous,like the scenes from the show,so I expected she don't have much feelings during romance moments.In fact,I feel the another way around,which I feel they're kinda realistic.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the events happened,the bond between Anzai and Tsukasa become stronger.They wanted to protect each other in several dangerous situations at all costs even though they're being restricted.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance is pretty well made and exciting,it doesn't conflict with the events happened and it developed through with the mysteries (which I will go through this later)\\n\\n\r\n-Conflicts\\n\\n\r\nIn Devils Line,humans may have bad feelings about vampires,since they can't control themselves when they see blood and may destroy people's life.Others may understand their needs and provide their needs,different people have different opinions about vampires in this show.On the other hand,vampires themselves also know some people have bad impression to them and feel worried,yet for Anzai,he's in love with Tsukasa,a human girl,which is pretty sure will have large conflicts among them.These are the features that this show has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nIt's later revealed that there're several mysteries about the settings itself,Anzai's co-workers and his past,(Who's controlling behind the scenes?What's Anzai's real character?),which I'm not going to spoil them,since it's relatively interesting and can't be explained in short.All I can say that it's very entertaining to resolve these questions one by one,especially for mystery anime fans.Devils Line did tried to explain the questions one by one throughout events and romance,an interesting combination indeed.In a nutshell,Devils Line surely has great character and story development,especially on Anzai.I'm surely that you'll find certain amount of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal opinions on the endings are pretty positive,although some people may find it unsatisfying,it does feel logical and realistic and I didn't find the ending bad,though it could be better if the mysteries can be resolved more completely at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThere're a few things I do think Devils Line can do better,like the story presentation.Although I just mentioned that Devils Line has lots of things to offer,it's in a relatively fast pace in several moments,probably because of the episode limit,it has to be done quickly.Also,at the end,though throughout events,the relationship between Tsukasa and Anzai developed well,I do think that Tsukasa isn't developed pretty well,especially about her personal past and her feelings about vampires before.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound are fine in this show.The colour visuals are well made in this show,this show is pretty good in portraying the dark scenes,but it'll be better if some of the actions can be done smoothly,rather than in a weird slow motion.They have a strong voice actors base,which is awesome for voice actors fans,but they don't have put much efforts on soundtracks,the amount of soundtracks in this show is pretty insufficient.Op and Ed are fine though.\\n\\n\r\nI could say that Devils Line isn't a masterpiece,but it did well in many aspects and satisfying the romance,mystery anime fans.Do give it a try for at least finishing half of the whole series and don't judge the book by its cover.Perhaps at the end,you maybe appreciated with this series.\\n\\n\r\nStory:7/10\\n\r\nAnimation:6.5/10\\n\r\nSound:7/10\\n\r\nCharacters:7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8/10\\n\r\nOverall:7/10 (B)",

I also was hoping to get more information on the main character and what happened to him in the past. So that was also a little unsatisfying.\r\nThe most entertaining part of the show for me personally was the relationship between the two main characters. I always enjoy when the guy is trying to control himself for his lady and is trying to protect her.\r\nI enjoyed the show throughout until it came to the ending. The ending was not really as good as I was hoping. Ibelieve it is still worth watching but know that the ending will be eh. But overall it was a good show.",

            "content": "Disclaimer; I haven't watched more than first few initial episodes at the time this is written in and it will not resemble a review. MAL doesn't have \"opinion\" tab and the forum is full of people lashing at each other so this is the only way to convey my \"feelings\". It will also be spoiler-free as I won't mention any specific events from the anime. I might end up using word \"shallow\" a lot. \r\nVery short TL;DR at the bottom, I do suggest to read it all if you wonder whether this show is worth your time. \r\nI pulled this show and wanted to watchit because of the theme. I love more adult-oriented shows with dark theme and proper romance, I also like vampire-ish themed shows. Another thing the show has going for itself are the voice actors and actresses, bunch of very good names. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is bad though and it isn't my opinion as I'd call it a statement/fact and I am going to vindicate what I just wrote.\\n\\n\r\n1. The supernatural(setting) and first episodes. The show throws you into a world with fictional elements as a main theme without explaining anything. This can in theory work if it's written/used well, the elements are explained as time passes (or not at all in some cases) to not dump everything on reader/viewer (and to keep the show/reading material mysterious) but it doesn't work here because they throw you into a world, hint at supernatural as \"urban legends, stories ...\" in conversations and then have those elements take literally 98% of the screen-time. You are blind and confused which completely destroys any bond you may be trying to build with the show (characters/story/lore/trivia). The writing is very very shallow, there is nothing to it, it is extremely rushed to a point where it starts making no sense which in connection to what I just wrote just...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters - Weird. Hell I'd even like the weird if they weren't just empty shells (no personalities, no explanation, no build up, no background fuuu). You aren't properly even introduced to them and that doesn't change as the episodes go on, you are basically as blind in episode 6 as you were before you even started watching. You get nothing and are supposed to care (and the shows acts like you care from the episode 1) just like with the theme/setting.\\n\\n\r\n2. Drama, romance and musical background. While the show does qualify as both drama and romance both aspects are completely hideous.\\n\\n\r\nDrama - the \"dramatic\" scenes are escalated from nothingness (and from the get-go) and you as a viewer are supposed to care but you rationally can't. You don't know what is happening, why is it happening, you don't know the characters that are taking part. As explained in first part, you know nothing about the world or anything else actually so how are you supposed to care about dramatic scenes? Rushed is too simple of a word n so is shallow.\\n\\n\r\nRomance - The show contains romance straight out from the beginning. There is no build up, you don't know the characters (and they don't know each other either btw) but are thrown into \"romantic\" situations which come out of nowhere without any sign or buildup. To make it even worse (and this applies to the drama part as well) the music (except op which is nice) completely ruins any and all scenes (as if they weren't ruined enough already). I have no idea whether the person picking the music and putting it in is a genius or an intern. To elaborate on that, the music and it's timing is horrible but on the other hand it completely fits the shallow writing and badly put together scenes. \\n\\n\r\nComedy - The show isn't labelled as comedy (although it seems to be one big joke) there is a comedy. There are \"funny\" situations to lighten the \"mood\" but I don't get why they are there, this show isn't supposed to be  rom-com with questionable humor. I will say though, that I did actually smile during those but that's only because Yoshitsugu's dry laugh makes me smile under any circumstances. \\n\\n\r\nVA - God bless the voice actors. The only good part of this but not even their hard work can redeem what this show is doing.\\n\\n\r\nTo give you a TLDR; The writing and composition are shallow and straight out horrible in all of their aspects which kills everything else. You are thrown into a world with characters and themes but the show fails to explain and establish a(ny kind of) connection. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all I just wrote I am not saying that people can't or shouldn't like it. Everyone is different and people like many things (good or bad, regardless of the quality) but that doesn't change quality of this show (or the things) but I feel like people take show rating here as an expression of their enjoyment which they shouldn't (as according to tool-tips it in no case should reflect that).\\n\\n\r\nSome people also compared this to twilight which is fair compaction actually. Speaking strictly about the movies, the quality of writing and composition is very similar (in a bad way). As I am writing this the \"average\" rating is 6.5, which according to MAL is between fine and good. This show is nor fine nor good, the only things I'd consider even average is the art and voice acting rest is bad/LQ.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't touched everything that can be said which may change if I turn this into full review. This was supposed to be very short to just give people heads-up (and to vent my thoughts), looking at it, it already is longer than expected. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT; This review has the show rated as 3(poor) while my personal rating has it rated as 4(bad), that is due to the difference in tool-tips. Also, if you aren't interested in the theme/VA or are looking for exceptional art you should personally count my ratings as 1 lover (dreadful/very bad).",

            "content": "Well, many people give this anime not so great rating and I can understand why, but my opinion on this anime is pretty different. (And my review has nothing to do with manga, because I have started to read it yet)\r\nAt first, I wouldn't compare this to any anime,- some people compare it to Tokyo Ghoul. Yes, when I read about this comparing and thought about it more, there are small things similar to TG. But the review shouldn't be based on 'It's better/worse than this anime', for sure not between Tokyo Ghoul and Devils Line,- both animes have many differences, both are original.\r\nThen yes,it's that type of anime, which isn't for everybody, not much people will like it. There are many reasons, why could you not like it, but contrariwise, you can find many reasons to like this anime too!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe plot can seem bit weird, unusual,- Actually is it. The relationship between Anzai and Tsukasa plays the main role in the story, especially in the beginning. Soon there is more and more action and dealing with other things, main characters' relationship is still important, but it isn't only about it already. I like it, but I acknowledge it's weaker part of anime, even last episodes were quite confusing for me. The last episode wasn't bad, maybe I could count that as end if it was just first season, but I think the plot went bit fast in the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI haven't been sure which rate should I give to art, but eventually,- 9/10 suits it well. I think it's great part of anime, it isn't perfect, but I have no problems with art, I very like it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to art. The sound doesn't contain I would remember for a long time, but also anything bad, so I am okay with it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, I know not everybody actually likes main character, Tsukasa. It's true that she is very common, has nothing special (except that she doesn't have any fear, can do anything), but she seems bit likeable for me. Sometimes even I stare, wondering how she could behave so calm, but that is probably only thing I don't like when it comes to Devils Line characters.\\n\r\nAnzai is great character, was interesting from the beginning and still there are many things I would like to know about him, so don't have any problem with him. Lee and support characters we can see aren't bad too, overall everyone is original in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHow I said, when I don't count last episodes that were more weird for me, I've been enjoying this anime. It has its charm, originality, that forced me to enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI have this rating only with few animes, but I feel, I should give this one 9/10 too. It isn't perfect, but I find it very interesting and I don't regret watching it at all.",

            "content": "When Devil's Line started airing, I definitely wanted to like it, but as it continued, it got harder and harder to make excuses for how mediocre it ended up. At first, watching Devil's Line felt kind of like a guilty pleasure, you know the kind you get when you're enjoying Twilight or something similar, but the pleasure bit faded as the show continued came to a conclusion. There were times that I considered dropping it, but I'm glad that I didn't. It wasn't that Devil's Line was terrible, it was just that it was inconsistently good. More on what I mean in a minute.\r\nTechnically speaking,Devil's Line was a bit of a mixed bag. Sometimes the animation was pretty solid, but other times, it was really choppy. I would love to say that the choppy bits were few and far between, but in reality, it was pretty consistent. That being said, it seemed to be isolated to mostly the beginning of the series, but it could be that I just got used to it's choppiness. The sound was strange too, especially when the someone went full \"Devil Mode\". I get what they were trying to accomplish with their sound mixing in those segments, but it ended up being less creepy in the way that they wanted and more creepy in an amusing way. However, the sound isn't all bad, most of the music was pretty good, especially then ending, which kept me going for a couple of those weird episodes towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nI'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy the premise of Devil's Line, especially since that's what drew me to it anyway. In fact, the themes of racism and segregation between Devil's and humans were the most interesting parts of the show. Unfortunately, those interesting themes got pushed to the side for a mediocre love story for most of the run-time. Not to say that Tsukasa and Anzai's dynamic wasn't interesting at first, but it got shallow and generic pretty quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major problems Devil's Line fell into had more to do with its overwhelming cast of side characters. And by that, I don't mean that there were countless side characters, but more that they were indistinguishable. Most of the designs were generic and they're referred to by name most of the time, which makes it extremely confusing, since you don't have a clear face to put with the name. Every time a side character's name was mentioned, I would struggle for a few minutes to figure out who they were talking about. Maybe I'm exaggerating this issue, but it certainly felt like they weren't doing a good job at making the designs unique enough to stand out, especially the police force characters.\\n\\n\r\nI think that illustrates Devil's Line's inconsistencies well enough, and I haven't even touched on the story at all. I won't go into detail, but I'll say that it's the same as everything else in this show, inconsistently good, with quite a bit of bad. I wouldn't not recommend Devil's Line, but I would definitely not tell anyone that it's a masterpiece. Your enjoyment depends on your interest in the relationship of the main characters and how much the premise and themes hold your attention. If those aren't enough, you aren't going to find much else.",

But with a twist. The vampires or Devils dont need to drink blood. But when they see your blood the want to rape/kill/drink you \r\nThis show ain't even bad, it just could have been so much better. \r\nStory 6: Its your average \"Oh there are bad creatures in this world ,but they arent actually bad\" anime and is kinda predictable. There were somewhat minor plot twist and which made the story a little bit better,  but I can't call it good yet. The romance is this show was trash, but hey, still a better love story then Twillight.  Sorry, but for the MC to almost have raped you is NOT a turn on(or it is, idk what you into)\\n\\n\r\nArt 7: The art was clean and kinda suitting for this kind of anime. It had some minor flaws, but is quitte good\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: LOVED the ending song and the OP aint even bad too. The music throughout the show was OK.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5: THe MC and his girl dont have no personality whatsoever. Nothing for them to actually stand out. They're relationship is build on plot and nothing really special. The only good thing about Anzai was that he had an interesting backstory, but that's kinda it. The Side characters were dope and Lee was a savage. If it wasn't for him i would give this 4 or 3.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8: I enjoyed the show though. It had action and the story was interesting. The romance was cute. Trash, but cute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7: Dont expect a lot from this anime, but if you look for Tokyo ghoul type of anime, but a little bit worse, this show is for you.

The thing is that by watching shitty stuff you can find a lot of hidden comedy gems, this type of show that is so terrible it ends up being funny as fuck. This, my peers, is one of those.\r\nStory: 2\r\nThe story is a mess. At this point (ep 7) there's little to no explanationof the main issues of the series and they just keep adding plot twists and useless information that goes nowhere. Is like they tried to focus in so many things and just developed one (kind of). Hell, I guess the manga is long as fuck, but they're definitely not solving all of the anime questions in the 5 episodes the series has left, and if they do, then the story rating can drop to 1 instead of 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt:3\\n\r\nHonestly I'm giving it a 3 because the main guy has a spot on top of his lip and it looks cute, but the art is bleh, animation even more bleh.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\r\nSurrounding all the mountain of crap that this anime is, there's an incredible voice cast, how this shit managed to get the likes of Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Mamoru Miyano, Aoi Shouta, Takahiro Sakurai, Miyuki sawashiro, ETC beats me, but the only thing that can be praised in this series is the voice acting, and even so, the lines are so terrible that sometimes the great voice acting falls flat. As for background sound there's nothing special about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:1\\n\r\nSo this is the story of a vampire and a girl who fall in love somehow without really having that much contact wow. Good guy hot demon with a mysterious aura and a tragic past, tries his best to fight his bloodlust (and let's say bloodlust because they took it quite literal) while defending the love of his life, while our useless and cute but not hot main girl sacrifices herself in every little ocation to protect the good guy hot demon who really needs no help whatsoever, thus, making the situation worse.\\n\r\nIs like every single character in the series is just a copy paste of templates someone posted somewhere. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:3\\n\r\nI give a 3 in enjoyment because to be honest with you all the terrible clich\u00e8 drama is just so entertaning to watch. This series is so bad that is funny and f you're anything like me it'll definitely get some good laughs out of you. Believe me, I'm watching the whole thing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\r\nBecause voice actors and a mole.\\n\\n\r\nThis series should be called flat lined instead of devil's line.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "TLDR: Devils line is a messy and poorly thought out series that makes no serious attempt at a high quality work. It's both confusing and flat out disappointing as you traverse through randomly put together fight scenes and the sad excuse for a plot direction. Avoid this watch, unless you're looking for a series that makes vampires fight and do vampire-ing stuff (or you want another drop on your list).\r\nScores~ Story [2] Art [5] Sound [4] Character [2] Enjoyment [1] Overall [2.8]\r\nStory [2]\r\nThe best way to describe the story in devil's line is a confusion. The studio makes no attempt to explain the reasoning behindeverything and chucks random characters together, with some context, and makes them do things. The overall plot itself, it's pointless and has no meaningful direction to follow or to look forward to. It does make a semi-serious attempt to develop a somewhat interesting romance, but any curiosity of this is whipped away as you're confused by what the heck is happening in the series. \\n\r\nA sad excuse for a plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt [5]\\n\r\nThe only \"strength\" of this series. The studio has made a genuine attempt to Instill some identity into their characters and makes it bearable on the eyes (and soul). Nothing of great note can be said here. It's mediocre and won't knock your socks off anytime soon. Art in which its sole purpose is to do its job and adapt. \\n\\n\r\nSound [4]\\n\r\nSimply O.K\\n\r\nThe sound is fine, it doesn't hitch in any major way. However, the voice acting does tend to get boring and doesn't scream \"I have character\" in any major way. Apart from it's under average OP and ending songs, the sound is slightly disappointing in Devil's line.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [2]\\n\r\nDevil's line's characters are bland, generic and sad to say the least. The studio makes no attempt to make the characters amount to anything other than hollow. The generic vampires. The generic MC woman. Everything just feels the same and/or predictable as random events move by. The studio makes no attempt at making Devil's line's characters amount to anything but a chore to bear your eyes into. While they're not horrible, they certainly are dreadful to every letter. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [1]\\n\r\nI am not enjoying this series whatsoever. This anime ruins any prospect of attempting a fun vampire series and replaces it with a collection and hollow characters doing randomly generated stuff together. While it keeps it somewhat entertaining through its overly sexual(ish) fight scenes, the sheer amount of trash you have to avoid to get to it is simply discouraging and becomes a massive chore to go through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [2.8]\\n\r\nAlthough it is a somewhat mediocre production, Devil's line squanders any prospect of a mediocre concept. It's generic characters and confusing plot leave it as a massive disappointment of a series in which the studio has made nonchalant attempt to make things interesting or watchable.\\n\\n\r\nSimply a poor quality watch and should be another anime on your drop list, should you take up this poor series. *sigh*",

It was subtle but it did manage to achieve it's own tale within it's narrative, which kept me interested. \r\nOverall, had a lot of potential but still couldn't quite deliver in the end. \r\nPROS:\r\n+ Relationship between Anzai and Tsukasa was the strongest facet of the series. It was down-to-earth and mature. \r\n+ Interesting reactions within the society and how the force arranges protocol with the 'devils.' I found it to be more towards the lenient side of things unlike Tokyo Ghoul, which was an interesting spin. \r\nCONS:\r\n- First episode was poor. Introduction could've been alot stronger. \\n\r\n- Clich\u00e9 vampire story and characters. \\n\r\n- Wasn't the worst ending, but the climax was rushed and bland. \\n\r\n- Too many Tokyo Ghoul concepts. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nFairly ordinary but had action, fondness and intimacy. Could of went on for a longer period but understandable due to budget and marketing. Probably recommend the Manga to continue unsatisfying loose ends.",

It was the fundamental idea around 'devils'.\r\nI have not watched anything that has attempted what Devil's Line has; the link between blood lust and sexual desire and how they proc each other. Some say that it has a twilight-ish feel to it but I disagree, yes there is some romance but in no way does it highlight how 'perfect' and 'beautiful' devils are. \r\nThe story is a bit slow but the progression isn't too bad and I enjoyed the political side of it. It is a little bit gory which Ialso enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nice, the shot angles and such worked quite well and the art of the devils themselves was reeeeeally cool.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are both a bit... boring? But they do get a bit more interesting as time goes on and the character development can be seen quite well through this method.\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed this so much, I went and bought the manga. I really do love this story. I recommend watching the first episode, if you don't like the feel, than I'd probably ditch it, it ain't for you. c:",

            "content": "Usually, I'll watch an anime at least twice before writing a review, taking notes the second time on specific qualities (variations in the art, nuances in the dialogue, actually paying attention to the soundtrack etc). However, I really feel like I need to leave a positive review on this one after my first watch, because I think it's greatly underappreciated.\r\nVery few animes introduce an entirely new concept as a focal plot point. The vast majority of stories are some combination of existing tropes, and even some animes that are considered revolutionary in some way are just two existing tropes put together in a new way.There's nothing in this anime that I've never seen before. Similar stories that come to mind are Toyko Ghoul, Ancient Magus' Bride, Claymore, and yes, Twilight. However, it's not the same as any of these, and is unique in the way that it pulls various aspects from each of those together. It also throws in a political element that I've seen before but can't recall where from. \\n\\n\r\nThere were a few things I thought were exceptional about this anime. Despite being a fantasy anime about vampires n stuff, the human elements were often incredibly realistic. In particular, Anzai's self hatred, his relationship with Tsukasa, and the public response were all exactly as I would expect real people would act in those circumstances. I also thought that the human-nonhuman issue was shown through a very balanced representation, including romantic, professional and friendly relations in mostly equal amounts. The subjective and variable triggering of demon transformations was also a subtly unique touch that added a lot to the story, characters and depth. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint was the pacing, especially the ending. Probably a top-10 worst ending in my book. I also would have liked to see more about Tsukasa's background, along with some of the supporting characters (Sawazaki and Juliana, in particular). I think this anime would have been a lot better given 24 episodes to explore those backgrounds a little more and allow for better separation into distinct story arcs. \\n\\n\r\nIf you leave your Twilight bashing and vampire romance preconceptions behind, I think you can really enjoy this anime. I don't think you could write a balanced, negative review about it without comparing it to certain stories of the past, which isn't the fault of the anime in any way. Forget about all that, and watch it for what it is.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A love story better then twilight? I don\u2019t think so. Devils Line is a show about the love story of a normal college girl named Tsukasa and a half vampire named Anzai. In the world of Devils Line, vampires live among humans. They don\u2019t look any different than humans, but when they are exposed to blood, they turn into bloodthirsty monsters.\r\n\tThat\u2019s as far as the synopsis goes on MAL, but it goes a bit farther than that. Devil\u2019s Line is a police drama, romance, action series following Anzai, a  half vampire detective. Vampires have dark circles around their eyes, have more sensitive senses andphysical abilities, and transform into a monster with blood red eyes, sharp claws, and huge fangs at the sight or smell of blood. Once a vampire gets exposed to human blood, they tend to get addicted and look for more. You may ask a question about Anzai, is it a vampire that is also a detective, or a detective that hunts vampires. The answer is, it's both. Anzai is a vampire investigating vampires. He is part of a government organization that specializes in tracking down various devil threats. Devil are the common name for vampires in the world. One night, Anzai is tracking down a devil serial rapist and murderer. Anzai finds him and stalks him for a while, until the murderer meets with a girl that fits his M.O., Tsukasa. Anzai then intervenes and fights the murderer in front of her, introducing Tsukasa to the world of devils and Anzai.\\n\r\n\tThe rest of the anime consists of the relationship of Anzai and Tsukasa, Devil human relations, and an organizations working to eradicate all devils. Tsukasa and Anzai\u2019s relationship is the most like twilight. Complete with Anzai stalking Tsukasa, Anzai almost raping Tsukasa, Anzai saving Tsukasa from being raped, and Tsukasa liking him back despite all of that. Although, a devil human relationship is dangerous, because a simple cut can trigger a devil to kill their partner. But Anzai and Tsukasa make it work. So as you can see, the romance aspect of Devil\u2019s Line is not very good. I find the devil human relations more interesting. As stated before Anzai is a devil detective, so he has first hand experience with what the devils struggle with on a daily and when they come in contact with blood. The general populous don\u2019t know about devils. If I say anything more it would be major spoilers. But how the world reacts to the appearance of devil's is the most interesting part of this show.\\n\r\n\tUnfortunately, aside from the stalking that takes place, the cast is stupid. They make stupid decisions and conclusions are very predictable. Information that should be known by doing any amount of experimentation is treated as a brand new thing revealed to the cast. Anyway I can\u2019t recommend for the love story, which the anime focuses on a lot, but for the world. It's also an edgy mess, if that isn't clear from the vampires. The art isn\u2019t very good, but there are times where the animation really shines. The music is not worth mentioning. Characters are retarded and don\u2019t make good decisions, but that's to be expected from this type of show. I give this show a 4 out of 10. This has been PixEFit\u2019s spoiler free, but not really review on Devil\u2019s Line.\\n",

One thing I was to applaud it on is it following closely to the manga. I watched mainly because I really wanted to watch a vampire romance that wasn't somewhat similar to Twilight, the whole love triangle trope with no solid main couple romance development was getting boring. The main thing that I loved about this is that, I saw them actually have romance, though some would thing it was a quite fast pace way for them falling in love, butfor me it was better from the usual slow snail pace and then at the end their wont even be a kiss scene and the series just ends like that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, I kinda had a feeling that the main girl wouldn't be this badass human, but she at least wasn't annoying, (well to me honestly) I would recommend this to someone who isn't expecting much and just wants to get away from the over used vampire tropes.  It does hint it of course, but it doesn't throw it in your face like a pack of potatoes.",

            "content": "Ah, vampire story lines. I really love seeing what the next person's idea is going to be for this concept, and am usually disappointed to some extent. \r\nDevil's Line met my expectation for that, but also pleasantly surprised me in that the disappointing elements didn't ruin the show for me!\r\nI started Devil's Line with the manga when it was first released, and was initially extremely disappointed. The story was choppy, the plot pacing/ ordering was disorganized, and there are so many holes in the story that you can slap this tale on a sandwich and call it Swiss cheese.\r\nWith that, I was more than rewardedby the direction of the anime. \\n\r\nStarting with where these devils come from, Devil's Line is an anime based off of the manga written by Ryo Hanada. The manga started in March of 2013 and is still on-going, so if you want to figure out what's going, on, you can try there, though I doubt it will help. The anime premiered in April of this year and ended this past weekend, being directed by Yoshinobu Tokumoto and released by Platinum Vision.\\n\\n\r\nTo start with my general thoughts not related to the review in particular, I'm more than mildly surprised that Platinum Vision took this show on. Considering how new they are in the world of hot topic anime, and how well rounded their others have been, (including one other vampire title, \"Servamp\") I was taken aback by the studio's decision to pick up such a lopsided plot.\\n\\n\r\nIF YOU DON'T CARE WHY I LIKE/ DISLIKE THE SHOW, SKIP DOWN FOR THE FINAL RECOMMENDATION!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\n- The story is really good. It's nothing we haven't seen before, but there's just the right of melodrama to make the tale what it is. I thoroughly enjoyed watching how it was going to go. There were moments that took me by surprise, and kept me wondering what was going to happen, which is something I can only give credit to the director for considering what a mess think the manga is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\n- I think the art in this show is beautiful: from the way the faces of the characters are drawn, to the bags under their eyes, to the way blood spatters when someone is shot. There was a lot of thought put into how each character should look, and why they look that way. On top of that, the animation had admirable qualities of it's own. I'll bring back the blood spatters for this point. It has been an extremely long time since I've seen blood depicted realistically the way it was in this show. That along with any face to face violence, the animation team (I feel) went out of their way to make the dramatic action scenes as realistic as contextually possible.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\n- I had a lot of trouble hearing certain parts. Or it sounded like the voice actors were too close to their mics in certain scenes. I wasn't a fan of how the sound went with what was happening in the show at all. I changed the servers I was watching the show on twice and had the same problem, so be prepared for that. It started happening to me around episode 5 or 6.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\n- Lordie, they need some serious work and some better development pacing, but I actually really appreciated the characters and how different they all were from each other. Each character had a very distinct personality, even characters that didn't have major parts. With that, though, each character design was EXTREMELY underdeveloped and the only person we know more that a handful of info about, is Anzai. Be prepared for how frustrating that's going to be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\n- This show isn't hard to enjoy if you aren't picky about having your preferences met. If you are, I highly suggest not wasting your time. I mean that in the kindest sense. It's enjoyable and catches your attention, willing you to finish the story (regardless of how good you think it is). I find the reality of the romance, violence, personality differences, and animation to be endearing despite all of the large holes we're left with.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL RATING: 7/10          RECOMMENDATION: Watch\\n\r\n- All in all, this show was a good watch and if I was bored enough, I'd probably be willing to watch it again. I think it's a waste of your time if you're easily riled up by an incomplete story, but I think if you're looking for something to watch that has an overall good story concept and direction then Devil's Line isn't the worst thing you could put on your watch list!\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time! \\n\r\nCiao =^-^=\\n\\n\r\n- Ama_",

            "content": "The story isn't original. I get it. You could compare this anime to a series like Tokyo Ghoul, Twilight, or pretty much anything that has the storyline of \"teenage girl falls in love with a vampire\" or \"inhuman protagonist struggles to live with themselves\". Devil's Line is basically a combination of the two. Despite it's lack of uniqueness, is it bad? In my opinion, no.\r\nI don't see much of a problem with the story. (I'll only touch upon surface level stuff.) Taira's a human girl who finds herself falling in love with a devil (or vampire) after discovering that one of her friends is adevil as well. This one incident has already drawn her into the world of devils. When she's rescued by Anzai, she becomes involved with the police (and her relationship with Anzai begins). Because of this, the story doesn't seem to be all over the place or anything like that. You can pretty much expect the future events in the series. My only issue is the ending. It was good but I would've been nice to see what happened to everyone else as well. \\n\\n\r\nOther than the times when the characters do something stupid, they're relatively good. Taira and Yuuki are likable characters. Despite this, there isn't much development. The male and female lead characters seem to have little to no change...separately. I feel like their relationship changed more than they did. (It was still nice to see them get closer to each other though.) Everyone else either wasn't very important or they got no development. The only exception to this would be Nanako. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is almost always good. I really like the opening and ending songs. \"Eclipse\" had good visuals but the ending song...the visuals look so awkward. The dramatic music was good as well. I wish the voices could've sounded better though. During some scenes, usually the ones when he's transformed into a devil, Anzai just makes some pretty weird sounds. They sound like gurgling...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the art is usually good. The bags under the eyes could look better. Also, I think they could've did better with the scenes where the devils are transformed. The animation looks weird sometimes, I admit that. For some people, it may be distracting.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (Things such as certain sounds and visuals were a bit off putting.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't think Devil's Line is as bad as it may seem. Even stories with a relatively unoriginal premise can be good in some ways. I give this anime an 8.",

            "content": "Man-eating monsters live as human disguised in our society.  Sound's familiar? With famous anime like tokyo ghoul or good anime like parasite, here we have one of the weaker genre representatives. While the anime mentioned above focus on our society, the human reaction or what makes a human itself, we're following a couple in love that doesn't know what to do in their strange situation and get in trouble with the police and a terror organisation. But let me start at the beginning:\r\nStory 5/10\r\nTsukasa Taira, a college student, is rescued from an attack by a devil, one of many vampires that blend in amongthe human population. Yuuki Anzai, her savior, is a half-devil who utilizes his devil-born gifts as a member of a shadowy police task force specializing in devil-related crime in Tokyo. As Anzai continues to keep guard over Tsukasa, the two are quickly confronted with unacceptance and terroristic activities by the society. \\n\r\nThe story is pretty weak, as it doesn't really know where to go and what to focus on. Romance? Politics? Action? Police? It seems it wants to do all these things at the same time, but isn't able to give us a good feeling about any of these points. On the other hand, the series isn't afraid to shift it's situation drastically. From a normal live to police work and later about terrorism, the series follows all these themes and situations at the same time. It has no problems actually switching it's set to a point it get's unpredictable. And it even likes to play around, both with the characters and the in world logic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nAnzai is a 21 year old hybrid male meaning he is half devil half human. He works for the police force under F-Squad in Division 5. He struggles containing his rage and blood-lust as both cause him to transform into an uncontrollable demon. \\n\r\nTaira is a 22 year old female human. She studies hard in school and lives an ordinary life that was all changed one night when she falls in love with a certain police vampire.\\n\r\nJohannes Kleemann, he grew up at the same place as Anzai, is also a demon but he can control his wish for blood.\\n\r\nBesides them, most of the side characters are forgettable, unnecessary and don't improve the story in any notable way. You shouldn't expect character development or surprising choices watching anime either. The surprisingly well done main cast almost saves this part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound/Voiceactors: 5/10\\n\r\nThe art style in Devils Line isn\u2019t too far out of the ordinary. Characters have soft faces and the colours mix in well with each other. The anime splits it\u2019s time being indoors and outdoors and priority at night when outside. It\u2019s rather dark which adds to the theme of vampires, devils, and darkness. This also allows emphasis when a brighter colour appears on screen. The biggest example of this is when we see blood. Blood is prominent throughout the series and when it is shown on screen it is usually the focal point. The choice of having dark background and bright blood throughout the show makes for great continuity. \\n\r\nExpressions are shown well of major characters, but a lot of the devils have the same expression or idle faces. The same toothy smile is used in just about every devil other than Anzai. One thing I was looking for that I was pleased to not see is that there is different blood patterns used in different episodes. For example, minor spoilers, when Taira gets a cut on her face halfway through the story she bleeds a certain way. When the cut is reopened and her face bleeds a different time, the blood doesn\u2019t flow the exact same way, nor do we see a repeated shot. \\n\r\nThe music chosen for Devils Line is very fitting and compliments the aura of the show well. The opening theme is \u2018Eclipse\u2019 by Souta Yanagawa commonly known as Shouta Aoi. The ending theme is \u2018Sotto Tokete Yuku You ni\u2019 by Mamoru Miyano, a very well known name. Both are well known for their works in the past and another job well done is presented here. \\n\r\nInteresting enough, for an anime that wasn\u2019t considered ridiculously popular, Devils Line has some well known voice actors. The voice of Anzai is done by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka. Notable works he has done are \u2018Sora\u2019 from No Game No Life and \u2018Kirito\u2019 from Sword Art Online. Taira is voiced by Yui Ishikawa. Notable works she has done are \u2018Mikasa Ackerman\u2019 from Attack on Titan or \u2018Violet Evergarden\u2019 from the very popular Violet Evergarden.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nWeak plot and characters with no growth make this anime already pretty bad. It has some good points speaking for it like the music or voice actors, but finally fails at the most important parts. If you want to watch a story about monsters in human form, you should watch tokyo ghoul or parasite. For a vampire story, you should try out shiki, which is far better thought out and developed than Devils Line.",

            "content": "WOW did this anime disappoint me. \r\nWhen I heard this anime was coming out, I ran to read the manga. The manga was great. It managed to combine both the romance and vampire plot lines together without one overshadowing the other and I loved that. I watched the first episode of this and knew I was in trouble. \r\nFirst, the plot line. The biggest problem was they always either shortened the plot lines, or lengthened them for absolutely no reason. I mean they had one fight continue for 15 minutes when it lasted maybe 4 pages in the manga. And as I said it wasfor NO REASON! Also, the plot went all over the place. One second there's a vampire attack, then there's a romantic scene with absolutely no transition into it. They explained some things so fast even if it was super important??? It's super disappointing how they took away so many things from the manga that would have enhanced the story so much more. \\n\\n\r\nNext, animation. So wow. That's all I can say. And not in a good way. The characters felt so stiff at times even during very emotional and crazy moments?? Honestly it was almost funny how straight faced and bored they looked at times. \\n\\n\r\nI don't even remember the music from this anime and I usually skipped the opening and ending, so nothing noteworthy to say there. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a HUGE letdown. I think the art played a huge part here. They acted so stiff and bored that it was pissing me off! I was actually getting mad. The characters backstories seemed so cheap and brushed off in the anime that it didn't even make sense. Also, they made a lot of the character's decisions seem dumb as hell! Like they barely explained why they did certain things. Also, none of them seemed to have any development which made them all feel very flat. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would not recommend this anime. I only continued to watch it because it was only one episode per week, but I even skipped some of the episodes when it just became too much for me. If the story seems interesting to you, please do yourself a favor and skip this anime and go straight to the manga instead.\\n",

            "content": "So I picked this show up just randomly browsing and I saw one of the posters/ads for it. Being a nerd of horror related things and having a lack of shows to watch at that given time, I figured I would give this show a try.\r\nThe show was only 2 or 3 episodes in, and I'm a pretty impatient person, so I decided to look at the manga. The subject matter seemed interesting to me, so I figured it wouldn't hurt.\r\nThis series definitely falls victim to the original content being sacked/cut out for time. If I remember correctly, episode 12 ends around chapter 40? Eachchapter is approximately 30-40 pages. That's a lot of content to cover for 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI hate to be that guy, but if you were/are hoping for stronger character development, read the manga. I binged all 59 available chapters that were currently out in about a week. I originally had the impression that Devil's Line was a Tokyo Ghoul copycat, but the story itself evolves into something completely different. It'd be a little rash to compare devils and ghouls, too.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a manga review, so I'll be talking about the anime from here on out.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation at times was weak and awkward. It was noticeably choppy more than once. The coloring of the characters and the background didn't mesh sometimes either. It looked like you were looking at two different scenes at once.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending really upset me. I won't mention what actually happened in the manga, but even if you didn't read the original content; the ending was horseshit. It was terribly rushed and wasn't believable in the slightest. Given how timid and stubborn Anzai is, he would not have reacted the way he had, nor would he have easily let go how much he hates himself despite how persistent Tsukasa is. \\n\r\nThis is my own personal opinion, but I really disliked Kikuhara's voice. Not how I envisioned this originally well written psychopath's voice. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the positives, I did like the music/OST/opening. I thought the ending was kinda lame, but I didn't hate it. I'd include the characters here, but for me they just weren't fleshed out enough in the anime. Lee wasn't as good of a comic relief either. Ishimaru is also one of my favorite characters in the show/manga. He's written more as a complex guy as well as someone who I enjoy to see because of the fact I find him to be pretty well written. The anime made him seem one-dimensional and boring. I was really exited to see him, but I was only let down.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, 6 is a generous rating.",

            "content": "SPOILER FREE REVIEW\r\nDevils Line has very mixed reviews. Some people love it and some people absolutely hate it. I personally enjoyed this anime and I will try to explain why I did. \r\nFirst of all this is a vampire-romance anime targeted towards adult audience so it might not be your cup of tea. I've watched quite a lot of vampire animes, but for some reason they are usually very bad. They don't stick to the original concept of vampires because they leave things out like bloodthirst, fangs, the need of blood to survive etc. However the vampires, or the 'devils' like they are called inDevils Line, stay true to the original concept. Which is refreshing to see. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally I found this anime interesting and I really liked the romance between Anzai and Tsukasa. It's definitely not your everyday highschool kinda romance. It shows the struggles of a devil-human relationship and it makes you wonder who the real 'devils' are. The humans or the vampires?\\n\\n\r\nI do have to say that the ending left me very unsatisfied. It went to a kinda weird way and could have been way better. \\n\\n\r\nSome people say that this story is like a copy of Tokyo Ghoul, because of the half-vampire concept, the eyecolour changing, attacking humans etc. That's just ridiculous. Vampires attack humans that's logical and the 'half' concept is used in a lot of animes. So those claims don't make any sense.\\n\\n\r\nAlso don't let the first few episodes mislead you into thinking it's an stupid ecchi anime or something because it isn't. \\n\\n\r\nSo was this the perfect vampire anime? No it wasn't. It still lacked on several points. For example the background music. It's almost never there which is sad because it could make the watching experience way better. (The ending song is amazing tho.) The pacing was a bit slow in some episodes but overall okay. And I wish Tsukasa showed a bit more emotions. But overall this anime is way better than the other vampire animes and enjoyable to watch. It's definitely a step forward in the vampire category. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend you to watch this? If you like vampire romance stories then yes. If not, then this is not your cup of tea and chances are high that you wouldn't like this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I have a feeling I might be the only one who actually quite enjoys Devils Blood, haha. I only stumbled upon this anime yesterday and I've already watched 5 episodes and started reading the manga as well. There's something about it that just keeps my interest up. Let's talk about the different aspects of this anime in more detail!\r\nThe plot is pretty good if you like the vampire genre even though it's nothing unheard of and there are a few differences compared to usual vampires. There's definitely a lot more blood in the fights between the 'devils' and humans than there is blood-sucking. While thevampires here don't NEED to drink blood, their thirst gets the best of them whenever they SEE human blood. The animations during fights are neat and the overall art is very neat, but nothing especially unique.\\n\\n\r\nTurns out that Taira's childhood friend has been a vampire all along and at the point where events begin, he takes our dear, naive female protagonist to a rather isolated street of the town. That's where Anzai, who is half devil, half human, and part of a special team that focuses on solving (murder) cases involving devils, saves the heroine from her good friend. The two of them more or less immediately fall in love and that's where I find some things rather inedequate. First off, Anzai is really hot (ngl I LOVE his character design), but he already got his hands all over Taira shortly after they met because of a bruise on her lip. And Taira, who has never had a big interest in men enjoys it and even starts dreaming about Anzai who kind of starts stalking her, which she doesn't mind either. Whatever the occasion, she just goes along with the flow. It's completely valid to see her as a bland character because that's what she is, more so for a protagonist. At the same time I can accept that since she sometimes jumps over her own shadow and I've seen way more annoying characters.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, I can say for sure that I will continue watching this anime. I'm curious on how the relationship between the main protegonists will develop and what else there is to offer, story-wise.",

Love between to different species, they killing, the hard part of being a vampire because you can\u2019t get a job etc.) I really don't think everyone is actually watching and understanding the concept of the whole story, I have already read the manga, I\u2019m actuallycurrent with it, it\u2019s actually interesting but again everyone has there likes and we have to respect it. \\n\r\n I\u2019m loving the voice characters, they choose such great ones.  The singer from the ending, c\u2019mon is Miya no Mamoru for god sake! They soundtrack is also good too.

I have been reading the manga for a while and though the character development in Tsukasa's case is...well, non-existent, I can't stop myself from enjoying the story as a whole. \r\nThere are underlying elements to the story, like the world, that really draw me in. But this has been in terms of the manga. \r\nIn terms of the anime...someone help, please. (I have watched all that has aired as of today.) I find the animation a bit wonky and the music is abysmal in my opinion. It gives me thisweird, creepy feeling like I'm watching something I shouldn't be instead of evoking emotion and making me fall in love with scenes. I despise all the music from the intro/outro to the scene soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nBut you know what, if you're not here to overanalyze and just want to enjoy watching something cool - a little brutal, kinda science-fiction, all the cop action - then you'll probably enjoy this. My approach to anime nowadays is don't think about it too much, just have a good time. \\n\\n\r\nIt's okay to let Devil's Line be a guilty pleasure. You won't regret that.",

            "content": "Spoiler Free:\r\nDevils\u2019 line has several well executed elements - a terrific story, a solid romance, well animated, full of great dialogue without sacrificing action, SOME good characters, but there is one aspect which brings others down with it: the female lead, Tsukasa.  \r\nThe story is phenomenal.  There are multiple compelling sub-plots woven into the romance seamlessly making the anime appear as a single, multi-faceted story.  The dark atmosphere is perfectly captured visually and through the voice acting. The pacing is fast which amplifies the drama, but perhaps at the cost of characterization.  Also, in the first few episodes, the story felta bit rushed.  Devils\u2019 line can hold its own on the story alone, even without the romantic component.  The romantic aspect is good with respect to everything except for Tsukasa.\\n\r\nThis is the entirety of what the audience knows about the female lead: She is in college; she takes good notes; she lives alone; she seems to be uninterested in guys; one of the classes she is in is a history class. She\u2019s quiet.  That is everything \u2013 we don\u2019t know her hobbies, passions, family, after college plans, or anything about her personality other than being relatively reserved. That\u2019s it.  She seems to be made as generically as possible so female audience members can self-insert.  However, if there is one thing Yuri On Ice should have taught the anime industry, it is you do not need a generic, female protagonist devoid of personality in a heterosexual relationship to create a romance appealing to a heterosexual female audience and becoming a massive financial success.  The other characters were made quite well, and their personalities are portrayed in a \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d way. \\n\r\nThis anime could easily be 8 or 9/10 if only for slightly more character building of Tsukasa.  Some have compared the story to Twilight, which I believe is unfair, as it is superior in many ways.  However, they share one commonality outside of being a vampire romance, an uninteresting, underdeveloped female lead.",

Its very ironic but I guess its true. That is onepart that I absolutely loved about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe fluff-fluff romance part are also the important that gave essence to this story. Like how blindly trusting is not enough in relationships. Many of the human-vampire relationships failed in the anime even when before they swore to trust their partner whole-heartedly. Understanding and communicating are depicted by the main couple and I simply love this honest and straight-forward interaction without wishy-washy approach.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all,I really enjoyed this anime and hope you guys will too.",

If you don't like Twilight, you're not gonna like this. If do you like Twilight you might like this. \r\nI won't lie, this isn't a good show. However if you want a quick, really cute romantic vampire show to watch, then look not further. I found the romantic moments to be funny, sort of sexy, and just kinda cute. I really like how inmate yet still naive the main couple could be. There are a couple of moments where Isimple have no idea how we got to this point, but I accepted it cause again....the main couple is very cute. \\n\\n",

            "content": "If an insta-love Twilight-esque story is your thing, this anime is for you.\r\nAlthough I haven't finished the series, I have seen enough to recognize its faults.The focus, romance, and characters are its biggest disappointment.\r\nCharacters and Romance \r\nOh my goodness, I don't know where to start with this. I believe that this element is the anime's weakest point. The main protagonists are boring cheap copies of other vampire-human romance. \r\nTaira is an empty shell of a character, whose only purpose is to act as Anzai's love interest. Seriously. A Mary Sue character, just as forgettable as my pending assignments. I would even say that if shewas to be taken out, the anime would've still flowed the same way. \\n\\n\r\nAnzai is your typical brooding mysterious vampire. Though it is the cliche, \"I am a tortured soul with a dark past\", he is far more interesting than Taira. \\n\\n\r\nI can't support the romance between the two at all. I prefer a slow burn romance, and their insta-love story is quite rapey and creepy too. In the first episode, literally probably an hour after they first met, Anzai kisses Taira. You would think that Taira would pull away, probably smack some sense into him and stay the hell away from him. But no! She just sits wide-eyed, and even catches feelings for him! I will at least give her a single clap for hitting him with her bag, but she hits him for using tongue in their kiss! Nope, that's not it. There's more! Anzai is not only a sexual assaulter, he also is a creepy ass stalker! Surprise!\\n\\n\r\nHe freaking visits her through her balcony at night, smells her hair while she's sleeping, and get this, he scolds her for trusting a stranger! Haha, as if he was one to talk. I just feel plain uncomfortable in the \"cute\" scenes. She stares at him wide-eyed, blushing lots, as this rapist-stalker kisses and hugs her. But that's okay, he's hot anyways! Jeez, honestly I find myself laughing most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nI understand that their bond grew slightly as they had been spending time together for 2 months, but it would've allowed for a deeper and more complex relationship if the author allowed it to develop while the mystery was ongoing. But I just can't support a relationship that stemmed from a forced upon kiss on the night they met, and the guy stalking her all the time. \\n\\n\r\nFocus\\n\\n\r\nIt's such a shame because this anime had a lot of potential to become more enjoyable. Anzai being a police officer brought a lot of excitement for me, thinking that I will be swept into an enticing mystery. I thought that it had a lot of potential to go into a similar storyline of Death Note, wherein there is a conflict of ideals from both ends. Unfortunately, the writer chose to highlight the lack luster romance more. I almost dropped this series as the first few episodes was dedicated to developing the relationship between Anzai and Taira. (I had to google her name because of how forgettable she is. I will delve into this more in the character section)\\n\\n\r\nI will say, though, that by the 4th episode, the storyline begins to pick up, bringing a thrill for the viewers. However, I believe that the writer could've captivate the viewers by the first episode by developing Anzai and Taira's relationship slowly as the storyline moves forward. I would love to see this being rewritten in this manner.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nThough the romance and characters are lack luster, I will say, though, that I will continue to watch this anime, and maybe read the manga. Thankfully, the author caught my attention just in time with the introduction of a new character and the thrill of action. I would've wished for less focus, or better yet none at all (please delete Taira from the series, no from existence, and it will become better), romance as I definitely see the potential in this plot. You can't exactly trust me, as I have not watched nor read the whole thing yet. I will be back with a more updated review.\\n\\n",

The romance was touching, but at the same time could've been focused on a little bit more, it would have been interesting if there was more of a love triangle as well. I was so disappointed in the ending though, it was too abrupt. I suggest to read the manga first before the anime, this means that when you get to the end that you know there was more to it; at the same time the anime was a lot more enjoyable then the manga (obviously until the ending), but that might just be because I read themanga online instead of an irl book",

            "content": "Frankly speaking, it was rather bad of a series I could have decided to watch. \r\nThis will sure to be a good and through spoiler to people, those who didn't watch might need to rethink about reading this review.\r\nAt first, I thought it was going to be more action than romance and drama. But right the first episode, and I bet it went the same for all people, I realized this was a through and through josei series. Handsome guy, short fused, cares about someone he didn't know, then afraid of hurting her so went on pushing her away, thinking it was for her ownsake, got told that he needed to control himself, rather than pushing her away. After going through some more danger, they finally confess to each other and start being a couple. But then, some bad guy just have to mess it up for them and they have to find a way to deal with it as the climax. \\n\\n\r\nThat was basically what the series was about. I didn't know this title, both in Manga and Anime and only decided to watch it since I didn't know what to watch at the time. It was bad, but rather decent. \\n\\n\r\nSure, plot line was predictable. Vampire guy and human girl romance? Oh? Where have I heard of that idea before? Right. Almost everywhere. To top it off, it was so predictable, I was even able to predict a lot of it, just going by meta thinking instead of plot clues despite it involved investigation by police and what not. Still though, it targeted a genre which was so familiar and well liked, speaking objectively, I can see that it can't be going anywhere too bad. \\n\r\nDespite all that, as someone who was familiar with works dedicated to female audiences/users of the culture, I have to say, this was as bad as it can get around the problems. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off, after heading down the road of predictable plot line, which you see like, everywhere, character building was awful. Well, it was awful overall, saved for one character, main protagonist love interest, Anzai Yuuki. He was actually complex by standard. \\n\\n\r\n  Starting off, he actually looked like he was a bad guy, following the two who seemed like main characters like a stalker but was in fact a police officer who went to arrest a serial killer and rapist. +\\n\r\n  Is basically strong enough to apprehend a vampire. Oh, so that means he's going to be stronger than most bad guy. +\\n\r\n  For personality, he was cold as snow, easily push protagonist away from danger like nothing. But then, that snow quickly melted as he took her home. Ok? He's a good guy, just not the friendly kind. ++\\n\r\n  He then almost \"raped\" protagonist at her door but controlled himself. Yeah.... Hot and actually able to control himself. +++\\n\r\n  As he pulled himself back by sedative, he shows that he was desperate. Now he's attracted to protagonist and have to resort to foreign elements to control himself. Well, that's cute. +\\n\r\n  Then he admit it himself that he is a vampire. A HALF vampire, to be exact. So? You are going to give him 3 more points just by that setting? +++\\n\r\n  After that, he was so concerned over the girl that he had to go back to see her so very often. Now, how are you going to top it with building one hell of a hunk in one episode? +++++\\n\\n\r\nJust like that, Anzai got himself 16 pluses in just episode 1. Wow. Now that's a guy I want to fall in love with and date him. Yay! - is what I pretty much expect all female audiences (physical sex may vary) to think, say, scream or fangirling about him. That is not talking about his design. I myself can't  quite score him on that, so he actually have more score than I can measure.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to that, protagonist was a college student, fairly cute, have rather nice personality, can easily accept everything, never felt in love before and is innocent but able to take the initiative. \\n\r\nUhm? Why so much of a blank sheet? Well, not my problem I guess. It's a series directed at women after all.\\n\\n\r\nThen, the rest of the cast was even worse. All of them were simple. Their reasons for actions are staple as well. \\n\\n\r\nWell seen plot and staple character? Let's say, art and animation was good then, since character design... was... good...... Ok? I needed like 15 minutes to get used to 2D hand drawn art style. That's even longer than Seikai Suru Kado and Ajin. Enough to say I guess. \\n\\n\r\nSound? What about sound? \\n\r\nWell, not that good but it was good. Especially, the vampires who lost their control sounded scary. Just like a bunch of zom...b..i...e...s? Ok, am I just watching to find faults now? That's not even with sound, it was in story, damn it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd don't even get me started on that ending where the protagonist  could have done something, more like almost everything to help at the very end. Yet she only saw what was in front of her and started doing shits the long way around. It's fine, I'm not triggered by that inaction.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: I tried to find a way to raise the score I can give to this series but I can't, despite thought it could have been good. Thought so to even watch all 12 episode. Only thing is, I couldn't do it.",

For this reason some people who know them want to eradicate all vampire. \r\nThis story look so damn unique and good...\r\nThis anime is bad, i won't speak more about it there already are a lot of review about it.\r\nSo why I'm writting this review ? and why i give it a fucking 8 ?\r\nBecause there is another story behind this, a story without vampire. A story with only men and women.\r\nSome men can't accept their lust, they undergo it, fight agai... Why the fuck i'm speaking about it?\\n\\n\r\nBecause it's the true story of this anime, or at least another intepretation of the story ( we have to ask the authour to know ). It's probably not the most exciting story nor the most popular. Vampire is a good way to speak about it and have some action scene. Anyways let's forget these \"devils\".\\n\\n\r\nVampire are a metaphor of men's lust (in general human's lust), from the start vampire's attack and sex are bound. When they loose controle et attack a woman they rape her, well this is not the first story which bound vampires' bite and pleasure. They have this thirsty of blood, or should I say thirsty of flesh, they also can train themselfto control it or fap to \"relax\" ( This scene when Anzai and tsukasa are in the room and \"train\" with handcliff ).\\n\r\nWhen tsukasa's teatcher tryed to rape her, Anzai have come in \"beast mode\", latter teathcer say to Anzai that he is like him, he was excited by the scene, by the blood.\\n\\n\r\nAnzai like some other vampire struggle against his inner demons. He is afraid by losing control and becoming a beast. In the begining there is a man who cut himself to keep control. They exactly act like people who can't accept their sexuality. They hate themself for it, they want to supress it. These ideas appaer several time in the opening  ( \"into the deep darkness  falling becoming a ugly appearance.\"; \"The drop of falling apart feelings,\\n\r\nA dangerous smell. A kiss of sadness.\\n\r\nA presented smile violently pierced the chest.\\n\r\nCan I... Can I... Can I... Who am I...\" ...)\\n\r\nSomehow they lose themself, they don't get who they are, when Kikuhara ask Anzai who he is, Anzai is shocked by this question. He is ths son of night and Hans is the son of light. Hans live with it, and Anzai fight against. \\n\\n\r\nAnzai hate vampires, and this hate come from his youth, When people hatetheir sexuality it often come of their youth. A person, an event have traumatise them, for Nanako it was the rape\\death of her mother. \\n\r\nfinally, in the last episode, Anzai is filled with remorse due of the fact he bit and hurt tsukasa, he also say \"i hated the vampire inside of me, i hated myself\" . It's common for this kind of people to hate themself and feel guilty after falling for their lust.\\n\\n\r\nthey said \"blood is only a pretext of the transphormation\", I also think that vampire are only a pretext for the real story. \\n\r\nFor me this anime is a golden shit, from far we only see the shit but if we look closer we can see an interetsing story and characters developpment\\n\\n",

But I wanted to give it a try and I'm glad I did.\r\nThis anime is all about vampires and has some Tokyo Ghoul elements in it (which I enjoyed because I also like Thokyo Ghoul). I think it suits the series quite well and makes it more interesting. However I read some reviews and people are complaining about that. If you are NOT interested in vampire stories, you shouldn't watch it (it doesn't make senseto watch a genre you haven't even liked in the first place and then complain because the anime is about vampires, or because it reminds you of Twilight). \\n\\n\\n\r\nI like the way they showed vampires in a different and more modern way. \\n\r\nPersonally I'm not a vampire-lover, I just watch fantasy-romance animes that seem interesting. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are interested, just give it a try. Taste's different. But I think people should be fair and not combine Twilight with every vampire story (that has also some romantic parts in it).\\n\\n\r\nHave a nice day.

            "content": "This review may contain some spoilers. Not anything major, but hard to give a decent review without mentioning some things, so read at your own risk. I'll try keeping them at minimum.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe setting is a world with humans and vampire-like creatures (called \"Oni\" which means demon in Japanese) that look like humans but basically go crazy after seeing or drinking blood. Oni try to live their lives (well, most of them do) normaly without killing or drinking blood and are afraid of going crazy and hurting people. The MPD Public Safety Division 5 is in charge of handeling the Oni and investigations and theCCC (Chosen Civil Community) is an organization with the goal of exterminating Oni. The story revolves around a half-human-half-oni MPD investigator Yuuki Anzai and Tsukasa Taira - a human who he saved from an Oni. They fall in love and go through several moral dylemmas and tough situations together. While the story itself is interesting, the plot is rushed and this would have been a lot better if it were a 24 episode anime. There's lots of things left unexplained and I doubt we'll get another season considering the ending (not spoiling).\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle and animation are on point. Hard to find a bad remark about them. The dark colors work really well with this kind of setting. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice cast does a good job on this one, especially for the main character Yuuki Anzai. The deep and warm voice really suits him.\\n\\n\r\nNothing really special about the background music, but it fits the scenes well and keeps the dark atmosphere going. \\n\\n\r\nInteresting opening and ending themes.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned in the story section, this would have been a much better anime if it went on for 24 episodes. Lacking in character developement. Tsukasa falls in love with Anzai at first sight and follows him uncoditionally everywhere, even gets hurt because of him or to help/save him. There's no real reason for this nor is there enough time for their relationship to grow to such lengths. One might say it's just her character, but I'll go ahead and say it's just a lack of her character and rushed writting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design is really cool though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all that, I really enjoyed this show, along with it's ups and downs. Not exceptional, but really good for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMaybe 8/10 is exagerated in terms of raw quality, but my overall rating is always influenced by how much I enjoyed the anime, so in terms of objective quality I'd say the rating should be around 6.5-7/10, but with enjoyment being 9/10 for me, I give it a 8/10 total.",

For the story, it's just too much, there are many characters and they have similar look as each other (luckily our main characters are somehow different from the others). The main girl doesn't give me any impression except her love for the vampire, the vampire - the girl's boyfriend - in my opinion is quite weak, who loves breaking the rules, jumping and can not control his desire for blood. No impression on this character,too. But the supporting character did a great job, he is funny, helpful and he knows his strengths. I like the way he lives his life.\\n\\n\r\nAbout this anime, it's quite entertaining and that's it :)",

That's sad It makes for a very disappointing anime.\r\nThis was one of the two shows I was looking forward to and the only highlight of my Saturday nights. It was a good show but the ending was very lackluster. And once again, something I like almost makes me want to read the manga, but I strongly dislike black and white pages with hardly any words to tell an actual story.\r\nSo I have to deal with this vague trainwreck. Basically, it's about a girl meeting and falling for a vampire. Stuff happens and she has to move in with him which is the top floor of a bar. The main villain is a group called the CCC but there is one episode for two minutes that shows his mom and his dad but the vampire, Yuki, doesn't know he just met his mom.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know, they just threw it in to make sure it was mentioned I guess. I liked the romance part of it. But the action was good too but it just didn't end the way I wanted it to.",

However, DL has a tendency to re-use and recycle very basic character traits that in the end just make it a very round-about anime making you feel that you wasted a large amount of time.",

            "content": "First review ever written. Watched only 6 of the episodes. Let's start.\r\nThe story: 6/10\r\n It is actually quite basic story about romance and vampires. Nothing unique and new I can say. If u have watched Tokyo Ghoul, you can definetely tell that they are placed in it some elements from the anime. Maybe that was the reason I gave it a chance after the first episode. Vampires are represented with many cliches, which is one of the minuses. Generally, the vampires are always or too overburdened with qualities or they are missing. No middle position. Here, though, there are not as many qualities as itshould have been, except that they drink blood. Perhaps, if the story was not made on a vampire theme, it would've been more likely to be liked by the people. But of course they are and some good things about the story. Its actually really exciting the whole love thing between the two charachters, at least for me. The story is proceeding rly fast which is maybe not so good, but for an anime which is not going to be probably continued, i think is fine.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n Its good. Nothing which I havent expected. Dunno what to tell more here. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n I am quite dissapointed with the opening. The rhythm goes fine with the story and everything, but just..something is missing. Maybe the vocals just dusturb me. I dont know. I cant say anything about the ending, just because I haven't listened it properly. Its kinda sad tho.\\n\\n\r\nCharachters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n Here it goes.. Lets start with the girl here. Well, the girs is basically a normal student  who only studyies and doesnt have any interests in men. What really bothers me about her is that she kinda doesnt have character. For a main personage, just without something unique, whats the point? \\n\r\n The boy. Well, maybe he is the one who compensates the character of the girl with his actions and intentions? He is the lonely wolf u can tell, who wants to protect everyone by suiciding his own life. The story is mostly about him and his feelings. He is that kind of a characher who is always searching for some kind of answers not asking the questions, if u know what I mean. He kinda attracts all of the attention when the anime should be spinning around the girl's life, cuz everything starts with her. Kinda confusing I can say. \\n\r\n The other personages. Well, the boy with the white hair is definatelly the one who gives the dynamics in the anime. He is the one who brings the whole story back to life. The savior. He brings back this entertainment. Thats why I like how they make him. And the cops and the others who are left.. well they are this kind of boring charachters that are just there to slow down the motion. They could be made so much funnier to give u that enjoument, cuz actually the anime holds only on the white haired guy, which is rly sad.\\n\r\n If they did actually put and some other main charachters, the raitings would be higher.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoument: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\n I give 7 just because I am kinda interested in this love story. The action and everything are rly not satisfying. The whole dynamics is kinda lost, but because of the main boy there and the white haired guy, i will give higher raiting. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n Give a chance to this anime. First watch the first episode then come to read the reviews. All of the things said here are with a rly low ranking, but after I watched it, its not so bad. Yeah, u can definatelly tell its kinda miserable at first point. Yet, i am still watching it. Try and then judge it.\\n",

'blaming the victim'-y. but i kept watching cuz i'm crazy about vampires, and i do think it gets better. in fact, while the main characters' relationship is initially rushed and kind of creepy, thelatest episodes seemed to be much more intelligent and healthy about it. things like consent and communication showed up and that made me very happy.\\n\\n\r\nit's a little too early for me to review the plot, but i do hope it develops more, cuz if the main focus is always going to be the mc's relationship, the show might be pretty boring. there are hints of a bigger plot though so... here's hoping!",
