            "content": "Preface:\r\nImagine three popular light novel writers who just so happen to be good friends, one evening, drinking to their hearts' content and then, drunk, doing some brainstorming for a story, wondering whether or not something like that really could and should be done and then, someone, for some dubious reason, wills a comparatively large franchise that nobody saw coming and also nobody really wanted, spanning across several light novels and an anime production, tointo existence. Yeah, now wouldn't that be hilarious?\r\nAnd while that may all sound like yet another cynical, third-rate MAL introduction rant, it's essentially how things actually played out. So follow the adventuresof Qualidea Code as it stumbles and stumbles and, once again, stumbles!\\n\\n\r\n[Also, this review contains spoilers yet no individual scores as those are p. dumb.]\\n\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\\n\r\nQualidea Code is a special child and wants to be seen as such and yet, despite that or most likely much rather because of it, one of the biggest issues with Qualidea Code is that it's built around a single twist or two, namely \"Our world is fake!\" and \"Our enemies are actually our allies!\" with little else to it and quite frankly, it doesn't even do a lot with said premises.\\n\\n\r\nWhat most certainly doesn't help matters is that the big reveal of QC's world being fake is a relatively predictable affair from episode 01 on. While it's admittedly not possible to figure the entire nature of their world out, with an enclosed area, enabling superpowers, attacked by enemies literally called \"Unknown\" and nobody quite ever mentioning the outside world, the thought of a fake world coming to mind is more or less a given very early on. And considering that finally, after nine entire episodes, that one gets confirmed, the content inbetween feels dragged out to no ends, not to mention everyone and their dog already managed to figure out that the students were alive all along, now fighting for the \"enemy\", the drama of characters dying lost all impact. So what's there in terms of raw plot certainly doesn't convince anyone.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe world building is equally lacklustre. World building is hardly a criterium I would usually bring up and one that gets way too often applied to anime that simply just do not concern themselves with those matters but it is an issue with Qualidea Code that certainly does need to be addressed: With a literally contained setting, secretly occupied by aliens, lead by students of three different schools, one would assume QC would flesh those aspects out and come up with interesting things to say and ideas to present but at the end of the day, the promising setting just ended up as a means serving completely different ends.\\n\\n\r\nThe ranking system, for instance, while ultimately arbitrary and counterproductive with students going after each other in life-threatening situations, could have been an interesting element to what QC has to offer. More points lead to a higher rank, giving out nicer living conditions to the hard-working, ambitious and talented. My main complaint with that is that we are told about these things but not even remotely shown. In fact, the entire premise loses what little meaning it had in the first place halfway throughout the show entirely. Theoretically speaking, the ranking system could have been used for engaging dynamics of competition between schools and students (think Harry Potter) but it wasn't and if there was any purpose to it to begin with, it only served as a drive for Suzaku to aspire to become #01. Yeah, that's it.\\n\\n\r\nThe alien angle is more or less nonexistent. How the Unknown got to coexist with humans, established their enclosed space, none of that is ever mentioned. Quite frankly, that would have been interesting. There admittedly are some laudable attempts with Asanagi and Airi to have a perspective from the other side but that one only amounted to \"We have feelings too, now that really makes you think!\" and that was all too little and too late. A compelling plot on how the Unknown just want to survive as well would have also made some sense and established some badly needed depth but considering how Asanagi and Airi just eliminated all of their comrades (see, only the Unknown that previously had some screentime actually matter!), that just wasn't a thing either. And don't even ask me about specifics about the Unknown themselves, cause, get it, they are _unkown_. That's all you need to know.\\n\\n\r\nThe arbitrariness doesn't stop there either. In total, there are three schools but they barely even matter apart from having different uniforms and separating the characters so character interactions end up as more or less set elements as well. Hime is with Hotaru as they both belong to Kanagawa and therefore, you won't, for instance, get to see a whole lot of interactions between Suzaku and Hotaru, something that is needlessly limiting. Not to mention that Chiba was more or less underrepresented as not only is it the only school without any side characters (Kanagawa got three, Tokyo one and apart from Aoi, those were just add-ons to the battles), we barely ever get to see Chiba. I'm not even sure whether or not it got attacked at all. Does it even matter?\\n\\n\r\nQuite frankly, the setting is paper-thin and considering how much emphasis is placed on that, that sure is a shame and all sorts of amateurish actually.\\n\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the show's meat stems from the characters and those range from poor to somewhat decent, being a bit of a stronger front than the thingamajig of a setting. Suzaku has become a somewhat okay protagonist by episode 03, a point at which it's very obvious that he's a decently likable tsundude, at least if you're willing to ignore that he's not around for about half the series and comes across a bit as someone who's the plaything of a writer having the incredibly clever thought of \"What if I create a character who is obsessed with being a hero... but fails at it?!\". Canaria works as a slapstick machine but little else and is solely defined by her relationship with Suzaku. The same can be said for Hotaru and Hime whose arc endlessly dragged on, essentially being about their special bond of, uh, being ~really~ special \u00fcberfriends and despite the heavy focus on their past, little did we actually learn about them that amounted more to flesh than flash. Asuha, too, is less of an individual character and more about having an attachment to another one, although, as far as onii-chan-obsessed imoutos come and go, she's one of the better ones, not that there's much of a high bar involved. Kasumi fares somewhat well comparatively as he even functions on his own, actually has opinions on things and temporarily serves as a quasi-protagonist actively trying to drive the plot forward and accomplishing just that.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, side characters happen to be way too passive to amount to anything really. Airi and Asanagi, apart from their subplot towards the end, essentially just serve as a purpose of exposition machines. What little can be said of Aoi is that she is less of an individual human being and more of a collection of assigned roles. She is \"the one who went past the barrier and survived\", \"the love interest of Kasumi\" (nothing ever happens with that might I add) and \"the character who switched sides\" (and the reason for that also applies to Hime). Also the character who just so happens to be around. Maybe they should have split up those roles between Kyousuke, Ginko and Zakuro to even out the screentime? They seemed like more interesting characters to me and would have left a bit of a bigger impression than essentially being cool character designs. They didn't even get a part in the non-epilogue. Now that's just sad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing worth mentioning is that there are also some themes that could have and should have been brought up but weren't. For instance, technically speaking, the good guys had been killing actual humans all along, so that could have resulted in an interesting moral dilemma, especially with straightforward characters such as Suzaku or Hime who just want to save their world but that aspect wasn't even brought up.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, it's obvious that Qualidea Code is a result of brainstorming without much thought put into it. There are ideas, interesting setpieces even but several of them just exist for the sake of it with little rhyme or reason and barely any of it ever gets fleshed out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAudiovisual Presentation:\\n\\n\r\nOver the recent years, for reason unbeknownst to me, there have been many pseudo-meaningful, overly generalizing statements on A-1 as a studio in particular, probably hailing from their involvement with popular titles such as SAO, Fairy Tail, KimiUso and simply plenty of anime in general. Most of them are blatant nonsense. I've heard things akin to \"the typical A-1 look\", something that doesn't even exist unless you're willing to tell me that, visually, Space Brothers, Shinsekai Yori, Grimgar and Silver Spoon have lots in common, so it's probably just the weak-minded drawing conclusions after having seen both Working and SAO. Truth to be told, whatever you'd like to attest to A-1 wouldn't hold up at all anyway as they are not bound to a fixed staff to begin with, leading to two generalizations that actually do hold water, namely that being something that allows them to tackle several projects at once and to get more often than what's usually the case into production problems.\\n\\n\r\nAnd production problems are present. A lot. In fact, Qualidea Code is so unbearably ugly, it might as well be the worst-looking show of the year, CG and flash fiascos notwithstanding. While episode 01 still managed to feature plenty of action that was decently animated, everything from the second episode on is just so much of a mess, it's hard to describe. Characters are off-model all the time, and frequently really badly too. It's not just the occassional hiccup. It's also way worse than other productions that got messed up with poor scheduling. It's just exceptionally bad. Animation itself is also largely absent, even when it clearly should have been there during battles, sometimes leading to results with inbetweens left out or entire animation cuts to begin with, either replaced by two stills of supposed character movement or a shot at the backgrounds while noises indicate action taking place closeby. The outcome tends to be hideous, jarring, anti-climactic and additionally hard to follow at times.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the visual side of things didn't even have anything to fall back on. Take Grimgar, for example, another one of A-1's production disasters. Grimgar had decent character designs, gorgeous backgrounds, its action was actually animated and the director was good enough to properly execute the show at all time. Qualidea Code has none of those qualities. At its best, Qualidea Code looks just okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST did have some nice, unorthodox tracks but little that I would go out of my way for to actually listen to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBottom Line::\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, it's not much of a surprise that Qualidea Code is bad, plain and simple. While there aren't numerous issues to count, the ones that exist are fundamental to the point of hurting the core of the entire concept and execution leaves much, very much in fact to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, I'd have to lie if I were to say that it didn't have its moments and with all that said and done, there were some entertaining episodes. Episode 01 is an action-packed adventure with fun and cool people being fun and cool. Despite being an aspect introduced at the end of the penultimate episode, a human cooperating with the Unknown out of love did end up as sort of touching. Some goodwill is on QC's side and the appeal of mixing up superpowered teenagers with a somewhat original setting is very much understandable and I certainly couldn't fault it for being generic. There isn't anything about Qualidea Code that makes me point at it, sigh and say \"Good grief, I hate this so much, it annoys me to no ends.\" and that's a rare thing these days. Canaria's pseudo-death had some impact (shame all that blood didn't really mesh well with the twist that the students were just abducted). The character interactions can be genuinely hilarious, especially between Suzaku and Kasumi - there is lots of goodness to be found in banter that leads to lines such as \"Didn't you know? It's the simple ones that are truly deep. Why don't you take up a bonsai or something?\". Canaria occasionally provided some hilarious comedic value as well. Johannes is easily the best character of the entire show and, even in the context of the entire season, stands out memorably for being such a huge contrast to everyone else involved and breaking all norms. \\n\r\nAt the end of the day, however, it's the light-hearted elements that shine the most - or at all - and sadly, the ratio is hardly in favor of aforementioned.\\n\\n\r\nConclusively, without its visual meltdown but a few tweaks here and there content-wise, Qualidea Code might have even been an okay experience. Not a memorable one, quickly forgotten about two weeks after its respective season but that would still be preferable to \"It's a thing that came to exist for some reason but really, it probably shouldn't have.\".",

            "content": "Qualidea Code is pretty standard, but not unbearably standard. While the character designs may look generic even if it wasn't produced by A-1 picture and the clothing imply a school setting for a sake of simplicity in not giving them unique clothing...\r\nThe anime isn't actually a school setting anime and instead focuses on six characters divide into three groups which run and defend their respective districts. \r\nThe plot: \r\nAfter an attack by a species known as \"unknowns\" humanity is able to organize itself and create a stronghold which is under constant attack by these \"unknowns\". This time however they've gained a power known as \"TheirWorld\" which allows them to combat these unknown. Thanks to these powers they actually make light work of their attackers. Or so they think. \\n\r\nSo those who have \"World\" are limited to teens, but per usual in anime it does a nice job of covering its track. \"World\" is a manifestation of the dreams of the individual when they were put in a cryptic sleep after the unknown invasion. It has a nice message of while adults don't have powers it was adults who paved the way for the future generations. In terms of details to the story it does a pretty good job. Like the crow which was killed at the end of episode 1 was revealed in episode 11. Or the true nature of Hotaru's ability which was never explicitly explained, but hinted at for the moment it would be needed. \\n\\n\r\nSomething I enjoyed about this series was that it was anime original(kind of anime original) and used that to its advantage. It plays to a mystery element and the more you learned about the setting the more you questioned it. Alongside that it drops hint here and there even in the opening which it actually has two of despite being a 12 episode anime. It also has three endings which are lovely to listen to, but are aesthetics. It's however fitting how each ending changes when the \"baton is passed\". Like mentioned the story places focus on three groups of characters which the focus switches around on either because one was killed, incapacitated, etc.\u00a0 However as far as the revelation angle it plays, don't expect much. \\n\r\nLike mentioned the anime is pretty standard, but I don't find much fault in it other that. Especially considering how it's a 12 episode anime. As a 12 episode anime the pacing is nice having a quick chain of events while also having an episode to slow itself down when it needs to. \\n\r\nEven the second episode which second half was a poor choice of idea with how they went with a form of swimsuit episode felt like important set up to the next chain of events. \\n\r\nWhile the anime does have after credits scenes they're not necessary to watch, but add a cliffhanger effect leaving you waiting for the next. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters there's not much to them in terms of personality, but their interactions amongst each other can be amusing. At the same time the anime seems to be self aware poking fun at Suzaku and his A-1 Pictures predecessors with bad social skills. (Seen in Episode 1) \\n\r\nOne thing I didn't like about Suzaku was his character development. For one; the direction of his character development can be seen a mile away. Egotistical guy grows to trust his comrades. K. \\n\r\nBut it's when he first goes into this \"emo\" phase which I found cringy partly due to how sudden it was, but aside from that scene his phase is handled nicely. \\n\\n\r\nGetting to Canaria she is the only person Suzaku cares, but still gets chided by him for what comes off as her fakeness with her peppyness.\\n\r\n In terms of Canaria's character her gimmick is having a gimmick. Alongside that her World is of interest painting a nice picture of the maiden who sings during battle literally setting a soundtrack. (I've never seen Guilty Crown btw.)\\n\\n\r\nWith that Suzaku and Canaria make an interesting pair with how you'd think the two wouldn't get along since Suzaku's an ego maniac, but you have to note he became that way because he hated his own weakness and want to protect Canaria. \\n\r\nI'm a sucker for characters of his type. I found it funny when he felt so superior he couldn't remember the name of a blue haired girl named Aoi before finding out she had a useful ability. Or his policy for answering phone calls. \\n\\n\r\nOverall in terms of comedy it does a nice job not trying to be in your face. The jokes are more quirky than funny which gives it charm.\u00a0\\n\r\nNext I'll bring up the sibling from the Chiba District. \\n\r\nKasumi is made to be the rival of Suzaku and is an opposite to him. Where else Suzaku is always serious, Kasumi doesn't care or so he appears. Again in contrast to Suzaku he doesn't look for recognition and acknowledges how he has his position due to his sister's influence. His sister claims that it is actually beneficial that the two butt heads due to Kasumi's way of interaction. Being Kasumi's sister Asuha knows how to get under his skin and teases him a lot. Naturally the two care about each other, but Asuha rather confused on a romantic level, but Kasumi on the other hand purely see her as a sister. And in that sense it may be fair to say that Asuha's affection is natural with her brother beng the only one she has at her side. \\n\\n\r\nFinally it comes to Kanagawa district. Similar to Canaria, Maihime has this gimmick character of the hyper leader who's overpowered. And Hotaru who has this disciplined gimmick, but who is doting of Maihime and admires her. These two really don't seem like they should go together, but as friends they are convincing. When the story focuses on them it plays well to the suspense that Hotaru isn't going to make it only for it change up the meaning of Hotaru arriving or not. \\n\r\nDespite their base Maihime in particular recieves good characterization. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound\\n\r\nIf someone told me they blew all their money on the artist they hired I'd believe them. At the same time. The OST wasn't anything godly. And for some reason they only gave Canaria one song. The animation can be be sloppy at times the most notable being when Maihime and Suzaku combine their attacks and it end up being a slideshow. The still images were sloppily drawn as well. If there's anytime animation shouldn't drop, it there. \\n\r\nBut episode 12, the last one was horrendous. And I'm not talking about badly drawn. I'm talking about how they made you look at a wall while the characters fought. The movement was so slow as well. \\n\r\nSlideshow the animation is what it was. As the final fight episode that it was it was a failure, but in terms of ending the series it was well done. \\n\\n\r\nSo as mentioned, it's second episode and poor animation give people an easy reason to drop it.\\n\r\nAs a time waster it was worth my time and something to look forward to each week. So I'll leave it with a 7/10.",

I certainly had hype for him, A-1 pictures maybe its not the best studio, but some of his works are excellent, atleast in animation, like SAO and shigatsu....but this had one of the worst I've ever seen, but this don't make this the worseanime i will explain why.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nI can not deny that the principle as so much cliche, but i can say that as some interesting plots, and a courageous author at first to your charachters, but only this don't make all, we can not ignore the many holes in the plot that this anime have, so I rate this anime as an interesting premise, but poorly executed, but at least tried to intrigue with some mysteries, so for me is something ok\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\r\nMan as I explained in the introduction, the animation of this show are the worse that i've attended this year, so much inconsistency in all, mainly in the character designs, which ridiculously deformed, out that the action scenes were cut to save frames ...why you do this A-1...usually you save good scenes for important scenes, but this show in animation are bad in  everything.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 7/10\\n\r\nWell atleast we have some good characters in the show they nevertheless have some development, the anime it seems has been divided into steps to introduce the characters, this i liked, because we have some episodes just to develop them, atleast the anime hit it, not to mention that we had a good diversity of personalities that help us to at least get sympathy for someone. So for me we have some good characters with an with an average ~ good development.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\r\nThe better thing in the entire anime, here there is nothing to complain,since they hired Claris, Garnid\u00e9lia and Lisa that are great singers, the only thing I could complain its the use of the osts not always hit the right time, and repair times, but nothing that stands out very.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI can say that I enjoyed the anime, he had some tense moments that I really thought interesting despite all the bad liveliest and holes in the script is something that is hard to explain, but at least I can say that passed my time, of course I will not even remember this anime a year from now probably, but i will not say that I regretted to see, was an anime slightly below the average that out throughout season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nQualidea code not bad as many speak, and not too good with some can defend, but I think your current note and just really a shame the anime was not an good animation/better adaptation, because in my eyes this anime had  a potential and he certainly was not well used, a waste ...\\n\\n\\n",

Honestly overall it was very enjoyable to me it was reallyjust the fact about the main character being a bit stuck up, it gets kinda annoying kinda but overall it wasnt bad.\\n\\n\r\nIf people never finish the whole anime it is hard to appreciate and for someone like me I've actually dropped it once and basically rated this a 6 but some people who told me to finish watching then judge it because they though it wasn't bad and surprisingly I enjoyed it it definitely not the best anime out there or the most satisfying ending but it kinda saved itself, unlike how some anime goes from good start to huh? But hey I recommend just sit tight through a few episodes before it kinda reaches it's climax but overall Ill say 7 or 7.6 or sometin but I gave it a 8 cuz...",

To be honest, I wasn't the biggest fan  of this show in the beginning; it was still a 7/10 for me because I was enjoying it, but it took a while to grow on me.  If your opinion was similiar to mine at the start, finish it before making a final judgment.  \r\nI don't remember what episode it was when theplot took a total 180 and became exciting; I think it was episode 7 or something.  The plot twist is what made this so much better.  A show that was good, but wasn't the best, became so much more.  So many aspects of the story that you knew completely change.  I want to say how the world itself changes, but it may ruin the story for some.  In the end, the characters fit their roles very nicely and I really liked most of them, the action is really good when it wants to be but it's good other times, the sound is really good, I really like both opening themes , and the show becomes really enjoyable.  If you're willing to give what seems to be an average show a chance, you'll likely realize that it becomes a little more than that.  I cannot make you watch it though, so it's your choice. After how much the show improved mid-way through, a 9/10 seems very fair to me anyway.",

            "content": "Qualidea Code has given me a new perspective on cliche anime once.However,due to poor presentation in Qualidea Code,I don't have much enjoyment in this anime,therefore I tried to understand the plot and put my standard and expectation lower,lower and lower...\r\nWhen things come to an end,since my expectation is low enough,I don't have any feelings after watching Qualidea Code.It feels like Qualidea Code doesn't even exist...\r\nStory(3/10)(35%)\r\nFor the story part,since this anime makes a relatively big change in the middle,so I decided to separate into parts.\r\n[First Impression]\r\nThe ideas in Qualidea code aren't refreshing and new.The story is based on a bunch of human characters fighting against aliencreatures \"unknowns\".Most popular anime or movie series,like world trigger or other sci-fi animes or movies have already used such settings so why we are still seeing them in this anime?I won't say cliche is a bad thing but have they at least try to make something new?About the plot,The story is based on human characters doing different missions,that's it,it's just too simple that I cannot further elaborate.\\n\\n\r\n[Episodes]\\n\r\n[Part1:Beginning]\\n\\n\r\nYou wouldn't believe that Qualidea Code will serve us unnecessary fanservice and boring arguments in the very beginning of this anime.In the first 2.5 episodes,most of the time,there're just meaningless arguments among characters and a swimming suit episode,while the introduction for the story and characters are just a little.I wouldn't say it's bad for fanservice and arguments but the amount of arguments are just too much for the beginning of the episodes and the fanservice should put in a proper place,rather than put it at the start.\\n\\n\r\n[Part2:episodes in the middle]\\n\\n\r\nIn general,not very good.The plot seems to go nowhere while rushing at the same time,they tries to move on the story without any explainations on its cliffhangers and its hard to catch up the storyline.You may feel confused when watching but at least you'll feel glad that the plot is finally started to move.\\n\\n\r\n[Part3:Episodes at the end]\\n\\n\r\nIn the later episodes,it starts to become more interesting.The mysteries are started to solving,all the potholes are started to be filled.Youll have a totally different perspective on this anime and felt excited.At this moment,you'll finally find the true identity in Qualidea Code.\\n\\n\r\nHowever,the plot is still rather confusing to me,since they explained the terms of \"code\",\"cold factory\" , \"the world setting\" etc. in a relatively rough and fast way.Even though there're many complex concepts they had to talk into the story,they should use longer length of episodes to explain them but not in a rush,ensure that there's only one idea is in one episode and well-connected ideas between episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end,when things never being explained well,your confused feeling are still there.Even though how the ending is,it feels like the ending is rushed,bizarre and empty,rather than disappointment.\\n\\n\r\n[Individual Aspects in the this anime]\\n\\n\r\n[Part1:Action]\\n\\n\r\nSo did they have exciting plot in Qualidea Code?No,definitely no.The actions are definitely the weakest part of the whole anime because either the characters are too strong or too weak and its not thrilling at all.With poor animation in this anime,it just makes the actions unbearable to watch.\\n\\n\r\n[Part2:mystery]\\n\\n\r\nMystery in this anime is the beacon of hope in this anime.The setting and the plot are confusing but mysterious at the same time.The potential of this anime is to make you feel curious about this plot.What'll happen next?What is it all about???By thinking these questions,you'll find the plot is interesting somehow. \\n\\n\r\nThough the explanations are not done well,mystery perhaps may let you get through a few episodes somehow...\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up,Qualidea code is a cliche show that seems to have potential in it.Unfortunately,due to poor presentation,the story structure is broken badly and doesn't worth much to expect in general.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation art(2/10)(10%)\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is probably the weakest point in this anime,which causes most action anime fans felt disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nApart from poor animated actions,there're also several animation problems in Qualidea Code that I think they should pay more efforts on them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters drawing in Qualidea Code are poor in general.The drawing of the characters are cheap and abnormal.If the camera is far away from the characters,You'll see they just outline the characters shape and fill them with inks but without paying any efforts on specific drawings.\\n\\n\r\nFor the visuals,the colours in this anime are generally nothing special and simple.Nothing bright and rich,it just barely meet the basic 2D anime standard.\\n\\n\r\nFor the camera angles,it may also affects your viewing experience too.Weird camera transitions are all around the place,it's really confusing to get to know whats going on in the show.Ive to rewatch the show again and again to clearly understand what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nSound(3/10)(10%)\\n\\n\r\nSound is another weak spot in Qualidea code,not because of the op and ed,but because of inadequate soundtracks and sound effects.As we all know,soundtracks and sound affects could able to add exciting atmosphere towards the whole show.In Qualidea Code,the main sound source is voice acting.Thats right,the whole show is just a bunch of texts ,meanwhile,soundtracks and sound effects seem to be ripped off during the whole show causing the whole show lack of excitements.\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming aspects are the op and ed,they're the only sound elements with rocking theme and fits into the theme.Im generally felt disappointed about the sound in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(4/10)(25%)\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the obvious and good ones.The show is good at making characters conflicts.Take Ichiya as an example.Ichiya is annoying as hell in the beginning,he like calling his fighting partners useless and he says he like working alone but he will bring his sister Canaria together with him.On the other hand,he has passion on fighting because of his terrible childhood,which is good that the protagonist has some positive attitude towards battles.However,he is over-confidence himself,which result some bad consequence towards the whole Tokyo team.Im generally find these conflicts due to different characters personalities are interesting to watch and makes the plot more richer,which I think it's the highlight of the show in the aspect of character development.\\n\\n\r\nThey also manage the back stories of the characters well.For example,Ichiya and Hima,they both have back stories describling themselves and able to explain the personalities of the characters in the story successfully.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately,they have some flaws in the characters development,which may not appeal to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all,The character designs are too cheap,especially for the unknowns.Similar to the cliche plot,they literally called the aliens as \u201cUnknowns\u201d,again I can't explain the creativity of that,it's just too cliche.For the personalities of the characters:Female characters are mostly caring and heart-warming;Male characters are either overpowerful and over confidence or being a guy who obsessed his own sister,they literally copypasted every personalities of characters from other animes too and the strengths and weaknesses are not well-round.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover,it seems that the pace of the story ruins character development.Most of the main characters are underdevloped and lacking of depths due to rushed plot,which causes some of the MC are being abandoned and affects the arrangement of characters.Most of the MC,for example,Hima and Ichiya will not be noteworthy in some of the episodes but suddenly they will show off again.It feels awkward and weird at the same time and characters in this anime are unable to show off in a proper way.\\n\\n\r\nSo again,similar to the case of the storyline,the character development has both highlights and several flaws at the same time,which could have some of the audience attention,while some people may think it's awkward at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(4/10)(20%)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Qualidea Code will let you deep into confusion,which you will consider whether drop the anime or not.Though at the end,you may feel that the plot seems to be kind of worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately,due to poorly presented plot,this anime doesn't meet your standard any longer,but instead we will have to lower our expectations in order to adapt the rushed ending.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end,Qualidea Code is like a stone near the road that doesn't really noticeable in your anime life.It just feel empty and meaningless...\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude,Qualidea Code is a kind of show that is empty and meaningless.Though it seems to have potential in the middle of the episodes,it doesn't get my attention much or worth any re-watch value. \\n\\n\r\nOverall(3.35/10)(F)(Dreadful)\\n",

It was cliche and many things were left in the dark but it wasn't too bad. Only the way it was executed. Plot holes and details that weren't thoroughly explained or not explained at all but it was an amusing anime.\r\nArt: It was just right for its year, not that I know much, but after watching older anime I saw that the art is well... Except for a few weird... Times. Oh god.\r\nSound: Well the music saved the anime if I may be bold. It was catchy andsomehow gets you hyped and is executed at the right time. Though I don't think it really fit exactly (personal opinion, of course!)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Oh yes! Yes! This part is the second best since the characters showed development (explosively and slowly). I really liked Asuha and her love for her brother (LOL). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well it wasn't so bad but it wasn't really memorable though but still you can watch it for fun or if you've got nothing to watch at the moment. I definitely enjoyed because of the characters and music though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Not the best but not the worst. It had its flaws and good points but this felt like it could've been better but hey, we can't be too picky now can we?",

It is casual, your usual magic action stuff, fun stuff to watch unless you are expecting some godlike story to blow your mind and be your top anime for the rest of your life.

            "content": "First of all i haven't read any of the light novels that the series was based on and as such the first time that i seen the characters and the setting was in the anime itself. \r\nThe main story revolves around children with special abilities that protect the world that was devastated by alien attacks from them. The setting is a near future version of Japan. As settings and stories go this is pretty genetic. \r\nSo then lets get started \r\nIchiya who I call Icchan is one of the main characters of the series. \r\nIcchan's personality at first is of arrogance and stubbornness which is\\n\r\nborne out of his desire to protect the world and Cana. He tends to think highly of himself and does it way too much and at the same time looking down on others. \\n\\n\r\nThis aspect of him I actually hate. However, despite this Icchan is a surprisingly adapt tactician able to come up with useful tactics on the fly something that I did not expect from him. \\n\\n\r\nHis personality changes somewhat after an event in the story becoming \\n\r\na little more considerate of others and more trusting while also learning to \\n\r\nwork alongside with others. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I liked about Icchan was his interaction with Cana which I found to be pretty cute. His personality and demeanor changes a lot when he's with her. \\n\\n\r\nCanaria who I call Cana is one of the main characters of the series. \\n\r\nCana serves as the second in command to Tokyo city and is the Icchan's second in command. Cana is a kind person by nature that always aim to be positive even in the face of despair. When Icchan's personality causes disagreements Cana is usually the one that smooths it out. Cana's special power is rather interesting in that it\u2019s not a combat power but rather a support power that enhances the power of all who hear her song that I call Canaria's song. Cana is an endearing character that I find to be one of my favorites as she can still be positive in any condition. \\n\\n\r\nHer seiyuu Yui Ishikawa really did a great job portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nAsuha is main of the main characters of the series and is Kasumi's younger\\n\r\nsister. Whether or not they are blood related is open to conjecture. Asuha \\n\r\nis overbearing and can get jealous easily but she cares a lot for her brother. \\n\r\nDespite this personality she is an able tactician and able to use tactics to some degree.\\n\\n\r\nHer special ability is ice related and fights with a pair of handguns. \\n\\n\r\nHer character I found lacks a good personality despite her seiyuu's best attempt at giving her one. \\n\\n\r\nKasumi is the older brother of Asuha. Personality wise Kasumi is diligent, calm and cool headed but quiet. Not being a good speaker he can only reply to others with mean words which often gets on other people especially Icchan's nerves. Despite this he serves as a good counter to Icchan whose personality makes it difficult for the others to \\n\r\nget close to him. Kasumi's power seems to be able to materialize a large caliber sniper rifle that uses special rounds. Kasumi has a rather interesting relationship with his sister. \\n\\n\r\nMaihime played by Veteran seiyuu Aoi Yuki and one of my favourite seiyuu's is one of the main characters of the series. Maihime who I call Tenkawa is the head of Kanagawa city and is one of the most powerful characters on the show. Personality wise Tenkawa is caring, loyal and considerate to others and out of all characters she is perhaps the one that embodies the ability users the most which that of a defender. Tenkawa's seiyuu Aoi Yuki really did a fantastic job portraying her and she is easily one of my fav characters on the series. \\n\\n\r\nHotaru is Tenkawa's best friend and is the second in command in Kanagawa. \\n\r\nA powerful swords woman Hotaru is extremely lethal in close combat being able to  destroy any enemy as long as she can see and reach them. She dotes on Tenkawa as lot and cares about her a lot. Interestingly their first encounter was anything but friendly. \\n\\n\r\nAoi played by veteran seiyuu and my third fav seiyuu Sora Amamiya is a support character that is part of Kanagawa city. By default, her personality is that of a meek, timid girl that gets nervous quite easily and excels at support duties. However later on this changes when finally gets conviction and purpose however misguided it was. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point her combat ability though weak in the beginning is revealed to be pretty strong. \\n\\n\r\nAoi I felt was a great character and Sora certainly did a great job portraying her but I felt that her character could have used a lot more development into her. \\n\\n\r\nAsanagi and Airi were originally the officers that commanded the defense of the human realm and as part of this coordinated the actions of the main characters as they fought against the unknown. However, this changed after a point in the story and they become the enemy. \\n\\n\r\nOf the pair Asanagi was the believer in his actions and true allegiances and while he did care about the children ultimately this was for his own benefit. Asanagi was a wise commander that knew when to be angry and when to crack the whip and despite everything he was still an honorable person. \\n\\n\r\nAiri is the other commanding officer that acts as the second in command to Asanagi. \\n\\n\r\nKind, endearing and caring Airi cares about the lives of the children in a way \\n\r\nthat a mother does. She's always the first to object to plans that will harm them in a way. Despite the rather surprising revelation Airi was still one of my fav characters in the series. Mamiko Noto who is one of my fav seiyuu\u2019s really did a great job portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nArt style for the series I found to be good in most parts but some of the environments shown looked rather sub par and boring. Animation for the most part was ok but was of inconsistent quality throughout the series. Character design though was pretty good and I loved the design of Cana, Airi and Aoi. The school uniforms for the cast also looked pretty stylish. \\n\\n\r\nMusic for the series I found to be pretty good especially the two opening themes which was sung by one of my fav singers LISA and third ending theme that was sung by clariS and Garnidelia.\\n\\n\r\nStrong voice acting especially by Mamiko Noto, Sora Amamiya and Yui Ishikawa \\n\\n\r\nOverall I liked Qualidea code in that it had a great story, interesting setting and great voice acting from a talented cast of seiyuu's but this was let down by lack of character dev for some of the main cast and inconsistent art and animation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Post-apocalyptic worlds seem to be all the rage these days. In this take here, we find three schools apparently holding back a seemingly endless wave of alien invaders, who had previously already decimated the Tokyo bay area the past. These schools are all filled with unique specialists. Tokyo is filled with flying magicians that use staffs like witch brooms. Kanagawa are melee specialists and apparently utilize a giant aircraft carrier somehow. Finally, Chiba are ranged specialists, using everything from small arms to gigantic WW2-Germany inspired train-mounted mega turrets. With the combined efforts of these three combative schools be enough to hold back the alien invaders?Moreover, why does everyone have a chip stamped on the back of his or her neck?\\n\\n\r\nThis was one of my stretch watches this season, and indeed, it is a rough patch in many ways. The plot is jumpy, the characters are not relatable, and though there is a bit of excitement later on, the conclusion leaves quite a bit to be desired. Honestly, when the antagonists are referred to as \"Unknowns\", there's an upper limit to one's expectations. If you're looking for a worthy post-apocalyptic experience, there are other superior recent works in the genre like God Eater. If you're looking for a group coming together to overcome odds, there are much more natural progressions like Grimgar. If you're just looking for a lot of action, then this might be a fair show if you're out of other options.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation quality is average for a current show, which means it's not bad. The show has a diverse amount of backgrounds all of which are pretty well drawn. Surprisingly, this \"futuristic\" world is relatively ordinary; there are some futuristic buildings alongside the ruins of present-day Tokyo (like the Metropolitan Government building) but for the most part, there's surprisingly little that is new. In addition, something about the atmosphere feels off; you don't get the vibe that this is humanity's last stand. Annoyingly, a lot of content is drawn in 3D CGI including the water (the battles almost always start over water), the enemy mobs that look like flying pink manta rays, and a good majority of the effects. The characters are average in design overall with a good variety of your typical archetypes. Expressions are average at best overall though there are a few worthy imouto moments from Asuha.\\n\\n\r\nExpect a great deal of action in this show, I'd say there are at least ten thousand mob opponents defeated through the course of the show. Most of the battles aren't particularly engaging though as our main protagonists easily overpower the mobs, and many scenes take place zoomed out with the protagonist as a shiny dot carving a path of destruction in their wake. Some of the opponents also just cheaply disappear in a blinding flash when defeated. One good thing about the schools' varying specialties is a variance in action, there's a good mix of melee and ranged combat. Choreography is average overall though certain scenes late in the show are a bit better. Along with the action there's a bit of blood but nothing particularly gory. I will call out Hotaru's \"Void Strike\" animation sequence as being way too similar to Kira Yamato's Gundam Seed Strike Freedom Burst mode animation. There is a light amount of ecchi with shower/dressing room scenes, but this is not a particular focus of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nQualidea code has a surprising number of different OP and EDs. Both OPs are pretty fast-paced and rock-based, the second of which is superior in my opinion. Claris and Garnidelia sing the EDs; the two groups have a very different style, creating a rather disjoint feeling. The first ED by Claris is rather light in pacing and tonality, whereas the second ED by Garnidelia is much more definitive and aggressive in pacing and melody. The last ED is a collaboration by both bands, and in my opinion is the best song of the bunch with an especially catchy opening melody. Most surprisingly, the show has a pretty catchy BGM as well with a lot of drums and electric instrumentation during battles. There are some nice vocals mixed in as well, including Canaria's battle meditation song.\\n\\n\r\nOf the main heroines, Aoi Yuuki is really the only one I'd consider a veteran; and fittingly her character has the most charisma of the group. You do get many strong supporting characters though with Sayaka Oohara, Mamiko Noto, Sora Amamiya, and Mai Nakahara all in the mix. Mai Nakahara gets the best supporting role award for her lively and surprisingly youthful support late in the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThis is where this show starts to unravel a bit into sub-standard space. So supposedly there's an alien invasion and the best thing the adults can do is cryo-freeze their kids and then retreat. Apparently, the \"dreams\" the kids experience during cryo-freeze somehow ends up giving them X-Men-like superpowers when they are eventually awoken. Thus, humanity, which somehow fends off the aliens to get back to the kids (never explained) now rely on the kids to hold the aliens at bay (literally, like they always appear from the ocean). The kids are divided into three schools as mentioned in the introduction and are for some reason ranked. This creates a great deal of animosity within the greater organization despite the supposedly apocalyptic situation outside of their ridiculous infighting.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a single central plot that roughly divides the show into three arcs, relatively synchronized with the three EDs. Each of the arcs has its own rising action and climax. The show does a good job keeping the viewer on their toes with plenty of huge plot twists and a good portion of the episodes ending on cliffhangers. However, you can't help but feel that a lot of the plot twists feel planted; the progression in general doesn't feel very smooth.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the whole mess once you dig into this show's actual plot code (i.e. reach the conclusion) - you find quite a few bugs and a few infinite loops. Though I now get why the show is some sort of \"code\", it really opens a huge amount of plot holes and unanswered questions that completely ruin the entire show up to that point. Let's just say you'll probably by doing yourself a favor by not thinking about the implications of the conclusion on the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe show doesn't start in a particularly convincing manner. It first introduces Ichiya as the protagonist. Though not your typical harem \"nice guy\", he is even worse as one of the most two-dimensional characters I've seen as a lead protagonist. His constant banter about heroes and being \"enough\" to save everyone is enough to make you sick. Though nicely drawn, Canaria isn't much better as your supportive yet clumsy sidekick and incestuous object of desire. Oh, it gets even better, and by better, I mean worse. From Kanazawa, you have Maihime, an inspirational girl who takes on too much responsibility herself and her katana-armed, ultra-short-miniskirt-clad assistant Hotaru, who for good measure has an unhealthy dedication to Maihime. And of course, from Chiba we have the Chigusa siblings who, by far, have the most interesting conversations of the bunch but yet also have oreimo vibes between them. Though Maihime is fun to watch and the Chigusa siblings have a fair amount of characterization, the rest of the them all are pretty much cookie-cutter junk.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the show tries to convince you that the characters are dynamic by a shift in behavior as the focus of the first arc. I'm sorry, but no way could they have survived this long with their behavior shown in the first episode. With a huge and relatively underwhelming main cast and an even larger and barely-introduced supporting cast, I can't justify giving this high marks.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nSomeone may be calling you from this show, but I think that this is one code you're best off avoiding. Though there are some decent action scenes and a fair level of intensity, the atmosphere just isn't right and the characters don't mesh (both with each other and with the viewer). I did like some of the sound production, but that alone can't justify watching a show, perhaps you should just pick up the OST instead.",

            "content": "Qualidea Code is about a post-apocalyptic Japan that was attacked by creatures called Unknown. The majority of adults were killed off, but, in order to protect future generations, the government forced the world's children into deep sleep. When the children (now teenagers) awoke many years later, they had strange powers called \"World\" and most of civilization was gone. Using their powers, the children fight against the Unknown and help administrate the new military system that was created by the remaining adults. \r\nThis concept sounds entertaining by itself, but it is also one of the problems with this show. There are so many anime where creaturesattack, a large portion of the population or world are destroyed, and then the youth need to save the world. It isn't a bad concept, but it's getting old. I want to point out that this anime does have a certain twist to it, which makes things interesting, but the many flaws of the anime eclipse the show's positive elements. The thing that hurt this show so much was the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI need to point out that most- if not all- of the characters had some kind of trope or stereotype with their personality (i.e. Canaria being a klutz). While tropes in themselves aren\u2019t a bad thing, the problem is that these tropes took over the characters\u2019 personalities made them seem very one-dimensional. While some of the characters are great (like Maihime in my opinion), there was one character that more or less ruined the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that would be Suzaku Ichiya, the protagonist. In anime, there are a lot of main characters that start out as an insensitive tool and then slowly develop compassion or other positive character traits. But Suzaku Ichiya was on a whole other level. To put it simply, he was deplorable. He was arrogant, rude, and reckless. Even after he went through some character development and realized he was being too pretentious, he still isn't very likable. At one point, he kind of drifts out of the spotlight and I honestly completely forgot about him for a while. That's how forgettable he is as a character.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the twist in the story was very interesting, but it was overshadowed by all the series' writing issues. In the first half of the series, the battle scenes were dragged out. Other times the characters had long, pointless conversations that didn't contribute much to the story. Instead of such long battles or unnecessary scenes, I would have focused more on the plot. There were parts that included some background information and character development. However, the emotional scenes sometimes felt over-exaggerated, melodramatic, or prolonged. And even with the backstories, there was lot of information missing from the anime. For example, the backstories of Yuunami Airi and Asanagi Gutoku, two adult military officers, were basically nonexistent.\\n\r\nAbout half way through the series, the story started to pick up pace and get exciting. However, toward the end things seemed rushed. The interesting twist was never really explained. What would have been a really interesting part of the story wasn't revealed in enough detail. How did the world get into the state it was in? How did the enemy infiltrate and evolve? None of this was really explored. Because of the abruptness and the plot holes, when the series ended, I didn't feel satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps if there is a second season, it will all be explained. There are manga and light novel adaptions of the series, and, if I am not mistaken, I think this series is a sequel to Qualidea of Scum and Gold, a light novel. Perhaps these mediums are more detailed and fill in the missing information. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on, the animation gets considerably worse and it wasn't the best to begin with. I felt like the audio was off at times too. It's a shame. The creators probably didn't have enough time or money to make the overall quality better. Maybe if they had postponed the release date, they could have improved the animation and sound. They could have also worked on the story, shortening unneeded parts and expanding the plot.  \\n\\n\r\nWith some changes and improvements, this show could have been really great. However, its flaws overshadow all of the anime's good aspects. Overall, I would give this show a 6 out of 10. I am hoping the anime can redeem itself with another season or with the series' other mediums.",

            "content": "Children who have been evacuated to a cold sleep facility during the invasion by the \"unknown\" several decades ago wake up from their slumber and learn that their bodies developed some supernatural forces. In order to protect the country from the \"unknown\" emerging from the Tokyo bay gate, the boys and girls wage battles in the defense the cities of Tokyo, Kanagawa, and Chiba.\r\nWell introduction to the story sounds pretty standard. Children with super powers fighting monsters while adults are cheering them up from the safe spots. But as we learned in anime that is not a bad thing. Stories based on that cliche canbe amazing and entertaining.\\n\r\nAnd at the beginning QC does not look bad. It has world with not that many plot holes. \\n\r\nWe meet world with three cities or rather three schools that defend their world. HOWEVER these schools does not matter. Only difference between them is how their uniforms look like. And fact that in one school students fly on brooms, second has swordsman type fighters and last one is for marksmen. But that doesn't matter, students are just background for the few main characters and it is very poor background.\\n\r\nWe meet the world with ranking system which was never fully explained. Of course we instantly know that it is based on combat strength of students. It was opportunity to show some struggle going up, rivalry between students. But nope, instead we get... well nothing. One guy who is proud of being #4 and that's all. One guy who is below top 200 and he doesn't care. Awesome use it, show how strong he is despite his low rank. Nope nothing. We met probably two strongest students but that does not matter at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is not complicated and after at most 3 eps you will be expecting the twist. Don't get me wrong. Story is written quite nicely, it is interesting and what is most important - I enjoyed it despite being so straight. I wasn't overjoyed with it but it was decent.\\n\r\nPowers called 'worlds' seemed to be important to the plot. I admit idea of gaining one as the result of dreams is not bad. Child dream about world, gain power based on that world (probably, they never explain it properly) and get supernatural ability called 'world'. And that's all. They are not interesting. Girl unleashing power with her sword made one or two big 'booms', boy controlling gravity never used it in interesting way. Sniper and her sister who is gunner showed few interesting actions but to be fair we never grasped how this marksman's ability worked at all.\\n\\n\r\nBut characters. They were very POORLY designed. I just finished this anime and I can't remember single character's name. But let's give main cast at least some thought and why they were... not the worst but not good either.\\n\r\nChigusa siblings - awkward brother and sister with bond that you will feel while watching them interact. But also I felt very awkward watching them. And I loved Ore no Imouto so I believe I can even accept anime when you put line 'incest ftw'. Their social awkwardness and weird interaction between them was both interesting and creepy. I guess Kasumi was meant to be the smart guy in this anime as well as caring guy who shows it being asshole but it didn't go well. He was just... creepy.\\n\r\nIchiya Suzaku aka #4. At start he is guy who is full of himself and believes that he can handle everything alone. Of course we discover he acts that way so he can protect the girl he loves (what a shocker!). And he starts to change into a little bit more cooperative guy (and more tsundere guy yack!) after accident. Then we see him go berserk after he loses the reason to live, which is understandable but it is again not showed properly so we can't feel bad for him. Instead he was at the beginning annoying asshole, then annoying wimp. Of course he was written to be opposite to Kasumi but that didn't work well.\\n\r\nHis supposed reason for living and fighting wasn't written better at all. Canaria Utara has little to no personality and quirk of being a slouch (is this proper word? the moments when I feel my english sux ;) ).\\n\r\nMaihime Tanekawa was the #1 student who also believed in protecting everybody. Great she didn't left any impression on me!\\n\r\nAnd last but not least Hotaru who was Maihime's friend and something like her guardian angel. They tried to show how strong their bond was but I just couldn't feel it. It was obvious what author intended to write but he did poor job.\\n\\n\r\nBut side characters do not add poor impression. Why? There is almost no supporting cast. Few guys even more forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound seems fine. Wasn't great, but ok. Few nice songs, decent graphics, fights wasn't impressive but didn't look terrible too.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line it is not bad anime it won't make you bleed from eyes or ears but if you don't have much time I suggest to skip that one. You wont miss anything at all. I bet in two weeks I will forget about it.",

            "content": "Qualidea code is an alright cash gra-I mean show. Let's go int more detail. This show has all the elements of a cash grab. \r\n1)They put no effort into the animation. \r\n-To explain what I mean, it seems like they tried to have as little movement as possible(two characters use gun, three of them barely move when they fight, and the 6th character just stands and moves their mouth).\r\n-The characters also look more like the drawings of a manga cover instead of actually being animated fully.\r\n-characters also look really weird sometimes like in episode 11 when a character looked terrible for a few seconds inthe beginning.\\n\r\n-They also fill the screen with special effects which don't look bad, it just shows hat they don't care that much to a point\\n\\n\r\n2) The soundtrack is phenomenal\\n\r\n-I noticed that in all those bad harem shows that keep coming out, they had multiple endings in the span of 12 episodes, but there are also original shows or single season shows that have multiple endings(The unlimited Hyobu Kyosuke/Akuma no Riddle) too, but those shows also had a lot of effort put into animation as well.\\n\r\n-This show has a great soundtrack which can be seen as trying to sell more CDs to substitute the lack of DVD sales.\\n\r\n-as for great songs shout out to the second opening Axxxis, which was a really good song, but was accompanied by a confusingly put together opening sequence(seriously the fist parts of it made some sense, but the part that showed characters fighting each other never happened).\\n\\n\r\n3)They hired three writers\\n\r\n-this isn't really much of a reason why this show could cash grab, but it can say that they ay have been trying to substitute animation with a good story line and music.\\n\\n\r\nI think of made my argument about the cash grab well enough, so let's move on to the other parts.\\n\\n\r\nStory-I can't go to into the story, because that's one of the few things this show has going for it, but I think the story is fine, it had good parts near the very end that make it stick out, but I will say it felt like(while the ending was nice) they were trying to hint that they wanted some kind of sequel(no cliffhangers thought[thank goodness]).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- I think they did well with half of the characters, Maihime, Ichiya and Kasumi were good characters, but Auha, Canaria and Hotaru don't have any character outside their respective partners, you could also argue something similar for Kasumi and Ichiya as well, but they at least seemed to have more character.\\n\r\nIchiya- A delusional hero who thinks he's better than anyone else,.I don't hate this character trait, because a jerk will usually change in good way(unlike rat from NO.6 who was not only needlessly mean, but didn't really develop correctly I felt). Ichiya being rude comes from his overconfidence in his abilities, which isn't bad and I never felt he was too rude.\\n\r\nKasumi- Kasumi is best described as deadpan most of the time or he just doesn't show any expression, and he is also a relatively smart guy. He seemed to do a lot more of the leading at his school despite being second in command, he makes many tactical decisions and and even gets more involved in the plot than his sister.\\n\r\nMaihime-she is an over-the-top leader, she's loud, and she is able to inspire others. She also has a bit more effort put into her back story than the others. She is also an awesome character who is the most powerful main character in the show. She had one of the coolest moments in the series as well.\\n\r\nAsuha-She's deadpan like her brother, and she's also in love with her brother(cringe). I'm really glad those two didn't get together in the end.\\n\r\nCanaria-She's happy and she's in love with Ichiya(It's cute, but she doesn't have any other character[she is kind of dumb though]). I'm not sure where those two stand on their relationship.\\n\r\nHotaru- She's very serious and Maihime's best friend/possibly something more. I think it would be cute if those two got together, but it doesn't need to happen for me.\\n\r\nAiri-She's basically the mother character and I actually enjoyed the romantic moments between her and Asanagi.\\n\r\nAsanagi-I liked his character too. He seem more like the Father character I think, not the perfect father though.\\n\r\nAoi-I don't know what is, but something about this character rubs me the wrong way. I like her design though, despite how having a blue haired character named Aoi is kind of generic.\\n\\n\r\nI think the character interactions were also good, except for the two siblings. \\n\r\nOverall this show is fine. I'd aso point out that really only seemed to be around for her butt, as shown by the first op and last ed. I give this show a recommendation to try or skip, it really doesn't matter. It's only 12 episodes, so that's just 4 hours of your time at least.",

            "content": "This is my first (short) review so I apologize in advance if there is a mistake or something that bothers anyone. This review contain a micro spoiler.\r\nWhen I first heard that the writer of Oregairu and Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko promises to make an anime together, I thought that it will be great. Two different novel writer work together to make an anime sounds very promising, right? But I was wrong. Totally. Here's the reason why this anime looks feels like a crap.\r\nFirst, it's not even a battle anime. It's a slice of life anime. Wait, you have weapons, enemies, and even rivals. So,why did it turns out that we have slice of life scenes instead of battles? I think I will never understand why.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, its story, its interaction, and even its character itself are boring. We have an annoying MC, his overly-kind sister, a cool-siscon rival and his cool sister, a princess captain and her overly-possessive \"servant\". Our MC even have an annoying catchphrase, which is perfect (sarcasm). I can't even describe them in more than one sentence. So what is our protagonist's motive again?\\n\\n\r\nThird, yes, they have battle scene, but it was short and mainstream. MC blows all the monster. His rival snipe everything. His sister singing. His sister's rival is also shooting. Their captain bludgeoning \"unknowns\". All of them aren't exactly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that manages to catch my attention is its OP and ED. Their art isn't look bad but also fails to make the protagonists unique.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime disappoint me in many ways. I don't recommend to watch this, as there are more entertaining anime outside.\\n\\n\r\nSummary :\\n\r\nStory : 1\\n\r\nArt : 7\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\r\nCharacter : 1\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 1\\n\r\nOverall : 1\\n\\n\r\nI wish they would think of slice of life instead of battle.",

            "content": "High School Students defending the world from aliens!\r\nQualidea Code's premise is your typical high school students defending and saving the world with a slight twist to it. Unfortunately the twist in itself doesn't make the anime any better as LA has some very mixed feelings for Qualidea Code.\r\nWell let's start with the characters...\r\nKasumi Chigusa voiced by Yuuma Uchida and Asuha Chigusa voiced by Chika Anzai have the entire annoying sibling relationship together for the most part, with Kasumi being the lone and lazy sniper with Asuha being the bombastic and \"controlling\" of the two and are decent characters overall. Hotaru Rindou voiced by Ayaka Fukuharaand Maihime Tenkawa voiced by Aoi Yuuki are also decent characters, with Hotaru's \"infatuation\" to Maihime and Maihime's overall genki and overall massive source of power making Maihime LA's favourite character, Asuha being a close second. Now for the main characters that kinda irked LA, that being Ichiya Suzaku voiced by Soma Saito and Canaria Utara voiced by Yui Ishikawa, Canaria for LA has the least problems out of the two, that being Canaria is a bit too much of a \"perfect\" girl, albeit not in power, but the \"perfect girl for Ichiya\" but that problem was only LA's opinion. As for Ichiya, well he's the hot-headed leader of the disjointed main 6 of the army to take down the aliens and really from his depression through the anime to his hot-headedness rather irked LA, but come the \"BIG PLOT REVEAL\", these 6 character overall got better (if they were worse anyways). There are some minor characters like Aoi Yaegaki voiced by Sora Amamiya and Mahiru Ookumi voiced by Sayaka Ohara, but overall the main focus goes to the character relationship building as well as world building, the minor characters are really just support.\\n\\n\r\nNow concerning the plot, LA did say this anime has a twist and really this twist really does change EVERYTHING about the anime and really the plot twist did help with the character development and character redemption for many of the characters in this anime (and although they do \"\"\"die\"\"\", even then they develop them further...don't get it?, well watch the anime to the big reveal then you'll get it). Really the first half of the anime is world and character building with some subtle hints to the true nature of this anime and depending on whether your more focused on the characters or the world or both, the hints adds up and makes the plot twist either predictable or unpredictable depending, as for LA, LA thought the plot twist was a welcome addition and changed up what the entire premise says.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as LA likes the plot to Qualidea Code, where Qualidea Code falters is in it's animation which leads us to...\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by A1-Pictures, if anything Qualidea Code's animation quality was probably the MOST erratic of all the animes of Summer 2016, as it had some very good quality animation during the first half, but then the latter half TRIES to redeem it by still making some very good background visuals, but falters in the facial animation derps, janky out of place characters, dissonant color palette (as in too bright characters on utterly dull or outright BLACK backgrounds or vice versa.), reusing shots and erratic dips in quality throughout at times. The animation isn't bad per say, just erratic and that's the ONE word to say about the animation in Qualidea Code overall.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, we have a pretty decent voice cast overall, but be it LA but LA thought there were even some awkward audio issues with this anime mainly with the OST being louder than the voice actor speaking at times, it might have just been LA but still. LA's favourite voice actor?.....Aoi Yuuki, like it was THAT obvious.\\n\\n\r\nNow the \"true villains\" of this anime, really due to circumstances LA saw the true villains a \"sympathetic\", now hear LA out...\\n\r\n*********HUGE SPOILERS DON'T READ UNLESS YOU'VE WATCHED ALL OF Qualidea Code**********\\n\\n\r\nIf anything due to the true aliens \"Unknown\" only wanting to have children as this \"alien race\" can't have children and with Airi Yuunami voiced by Mamiko Noto and Gutou Asanagi voiced by Hiroaki Hirata being the \"proxy\" as villains in this anime and Airi being the gate to opening more of their own kind into Qualidea Code's world, they're really sympathetic as they really haven't done nothing wrong in terms of bloodshed, sure they kidnapped comatose kids and used them as an army to defend themselves from the adults that left during the incident and returned for their kids, but all the Unknown wanted were children (in Airi and Gutou's case anyways, the Unknown motivation aren't really told properly as they can't talk) and sure kidnapping the kids and using them as child soldiers and brainwashing them into thinking the real adults are aliens is their fault, but the real adults are kinda at fault too as they kinda enacted the war between themselves and the true Unknown which caused all this to happen...these \"sympathetic villains aren't much\" but they did impact what happened by the finale\\n\\n\r\n********SPOILERS END*************\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was pretty satisfying and most of the plot threads were what LA expected it turned out with what LA said about the spoiler above. The ending however was GREATLY affected by the janky animation (such as not showing the \"action\" during the fights instead it showing some off-putting scenery, frames that needed \"more frames\"), as much as the plot and characters was great and satisfying with the resolution to all of it, the animation utterly crippled this ending.\\n\\n\r\nQualidea Code definitely has a good anime with a good twist that kept it under wraps for a really long time before Qualidea Code showed it's true self and really LA did like that about Qualidea Code, both the character, relationship and world building helped immensely with the huge twist it was saving for, however Qualidea Code was utterly crippled by the erratic animation quality. LA has not seen an anime in a while in which it's janky erratic animation quality would be it's downfall, Qualidea Code isn't a horrible anime, just mismanaged animation quality control with a good decent plot to go with it. With all that in mind, Qualidea Code is at best a slightly above average anime with a good plot, a janky mess of animation at worse.",

            "content": "Preface:\r\nImagine three popular light novel writers who just so happen to be good friends, one evening, drinking to their hearts' content and then, drunk, doing some brainstorming for a story, wondering whether or not something like that really could and should be done and then, someone, for some dubious reason, wills a comparatively large franchise that nobody saw coming and also nobody really wanted, spanning across several light novels and an anime production, tointo existence. Yeah, now wouldn't that be hilarious?\r\nAnd while that may all sound like yet another cynical, third-rate MAL introduction rant, it's essentially how things actually played out. So follow the adventuresof Qualidea Code as it stumbles and stumbles and, once again, stumbles!\\n\\n\r\n[Also, this review contains spoilers yet no individual scores as those are p. dumb.]\\n\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\\n\r\nQualidea Code is a special child and wants to be seen as such and yet, despite that or most likely much rather because of it, one of the biggest issues with Qualidea Code is that it's built around a single twist or two, namely \"Our world is fake!\" and \"Our enemies are actually our allies!\" with little else to it and quite frankly, it doesn't even do a lot with said premises.\\n\\n\r\nWhat most certainly doesn't help matters is that the big reveal of QC's world being fake is a relatively predictable affair from episode 01 on. While it's admittedly not possible to figure the entire nature of their world out, with an enclosed area, enabling superpowers, attacked by enemies literally called \"Unknown\" and nobody quite ever mentioning the outside world, the thought of a fake world coming to mind is more or less a given very early on. And considering that finally, after nine entire episodes, that one gets confirmed, the content inbetween feels dragged out to no ends, not to mention everyone and their dog already managed to figure out that the students were alive all along, now fighting for the \"enemy\", the drama of characters dying lost all impact. So what's there in terms of raw plot certainly doesn't convince anyone.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe world building is equally lacklustre. World building is hardly a criterium I would usually bring up and one that gets way too often applied to anime that simply just do not concern themselves with those matters but it is an issue with Qualidea Code that certainly does need to be addressed: With a literally contained setting, secretly occupied by aliens, lead by students of three different schools, one would assume QC would flesh those aspects out and come up with interesting things to say and ideas to present but at the end of the day, the promising setting just ended up as a means serving completely different ends.\\n\\n\r\nThe ranking system, for instance, while ultimately arbitrary and counterproductive with students going after each other in life-threatening situations, could have been an interesting element to what QC has to offer. More points lead to a higher rank, giving out nicer living conditions to the hard-working, ambitious and talented. My main complaint with that is that we are told about these things but not even remotely shown. In fact, the entire premise loses what little meaning it had in the first place halfway throughout the show entirely. Theoretically speaking, the ranking system could have been used for engaging dynamics of competition between schools and students (think Harry Potter) but it wasn't and if there was any purpose to it to begin with, it only served as a drive for Suzaku to aspire to become #01. Yeah, that's it.\\n\\n\r\nThe alien angle is more or less nonexistent. How the Unknown got to coexist with humans, established their enclosed space, none of that is ever mentioned. Quite frankly, that would have been interesting. There admittedly are some laudable attempts with Asanagi and Airi to have a perspective from the other side but that one only amounted to \"We have feelings too, now that really makes you think!\" and that was all too little and too late. A compelling plot on how the Unknown just want to survive as well would have also made some sense and established some badly needed depth but considering how Asanagi and Airi just eliminated all of their comrades (see, only the Unknown that previously had some screentime actually matter!), that just wasn't a thing either. And don't even ask me about specifics about the Unknown themselves, cause, get it, they are _unkown_. That's all you need to know.\\n\\n\r\nThe arbitrariness doesn't stop there either. In total, there are three schools but they barely even matter apart from having different uniforms and separating the characters so character interactions end up as more or less set elements as well. Hime is with Hotaru as they both belong to Kanagawa and therefore, you won't, for instance, get to see a whole lot of interactions between Suzaku and Hotaru, something that is needlessly limiting. Not to mention that Chiba was more or less underrepresented as not only is it the only school without any side characters (Kanagawa got three, Tokyo one and apart from Aoi, those were just add-ons to the battles), we barely ever get to see Chiba. I'm not even sure whether or not it got attacked at all. Does it even matter?\\n\\n\r\nQuite frankly, the setting is paper-thin and considering how much emphasis is placed on that, that sure is a shame and all sorts of amateurish actually.\\n\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the show's meat stems from the characters and those range from poor to somewhat decent, being a bit of a stronger front than the thingamajig of a setting. Suzaku has become a somewhat okay protagonist by episode 03, a point at which it's very obvious that he's a decently likable tsundude, at least if you're willing to ignore that he's not around for about half the series and comes across a bit as someone who's the plaything of a writer having the incredibly clever thought of \"What if I create a character who is obsessed with being a hero... but fails at it?!\". Canaria works as a slapstick machine but little else and is solely defined by her relationship with Suzaku. The same can be said for Hotaru and Hime whose arc endlessly dragged on, essentially being about their special bond of, uh, being ~really~ special \u00fcberfriends and despite the heavy focus on their past, little did we actually learn about them that amounted more to flesh than flash. Asuha, too, is less of an individual character and more about having an attachment to another one, although, as far as onii-chan-obsessed imoutos come and go, she's one of the better ones, not that there's much of a high bar involved. Kasumi fares somewhat well comparatively as he even functions on his own, actually has opinions on things and temporarily serves as a quasi-protagonist actively trying to drive the plot forward and accomplishing just that.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, side characters happen to be way too passive to amount to anything really. Airi and Asanagi, apart from their subplot towards the end, essentially just serve as a purpose of exposition machines. What little can be said of Aoi is that she is less of an individual human being and more of a collection of assigned roles. She is \"the one who went past the barrier and survived\", \"the love interest of Kasumi\" (nothing ever happens with that might I add) and \"the character who switched sides\" (and the reason for that also applies to Hime). Also the character who just so happens to be around. Maybe they should have split up those roles between Kyousuke, Ginko and Zakuro to even out the screentime? They seemed like more interesting characters to me and would have left a bit of a bigger impression than essentially being cool character designs. They didn't even get a part in the non-epilogue. Now that's just sad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing worth mentioning is that there are also some themes that could have and should have been brought up but weren't. For instance, technically speaking, the good guys had been killing actual humans all along, so that could have resulted in an interesting moral dilemma, especially with straightforward characters such as Suzaku or Hime who just want to save their world but that aspect wasn't even brought up.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, it's obvious that Qualidea Code is a result of brainstorming without much thought put into it. There are ideas, interesting setpieces even but several of them just exist for the sake of it with little rhyme or reason and barely any of it ever gets fleshed out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAudiovisual Presentation:\\n\\n\r\nOver the recent years, for reason unbeknownst to me, there have been many pseudo-meaningful, overly generalizing statements on A-1 as a studio in particular, probably hailing from their involvement with popular titles such as SAO, Fairy Tail, KimiUso and simply plenty of anime in general. Most of them are blatant nonsense. I've heard things akin to \"the typical A-1 look\", something that doesn't even exist unless you're willing to tell me that, visually, Space Brothers, Shinsekai Yori, Grimgar and Silver Spoon have lots in common, so it's probably just the weak-minded drawing conclusions after having seen both Working and SAO. Truth to be told, whatever you'd like to attest to A-1 wouldn't hold up at all anyway as they are not bound to a fixed staff to begin with, leading to two generalizations that actually do hold water, namely that being something that allows them to tackle several projects at once and to get more often than what's usually the case into production problems.\\n\\n\r\nAnd production problems are present. A lot. In fact, Qualidea Code is so unbearably ugly, it might as well be the worst-looking show of the year, CG and flash fiascos notwithstanding. While episode 01 still managed to feature plenty of action that was decently animated, everything from the second episode on is just so much of a mess, it's hard to describe. Characters are off-model all the time, and frequently really badly too. It's not just the occassional hiccup. It's also way worse than other productions that got messed up with poor scheduling. It's just exceptionally bad. Animation itself is also largely absent, even when it clearly should have been there during battles, sometimes leading to results with inbetweens left out or entire animation cuts to begin with, either replaced by two stills of supposed character movement or a shot at the backgrounds while noises indicate action taking place closeby. The outcome tends to be hideous, jarring, anti-climactic and additionally hard to follow at times.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the visual side of things didn't even have anything to fall back on. Take Grimgar, for example, another one of A-1's production disasters. Grimgar had decent character designs, gorgeous backgrounds, its action was actually animated and the director was good enough to properly execute the show at all time. Qualidea Code has none of those qualities. At its best, Qualidea Code looks just okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST did have some nice, unorthodox tracks but little that I would go out of my way for to actually listen to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBottom Line::\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, it's not much of a surprise that Qualidea Code is bad, plain and simple. While there aren't numerous issues to count, the ones that exist are fundamental to the point of hurting the core of the entire concept and execution leaves much, very much in fact to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, I'd have to lie if I were to say that it didn't have its moments and with all that said and done, there were some entertaining episodes. Episode 01 is an action-packed adventure with fun and cool people being fun and cool. Despite being an aspect introduced at the end of the penultimate episode, a human cooperating with the Unknown out of love did end up as sort of touching. Some goodwill is on QC's side and the appeal of mixing up superpowered teenagers with a somewhat original setting is very much understandable and I certainly couldn't fault it for being generic. There isn't anything about Qualidea Code that makes me point at it, sigh and say \"Good grief, I hate this so much, it annoys me to no ends.\" and that's a rare thing these days. Canaria's pseudo-death had some impact (shame all that blood didn't really mesh well with the twist that the students were just abducted). The character interactions can be genuinely hilarious, especially between Suzaku and Kasumi - there is lots of goodness to be found in banter that leads to lines such as \"Didn't you know? It's the simple ones that are truly deep. Why don't you take up a bonsai or something?\". Canaria occasionally provided some hilarious comedic value as well. Johannes is easily the best character of the entire show and, even in the context of the entire season, stands out memorably for being such a huge contrast to everyone else involved and breaking all norms. \\n\r\nAt the end of the day, however, it's the light-hearted elements that shine the most - or at all - and sadly, the ratio is hardly in favor of aforementioned.\\n\\n\r\nConclusively, without its visual meltdown but a few tweaks here and there content-wise, Qualidea Code might have even been an okay experience. Not a memorable one, quickly forgotten about two weeks after its respective season but that would still be preferable to \"It's a thing that came to exist for some reason but really, it probably shouldn't have.\".",

            "content": "Qualidea Code is pretty standard, but not unbearably standard. While the character designs may look generic even if it wasn't produced by A-1 picture and the clothing imply a school setting for a sake of simplicity in not giving them unique clothing...\r\nThe anime isn't actually a school setting anime and instead focuses on six characters divide into three groups which run and defend their respective districts. \r\nThe plot: \r\nAfter an attack by a species known as \"unknowns\" humanity is able to organize itself and create a stronghold which is under constant attack by these \"unknowns\". This time however they've gained a power known as \"TheirWorld\" which allows them to combat these unknown. Thanks to these powers they actually make light work of their attackers. Or so they think. \\n\r\nSo those who have \"World\" are limited to teens, but per usual in anime it does a nice job of covering its track. \"World\" is a manifestation of the dreams of the individual when they were put in a cryptic sleep after the unknown invasion. It has a nice message of while adults don't have powers it was adults who paved the way for the future generations. In terms of details to the story it does a pretty good job. Like the crow which was killed at the end of episode 1 was revealed in episode 11. Or the true nature of Hotaru's ability which was never explicitly explained, but hinted at for the moment it would be needed. \\n\\n\r\nSomething I enjoyed about this series was that it was anime original(kind of anime original) and used that to its advantage. It plays to a mystery element and the more you learned about the setting the more you questioned it. Alongside that it drops hint here and there even in the opening which it actually has two of despite being a 12 episode anime. It also has three endings which are lovely to listen to, but are aesthetics. It's however fitting how each ending changes when the \"baton is passed\". Like mentioned the story places focus on three groups of characters which the focus switches around on either because one was killed, incapacitated, etc.\u00a0 However as far as the revelation angle it plays, don't expect much. \\n\r\nLike mentioned the anime is pretty standard, but I don't find much fault in it other that. Especially considering how it's a 12 episode anime. As a 12 episode anime the pacing is nice having a quick chain of events while also having an episode to slow itself down when it needs to. \\n\r\nEven the second episode which second half was a poor choice of idea with how they went with a form of swimsuit episode felt like important set up to the next chain of events. \\n\r\nWhile the anime does have after credits scenes they're not necessary to watch, but add a cliffhanger effect leaving you waiting for the next. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters there's not much to them in terms of personality, but their interactions amongst each other can be amusing. At the same time the anime seems to be self aware poking fun at Suzaku and his A-1 Pictures predecessors with bad social skills. (Seen in Episode 1) \\n\r\nOne thing I didn't like about Suzaku was his character development. For one; the direction of his character development can be seen a mile away. Egotistical guy grows to trust his comrades. K. \\n\r\nBut it's when he first goes into this \"emo\" phase which I found cringy partly due to how sudden it was, but aside from that scene his phase is handled nicely. \\n\\n\r\nGetting to Canaria she is the only person Suzaku cares, but still gets chided by him for what comes off as her fakeness with her peppyness.\\n\r\n In terms of Canaria's character her gimmick is having a gimmick. Alongside that her World is of interest painting a nice picture of the maiden who sings during battle literally setting a soundtrack. (I've never seen Guilty Crown btw.)\\n\\n\r\nWith that Suzaku and Canaria make an interesting pair with how you'd think the two wouldn't get along since Suzaku's an ego maniac, but you have to note he became that way because he hated his own weakness and want to protect Canaria. \\n\r\nI'm a sucker for characters of his type. I found it funny when he felt so superior he couldn't remember the name of a blue haired girl named Aoi before finding out she had a useful ability. Or his policy for answering phone calls. \\n\\n\r\nOverall in terms of comedy it does a nice job not trying to be in your face. The jokes are more quirky than funny which gives it charm.\u00a0\\n\r\nNext I'll bring up the sibling from the Chiba District. \\n\r\nKasumi is made to be the rival of Suzaku and is an opposite to him. Where else Suzaku is always serious, Kasumi doesn't care or so he appears. Again in contrast to Suzaku he doesn't look for recognition and acknowledges how he has his position due to his sister's influence. His sister claims that it is actually beneficial that the two butt heads due to Kasumi's way of interaction. Being Kasumi's sister Asuha knows how to get under his skin and teases him a lot. Naturally the two care about each other, but Asuha rather confused on a romantic level, but Kasumi on the other hand purely see her as a sister. And in that sense it may be fair to say that Asuha's affection is natural with her brother beng the only one she has at her side. \\n\\n\r\nFinally it comes to Kanagawa district. Similar to Canaria, Maihime has this gimmick character of the hyper leader who's overpowered. And Hotaru who has this disciplined gimmick, but who is doting of Maihime and admires her. These two really don't seem like they should go together, but as friends they are convincing. When the story focuses on them it plays well to the suspense that Hotaru isn't going to make it only for it change up the meaning of Hotaru arriving or not. \\n\r\nDespite their base Maihime in particular recieves good characterization. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound\\n\r\nIf someone told me they blew all their money on the artist they hired I'd believe them. At the same time. The OST wasn't anything godly. And for some reason they only gave Canaria one song. The animation can be be sloppy at times the most notable being when Maihime and Suzaku combine their attacks and it end up being a slideshow. The still images were sloppily drawn as well. If there's anytime animation shouldn't drop, it there. \\n\r\nBut episode 12, the last one was horrendous. And I'm not talking about badly drawn. I'm talking about how they made you look at a wall while the characters fought. The movement was so slow as well. \\n\r\nSlideshow the animation is what it was. As the final fight episode that it was it was a failure, but in terms of ending the series it was well done. \\n\\n\r\nSo as mentioned, it's second episode and poor animation give people an easy reason to drop it.\\n\r\nAs a time waster it was worth my time and something to look forward to each week. So I'll leave it with a 7/10.",

I certainly had hype for him, A-1 pictures maybe its not the best studio, but some of his works are excellent, atleast in animation, like SAO and shigatsu....but this had one of the worst I've ever seen, but this don't make this the worseanime i will explain why.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nI can not deny that the principle as so much cliche, but i can say that as some interesting plots, and a courageous author at first to your charachters, but only this don't make all, we can not ignore the many holes in the plot that this anime have, so I rate this anime as an interesting premise, but poorly executed, but at least tried to intrigue with some mysteries, so for me is something ok\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\r\nMan as I explained in the introduction, the animation of this show are the worse that i've attended this year, so much inconsistency in all, mainly in the character designs, which ridiculously deformed, out that the action scenes were cut to save frames ...why you do this A-1...usually you save good scenes for important scenes, but this show in animation are bad in  everything.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 7/10\\n\r\nWell atleast we have some good characters in the show they nevertheless have some development, the anime it seems has been divided into steps to introduce the characters, this i liked, because we have some episodes just to develop them, atleast the anime hit it, not to mention that we had a good diversity of personalities that help us to at least get sympathy for someone. So for me we have some good characters with an with an average ~ good development.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\r\nThe better thing in the entire anime, here there is nothing to complain,since they hired Claris, Garnid\u00e9lia and Lisa that are great singers, the only thing I could complain its the use of the osts not always hit the right time, and repair times, but nothing that stands out very.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI can say that I enjoyed the anime, he had some tense moments that I really thought interesting despite all the bad liveliest and holes in the script is something that is hard to explain, but at least I can say that passed my time, of course I will not even remember this anime a year from now probably, but i will not say that I regretted to see, was an anime slightly below the average that out throughout season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nQualidea code not bad as many speak, and not too good with some can defend, but I think your current note and just really a shame the anime was not an good animation/better adaptation, because in my eyes this anime had  a potential and he certainly was not well used, a waste ...\\n\\n\\n",

To be honest, I wasn't the biggest fan  of this show in the beginning; it was still a 7/10 for me because I was enjoying it, but it took a while to grow on me.  If your opinion was similiar to mine at the start, finish it before making a final judgment.  \r\nI don't remember what episode it was when theplot took a total 180 and became exciting; I think it was episode 7 or something.  The plot twist is what made this so much better.  A show that was good, but wasn't the best, became so much more.  So many aspects of the story that you knew completely change.  I want to say how the world itself changes, but it may ruin the story for some.  In the end, the characters fit their roles very nicely and I really liked most of them, the action is really good when it wants to be but it's good other times, the sound is really good, I really like both opening themes , and the show becomes really enjoyable.  If you're willing to give what seems to be an average show a chance, you'll likely realize that it becomes a little more than that.  I cannot make you watch it though, so it's your choice. After how much the show improved mid-way through, a 9/10 seems very fair to me anyway.",

            "content": "Qualidea Code has given me a new perspective on cliche anime once.However,due to poor presentation in Qualidea Code,I don't have much enjoyment in this anime,therefore I tried to understand the plot and put my standard and expectation lower,lower and lower...\r\nWhen things come to an end,since my expectation is low enough,I don't have any feelings after watching Qualidea Code.It feels like Qualidea Code doesn't even exist...\r\nStory(3/10)(35%)\r\nFor the story part,since this anime makes a relatively big change in the middle,so I decided to separate into parts.\r\n[First Impression]\r\nThe ideas in Qualidea code aren't refreshing and new.The story is based on a bunch of human characters fighting against aliencreatures \"unknowns\".Most popular anime or movie series,like world trigger or other sci-fi animes or movies have already used such settings so why we are still seeing them in this anime?I won't say cliche is a bad thing but have they at least try to make something new?About the plot,The story is based on human characters doing different missions,that's it,it's just too simple that I cannot further elaborate.\\n\\n\r\n[Episodes]\\n\r\n[Part1:Beginning]\\n\\n\r\nYou wouldn't believe that Qualidea Code will serve us unnecessary fanservice and boring arguments in the very beginning of this anime.In the first 2.5 episodes,most of the time,there're just meaningless arguments among characters and a swimming suit episode,while the introduction for the story and characters are just a little.I wouldn't say it's bad for fanservice and arguments but the amount of arguments are just too much for the beginning of the episodes and the fanservice should put in a proper place,rather than put it at the start.\\n\\n\r\n[Part2:episodes in the middle]\\n\\n\r\nIn general,not very good.The plot seems to go nowhere while rushing at the same time,they tries to move on the story without any explainations on its cliffhangers and its hard to catch up the storyline.You may feel confused when watching but at least you'll feel glad that the plot is finally started to move.\\n\\n\r\n[Part3:Episodes at the end]\\n\\n\r\nIn the later episodes,it starts to become more interesting.The mysteries are started to solving,all the potholes are started to be filled.Youll have a totally different perspective on this anime and felt excited.At this moment,you'll finally find the true identity in Qualidea Code.\\n\\n\r\nHowever,the plot is still rather confusing to me,since they explained the terms of \"code\",\"cold factory\" , \"the world setting\" etc. in a relatively rough and fast way.Even though there're many complex concepts they had to talk into the story,they should use longer length of episodes to explain them but not in a rush,ensure that there's only one idea is in one episode and well-connected ideas between episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end,when things never being explained well,your confused feeling are still there.Even though how the ending is,it feels like the ending is rushed,bizarre and empty,rather than disappointment.\\n\\n\r\n[Individual Aspects in the this anime]\\n\\n\r\n[Part1:Action]\\n\\n\r\nSo did they have exciting plot in Qualidea Code?No,definitely no.The actions are definitely the weakest part of the whole anime because either the characters are too strong or too weak and its not thrilling at all.With poor animation in this anime,it just makes the actions unbearable to watch.\\n\\n\r\n[Part2:mystery]\\n\\n\r\nMystery in this anime is the beacon of hope in this anime.The setting and the plot are confusing but mysterious at the same time.The potential of this anime is to make you feel curious about this plot.What'll happen next?What is it all about???By thinking these questions,you'll find the plot is interesting somehow. \\n\\n\r\nThough the explanations are not done well,mystery perhaps may let you get through a few episodes somehow...\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up,Qualidea code is a cliche show that seems to have potential in it.Unfortunately,due to poor presentation,the story structure is broken badly and doesn't worth much to expect in general.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation art(2/10)(10%)\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is probably the weakest point in this anime,which causes most action anime fans felt disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nApart from poor animated actions,there're also several animation problems in Qualidea Code that I think they should pay more efforts on them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters drawing in Qualidea Code are poor in general.The drawing of the characters are cheap and abnormal.If the camera is far away from the characters,You'll see they just outline the characters shape and fill them with inks but without paying any efforts on specific drawings.\\n\\n\r\nFor the visuals,the colours in this anime are generally nothing special and simple.Nothing bright and rich,it just barely meet the basic 2D anime standard.\\n\\n\r\nFor the camera angles,it may also affects your viewing experience too.Weird camera transitions are all around the place,it's really confusing to get to know whats going on in the show.Ive to rewatch the show again and again to clearly understand what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nSound(3/10)(10%)\\n\\n\r\nSound is another weak spot in Qualidea code,not because of the op and ed,but because of inadequate soundtracks and sound effects.As we all know,soundtracks and sound affects could able to add exciting atmosphere towards the whole show.In Qualidea Code,the main sound source is voice acting.Thats right,the whole show is just a bunch of texts ,meanwhile,soundtracks and sound effects seem to be ripped off during the whole show causing the whole show lack of excitements.\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming aspects are the op and ed,they're the only sound elements with rocking theme and fits into the theme.Im generally felt disappointed about the sound in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(4/10)(25%)\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the obvious and good ones.The show is good at making characters conflicts.Take Ichiya as an example.Ichiya is annoying as hell in the beginning,he like calling his fighting partners useless and he says he like working alone but he will bring his sister Canaria together with him.On the other hand,he has passion on fighting because of his terrible childhood,which is good that the protagonist has some positive attitude towards battles.However,he is over-confidence himself,which result some bad consequence towards the whole Tokyo team.Im generally find these conflicts due to different characters personalities are interesting to watch and makes the plot more richer,which I think it's the highlight of the show in the aspect of character development.\\n\\n\r\nThey also manage the back stories of the characters well.For example,Ichiya and Hima,they both have back stories describling themselves and able to explain the personalities of the characters in the story successfully.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately,they have some flaws in the characters development,which may not appeal to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all,The character designs are too cheap,especially for the unknowns.Similar to the cliche plot,they literally called the aliens as \u201cUnknowns\u201d,again I can't explain the creativity of that,it's just too cliche.For the personalities of the characters:Female characters are mostly caring and heart-warming;Male characters are either overpowerful and over confidence or being a guy who obsessed his own sister,they literally copypasted every personalities of characters from other animes too and the strengths and weaknesses are not well-round.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover,it seems that the pace of the story ruins character development.Most of the main characters are underdevloped and lacking of depths due to rushed plot,which causes some of the MC are being abandoned and affects the arrangement of characters.Most of the MC,for example,Hima and Ichiya will not be noteworthy in some of the episodes but suddenly they will show off again.It feels awkward and weird at the same time and characters in this anime are unable to show off in a proper way.\\n\\n\r\nSo again,similar to the case of the storyline,the character development has both highlights and several flaws at the same time,which could have some of the audience attention,while some people may think it's awkward at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(4/10)(20%)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Qualidea Code will let you deep into confusion,which you will consider whether drop the anime or not.Though at the end,you may feel that the plot seems to be kind of worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately,due to poorly presented plot,this anime doesn't meet your standard any longer,but instead we will have to lower our expectations in order to adapt the rushed ending.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end,Qualidea Code is like a stone near the road that doesn't really noticeable in your anime life.It just feel empty and meaningless...\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude,Qualidea Code is a kind of show that is empty and meaningless.Though it seems to have potential in the middle of the episodes,it doesn't get my attention much or worth any re-watch value. \\n\\n\r\nOverall(3.35/10)(F)(Dreadful)\\n",

It was cliche and many things were left in the dark but it wasn't too bad. Only the way it was executed. Plot holes and details that weren't thoroughly explained or not explained at all but it was an amusing anime.\r\nArt: It was just right for its year, not that I know much, but after watching older anime I saw that the art is well... Except for a few weird... Times. Oh god.\r\nSound: Well the music saved the anime if I may be bold. It was catchy andsomehow gets you hyped and is executed at the right time. Though I don't think it really fit exactly (personal opinion, of course!)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Oh yes! Yes! This part is the second best since the characters showed development (explosively and slowly). I really liked Asuha and her love for her brother (LOL). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well it wasn't so bad but it wasn't really memorable though but still you can watch it for fun or if you've got nothing to watch at the moment. I definitely enjoyed because of the characters and music though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Not the best but not the worst.

The art is a little lacking, it looks older and not as clean as newer anime. The sound when they sing isn't bad, so ill rate that a little higher.

            "content": "First of all i haven't read any of the light novels that the series was based on and as such the first time that i seen the characters and the setting was in the anime itself. \r\nThe main story revolves around children with special abilities that protect the world that was devastated by alien attacks from them. The setting is a near future version of Japan. As settings and stories go this is pretty genetic. \r\nSo then lets get started \r\nIchiya who I call Icchan is one of the main characters of the series. \r\nIcchan's personality at first is of arrogance and stubbornness which is\\n\r\nborne out of his desire to protect the world and Cana. He tends to think highly of himself and does it way too much and at the same time looking down on others. \\n\\n\r\nThis aspect of him I actually hate. However, despite this Icchan is a surprisingly adapt tactician able to come up with useful tactics on the fly something that I did not expect from him. \\n\\n\r\nHis personality changes somewhat after an event in the story becoming \\n\r\na little more considerate of others and more trusting while also learning to \\n\r\nwork alongside with others. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I liked about Icchan was his interaction with Cana which I found to be pretty cute. His personality and demeanor changes a lot when he's with her. \\n\\n\r\nCanaria who I call Cana is one of the main characters of the series. \\n\r\nCana serves as the second in command to Tokyo city and is the Icchan's second in command. Cana is a kind person by nature that always aim to be positive even in the face of despair. When Icchan's personality causes disagreements Cana is usually the one that smooths it out. Cana's special power is rather interesting in that it\u2019s not a combat power but rather a support power that enhances the power of all who hear her song that I call Canaria's song. Cana is an endearing character that I find to be one of my favorites as she can still be positive in any condition. \\n\\n\r\nHer seiyuu Yui Ishikawa really did a great job portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nAsuha is main of the main characters of the series and is Kasumi's younger\\n\r\nsister. Whether or not they are blood related is open to conjecture. Asuha \\n\r\nis overbearing and can get jealous easily but she cares a lot for her brother. \\n\r\nDespite this personality she is an able tactician and able to use tactics to some degree.\\n\\n\r\nHer special ability is ice related and fights with a pair of handguns. \\n\\n\r\nHer character I found lacks a good personality despite her seiyuu's best attempt at giving her one. \\n\\n\r\nKasumi is the older brother of Asuha. Personality wise Kasumi is diligent, calm and cool headed but quiet. Not being a good speaker he can only reply to others with mean words which often gets on other people especially Icchan's nerves. Despite this he serves as a good counter to Icchan whose personality makes it difficult for the others to \\n\r\nget close to him. Kasumi's power seems to be able to materialize a large caliber sniper rifle that uses special rounds. Kasumi has a rather interesting relationship with his sister. \\n\\n\r\nMaihime played by Veteran seiyuu Aoi Yuki and one of my favourite seiyuu's is one of the main characters of the series. Maihime who I call Tenkawa is the head of Kanagawa city and is one of the most powerful characters on the show. Personality wise Tenkawa is caring, loyal and considerate to others and out of all characters she is perhaps the one that embodies the ability users the most which that of a defender. Tenkawa's seiyuu Aoi Yuki really did a fantastic job portraying her and she is easily one of my fav characters on the series. \\n\\n\r\nHotaru is Tenkawa's best friend and is the second in command in Kanagawa. \\n\r\nA powerful swords woman Hotaru is extremely lethal in close combat being able to  destroy any enemy as long as she can see and reach them. She dotes on Tenkawa as lot and cares about her a lot. Interestingly their first encounter was anything but friendly. \\n\\n\r\nAoi played by veteran seiyuu and my third fav seiyuu Sora Amamiya is a support character that is part of Kanagawa city. By default, her personality is that of a meek, timid girl that gets nervous quite easily and excels at support duties. However later on this changes when finally gets conviction and purpose however misguided it was. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point her combat ability though weak in the beginning is revealed to be pretty strong. \\n\\n\r\nAoi I felt was a great character and Sora certainly did a great job portraying her but I felt that her character could have used a lot more development into her. \\n\\n\r\nAsanagi and Airi were originally the officers that commanded the defense of the human realm and as part of this coordinated the actions of the main characters as they fought against the unknown. However, this changed after a point in the story and they become the enemy. \\n\\n\r\nOf the pair Asanagi was the believer in his actions and true allegiances and while he did care about the children ultimately this was for his own benefit. Asanagi was a wise commander that knew when to be angry and when to crack the whip and despite everything he was still an honorable person. \\n\\n\r\nAiri is the other commanding officer that acts as the second in command to Asanagi. \\n\\n\r\nKind, endearing and caring Airi cares about the lives of the children in a way \\n\r\nthat a mother does. She's always the first to object to plans that will harm them in a way. Despite the rather surprising revelation Airi was still one of my fav characters in the series. Mamiko Noto who is one of my fav seiyuu\u2019s really did a great job portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nArt style for the series I found to be good in most parts but some of the environments shown looked rather sub par and boring. Animation for the most part was ok but was of inconsistent quality throughout the series. Character design though was pretty good and I loved the design of Cana, Airi and Aoi. The school uniforms for the cast also looked pretty stylish. \\n\\n\r\nMusic for the series I found to be pretty good especially the two opening themes which was sung by one of my fav singers LISA and third ending theme that was sung by clariS and Garnidelia.\\n\\n\r\nStrong voice acting especially by Mamiko Noto, Sora Amamiya and Yui Ishikawa \\n\\n\r\nOverall I liked Qualidea code in that it had a great story, interesting setting and great voice acting from a talented cast of seiyuu's but this was let down by lack of character dev for some of the main cast and inconsistent art and animation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Post-apocalyptic worlds seem to be all the rage these days. In this take here, we find three schools apparently holding back a seemingly endless wave of alien invaders, who had previously already decimated the Tokyo bay area the past. These schools are all filled with unique specialists. Tokyo is filled with flying magicians that use staffs like witch brooms. Kanagawa are melee specialists and apparently utilize a giant aircraft carrier somehow. Finally, Chiba are ranged specialists, using everything from small arms to gigantic WW2-Germany inspired train-mounted mega turrets. With the combined efforts of these three combative schools be enough to hold back the alien invaders?Moreover, why does everyone have a chip stamped on the back of his or her neck?\\n\\n\r\nThis was one of my stretch watches this season, and indeed, it is a rough patch in many ways. The plot is jumpy, the characters are not relatable, and though there is a bit of excitement later on, the conclusion leaves quite a bit to be desired. Honestly, when the antagonists are referred to as \"Unknowns\", there's an upper limit to one's expectations. If you're looking for a worthy post-apocalyptic experience, there are other superior recent works in the genre like God Eater. If you're looking for a group coming together to overcome odds, there are much more natural progressions like Grimgar. If you're just looking for a lot of action, then this might be a fair show if you're out of other options.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation quality is average for a current show, which means it's not bad. The show has a diverse amount of backgrounds all of which are pretty well drawn. Surprisingly, this \"futuristic\" world is relatively ordinary; there are some futuristic buildings alongside the ruins of present-day Tokyo (like the Metropolitan Government building) but for the most part, there's surprisingly little that is new. In addition, something about the atmosphere feels off; you don't get the vibe that this is humanity's last stand. Annoyingly, a lot of content is drawn in 3D CGI including the water (the battles almost always start over water), the enemy mobs that look like flying pink manta rays, and a good majority of the effects. The characters are average in design overall with a good variety of your typical archetypes. Expressions are average at best overall though there are a few worthy imouto moments from Asuha.\\n\\n\r\nExpect a great deal of action in this show, I'd say there are at least ten thousand mob opponents defeated through the course of the show. Most of the battles aren't particularly engaging though as our main protagonists easily overpower the mobs, and many scenes take place zoomed out with the protagonist as a shiny dot carving a path of destruction in their wake. Some of the opponents also just cheaply disappear in a blinding flash when defeated. One good thing about the schools' varying specialties is a variance in action, there's a good mix of melee and ranged combat. Choreography is average overall though certain scenes late in the show are a bit better. Along with the action there's a bit of blood but nothing particularly gory. I will call out Hotaru's \"Void Strike\" animation sequence as being way too similar to Kira Yamato's Gundam Seed Strike Freedom Burst mode animation. There is a light amount of ecchi with shower/dressing room scenes, but this is not a particular focus of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nQualidea code has a surprising number of different OP and EDs. Both OPs are pretty fast-paced and rock-based, the second of which is superior in my opinion. Claris and Garnidelia sing the EDs; the two groups have a very different style, creating a rather disjoint feeling. The first ED by Claris is rather light in pacing and tonality, whereas the second ED by Garnidelia is much more definitive and aggressive in pacing and melody. The last ED is a collaboration by both bands, and in my opinion is the best song of the bunch with an especially catchy opening melody. Most surprisingly, the show has a pretty catchy BGM as well with a lot of drums and electric instrumentation during battles. There are some nice vocals mixed in as well, including Canaria's battle meditation song.\\n\\n\r\nOf the main heroines, Aoi Yuuki is really the only one I'd consider a veteran; and fittingly her character has the most charisma of the group. You do get many strong supporting characters though with Sayaka Oohara, Mamiko Noto, Sora Amamiya, and Mai Nakahara all in the mix. Mai Nakahara gets the best supporting role award for her lively and surprisingly youthful support late in the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThis is where this show starts to unravel a bit into sub-standard space. So supposedly there's an alien invasion and the best thing the adults can do is cryo-freeze their kids and then retreat. Apparently, the \"dreams\" the kids experience during cryo-freeze somehow ends up giving them X-Men-like superpowers when they are eventually awoken. Thus, humanity, which somehow fends off the aliens to get back to the kids (never explained) now rely on the kids to hold the aliens at bay (literally, like they always appear from the ocean). The kids are divided into three schools as mentioned in the introduction and are for some reason ranked. This creates a great deal of animosity within the greater organization despite the supposedly apocalyptic situation outside of their ridiculous infighting.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a single central plot that roughly divides the show into three arcs, relatively synchronized with the three EDs. Each of the arcs has its own rising action and climax. The show does a good job keeping the viewer on their toes with plenty of huge plot twists and a good portion of the episodes ending on cliffhangers. However, you can't help but feel that a lot of the plot twists feel planted; the progression in general doesn't feel very smooth.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the whole mess once you dig into this show's actual plot code (i.e. reach the conclusion) - you find quite a few bugs and a few infinite loops. Though I now get why the show is some sort of \"code\", it really opens a huge amount of plot holes and unanswered questions that completely ruin the entire show up to that point. Let's just say you'll probably by doing yourself a favor by not thinking about the implications of the conclusion on the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe show doesn't start in a particularly convincing manner. It first introduces Ichiya as the protagonist. Though not your typical harem \"nice guy\", he is even worse as one of the most two-dimensional characters I've seen as a lead protagonist. His constant banter about heroes and being \"enough\" to save everyone is enough to make you sick. Though nicely drawn, Canaria isn't much better as your supportive yet clumsy sidekick and incestuous object of desire. Oh, it gets even better, and by better, I mean worse. From Kanazawa, you have Maihime, an inspirational girl who takes on too much responsibility herself and her katana-armed, ultra-short-miniskirt-clad assistant Hotaru, who for good measure has an unhealthy dedication to Maihime. And of course, from Chiba we have the Chigusa siblings who, by far, have the most interesting conversations of the bunch but yet also have oreimo vibes between them. Though Maihime is fun to watch and the Chigusa siblings have a fair amount of characterization, the rest of the them all are pretty much cookie-cutter junk.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the show tries to convince you that the characters are dynamic by a shift in behavior as the focus of the first arc. I'm sorry, but no way could they have survived this long with their behavior shown in the first episode. With a huge and relatively underwhelming main cast and an even larger and barely-introduced supporting cast, I can't justify giving this high marks.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nSomeone may be calling you from this show, but I think that this is one code you're best off avoiding. Though there are some decent action scenes and a fair level of intensity, the atmosphere just isn't right and the characters don't mesh (both with each other and with the viewer). I did like some of the sound production, but that alone can't justify watching a show, perhaps you should just pick up the OST instead.",

            "content": "Qualidea Code is about a post-apocalyptic Japan that was attacked by creatures called Unknown. The majority of adults were killed off, but, in order to protect future generations, the government forced the world's children into deep sleep. When the children (now teenagers) awoke many years later, they had strange powers called \"World\" and most of civilization was gone. Using their powers, the children fight against the Unknown and help administrate the new military system that was created by the remaining adults. \r\nThis concept sounds entertaining by itself, but it is also one of the problems with this show. There are so many anime where creaturesattack, a large portion of the population or world are destroyed, and then the youth need to save the world. It isn't a bad concept, but it's getting old. I want to point out that this anime does have a certain twist to it, which makes things interesting, but the many flaws of the anime eclipse the show's positive elements. The thing that hurt this show so much was the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI need to point out that most- if not all- of the characters had some kind of trope or stereotype with their personality (i.e. Canaria being a klutz). While tropes in themselves aren\u2019t a bad thing, the problem is that these tropes took over the characters\u2019 personalities made them seem very one-dimensional. While some of the characters are great (like Maihime in my opinion), there was one character that more or less ruined the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that would be Suzaku Ichiya, the protagonist. In anime, there are a lot of main characters that start out as an insensitive tool and then slowly develop compassion or other positive character traits. But Suzaku Ichiya was on a whole other level. To put it simply, he was deplorable. He was arrogant, rude, and reckless. Even after he went through some character development and realized he was being too pretentious, he still isn't very likable. At one point, he kind of drifts out of the spotlight and I honestly completely forgot about him for a while. That's how forgettable he is as a character.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the twist in the story was very interesting, but it was overshadowed by all the series' writing issues. In the first half of the series, the battle scenes were dragged out. Other times the characters had long, pointless conversations that didn't contribute much to the story. Instead of such long battles or unnecessary scenes, I would have focused more on the plot. There were parts that included some background information and character development. However, the emotional scenes sometimes felt over-exaggerated, melodramatic, or prolonged. And even with the backstories, there was lot of information missing from the anime. For example, the backstories of Yuunami Airi and Asanagi Gutoku, two adult military officers, were basically nonexistent.\\n\r\nAbout half way through the series, the story started to pick up pace and get exciting. However, toward the end things seemed rushed. The interesting twist was never really explained. What would have been a really interesting part of the story wasn't revealed in enough detail. How did the world get into the state it was in? How did the enemy infiltrate and evolve? None of this was really explored. Because of the abruptness and the plot holes, when the series ended, I didn't feel satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps if there is a second season, it will all be explained. There are manga and light novel adaptions of the series, and, if I am not mistaken, I think this series is a sequel to Qualidea of Scum and Gold, a light novel. Perhaps these mediums are more detailed and fill in the missing information. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on, the animation gets considerably worse and it wasn't the best to begin with. I felt like the audio was off at times too. It's a shame. The creators probably didn't have enough time or money to make the overall quality better. Maybe if they had postponed the release date, they could have improved the animation and sound. They could have also worked on the story, shortening unneeded parts and expanding the plot.  \\n\\n\r\nWith some changes and improvements, this show could have been really great. However, its flaws overshadow all of the anime's good aspects. Overall, I would give this show a 6 out of 10. I am hoping the anime can redeem itself with another season or with the series' other mediums.",

            "content": "Children who have been evacuated to a cold sleep facility during the invasion by the \"unknown\" several decades ago wake up from their slumber and learn that their bodies developed some supernatural forces. In order to protect the country from the \"unknown\" emerging from the Tokyo bay gate, the boys and girls wage battles in the defense the cities of Tokyo, Kanagawa, and Chiba.\r\nWell introduction to the story sounds pretty standard. Children with super powers fighting monsters while adults are cheering them up from the safe spots. But as we learned in anime that is not a bad thing. Stories based on that cliche canbe amazing and entertaining.\\n\r\nAnd at the beginning QC does not look bad. It has world with not that many plot holes. \\n\r\nWe meet world with three cities or rather three schools that defend their world. HOWEVER these schools does not matter. Only difference between them is how their uniforms look like. And fact that in one school students fly on brooms, second has swordsman type fighters and last one is for marksmen. But that doesn't matter, students are just background for the few main characters and it is very poor background.\\n\r\nWe meet the world with ranking system which was never fully explained. Of course we instantly know that it is based on combat strength of students. It was opportunity to show some struggle going up, rivalry between students. But nope, instead we get... well nothing. One guy who is proud of being #4 and that's all. One guy who is below top 200 and he doesn't care. Awesome use it, show how strong he is despite his low rank. Nope nothing. We met probably two strongest students but that does not matter at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is not complicated and after at most 3 eps you will be expecting the twist. Don't get me wrong. Story is written quite nicely, it is interesting and what is most important - I enjoyed it despite being so straight. I wasn't overjoyed with it but it was decent.\\n\r\nPowers called 'worlds' seemed to be important to the plot. I admit idea of gaining one as the result of dreams is not bad. Child dream about world, gain power based on that world (probably, they never explain it properly) and get supernatural ability called 'world'. And that's all. They are not interesting. Girl unleashing power with her sword made one or two big 'booms', boy controlling gravity never used it in interesting way. Sniper and her sister who is gunner showed few interesting actions but to be fair we never grasped how this marksman's ability worked at all.\\n\\n\r\nBut characters. They were very POORLY designed. I just finished this anime and I can't remember single character's name. But let's give main cast at least some thought and why they were... not the worst but not good either.\\n\r\nChigusa siblings - awkward brother and sister with bond that you will feel while watching them interact. But also I felt very awkward watching them. And I loved Ore no Imouto so I believe I can even accept anime when you put line 'incest ftw'. Their social awkwardness and weird interaction between them was both interesting and creepy. I guess Kasumi was meant to be the smart guy in this anime as well as caring guy who shows it being asshole but it didn't go well. He was just... creepy.\\n\r\nIchiya Suzaku aka #4. At start he is guy who is full of himself and believes that he can handle everything alone. Of course we discover he acts that way so he can protect the girl he loves (what a shocker!). And he starts to change into a little bit more cooperative guy (and more tsundere guy yack!) after accident. Then we see him go berserk after he loses the reason to live, which is understandable but it is again not showed properly so we can't feel bad for him. Instead he was at the beginning annoying asshole, then annoying wimp. Of course he was written to be opposite to Kasumi but that didn't work well.\\n\r\nHis supposed reason for living and fighting wasn't written better at all. Canaria Utara has little to no personality and quirk of being a slouch (is this proper word? the moments when I feel my english sux ;) ).\\n\r\nMaihime Tanekawa was the #1 student who also believed in protecting everybody. Great she didn't left any impression on me!\\n\r\nAnd last but not least Hotaru who was Maihime's friend and something like her guardian angel. They tried to show how strong their bond was but I just couldn't feel it. It was obvious what author intended to write but he did poor job.\\n\\n\r\nBut side characters do not add poor impression. Why? There is almost no supporting cast. Few guys even more forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound seems fine. Wasn't great, but ok. Few nice songs, decent graphics, fights wasn't impressive but didn't look terrible too.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line it is not bad anime it won't make you bleed from eyes or ears but if you don't have much time I suggest to skip that one. You wont miss anything at all. I bet in two weeks I will forget about it.",

            "content": "Qualidea code is an alright cash gra-I mean show. Let's go int more detail. This show has all the elements of a cash grab. \r\n1)They put no effort into the animation. \r\n-To explain what I mean, it seems like they tried to have as little movement as possible(two characters use gun, three of them barely move when they fight, and the 6th character just stands and moves their mouth).\r\n-The characters also look more like the drawings of a manga cover instead of actually being animated fully.\r\n-characters also look really weird sometimes like in episode 11 when a character looked terrible for a few seconds inthe beginning.\\n\r\n-They also fill the screen with special effects which don't look bad, it just shows hat they don't care that much to a point\\n\\n\r\n2) The soundtrack is phenomenal\\n\r\n-I noticed that in all those bad harem shows that keep coming out, they had multiple endings in the span of 12 episodes, but there are also original shows or single season shows that have multiple endings(The unlimited Hyobu Kyosuke/Akuma no Riddle) too, but those shows also had a lot of effort put into animation as well.\\n\r\n-This show has a great soundtrack which can be seen as trying to sell more CDs to substitute the lack of DVD sales.\\n\r\n-as for great songs shout out to the second opening Axxxis, which was a really good song, but was accompanied by a confusingly put together opening sequence(seriously the fist parts of it made some sense, but the part that showed characters fighting each other never happened).\\n\\n\r\n3)They hired three writers\\n\r\n-this isn't really much of a reason why this show could cash grab, but it can say that they ay have been trying to substitute animation with a good story line and music.\\n\\n\r\nI think of made my argument about the cash grab well enough, so let's move on to the other parts.\\n\\n\r\nStory-I can't go to into the story, because that's one of the few things this show has going for it, but I think the story is fine, it had good parts near the very end that make it stick out, but I will say it felt like(while the ending was nice) they were trying to hint that they wanted some kind of sequel(no cliffhangers thought[thank goodness]).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- I think they did well with half of the characters, Maihime, Ichiya and Kasumi were good characters, but Auha, Canaria and Hotaru don't have any character outside their respective partners, you could also argue something similar for Kasumi and Ichiya as well, but they at least seemed to have more character.\\n\r\nIchiya- A delusional hero who thinks he's better than anyone else,.I don't hate this character trait, because a jerk will usually change in good way(unlike rat from NO.6 who was not only needlessly mean, but didn't really develop correctly I felt). Ichiya being rude comes from his overconfidence in his abilities, which isn't bad and I never felt he was too rude.\\n\r\nKasumi- Kasumi is best described as deadpan most of the time or he just doesn't show any expression, and he is also a relatively smart guy. He seemed to do a lot more of the leading at his school despite being second in command, he makes many tactical decisions and and even gets more involved in the plot than his sister.\\n\r\nMaihime-she is an over-the-top leader, she's loud, and she is able to inspire others. She also has a bit more effort put into her back story than the others. She is also an awesome character who is the most powerful main character in the show. She had one of the coolest moments in the series as well.\\n\r\nAsuha-She's deadpan like her brother, and she's also in love with her brother(cringe). I'm really glad those two didn't get together in the end.\\n\r\nCanaria-She's happy and she's in love with Ichiya(It's cute, but she doesn't have any other character[she is kind of dumb though]). I'm not sure where those two stand on their relationship.\\n\r\nHotaru- She's very serious and Maihime's best friend/possibly something more. I think it would be cute if those two got together, but it doesn't need to happen for me.\\n\r\nAiri-She's basically the mother character and I actually enjoyed the romantic moments between her and Asanagi.\\n\r\nAsanagi-I liked his character too. He seem more like the Father character I think, not the perfect father though.\\n\r\nAoi-I don't know what is, but something about this character rubs me the wrong way. I like her design though, despite how having a blue haired character named Aoi is kind of generic.\\n\\n\r\nI think the character interactions were also good, except for the two siblings. \\n\r\nOverall this show is fine. I'd aso point out that really only seemed to be around for her butt, as shown by the first op and last ed. I give this show a recommendation to try or skip, it really doesn't matter. It's only 12 episodes, so that's just 4 hours of your time at least.",

            "content": "This is my first (short) review so I apologize in advance if there is a mistake or something that bothers anyone. This review contain a micro spoiler.\r\nWhen I first heard that the writer of Oregairu and Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko promises to make an anime together, I thought that it will be great. Two different novel writer work together to make an anime sounds very promising, right? But I was wrong. Totally. Here's the reason why this anime looks feels like a crap.\r\nFirst, it's not even a battle anime. It's a slice of life anime. Wait, you have weapons, enemies, and even rivals. So,why did it turns out that we have slice of life scenes instead of battles? I think I will never understand why.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, its story, its interaction, and even its character itself are boring. We have an annoying MC, his overly-kind sister, a cool-siscon rival and his cool sister, a princess captain and her overly-possessive \"servant\". Our MC even have an annoying catchphrase, which is perfect (sarcasm). I can't even describe them in more than one sentence. So what is our protagonist's motive again?\\n\\n\r\nThird, yes, they have battle scene, but it was short and mainstream. MC blows all the monster. His rival snipe everything. His sister singing. His sister's rival is also shooting. Their captain bludgeoning \"unknowns\". All of them aren't exactly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that manages to catch my attention is its OP and ED. Their art isn't look bad but also fails to make the protagonists unique.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime disappoint me in many ways. I don't recommend to watch this, as there are more entertaining anime outside.\\n\\n\r\nSummary :\\n\r\nStory : 1\\n\r\nArt : 7\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\r\nCharacter : 1\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 1\\n\r\nOverall : 1\\n\\n\r\nI wish they would think of slice of life instead of battle.",

            "content": "High School Students defending the world from aliens!\r\nQualidea Code's premise is your typical high school students defending and saving the world with a slight twist to it. Unfortunately the twist in itself doesn't make the anime any better as LA has some very mixed feelings for Qualidea Code.\r\nWell let's start with the characters...\r\nKasumi Chigusa voiced by Yuuma Uchida and Asuha Chigusa voiced by Chika Anzai have the entire annoying sibling relationship together for the most part, with Kasumi being the lone and lazy sniper with Asuha being the bombastic and \"controlling\" of the two and are decent characters overall. Hotaru Rindou voiced by Ayaka Fukuharaand Maihime Tenkawa voiced by Aoi Yuuki are also decent characters, with Hotaru's \"infatuation\" to Maihime and Maihime's overall genki and overall massive source of power making Maihime LA's favourite character, Asuha being a close second. Now for the main characters that kinda irked LA, that being Ichiya Suzaku voiced by Soma Saito and Canaria Utara voiced by Yui Ishikawa, Canaria for LA has the least problems out of the two, that being Canaria is a bit too much of a \"perfect\" girl, albeit not in power, but the \"perfect girl for Ichiya\" but that problem was only LA's opinion. As for Ichiya, well he's the hot-headed leader of the disjointed main 6 of the army to take down the aliens and really from his depression through the anime to his hot-headedness rather irked LA, but come the \"BIG PLOT REVEAL\", these 6 character overall got better (if they were worse anyways). There are some minor characters like Aoi Yaegaki voiced by Sora Amamiya and Mahiru Ookumi voiced by Sayaka Ohara, but overall the main focus goes to the character relationship building as well as world building, the minor characters are really just support.\\n\\n\r\nNow concerning the plot, LA did say this anime has a twist and really this twist really does change EVERYTHING about the anime and really the plot twist did help with the character development and character redemption for many of the characters in this anime (and although they do \"\"\"die\"\"\", even then they develop them further...don't get it?, well watch the anime to the big reveal then you'll get it). Really the first half of the anime is world and character building with some subtle hints to the true nature of this anime and depending on whether your more focused on the characters or the world or both, the hints adds up and makes the plot twist either predictable or unpredictable depending, as for LA, LA thought the plot twist was a welcome addition and changed up what the entire premise says.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as LA likes the plot to Qualidea Code, where Qualidea Code falters is in it's animation which leads us to...\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by A1-Pictures, if anything Qualidea Code's animation quality was probably the MOST erratic of all the animes of Summer 2016, as it had some very good quality animation during the first half, but then the latter half TRIES to redeem it by still making some very good background visuals, but falters in the facial animation derps, janky out of place characters, dissonant color palette (as in too bright characters on utterly dull or outright BLACK backgrounds or vice versa.), reusing shots and erratic dips in quality throughout at times. The animation isn't bad per say, just erratic and that's the ONE word to say about the animation in Qualidea Code overall.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, we have a pretty decent voice cast overall, but be it LA but LA thought there were even some awkward audio issues with this anime mainly with the OST being louder than the voice actor speaking at times, it might have just been LA but still. LA's favourite voice actor?.....Aoi Yuuki, like it was THAT obvious.\\n\\n\r\nNow the \"true villains\" of this anime, really due to circumstances LA saw the true villains a \"sympathetic\", now hear LA out...\\n\r\n*********HUGE SPOILERS DON'T READ UNLESS YOU'VE WATCHED ALL OF Qualidea Code**********\\n\\n\r\nIf anything due to the true aliens \"Unknown\" only wanting to have children as this \"alien race\" can't have children and with Airi Yuunami voiced by Mamiko Noto and Gutou Asanagi voiced by Hiroaki Hirata being the \"proxy\" as villains in this anime and Airi being the gate to opening more of their own kind into Qualidea Code's world, they're really sympathetic as they really haven't done nothing wrong in terms of bloodshed, sure they kidnapped comatose kids and used them as an army to defend themselves from the adults that left during the incident and returned for their kids, but all the Unknown wanted were children (in Airi and Gutou's case anyways, the Unknown motivation aren't really told properly as they can't talk) and sure kidnapping the kids and using them as child soldiers and brainwashing them into thinking the real adults are aliens is their fault, but the real adults are kinda at fault too as they kinda enacted the war between themselves and the true Unknown which caused all this to happen...these \"sympathetic villains aren't much\" but they did impact what happened by the finale\\n\\n\r\n********SPOILERS END*************\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was pretty satisfying and most of the plot threads were what LA expected it turned out with what LA said about the spoiler above. The ending however was GREATLY affected by the janky animation (such as not showing the \"action\" during the fights instead it showing some off-putting scenery, frames that needed \"more frames\"), as much as the plot and characters was great and satisfying with the resolution to all of it, the animation utterly crippled this ending.\\n\\n\r\nQualidea Code definitely has a good anime with a good twist that kept it under wraps for a really long time before Qualidea Code showed it's true self and really LA did like that about Qualidea Code, both the character, relationship and world building helped immensely with the huge twist it was saving for, however Qualidea Code was utterly crippled by the erratic animation quality. LA has not seen an anime in a while in which it's janky erratic animation quality would be it's downfall, Qualidea Code isn't a horrible anime, just mismanaged animation quality control with a good decent plot to go with it. With all that in mind, Qualidea Code is at best a slightly above average anime with a good plot, a janky mess of animation at worse.",

Imagine you met your long lost father, instead of breaking out into tears or showing a shocking expression,they make the scene a comedic one.\\n\r\n-Nothing makes sense. This is the worst factor of all, I'm not going to spoil it but once you watch the anime towards the end, you'll understand.\\n\r\n-The reason they were able to defeat the enemy by simply killing one person, the supposedly intelligent race of aliens were killed in an instant. This is an obvious sarcasm, the 'unknown' who were extremely intelligent weren't smart enough to use something more suitable for the dimensional gate.\\n\\n\r\nI'm being generous by giving this 5/10",

            "content": "First of all I need to just say this THIS IS NOT YOUR GENERIC HAREM LIGHT NOVEL SERIES!! I went into this one with extremely low expectations thinking it was going to be another harem and I didnt think id finish it BUT for once the main character doesnt have 5 girls waiting in line to suck his dick, sure the concept is generic and nothing really special, but for me its mostly the characters and their development that makes this anime great.\r\n(this review wont be constructed well, its more of like a rant I guess)\r\nThe concept like I said isnt too special, it takesplace in this world, where these children have a bunch of different superpowers and they have to fight the \"unknown\" who are constantly attacking. Its not what makes this show for me, but its a solid foundation for this anime. The story follows mostly Ichiya, who wants to become stronger because he promised to protect his childhood friend, but it also focuses on these 2 cool-looking siblings who are like his rivals. The story has a really unexpected ending and some shocking events happen but just keep watching, thats my advice atleast. I really liked the backstory and development of these characters and it progressed at a good rate, not too slow and boring but not too fast either\\n\\n\r\nbut the BIGGEST reason I liked this anime is because it follows 3 different \"romantic\" relationships: the main character and his childhood friend (meh its kinda generic but I guess its pretty good), this girl who is PRIME waifu material with her brother (shes just perfect I cant even describe it with words) and finally these 2 girls who have a deep history, im not gonna go too much into it because 1. I dont really remember and 2. its better if I dont spoil too much, just go watch it yourself. Also why I used \"romantic\" with quotes is because the last one isnt really romantic but it feels like it definetly would be if the anime continued for another 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is a review, ill talk about what I disliked aswell. I really dont like Ichiya, he just has the perfect personality for a harem protagonist. No hes not clueless and retarded, but hes this good guy hero \"ill get stronger then everybody\" \"ill protect you\" thing that usually makes every girl fall for him, but luckly not in this anime. STILL DONT LIKE HIM THO\\n\\n\r\nQuickly ill talk about the art and sound aswell - its aight, im not gonna go into it anymore because its nothing spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: waifu is 10/10, story is like 7-8/10, waifu is 10/10, art n shit is pretty good yknow 8/10? but more importantly asuha chigusa waifu 10/10\\n\\n\r\nnoxy quality reviews\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Qualidea Code, A-1 Pictures' new attempt at \"cash grab\" show for the summer 2016 season. This show had a certain hype behind it considering the studio behind it and their previous works, notably: Sword Art Online, Anohana, Your Lie In April and Silver Spoon among others.\r\nThose of you who follow certain studios and look at their previous works will recognize that A-1 is a hit or miss studio. Sure they gave birth to shows like Erased and Your Lie in April which are greatly loved, but they also gave us Subete ga F ni naru and Aldnoah Zero which aren't great.\r\nSadly Qualidea Code falls uponthe lower end the line as (in my opinion) it isn't good. That isn't to say it isn't enjoyable I liked watching this (sort of) and you should attempt to watch it and form your own opinions.\\n\\n\r\nWell onto the aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot for Q.C was honestly not bad I would go as far as to say it was good, it had interesting moments, some good twists and overall left me somewhat fulfilled as it closed up all the holes it seemed to have opened. Sure it could've been better but almost anything can be improved and they did fine as it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show has it's beautiful moments, the characters weren't bad looking, the world was fine but what let it down was the animation. Minor spoiler... I think but the ruined it's moments of action, the fight scenes, what some of us have been looking for in this show we're sub par at best. During moments of intensity when tensions are high and everything showed be awesome *kaboom* *bang*, that's the kind of stuff we look forward to, coupled with an awesome shounen show type fight moment we would be happy. Though we were let down, during these moments we just got still frames of what characters were doing.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was wonderfully done, rather than being dumped in to add effect A-1 used it to add tension and get the scene across well. In addition the voice actors played their parts well and managed to portray a good scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters like everything else were fine, nothing to really moan over with the exception of 1 or 2 whose personalities and actions mad me sigh. The were drawn well and well acted as I mentioned, they fit the scenes well which helped this show.\\n\\n\r\nQualidea Code is what I would expect from an A-1 pictures adaptation now a days, not to insult the studio because some of my favourite shows were put out by them, what I mean is that it feels raw, unrefined and just rough. If they had waited to put this out and polished the animation sequences it would've been in the upper levels of the summer 2016 chart but they didn't. I mean it was fine, I wouldn't watch it again once is plenty but I wouldn't be embarrassed to say I had watched it. Anyway I believe everyone reading should go watch an episode make your own opinion and then choose what to do because honestly it isn't bad but it isn't good. If I just threw paint at a wall someone would call it art, maybe you'll like it maybe you won't but hey it exists in case you want to try it.  :D",
