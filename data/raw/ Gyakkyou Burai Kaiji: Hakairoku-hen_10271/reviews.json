            "content": "Ok this is my first time to write a review so please go easy.\r\nLet me start by saying I'm a huge fan of psychological thriller series and I must say Kaiji is one of the best there is in that aspect. Season 1 was just amazing, keeps you thinking and surprises you with the twisted outcomes. In Season 2 Kaiji has done it again, each episode keeps getting better and better makes you at the edge of your seat hunger to know whats will happen next. \r\nIf your a fan of Psychological thrillers such as Death note or Liar game, Kaiji is a must watchfor you. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The story continues after the incidents from season 1, Kaiji has been taken to work in an underground facility to work in hard labor so he can pay off his debt, however he then finds out that there is a dark side inside the underground which is ofcourse \"GAMBLE!!\" he now will risk it all again so he can leave the underground and pay off his giant debt. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I can tell the art is better than Season 1, the characters are now more detailed and shows how they changed since the previous season. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtracks in Kaiji season 2 are amazing, it keeps you hyper in every moment, as for the opening and ending I personally loved them as I am a fan of Techno metal and pop rock. And yes we get more ZAWA ZAWA !!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: As I said the characters have changed since the last season, there are new rivals and new friends. Men risking their lives to get out of this miserable life and there are men who plan to ruin their dreams of escaping. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I assure you this the enjoyment of this show is VERY ADDICTING \\n\r\nit will keep you thinking what will happen next and keep searching for clues in the site/forums. As I said before if you enjoyed Death note or Liar game or any Psychological thriller show. Kaiji will MAGNET your emotions!!\\n\\n\r\nI really hope I did great as a first time doing a review, Please enjoy the show!\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and enjoy the show ^.^",

            "content": "Are you suffering from an absence of GAR and strategy in your life? Already burn through your reserve JoJo's and No Game No Life strategic asspulls for a rainy day? Well, I got just the fix!\r\nZAWA ZAWA ZAWA ZAWA ZAWA\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nYou'd think the novelty of high gambling will be dull after 26 episodes right? But Kaiji's sequel not only delivers yet again but surpasses expectations! But it's not all a win. The story pits Kaiji into an underground camp as a slave laborer in order to pay off his debts. As in typical Kaiji fashion, it's not all as it seems. As Kaiji butts headswith his 1st antagonists and the 1st story arc deals with the struggle of who'll come out on top. The script delivers yet again with the stakes matching the given level of risk. The psychological element is still there but it's safe to say that season 2 leans more towards who can cheat the best than actual strategy.\\n\r\n   The second arc continues the trend of who's the better cheater, showing a natural flow from one arc to another. However, there's a reason the story doesn't get a 10/10 and that will become apparent as soon as you reach the 2nd half. The challenge is a 1/1000,000,000 high gamble game of pachinko. And unlike season 1, where arcs were resolved within 6-7 episodes, the final arc will have you yelling \"FUCKIN WIN ALREADY!\"  at your monitor, as it's apparent that it's being stretched to reach it's desired 26 episode mark. The ending also remains open-ended.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNever since the Death Note potato chip eating scene has scenes about mundane tasks get the blood pumping!\\n\\n\r\nIt's Madhouse, it should go without saying that they always deliver. The ugly yet appealing character designs are as bold and GAR as ever! There's also a clear improvement of the facial features. Giving the over the top look of joy or anguish when necessary. The visual metaphors also added a much-needed flare for a show with no real physical action. You know, the whole \"if Kaiji is winning, he's grasping the universe\" or \"if he's losing he's sinking into a swamp\" that kinda thing. Although it can become unnecessary at times, done only to extend the episode run time. Nerveless, if you like the blood rush of this series then it'll do the job!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nZAWA ZAWA ZAWAAA\\n\\n\r\nThe sound also keeps stride. The attention to detail is apparent, from the hissing sound of an air current to the crackling of dice in a bowl. The soundtrack is also well synchronized in scenes when needed. Especially noteworthy during the symbolic visual cues throughout the show. and who can forget the 'ZAWA ZAWA ZAWA' lol\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKaiji radiates so much GAR that Kenshiro will nod in approval. He's also slightly developed as well, as his methods for winning become more cutthroat than from season 1.  That doesn't mean he changed, in fact, he still trusts others too easily right up to the very end. A point even brought up by a character later on. But unlike other MCs, Kaiji's flaws are apparent and in the same process makes him feel more human. He struggles, he cares, he deceives and ultimately he learns. \\n\r\nall the antagonists are over the top, and I'm talking about your Saturday morning cartoons kinda evil. But given the fact that the entire show runs on testosterone and MANLY MANPOWER it's to be expected. In fact, I would say this elevates the show more than hindering it. Making the already suspenseful roller coaster ride that more enjoyable. \\n\r\nHell, even the narrator exudes MANLY MANPOWER.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nVery little shows manage to hook me from beginning to end. Kaiji 2 became just as addicting as gambling itself as I found myself marathoning it without stop. This was an exhilarating thrill ride that brought my GAR meter back to stable conditions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of manly men doing insanely manly shit and psychological mind games then this is the anime for you. But be warned, once you start there's no stopping it!\\n",

            "content": "Kaiji season 2 offers a solid conclusion to the anime series however the series itself is a decrease in quality from season 1 Kaiji Ultimate Survivor.\r\nTaking place a few months after the first arc, Kaiji is taken underground to pay his debt by manual labor which will take him around 15 years to complete his sentence. After a few months later, Kaiji is then allowed to be outside for a few days in which he hears about a casino with the infamous pachinko game \"The Bog\" which if Kaiji wins can pay off his entire debt.\r\nThe differences in this season being the 3rd series ofthe Kaiji manga include the lack of psychological thrills & games revolving around quick cunning & dangerous high stakes. This part only features a total of 2 games while the first part consisted of 4, plus the gambles in series 2 revolve around luck rather than strategy. \\n\\n\r\nBenefits of Kaiji 2 include Kaiji himself as we see more of his intellect & role as a leader who never abandons hope. Aside from the main lead, the only other highlight would be the ending of the series as it brings a satisfying conclusion leading to its series 4 of the manga. Despite the lack of horrifying tension & the tragic moments in the first season, Kaiji does remain to have its feels & teary-eye moments. While it's not as complex in morality issues as the first series it is still well written & well directed.\\n\\n\r\nCons of Kaiji 2 mainly belong to its final arc as it is too long as it is a total of 18 episodes; more than half of the season. Essentially The Bog pachinko consists of Kaiji winning his freedom but it is a necessary arc & is handled mostly well. The beginning of The Bog starts off nicely & progresses smoothly with little to no problem, however the cons begin to show at episode 16 when Kaiji plays the bog for 9 episodes straight. While some scenes within those episodes are crucial to the story, I found myself skimming through the episode as it felt very dragged & repetitive. It would have benefited at least being half of the amount. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Kaiji 2 is weaker in story in its first season & may have been a better series if it's Bog game was shorter. It definitely offers some good moments & great character writing but in terms of content it does lack a lot of areas done in the 1st season mainly its creative games & journey into the evils of men. Kaiji 2 instead focuses on classic Japanese gambling & a struggling journey towards freedom.",

            "content": "I was a great fan of the first season so it's probably going to be a bit biased.\r\nBut let me tell you how much I love these series. I usually like psychological thriller, \"Main character being super smart pwning everybody\" kind of anime but this is my favorite one out there.\r\nOne out was mediocre, liar game got boring midway through, death note was really good but... There's just something about this series that tops all those anime and manga.\r\nI saw the first season like 4 years ago and it's still on my mind.\r\nAnyway WATCH THE FIRST ONE if you haven't GO NOW!\r\nIt might get youa little down after watching a few eps cause it deals with somethings that aren't very pleasant to think about... There's good and bad in this world but I believe that you need to know both sides as much as you can to get a clearer picture of everything.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime kind of changed my viewpoints in the way I look at life, and it doesn't seem like a coincidence because at the time I was transfixed in dystopian novels like 1984, Brave new world, farenheit 451 etc.\\n\\n\r\nNot all the things that happen in this anime is \"real\" but the philosophy, in my opinion rings very true to some of the things I've seen in society.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is... for the people that aren't innocent anymore, but value those innocent values of fairness, love, justice and want to protect them.\\n\r\nWatch if your interested in psychology, and want to protect yourself from losing completely to seemingly innocent assholes who try to take your freedom from you.\\n\\n\r\nAlso watch if you know what I am talking about.",

            "content": "Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Hakairoku Hen is the second season of kaiji ultimate survivor  which  continues from where the first season left of. \r\nStory 8/10  The second season starts of with Kaiji wondering around japan looking for ways  to earn money.  \r\nWile he sees an  familiar face Endoh from the first season which somewhat helped him with his debt problems in season 1 eg The gambling ship  this time though Kaiji is kidnapped by Endoh and forced into slave labor to pay off his debt with very harsh living conditions. Now what l like to say about the firsthalf of season 2 it has a lot of suspense to it rivals the first season's   and the antagonist in  both half's are great  the problem is with the a second half the bourge arc. Which is basically impossible pachinko   each episode does drag on with this arc.  And makes the  show irritating to sit through you will be there yelling at your screen is kaiji gonna fucking win or not. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation  8/10  It's madhouse madhouse does some amazing amazing animation with their shows.  Sure the weird character designs are still there but l won't take a point  of as its part of the shows style. The animation  does have a few problems near the end but the animation with the characters reactions when  they are in  peril is fantastic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 The sound probably the weakest part of the show. But its not bad at all the opening is fucking fantastic even though it is screamo the ending sucks it just flat outright sucks \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n it doesn't suit the tone of the show at all and just takes you out of the experience. \\n\r\n The ost though is nice the iconic zara zara is there when something is  not going kaiji's way or if its just a bad situation in general.  Characters 9/10  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOur fantastic protagonist kaiji is back while he is still  a bit of a mean spirited person  the development from season 1 he has extremely pure goals and  pretty much putting his life on the line against impossible odds. \\n\\n\r\n Sometimes not always winning in the end and adding more despair and tension to the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters and the villains are also unique the villains are evil evil fucking people and you just want something really awful to happen to them at the end of it.  and the sides especially kaiji's friends being a great bunch of unlucky people. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe show had me on the edge of my seat most of the time more in the second half as it had way more build up then the first half. But still weaker in general. \\n\\n\r\nl really enjoyed the second season of  kaiji even though l didn't like it as much as the first season and the resolution is a bit too open ended for my tastes. \\n\r\nOverall 8/10  Kaiji's second season is something you should definitely see if you loved the first season. \\n\\n\r\n But the second half may  frustrate you imagine how the people who watched this shows airing right fuck that must have been awful anyway thanks for reading my review.",

            "content": "This series is pretty suspenseful and will give you a similar type of enjoyment to the first series, but I gotta say it's not as good. \r\nFirst off, Kaiji 2 is not a psychological battle. It also doesn't have much philosophy in it. It vaguely contains that sorta stuff, but it's really faint. I loved the first series of Kaiji so much for the constant risks, trust, betrayal, scams, elaborate schemes, exposure of human emotions, putting human character into question, and Tonegawa's philosophical speeches. Kaiji 2 doesn't really have such concepts in it. Both of his gambles are pretty much won simply with logic andcareful planning; the goal is to scam the scammer. This isn't a bad thing, but it wasn't as exciting as it could've been, or maybe I'm just being unfair since I thought the first season's way of doing things was much better. \\n\\n\r\nKaiji has good morals and it's interesting to see a good person thrown into a setting where being good is merely mocked, considered foolish, and makes everything much harder. Most anime will reward the hero for his good behaviour, but Kaiji must struggle due to his ideals, which is pretty realistic.\\n\r\nOnce again, Kaiji teams up with fellow losers and demonstrates good leadership. His devotion is pretty touching. He's just a pretty great character. \\n\\n\r\nOne big problem with this series is how long things are dragged out for. It's not as fast paced as the first series or even most other anime... The second half of the series is particularly bad about that; the animation gets very repetitive... The crowd cheering, the pachinko balls flying around in the Bog, and the balls circling around the dishes. The pachinko balls and Bog are done in 3D, which is pretty boring and unappealing to me. It goes on and it goes on, each episode contains one realization/plot twist. \\n\r\nHe's gonna win! Go, yeah! It's on the second plate! He's gonna lose. What a fool he was, now he's screwed. He's gonna win! This is it, nothing can hold him back now! Time to kick some ass! He's gonna lose. Agh, it's all hopeless! Or is it?\\n\r\nThey could've shortened that stuff down a bit. I know the manga drags it out just as long, but I think it would've been nice if the animation studio decided to add a little filler arc... though that would've proved challenging with Kaiji's situation, I'm sure they could've found a way to do it without ruining the existing story/plot. It could've just been 2 or 3 episodes of some different kind of gamble, anything to shorten down all that time wasted watching pachinko balls rolling around. For example, if they started the series in a different way even if that would've taken away from the shock of Kaiji being sent underground immediately. He could've lost some other gamble and been found by Teiai due to that or something... \\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, this is good overall, but not a masterpiece. It's suspenseful and exciting, but not as much as it could've been. You'll probably like it if you liked the first series, but you might feel something's missing or that it's drawn out.",

It's basically just an advert for pachinko and the upcoming Kaiji live-action movie.\r\nNow the first season of Kaiji (aside from being very good) was dragged out a little, as are most other anime, but this season is really taking the mickey.\r\nAny tension i intially felt while watching this has completely vanished. Kaiji's chances of wininng are like watching someone with bipolar, up, down, up, down... every single episode, just so they can stretch the seriesout to 26 episodes. Midway through the series it just gets horrendously repetative.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, just don't waste your time on this.",

            "content": "Tension and Tedious are 2 completely different things!\r\nand it's clear Kaiji season 2 feels there is no distinction between the two.\r\nUnlike season 1 this addition just drags...and drags...and drags! on and on and on.\r\nEverything Else in the show is perfectly fine. the score is intense, the animation is crips clean, the voice acting is solid. but the single deathblow season 2 has is it's TERRIBLE dragged out pacing. it's not that noticeable in the first half of the season but it really begins to show during the second half.\r\nAnd this is where the Tension vs Tedious bit comes into play. The big final gamble ofthe series which starts around halfway the season and goes on all the way to the end. and every episode from this point on consists of only 2 things. 10% of the episode is dedicated to the next \"cheat\" our pro-/antagonist uses to counter the other. and the other 90% is showing their emotional reaction to either achieving or getting denied their goal. \\n\\n\r\nYou can do this for...3...maybe 5 episode since were talking \"final boss\" in this case. but anything beyond that just makes most of the episode feel like padding. and geez 12 episodes of padding was a frustrating sit. it's not a good thing when I'm yelling \"GET ON WITH IT\" at my screen. accompanied by skipping trough large portions of the latter episodes without missing ANYTHING important.\\n\\n\r\nI'll go as far as saying this season could easily have been 12 episodes long it was re-cut correctly, while still have enough room to build tension without feeling rushed",

            "content": "The 2nd season of Kaiji is not as impressive as the first season. It still has some of the same elements that made the first season so successful and so addicting, yet it falls short in other areas.\r\nThe story continues from the events that took place at the end of season 1. The first arc is decent. The second and final arc is sluggish and it becomes apparent that it is forcefully dragged out to fill 26 episodes. It makes you question what is more impressive, Kaiji's ingenuity to overcome difficulties or the developers' ability to stretch one pachinko session for half of the season.One way or the other, it becomes very tiring and repetitive towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nAnother of the main issues why this season is not as impressive lies with the antagonists: Unlike the well-crafted personalities of the antagonists in the prequel with their philosophy and reasoning behind their actions, in this season the antagonists are an extremely degraded version and the typical ignorant fools that exist only to make things happen, but without really leaving an impact. The first season was a battle of minds and concepts between Kaiji and the \"villains\". This season is essentially a race of Kaiji against the clock as you can feel it from miles away that it is only a matter of time before Kaiji wins, the only question is how. \\n\\n\r\nThere is another distinct change in this season: Unlike in first season where Kaiji was more reactive towards the things happening and he was using his ingenuity to adapt on the spur of the moment, in this sequel Kaiji is more proactive and makes his plans before he acts. It is interesting to see that change in Kaiji and him becoming more strategic, but it is certainly not as impressive and intense as being the man of the eleventh hour. Due to that, in this second season everything feels rather pre-determined unlike the surprise factors of season 1.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is much more refined and detailed this time around. The sound remains average, it still gets the job done but nothing really memorable at the end of the day. The \"zawa\" sound becomes annoying after a while due to it being overused. The narrator retains the same level of epicness as in first season, maybe even more actually, which is a very positive thing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, an enjoyable sequel and an interesting watch, but do not expect the awesomeness of the first season.",

            "content": "(This review is only helpful if you have seen the first season)\r\nI am writing this review to give people the perspective of someone whose favorite anime of all-time is Kaiji, yet was severely disappointed in Hairoku Hen. While Kaiji was a fast-paced rollercoaster, Hairoku Hen is the teacup ride at Disney Land. It's unfair to to compare the second season to the first- usually. In Kaiji's case however I deem it necessary.\r\nThe first arc of Hairoku Hen is excellent, and had my hopes soaring high for the rest of the season. The pace was fast, the art is still Kaiji art so it's awesome, andit was pretty intense.\\n\\n\r\nHowever my biggest complaint with Hairoku Hen comes in the second and final arc, The Bog.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bog is a pachinko machine that is essentially rigged so no one can win. Kaiji soon realizes this and puts his head to the test in trying to beat this unbeatable machine. This would all be awesome if it the arc was around 8 episodes, like the first, leaving a super intense climactic final arc to finish the series off. But nope, The Bog arc starts at around episode 8 where the first arc left off, and drags on until all 26 episodes are complete. Some episodes are literally so tedious to watch I considered dropping the series, while some were actually mildly entertaining. The pace does pick back up when there's like 3 episodes to go but by this point I was so tired of The Bog that I didn't care as much as I could have. While this paragraph goes in depth on my only real gripe with Hairoku Hen, it is a big one as like 10 episodes out of 26 weren't very entertaining, and you can't really call it thematic pacing because from the beginning you know Kaiji is going to win as he always does.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, sound, story, etc are all great like the first season. It's just Hairoku Hen stumbled all over itself while Kaiji broke the speed limit.",

So basically we once again meet with Kaiji. As always he is broke. He once again is put to a test. The first part of the series concentrates in a another place (that I won't mention so there aren't any spoilers), but basically he has to gamble once more. To be honest the reason I think this season is better is since Kaiji has become more and more of a hero. Even though theflow of the series moves rather slow (there wasn't enough material in my opinion for 26 episodes), but Kaiji now more resembles a figure that I myself would admire. He is more dependable. The art is as always interesting. When I rate the art I don't rate it for style but more like the way everything is showcased. I just love how the scenes change and how the characters react. Emotions are just flowing and you can just feel the adrenaline. I found myself being on the edge numerous times. So in a way you get emottionaly attached. This gambling, gambling in Kaiji's way is something unique. The series is also \"anti-moe\", meaning there are now women (well only one to be exact and she is well special in her own way). This anime will keep you on the edge. I would recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "To keep it brief: \r\nThe first season of Kaiji was a fantastic gambling anime, with the exception of the bridge crossing, but the character driven drama made even that lull in the tactical aspect of the anime enjoyable. \r\nHowever, this season went a bit overboard with how slow some games are drawn out for, in particular, Kaiji vs the Bog goes on for an excruciatingly long number of episodes, and debatably it's long enough to diffuse tension, which is the opposite of the goal. \r\nAnother recurring problem was the narrator and characters repeating some phrase upwards of three times for emphasis. Though this in itselfis an innocuous, effective technique, I felt as if it were slightly overused in this season, which ultimately pulled me out of the experience whenever it happened.\\n\\n\r\nThe final problem I had with Kaiji - Against All Rules, is they changed something that made season one very enjoyable. Though watching the characters come up with strategies and ways to combat the other person cheating, the real joy is from realising all the information needed to figure out the same strategies were shown to us. This however, does not happen in the last stand off this season. There is a moment where Kaiji overhears something in a bar that becomes crucial to his plan that is not revealed to us until many episodes later, exactly when that piece of information became important. Although it is a common theme for mysteries to withhold tiny bits of information until the big reveal, it is unfortunate that Kaiji does not stick to the old formula where everything is revealed to us beforehand. \\n\\n\r\nCriticism aside, this was still an enjoyable anime and the character animation was done very well, succeeding in invoking fear and relief in the audience. Definitely worth giving it a watch.",

            "content": "NOT Spoiler free. You have been warned!\r\nAfter such an amazing first season, how does the second one hold up.\r\nWe enter the second season of Kaiji to find Kaiji down on his luck. He still has a huge debt hanging over him and he spends a lot of time gambling still, trying to win as much money as possible. We then find Endou, who's complaining about his latest job, which is finding and bring in Kaiji.\r\nTurns out it's really easy because he find Kaiji almost right away, Kaiji notices Endou and instantly starts asking to go into another survival game saying this time he knows hecan win for sure since he was so close last time, however he is knocked out and taken to the underground hell that was touched on only a little in the first season.\\n\r\nThe second season has only two arcs really, the first being playing chichiro in the underground and then Kaiji getting a small parole time and playing an extreme version of pachinko on a machine called the bog, which is beaten gives an extreme payout.\\n\r\nThe story this time isn't nearly as good as the first season, the chinchiro is pretty entertaining and has some interesting tactics but overall it's not nearly as well written or complex as the first season, there's just way too much restrictions now, he's in the underground and when it comes down to it, it really is just chinchiro, there's no extra element to it really.\\n\r\nThe pachinko arc also has some interesting strategies, the bog is so broken that the only way to win is to cheat your way through it, the various ways that Kaiji counters the bogs defences are interesting but the main issue is that the pachinko arc can be so slow. They must of had way more episodes then they knew what to do with cause while the same amount of episodes did like 3-4 arcs in the first season there's only 2 here. The start and most of the pachinko arc is actually really enjoyable and whole not as good as the first season it's still really good. But it starts to drag real bad and it stays that way for a fair while and then once all is said and done the last two episodes are also a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nKaiji is so much more relatable now then in the first season, due to Kaiji advanced thinking and crazy schemes the first season defiantly made him cool but unrelatable, it was a joy to watch but Kaiji is more relatable now which is both a good and a bad thing. Very early on he caves into the underground a temptation of beer and snacks that they can buy with money exclusive to the underground, the money can also be used to buy one day pass\u2019 to the outside world though and so that's what Kaiji wants to age up for.\\n\r\nBut as I said he caves in and we even see these scenes of him trying to justify it to himself. Stuff like how if he saves all the money he will have enough by six months but he will also have some left over, so he can use the leftover money for beer and snacks. Later he then starts saying that he can just wait for seven months to get the outside pass and he keeps pushing it back and making excuses.\\n\r\nThis is me all the time, I do the same kind of thing with my money and I also hate myself for it once all is said and done so watching this gave me a little chuckle but I totally felt for Kaiji as he tried to fight temptation and once he failed kept trying to justify it he exact same way I always try to justify myself.\\n\r\nHowever Kaiji being more human and normal also has its issues, toward the end things get real bleak and Kaiji out of nowhere becomes a real coward, he has extreme fear of losing which is fair but he straight up cries and tries to ask for a draw, this is something that season 1 Kaiji never did. No matter how bad the situation got Kaiji would just think up a new plan and try his best to escape the situation but new Kaiji breaks down way more easily. Plus even when Kaiji is going to win it's not some epic situation where he's got a smug look on his face and his filled with confidence. But his crying and yelling in basically relief, I get it,  do but season 1 Kaiji was just much different to how he acts now.\\n\r\nOverall Kaiji still has some crazy tactics but he also makes a few mistakes and fails to see things as well as he use to, he definitely is still able to pull off some crazy stuff but it doesn't seem as cool. This change has its good and it's bad so overall I'd say that if I were to give just Kaiji a rating it would be about the same as season 1 Kaiji but just for different reasons.\\n\\n\r\nEndou actually has a surprisingly large amount of importance this time. We see him at the start of course but since Kaiji is underground for the first arc we don't see him till the second arc and even then we don't see him right way. First Kaiji goes along with a gambler named Sakazaki and tried to help him best the bog, however once this fails and Kaiji takes over trying to come up with his own plan he decides to try and get some help from Endou, since he needs more funds and someone with the kind of connections that Endou has. \\n\r\nEndou is also facing large amounts of debt and is going to be in serious trouble if he can't pay it back and there is even the risk of being sent to the underground. Once some interest is worked out and the division of the jackpot is worked out he decided to help out despite thinking there's only a 50% chance of winning.\\n\r\nEndou doesn't really do too much outside of this, once Kaijis attack on the bog begins there's only really two characters that matter. However I still like Endou being included, he defiantly ads some extra dynamics and seeing how his situations has changed overall is rather interesting and in the end he ends up taking a ton of kaijis share of the money since Endou loaded more money to Kaiji in a dire situation and thus Kaiji signed without looking, because of this the interest was absolutely insane.\\n\r\nEndou is a massive dick but he was needed and I liked him being there since he still worked for the enemy and all.\\n\\n\r\nI also mentioned someone named Sakazaki, this is an old man who works as a night guard. He has a wife and daughter but they left him due to his financial issues, he wants to beat the bog so he can buy a house and show his family that he is reliable and win them back into his life, however his a hopeless gambler. Kaiji and Sakazaki meet shorty after Kaiji is out and Sakazaki shows Kaiji the bog and explains its massive payout, he asks Kaiji for help in besting it and offers a share of the money to him if they win. However the plan fails and Sakazaki falls into despair, he stole money from his boss in order to get more chances at the bog and now he's gonna be in serious trouble if his boss finds out.\\n\r\nOnce his plan fails Kaiji takes control and tries to figure out a plan for beating the bog and he does, he thinks up ways to break down the bogs defences and then has Sakazaki help him with the win.\\n\r\nSakazaki actually plays a very critical role in the plan overall and is definitely needed. Plus his the whole reason the second arc even really happens. However the show doesn't forget what it's characters are for and makes sure to use him to show greed and how horrible humans can really be. Sakazaki releases on Kaiji so much and takes extreme risks to help him out and then as soon as Kaiji loses a chunk of his share to Endou, Sakazaki goes to make a quick escape saying \u2018I better go before he starts begging to take some of my share.\u2019 Once again showing what the first season really focused on, it's nice that it here in Sakazaki even if the that point isn't really there much at all.\\n\\n\r\nLastly there's Ichijou the main antagonist, he is the manager of the casino with the bog, the casino is also run by the Teiai Corporation, so Kaiji once again is still fighting them. Ichijou can basically be considered the third in command, he is he favorite manager of tonegawa\u2019s replacement so it basically puts him in third place and he claims that once the head dies off he will defiantly be made the second in command.\\n\r\nIchijou is extremely prideful however his pride and cockiness are his downfall as he fails to see what's going on and is way to lax with letting Kaiji get into a winning position, he keeps thinking he's in the lead and thus turns down potentially outlets and doesn't stay on the defensive enough.\\n\r\nIchijou is also a straight up Cheater, he has multiple devices that he can use to activate more defenses for the bog. Stuff like a sensor that facts a set of flipper making it impossible for any balls to get near the jackpot. Ichijou goes in and out of his confidence, the situation and how likely Kaiji is to win changes a lot and ichijou actually helps Kaiji to win and destroys his own defences in the end.\\n\r\nIchijou was an interesting enough antagonist, he has some clear if not very basic goals and motivation, he definitely is cocky and overconfident to the point of self destruction just like how in the first season tonegawa does the same thing, he lost because of how advanced of a thinker he was. And now ichijou loses because of how much manipulation of the bog he had at his disposal.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters are a whole lot better this time, last time they weren't really focused on that much since it was more about people in general, plus the first season is just full of death, people die so much in that. Now each characters is given motivations and they stay around for the whole thing and don't just die off, there's also a much bigger range with Endou being on kaijis side, Sakazaki actually living through it unlike ishida from last time and the villain is also just a lot more fleshed out and also has a lot more to fear, tonegawa only wanted to win because he was scared of losing his position and the boss. \\n\r\nHowever ichijou is going to have to go underground to make back his extreme loses if Kaiji wins the jackpot, plus he hasn't even got to his second position yet, his just shy of getting there, he was so close but didn't get there when he feel. Tonegawa at least got to enjoy his position for a long time before it was taken away. Overall I just felt for them more and liked the lot of them more.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is the same as last time, I still love the bold outlines on everything and it's still got insane metaphor imagery which is a lot of fun to watch as it's way more over the top then it needs to be. However like I said the show drags a lot and so I did start to get tired of seeing some similar or same metaphor imagery used. Plus a lot of the shots used for the pachinko machine showing the balls doing something was reused a lot and that slightly annoyed me. Plus Kaiji is so desperate to win that his crying a lot, all the people watching him are cause they want him to win as it will show them that any loser has hope. Sakazaki and Endou want him to win just as much as Kaiji wants to himself so they also have tears and whenever ichijou is scared of losing he als has intense tears.\\n\r\nThe tears are way too intense for me, there think and really runny and apparently endless, the just flow out of Kaiji endlessly for the like the last 4 episodes, it's a bit too much and I did start to despise it towards the end, it just get a bit too much.\\n\r\nOnce again the voice acting was done well, absolutely no issues there. \\n\r\nEveryone was cast well and did an excellent job, although I have my issues with the narrator. He's always there, sure he was always there in the first season but he just annoys me this time, it's mainly because of how much the show drags this time, he ends up repeating a lot of the same stuff and his voice just gets real stale as it always the same tone unlike everyone else who has changes in there voice to match there emotion obviously. But the narrator's endless presence and lack of emotion makes him really stale real fast and I just wanted him to shut up towards the end.\\n\r\nThe sound is questionable, while there's is the good old ZUWA ZUWA, I feel it's used a bit too much this time around, towards the end it kinda lost its meaning and it felt like it was just thrown in there whenever, the background music is fine but it's mostly bland plus the can't hear it over the sounds of pachinko.\\n\r\nIt's very likely not many of you had been in at a pachinko arcade before or played real pachinko, I have and the show defiantly nails what it sounds like, the balls endlessly clicking and clacking around. But it's a pain to hear especially as this arc drags on and it is just always in the background, it's not too bad early on and it's really good that they nailed it, but it's too perfect. Which gets on my nerves, while I shouldn't get mad at the show for this since they just made it accurate, but this is based off my enjoyment dammit and this did hamper it to a degree.\\n\r\nThe opening is great, I absolutely love it's high energy rock and high volume. It's very intense and strong and I love it, I also found myself head banging to the start of it almost every single episode. The ED is alright in terms of music but my god is it creepy and whenever I was watching in a public place like my uni I just felt slightly awkward and really hoped that no one would see since it's just a little intense. But it works and it didn't really make me like it less.\\n\\n\r\nI liked Kaiji I really did, the second season was a really good watch and if you liked the first one then there's no reason why you should dislike this one. It's not as good but it's still really good and in the same vain as the first season. However it also has better characters and the presentation is kind of a mixed bag of better and worse but overall I'd still rather watch the first season rathern then this. Towards the end I slowed down on watching this and I definitely wasn't enjoying it as much as this review would make you believe, but the overall enjoyment was high for me and the final episode is really good, I like it a lot so they was a worthy payoff for me which made the final slog worth it. I kinda keep going back and forth here but that's because I want you to really know what i find good and what I find bad and the reasons for it. Also no matter what way I look at it I have very conflicted feelings about this show and what was worth it and what wasn't. Most of its issued can come back to it dragging on for way more then it needs, it's to build tension and make for a big payoff with its great end but it causes more issues then things it helps, either way it's still a very good show.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind guys I have to Kaiji: against all rules 7/10.\\n",

            "content": "My first review ^_^\r\nOkay so I go to a website I always go to for Anime and my friend and I every month choose a random anime. Go to number Generator and it chooses our letter and which anime. Anyway this one came up. \r\nStory:\r\nI found the story very interesting. I haven't actually seen anything like this (I don't really watch anime as much as I used to) and it caught my attention. The first few episodes is where it shined the most to me. It was very unexpected and it was very well played out. However as it drew closer to the end, Ifelt it was being dragged. I was just getting bored because it was basically watching DBZ where it just dragged on and on. I did find the ending a little disappointing. From starting out being amazing to the way it ended, it still kept you intrigued on what was going to happen next. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art designs were okay. Like if you watch, you noticed most of the characters have the same faces and same body structure other than the main characters that actually have a minor role. It does have a lot of moments where the art design is fantastic but I just wished they added more depth to the characters than just seeing the same faces over and over again. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe sound was good too. It flowed together well I just wished they didn't say Kanji-San so many times an episode. Trust me, you will be like really???? 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe main character Kanji, definitely stands out and I enjoyed his development and the thought processes to get passed his challenges he had to overcome. He had to go through a lot in this season and it's crazy to think where he started to the end. I found it enjoyable. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nNow there have been parts where I was excited and in joy to the victories but then I was angered and annoyed by the betrayal where I was like yooooo wtf??? But that was makes me enjoy it where I can get so into an anime to the point where I am pissed off at a character. So it definitely did a good job toying with my emotions like that. But I enjoyed up until the ending as I stated earlier just got boring and dragged on. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall it's a solid anime and I suggest it to anyone. But I feel that people will either love it or hate it after about 5-6 episodes. But give it a chance and maybe you will enjoy it.\\n",

            "content": "(Spoilers incoming) If you like engaging, binge-worthy, edge-of-your-seat shows, you'll love Kaiji.\r\nStory: 8/10. I found the motivations for Kaiji in this season to be stronger than those in Season 1, and it really helped establish Kaiji's character a bit more in this season while making all the risks he took seem organic and believable. There was an unbelievable sense of catharsis watching the show, perhaps one of the strongest I've felt in watching any sports anime (I consider Kaiji comparable to other anime of the sports genre despite gambling not being a sport persay). The story's nothing deep (win money and escape forced labor), butthat doesn't hold down the show at all. \\n\\n\r\nReally, the bulk of the story can be condensed into two situations: Kaiji escaping the underground and Kaiji reclaiming his freedom through the casino. I found the former situation somewhat underwhelming until its latter end, but I really enjoyed the second arc (famously known as the Pachinko arc). It's pretty much a consensus that the arc dragged on immensely, basically taking up more than half of the runtime of the show. However, I never felt bored watching it; ever episode introduced a twist or a new obstacle, and throughout we see the fruits of Kaiji and friends' labors as their plan to win is revealed bit by bit. It was a great balance of immersion and strategy, the latter of which is fairly impressive since you'd never expect a thorough strategy in gambling. Kaiji definitely exhibits a sort of innovation in this way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10. I really like the unique art style of Kaiji, some say it's weird but I like the unique take. Everything is bright and vibrant and this worked wonders when we actually got to the casino setting, since the color scheme + art style really brought more life to the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. Not being a fan of Season 1's music, I was pretty surprised to see how good the OST is here. Season 2 really outdid themselves compared to Season 1, the tracks have an intensity and rhythm absent in Season 1's tracks. There are a few unmemorable (or in my opinion just plain bad) tracks, but they're few and far between (I didn't like the ending song at all). All in all, each OST is unique and plays at the exact right time to up the intensity/drama of the moment\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. You're not gonna find deep characters in Kaiji, but the characters we do get are good enough at serving their purpose and having a strong individual persona. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10+/10. Despite the slow start, once things picked up I found myself binging the show within 3 days. While the last arc did drag out A TON, I never felt bored because of the twists they introduced and how the dynamics shifted in organic ways, which kept me wanting to see more. As I mentioned prior, the catharsis is real; there were moments I jumped for joy when Kaiji had a success. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. I was iffy on giving Season 1 a 9/10, but here I'm convinced the show deserves it. From start to finish I was immersed, and I enjoyed the show too much to not be able to recommend it. It's ridiculous but genius. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, the pros and cons of the show for me are:\\n\\n\r\n+great to binge\\n\r\n+engaging start to finish \\n\r\n+interesting scenarios and clever innovation within those scenarios\\n\r\n+likeable, distinct characters\\n\r\n+intense and unpredictable\\n\r\n-dragged out latter episodes might turn you off \\n\r\n-open ending + some loose ends from prior season not handled. If you expected Hyoudo to be relevant in this arc he doesn't play a significant role at all. And with no Season 3 and with the anime being 7 years old, I'm afraid we might not see this ever unless you're a manga reader (I'm not so I don't know if these conflicts are resolved in the manga).\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It started off well and I really enjoyed it up until later on in the series on the second arc. i wont spoil anything but it dragged on way longer than it needed to. it was like the story board artist gave up and just rinse and repeat the same premise of the last episodes until it ended. I was ready tojust drop the anime and move on, but I pushed through it. The ending was not as satisfying as it would have been if the story board artist did a well enough job but I am not blaming them at all. I guess it is hard for them to make a 26 episode long anime with little source material so I gave it a pass.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Guy gets put in shitty situations\\n\\n\r\nThe way they portrayed it gives it a 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nArt: I think nothing is wrong with the art style\\n\\n\r\nIt was good 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: ...\\n\\n\r\nZAWA ZAWa ZAwa Zawa zawa 5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Showed us how shitty people can be\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Up until episode 19 was pretty good\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nOverall: It was a good intense show but because of the drawn out episodes\\n\\n\r\nI have to give it a 8/10\\n",

I saw both seasons in two sittings, and the second one finished at 4am leaving me with my eyes almost burnt out and my head throbbing in pain from watching so much all at the same time. It's a captivating tragedy, I literally couldn't bring myself to stop because I got so sucked in. Most great shows have lots of small lessons in them with many things happening at once. Kaiji is focused entirely on Kaiji himself andhis addiction to gambling. So few events within each episode, and yet the emotional pull is incredibly strong. The show has this real grounded, down to Earth feeling, everyone felt the feelings expressed in this show. The villians could be just like your boss at work. The friends Kaiji gained are like your friends you go to after punching out at work. The shit that piles on Kaiji is not dissimilar to how I feel when I get bills in the mail. Kaiji reflects adult life, it's cruel, cold nature, but also it's pockets of happiness between.\\n\r\nI would not watch this if you're feeling depressed, but if you're looking for a good drama or just something mature I highly, highly recommend.",

Season 1 was just amazing, keeps you thinking and surprises you with the twisted outcomes. In Season 2 Kaiji has done it again, each episode keeps getting better and better makes you at the edge of your seat hunger to know whats will happen next. \r\nIf your a fan of Psychological thrillers such as Death note or Liar game, Kaiji is a must watchfor you. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The story continues after the incidents from season 1, Kaiji has been taken to work in an underground facility to work in hard labor so he can pay off his debt, however he then finds out that there is a dark side inside the underground which is ofcourse \"GAMBLE!!\" he now will risk it all again so he can leave the underground and pay off his giant debt. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I can tell the art is better than Season 1, the characters are now more detailed and shows how they changed since the previous season. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtracks in Kaiji season 2 are amazing, it keeps you hyper in every moment, as for the opening and ending I personally loved them as I am a fan of Techno metal and pop rock. And yes we get more ZAWA ZAWA !!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: As I said the characters have changed since the last season, there are new rivals and new friends. Men risking their lives to get out of this miserable life and there are men who plan to ruin their dreams of escaping. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I assure you this the enjoyment of this show is VERY ADDICTING \\n\r\nit will keep you thinking what will happen next and keep searching for clues in the site/forums. As I said before if you enjoyed Death note or Liar game or any Psychological thriller show. Kaiji will MAGNET your emotions!!\\n\\n\r\nI really hope I did great as a first time doing a review, Please enjoy the show!\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and enjoy the show ^.^",

Well, I got just the fix!\r\nZAWA ZAWA ZAWA ZAWA ZAWA\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nYou'd think the novelty of high gambling will be dull after 26 episodes right? But Kaiji's sequel not only delivers yet again but surpasses expectations! But it's not all a win. The story pits Kaiji into an underground camp as a slave laborer in order to pay off his debts. As in typical Kaiji fashion, it's not all as it seems. As Kaiji butts headswith his 1st antagonists and the 1st story arc deals with the struggle of who'll come out on top. The script delivers yet again with the stakes matching the given level of risk. The psychological element is still there but it's safe to say that season 2 leans more towards who can cheat the best than actual strategy.\\n\r\n   The second arc continues the trend of who's the better cheater, showing a natural flow from one arc to another. However, there's a reason the story doesn't get a 10/10 and that will become apparent as soon as you reach the 2nd half. The challenge is a 1/1000,000,000 high gamble game of pachinko. And unlike season 1, where arcs were resolved within 6-7 episodes, the final arc will have you yelling \"FUCKIN WIN ALREADY!\"  at your monitor, as it's apparent that it's being stretched to reach it's desired 26 episode mark. The ending also remains open-ended.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNever since the Death Note potato chip eating scene has scenes about mundane tasks get the blood pumping!\\n\\n\r\nIt's Madhouse, it should go without saying that they always deliver. The ugly yet appealing character designs are as bold and GAR as ever! There's also a clear improvement of the facial features. Giving the over the top look of joy or anguish when necessary. The visual metaphors also added a much-needed flare for a show with no real physical action. You know, the whole \"if Kaiji is winning, he's grasping the universe\" or \"if he's losing he's sinking into a swamp\" that kinda thing. Although it can become unnecessary at times, done only to extend the episode run time. Nerveless, if you like the blood rush of this series then it'll do the job!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nZAWA ZAWA ZAWAAA\\n\\n\r\nThe sound also keeps stride. The attention to detail is apparent, from the hissing sound of an air current to the crackling of dice in a bowl. The soundtrack is also well synchronized in scenes when needed. Especially noteworthy during the symbolic visual cues throughout the show. and who can forget the 'ZAWA ZAWA ZAWA' lol\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKaiji radiates so much GAR that Kenshiro will nod in approval. He's also slightly developed as well, as his methods for winning become more cutthroat than from season 1.  That doesn't mean he changed, in fact, he still trusts others too easily right up to the very end. A point even brought up by a character later on. But unlike other MCs, Kaiji's flaws are apparent and in the same process makes him feel more human. He struggles, he cares, he deceives and ultimately he learns. \\n\r\nall the antagonists are over the top, and I'm talking about your Saturday morning cartoons kinda evil. But given the fact that the entire show runs on testosterone and MANLY MANPOWER it's to be expected. In fact, I would say this elevates the show more than hindering it. Making the already suspenseful roller coaster ride that more enjoyable. \\n\r\nHell, even the narrator exudes MANLY MANPOWER.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nVery little shows manage to hook me from beginning to end. Kaiji 2 became just as addicting as gambling itself as I found myself marathoning it without stop. This was an exhilarating thrill ride that brought my GAR meter back to stable conditions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of manly men doing insanely manly shit and psychological mind games then this is the anime for you. But be warned, once you start there's no stopping it!\\n",

            "content": "Kaiji season 2 offers a solid conclusion to the anime series however the series itself is a decrease in quality from season 1 Kaiji Ultimate Survivor.\r\nTaking place a few months after the first arc, Kaiji is taken underground to pay his debt by manual labor which will take him around 15 years to complete his sentence. After a few months later, Kaiji is then allowed to be outside for a few days in which he hears about a casino with the infamous pachinko game \"The Bog\" which if Kaiji wins can pay off his entire debt.\r\nThe differences in this season being the 3rd series ofthe Kaiji manga include the lack of psychological thrills & games revolving around quick cunning & dangerous high stakes. This part only features a total of 2 games while the first part consisted of 4, plus the gambles in series 2 revolve around luck rather than strategy. \\n\\n\r\nBenefits of Kaiji 2 include Kaiji himself as we see more of his intellect & role as a leader who never abandons hope. Aside from the main lead, the only other highlight would be the ending of the series as it brings a satisfying conclusion leading to its series 4 of the manga. Despite the lack of horrifying tension & the tragic moments in the first season, Kaiji does remain to have its feels & teary-eye moments. While it's not as complex in morality issues as the first series it is still well written & well directed.\\n\\n\r\nCons of Kaiji 2 mainly belong to its final arc as it is too long as it is a total of 18 episodes; more than half of the season. Essentially The Bog pachinko consists of Kaiji winning his freedom but it is a necessary arc & is handled mostly well. The beginning of The Bog starts off nicely & progresses smoothly with little to no problem, however the cons begin to show at episode 16 when Kaiji plays the bog for 9 episodes straight. While some scenes within those episodes are crucial to the story, I found myself skimming through the episode as it felt very dragged & repetitive. It would have benefited at least being half of the amount. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Kaiji 2 is weaker in story in its first season & may have been a better series if it's Bog game was shorter. It definitely offers some good moments & great character writing but in terms of content it does lack a lot of areas done in the 1st season mainly its creative games & journey into the evils of men. Kaiji 2 instead focuses on classic Japanese gambling & a struggling journey towards freedom.",

I usually like psychological thriller, \"Main character being super smart pwning everybody\" kind of anime but this is my favorite one out there.\r\nOne out was mediocre, liar game got boring midway through, death note was really good but... There's just something about this series that tops all those anime and manga.\r\nI saw the first season like 4 years ago and it's still on my mind.\r\nAnyway WATCH THE FIRST ONE if you haven't GO NOW!\r\nIt might get youa little down after watching a few eps cause it deals with somethings that aren't very pleasant to think about... There's good and bad in this world but I believe that you need to know both sides as much as you can to get a clearer picture of everything.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime kind of changed my viewpoints in the way I look at life, and it doesn't seem like a coincidence because at the time I was transfixed in dystopian novels like 1984, Brave new world, farenheit 451 etc.\\n\\n\r\nNot all the things that happen in this anime is \"real\" but the philosophy, in my opinion rings very true to some of the things I've seen in society.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is... for the people that aren't innocent anymore, but value those innocent values of fairness, love, justice and want to protect them.\\n\r\nWatch if your interested in psychology, and want to protect yourself from losing completely to seemingly innocent assholes who try to take your freedom from you.\\n\\n\r\nAlso watch if you know what I am talking about.",

Now what l like to say about the firsthalf of season 2 it has a lot of suspense to it rivals the first season's   and the antagonist in  both half's are great  the problem is with the a second half the bourge arc. Which is basically impossible pachinko   each episode does drag on with this arc.  And makes the  show irritating to sit through you will be there yelling at your screen is kaiji gonna fucking win or not. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation  8/10  It's madhouse madhouse does some amazing amazing animation with their shows.  Sure the weird character designs are still there but l won't take a point  of as its part of the shows style. The animation  does have a few problems near the end but the animation with the characters reactions when  they are in  peril is fantastic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 The sound probably the weakest part of the show. But its not bad at all the opening is fucking fantastic even though it is screamo the ending sucks it just flat outright sucks \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n it doesn't suit the tone of the show at all and just takes you out of the experience. \\n\r\n The ost though is nice the iconic zara zara is there when something is  not going kaiji's way or if its just a bad situation in general.  Characters 9/10  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOur fantastic protagonist kaiji is back while he is still  a bit of a mean spirited person  the development from season 1 he has extremely pure goals and  pretty much putting his life on the line against impossible odds. \\n\\n\r\n Sometimes not always winning in the end and adding more despair and tension to the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters and the villains are also unique the villains are evil evil fucking people and you just want something really awful to happen to them at the end of it.  and the sides especially kaiji's friends being a great bunch of unlucky people. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe show had me on the edge of my seat most of the time more in the second half as it had way more build up then the first half. But still weaker in general. \\n\\n\r\nl really enjoyed the second season of  kaiji even though l didn't like it as much as the first season and the resolution is a bit too open ended for my tastes. \\n\r\nOverall 8/10  Kaiji's second season is something you should definitely see if you loved the first season. \\n\\n\r\n But the second half may  frustrate you imagine how the people who watched this shows airing right fuck that must have been awful anyway thanks for reading my review.",

            "content": "This series is pretty suspenseful and will give you a similar type of enjoyment to the first series, but I gotta say it's not as good. \r\nFirst off, Kaiji 2 is not a psychological battle. It also doesn't have much philosophy in it. It vaguely contains that sorta stuff, but it's really faint. I loved the first series of Kaiji so much for the constant risks, trust, betrayal, scams, elaborate schemes, exposure of human emotions, putting human character into question, and Tonegawa's philosophical speeches. Kaiji 2 doesn't really have such concepts in it. Both of his gambles are pretty much won simply with logic andcareful planning; the goal is to scam the scammer. This isn't a bad thing, but it wasn't as exciting as it could've been, or maybe I'm just being unfair since I thought the first season's way of doing things was much better. \\n\\n\r\nKaiji has good morals and it's interesting to see a good person thrown into a setting where being good is merely mocked, considered foolish, and makes everything much harder. Most anime will reward the hero for his good behaviour, but Kaiji must struggle due to his ideals, which is pretty realistic.\\n\r\nOnce again, Kaiji teams up with fellow losers and demonstrates good leadership. His devotion is pretty touching. He's just a pretty great character. \\n\\n\r\nOne big problem with this series is how long things are dragged out for. It's not as fast paced as the first series or even most other anime... The second half of the series is particularly bad about that; the animation gets very repetitive... The crowd cheering, the pachinko balls flying around in the Bog, and the balls circling around the dishes. The pachinko balls and Bog are done in 3D, which is pretty boring and unappealing to me. It goes on and it goes on, each episode contains one realization/plot twist. \\n\r\nHe's gonna win! Go, yeah! It's on the second plate! He's gonna lose. What a fool he was, now he's screwed. He's gonna win! This is it, nothing can hold him back now! Time to kick some ass! He's gonna lose. Agh, it's all hopeless! Or is it?\\n\r\nThey could've shortened that stuff down a bit. I know the manga drags it out just as long, but I think it would've been nice if the animation studio decided to add a little filler arc... though that would've proved challenging with Kaiji's situation, I'm sure they could've found a way to do it without ruining the existing story/plot. It could've just been 2 or 3 episodes of some different kind of gamble, anything to shorten down all that time wasted watching pachinko balls rolling around. For example, if they started the series in a different way even if that would've taken away from the shock of Kaiji being sent underground immediately. He could've lost some other gamble and been found by Teiai due to that or something... \\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, this is good overall, but not a masterpiece. It's suspenseful and exciting, but not as much as it could've been. You'll probably like it if you liked the first series, but you might feel something's missing or that it's drawn out.",

Kaiji's chances of wininng are like watching someone with bipolar, up, down, up, down... every single episode, just so they can stretch the seriesout to 26 episodes.

The big final gamble ofthe series which starts around halfway the season and goes on all the way to the end. and every episode from this point on consists of only 2 things. 10% of the episode is dedicated to the next \"cheat\" our pro-/antagonist uses to counter the other. and the other 90% is showing their emotional reaction to either achieving or getting denied their goal. \\n\\n\r\nYou can do this for...3...maybe 5 episode since were talking \"final boss\" in this case. but anything beyond that just makes most of the episode feel like padding. and geez 12 episodes of padding was a frustrating sit. it's not a good thing when I'm yelling \"GET ON WITH IT\" at my screen. accompanied by skipping trough large portions of the latter episodes without missing ANYTHING important.\\n\\n\r\nI'll go as far as saying this season could easily have been 12 episodes long it was re-cut correctly, while still have enough room to build tension without feeling rushed",

            "content": "The 2nd season of Kaiji is not as impressive as the first season. It still has some of the same elements that made the first season so successful and so addicting, yet it falls short in other areas.\r\nThe story continues from the events that took place at the end of season 1. The first arc is decent. The second and final arc is sluggish and it becomes apparent that it is forcefully dragged out to fill 26 episodes. It makes you question what is more impressive, Kaiji's ingenuity to overcome difficulties or the developers' ability to stretch one pachinko session for half of the season.One way or the other, it becomes very tiring and repetitive towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nAnother of the main issues why this season is not as impressive lies with the antagonists: Unlike the well-crafted personalities of the antagonists in the prequel with their philosophy and reasoning behind their actions, in this season the antagonists are an extremely degraded version and the typical ignorant fools that exist only to make things happen, but without really leaving an impact. The first season was a battle of minds and concepts between Kaiji and the \"villains\". This season is essentially a race of Kaiji against the clock as you can feel it from miles away that it is only a matter of time before Kaiji wins, the only question is how. \\n\\n\r\nThere is another distinct change in this season: Unlike in first season where Kaiji was more reactive towards the things happening and he was using his ingenuity to adapt on the spur of the moment, in this sequel Kaiji is more proactive and makes his plans before he acts. It is interesting to see that change in Kaiji and him becoming more strategic, but it is certainly not as impressive and intense as being the man of the eleventh hour. Due to that, in this second season everything feels rather pre-determined unlike the surprise factors of season 1.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is much more refined and detailed this time around. The sound remains average, it still gets the job done but nothing really memorable at the end of the day. The \"zawa\" sound becomes annoying after a while due to it being overused. The narrator retains the same level of epicness as in first season, maybe even more actually, which is a very positive thing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, an enjoyable sequel and an interesting watch, but do not expect the awesomeness of the first season.",

            "content": "(This review is only helpful if you have seen the first season)\r\nI am writing this review to give people the perspective of someone whose favorite anime of all-time is Kaiji, yet was severely disappointed in Hairoku Hen. While Kaiji was a fast-paced rollercoaster, Hairoku Hen is the teacup ride at Disney Land. It's unfair to to compare the second season to the first- usually. In Kaiji's case however I deem it necessary.\r\nThe first arc of Hairoku Hen is excellent, and had my hopes soaring high for the rest of the season. The pace was fast, the art is still Kaiji art so it's awesome, andit was pretty intense.\\n\\n\r\nHowever my biggest complaint with Hairoku Hen comes in the second and final arc, The Bog.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bog is a pachinko machine that is essentially rigged so no one can win. Kaiji soon realizes this and puts his head to the test in trying to beat this unbeatable machine. This would all be awesome if it the arc was around 8 episodes, like the first, leaving a super intense climactic final arc to finish the series off. But nope, The Bog arc starts at around episode 8 where the first arc left off, and drags on until all 26 episodes are complete. Some episodes are literally so tedious to watch I considered dropping the series, while some were actually mildly entertaining. The pace does pick back up when there's like 3 episodes to go but by this point I was so tired of The Bog that I didn't care as much as I could have. While this paragraph goes in depth on my only real gripe with Hairoku Hen, it is a big one as like 10 episodes out of 26 weren't very entertaining, and you can't really call it thematic pacing because from the beginning you know Kaiji is going to win as he always does.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, sound, story, etc are all great like the first season. It's just Hairoku Hen stumbled all over itself while Kaiji broke the speed limit.",

            "content": "I take it that the people who are going to watch this have already watched the first season. I am going to try to base my review on that. So basically we once again meet with Kaiji. As always he is broke. He once again is put to a test. The first part of the series concentrates in a another place (that I won't mention so there aren't any spoilers), but basically he has to gamble once more. To be honest the reason I think this season is better is since Kaiji has become more and more of a hero. Even though theflow of the series moves rather slow (there wasn't enough material in my opinion for 26 episodes), but Kaiji now more resembles a figure that I myself would admire. He is more dependable. The art is as always interesting. When I rate the art I don't rate it for style but more like the way everything is showcased. I just love how the scenes change and how the characters react. Emotions are just flowing and you can just feel the adrenaline. I found myself being on the edge numerous times. So in a way you get emottionaly attached. This gambling, gambling in Kaiji's way is something unique. The series is also \"anti-moe\", meaning there are now women (well only one to be exact and she is well special in her own way). This anime will keep you on the edge. I would recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "To keep it brief: \r\nThe first season of Kaiji was a fantastic gambling anime, with the exception of the bridge crossing, but the character driven drama made even that lull in the tactical aspect of the anime enjoyable. \r\nHowever, this season went a bit overboard with how slow some games are drawn out for, in particular, Kaiji vs the Bog goes on for an excruciatingly long number of episodes, and debatably it's long enough to diffuse tension, which is the opposite of the goal. \r\nAnother recurring problem was the narrator and characters repeating some phrase upwards of three times for emphasis. Though this in itselfis an innocuous, effective technique, I felt as if it were slightly overused in this season, which ultimately pulled me out of the experience whenever it happened.\\n\\n\r\nThe final problem I had with Kaiji - Against All Rules, is they changed something that made season one very enjoyable. Though watching the characters come up with strategies and ways to combat the other person cheating, the real joy is from realising all the information needed to figure out the same strategies were shown to us. This however, does not happen in the last stand off this season. There is a moment where Kaiji overhears something in a bar that becomes crucial to his plan that is not revealed to us until many episodes later, exactly when that piece of information became important. Although it is a common theme for mysteries to withhold tiny bits of information until the big reveal, it is unfortunate that Kaiji does not stick to the old formula where everything is revealed to us beforehand. \\n\\n\r\nCriticism aside, this was still an enjoyable anime and the character animation was done very well, succeeding in invoking fear and relief in the audience. Definitely worth giving it a watch.",

            "content": "NOT Spoiler free. You have been warned!\r\nAfter such an amazing first season, how does the second one hold up.\r\nWe enter the second season of Kaiji to find Kaiji down on his luck. He still has a huge debt hanging over him and he spends a lot of time gambling still, trying to win as much money as possible. We then find Endou, who's complaining about his latest job, which is finding and bring in Kaiji.\r\nTurns out it's really easy because he find Kaiji almost right away, Kaiji notices Endou and instantly starts asking to go into another survival game saying this time he knows hecan win for sure since he was so close last time, however he is knocked out and taken to the underground hell that was touched on only a little in the first season.\\n\r\nThe second season has only two arcs really, the first being playing chichiro in the underground and then Kaiji getting a small parole time and playing an extreme version of pachinko on a machine called the bog, which is beaten gives an extreme payout.\\n\r\nThe story this time isn't nearly as good as the first season, the chinchiro is pretty entertaining and has some interesting tactics but overall it's not nearly as well written or complex as the first season, there's just way too much restrictions now, he's in the underground and when it comes down to it, it really is just chinchiro, there's no extra element to it really.\\n\r\nThe pachinko arc also has some interesting strategies, the bog is so broken that the only way to win is to cheat your way through it, the various ways that Kaiji counters the bogs defences are interesting but the main issue is that the pachinko arc can be so slow. They must of had way more episodes then they knew what to do with cause while the same amount of episodes did like 3-4 arcs in the first season there's only 2 here. The start and most of the pachinko arc is actually really enjoyable and whole not as good as the first season it's still really good. But it starts to drag real bad and it stays that way for a fair while and then once all is said and done the last two episodes are also a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nKaiji is so much more relatable now then in the first season, due to Kaiji advanced thinking and crazy schemes the first season defiantly made him cool but unrelatable, it was a joy to watch but Kaiji is more relatable now which is both a good and a bad thing. Very early on he caves into the underground a temptation of beer and snacks that they can buy with money exclusive to the underground, the money can also be used to buy one day pass\u2019 to the outside world though and so that's what Kaiji wants to age up for.\\n\r\nBut as I said he caves in and we even see these scenes of him trying to justify it to himself. Stuff like how if he saves all the money he will have enough by six months but he will also have some left over, so he can use the leftover money for beer and snacks. Later he then starts saying that he can just wait for seven months to get the outside pass and he keeps pushing it back and making excuses.\\n\r\nThis is me all the time, I do the same kind of thing with my money and I also hate myself for it once all is said and done so watching this gave me a little chuckle but I totally felt for Kaiji as he tried to fight temptation and once he failed kept trying to justify it he exact same way I always try to justify myself.\\n\r\nHowever Kaiji being more human and normal also has its issues, toward the end things get real bleak and Kaiji out of nowhere becomes a real coward, he has extreme fear of losing which is fair but he straight up cries and tries to ask for a draw, this is something that season 1 Kaiji never did. No matter how bad the situation got Kaiji would just think up a new plan and try his best to escape the situation but new Kaiji breaks down way more easily. Plus even when Kaiji is going to win it's not some epic situation where he's got a smug look on his face and his filled with confidence. But his crying and yelling in basically relief, I get it,  do but season 1 Kaiji was just much different to how he acts now.\\n\r\nOverall Kaiji still has some crazy tactics but he also makes a few mistakes and fails to see things as well as he use to, he definitely is still able to pull off some crazy stuff but it doesn't seem as cool. This change has its good and it's bad so overall I'd say that if I were to give just Kaiji a rating it would be about the same as season 1 Kaiji but just for different reasons.\\n\\n\r\nEndou actually has a surprisingly large amount of importance this time. We see him at the start of course but since Kaiji is underground for the first arc we don't see him till the second arc and even then we don't see him right way. First Kaiji goes along with a gambler named Sakazaki and tried to help him best the bog, however once this fails and Kaiji takes over trying to come up with his own plan he decides to try and get some help from Endou, since he needs more funds and someone with the kind of connections that Endou has. \\n\r\nEndou is also facing large amounts of debt and is going to be in serious trouble if he can't pay it back and there is even the risk of being sent to the underground. Once some interest is worked out and the division of the jackpot is worked out he decided to help out despite thinking there's only a 50% chance of winning.\\n\r\nEndou doesn't really do too much outside of this, once Kaijis attack on the bog begins there's only really two characters that matter. However I still like Endou being included, he defiantly ads some extra dynamics and seeing how his situations has changed overall is rather interesting and in the end he ends up taking a ton of kaijis share of the money since Endou loaded more money to Kaiji in a dire situation and thus Kaiji signed without looking, because of this the interest was absolutely insane.\\n\r\nEndou is a massive dick but he was needed and I liked him being there since he still worked for the enemy and all.\\n\\n\r\nI also mentioned someone named Sakazaki, this is an old man who works as a night guard. He has a wife and daughter but they left him due to his financial issues, he wants to beat the bog so he can buy a house and show his family that he is reliable and win them back into his life, however his a hopeless gambler. Kaiji and Sakazaki meet shorty after Kaiji is out and Sakazaki shows Kaiji the bog and explains its massive payout, he asks Kaiji for help in besting it and offers a share of the money to him if they win. However the plan fails and Sakazaki falls into despair, he stole money from his boss in order to get more chances at the bog and now he's gonna be in serious trouble if his boss finds out.\\n\r\nOnce his plan fails Kaiji takes control and tries to figure out a plan for beating the bog and he does, he thinks up ways to break down the bogs defences and then has Sakazaki help him with the win.\\n\r\nSakazaki actually plays a very critical role in the plan overall and is definitely needed. Plus his the whole reason the second arc even really happens. However the show doesn't forget what it's characters are for and makes sure to use him to show greed and how horrible humans can really be. Sakazaki releases on Kaiji so much and takes extreme risks to help him out and then as soon as Kaiji loses a chunk of his share to Endou, Sakazaki goes to make a quick escape saying \u2018I better go before he starts begging to take some of my share.\u2019 Once again showing what the first season really focused on, it's nice that it here in Sakazaki even if the that point isn't really there much at all.\\n\\n\r\nLastly there's Ichijou the main antagonist, he is the manager of the casino with the bog, the casino is also run by the Teiai Corporation, so Kaiji once again is still fighting them. Ichijou can basically be considered the third in command, he is he favorite manager of tonegawa\u2019s replacement so it basically puts him in third place and he claims that once the head dies off he will defiantly be made the second in command.\\n\r\nIchijou is extremely prideful however his pride and cockiness are his downfall as he fails to see what's going on and is way to lax with letting Kaiji get into a winning position, he keeps thinking he's in the lead and thus turns down potentially outlets and doesn't stay on the defensive enough.\\n\r\nIchijou is also a straight up Cheater, he has multiple devices that he can use to activate more defenses for the bog. Stuff like a sensor that facts a set of flipper making it impossible for any balls to get near the jackpot. Ichijou goes in and out of his confidence, the situation and how likely Kaiji is to win changes a lot and ichijou actually helps Kaiji to win and destroys his own defences in the end.\\n\r\nIchijou was an interesting enough antagonist, he has some clear if not very basic goals and motivation, he definitely is cocky and overconfident to the point of self destruction just like how in the first season tonegawa does the same thing, he lost because of how advanced of a thinker he was. And now ichijou loses because of how much manipulation of the bog he had at his disposal.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters are a whole lot better this time, last time they weren't really focused on that much since it was more about people in general, plus the first season is just full of death, people die so much in that. Now each characters is given motivations and they stay around for the whole thing and don't just die off, there's also a much bigger range with Endou being on kaijis side, Sakazaki actually living through it unlike ishida from last time and the villain is also just a lot more fleshed out and also has a lot more to fear, tonegawa only wanted to win because he was scared of losing his position and the boss. \\n\r\nHowever ichijou is going to have to go underground to make back his extreme loses if Kaiji wins the jackpot, plus he hasn't even got to his second position yet, his just shy of getting there, he was so close but didn't get there when he feel. Tonegawa at least got to enjoy his position for a long time before it was taken away. Overall I just felt for them more and liked the lot of them more.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is the same as last time, I still love the bold outlines on everything and it's still got insane metaphor imagery which is a lot of fun to watch as it's way more over the top then it needs to be. However like I said the show drags a lot and so I did start to get tired of seeing some similar or same metaphor imagery used. Plus a lot of the shots used for the pachinko machine showing the balls doing something was reused a lot and that slightly annoyed me. Plus Kaiji is so desperate to win that his crying a lot, all the people watching him are cause they want him to win as it will show them that any loser has hope. Sakazaki and Endou want him to win just as much as Kaiji wants to himself so they also have tears and whenever ichijou is scared of losing he als has intense tears.\\n\r\nThe tears are way too intense for me, there think and really runny and apparently endless, the just flow out of Kaiji endlessly for the like the last 4 episodes, it's a bit too much and I did start to despise it towards the end, it just get a bit too much.\\n\r\nOnce again the voice acting was done well, absolutely no issues there. \\n\r\nEveryone was cast well and did an excellent job, although I have my issues with the narrator. He's always there, sure he was always there in the first season but he just annoys me this time, it's mainly because of how much the show drags this time, he ends up repeating a lot of the same stuff and his voice just gets real stale as it always the same tone unlike everyone else who has changes in there voice to match there emotion obviously. But the narrator's endless presence and lack of emotion makes him really stale real fast and I just wanted him to shut up towards the end.\\n\r\nThe sound is questionable, while there's is the good old ZUWA ZUWA, I feel it's used a bit too much this time around, towards the end it kinda lost its meaning and it felt like it was just thrown in there whenever, the background music is fine but it's mostly bland plus the can't hear it over the sounds of pachinko.\\n\r\nIt's very likely not many of you had been in at a pachinko arcade before or played real pachinko, I have and the show defiantly nails what it sounds like, the balls endlessly clicking and clacking around. But it's a pain to hear especially as this arc drags on and it is just always in the background, it's not too bad early on and it's really good that they nailed it, but it's too perfect. Which gets on my nerves, while I shouldn't get mad at the show for this since they just made it accurate, but this is based off my enjoyment dammit and this did hamper it to a degree.\\n\r\nThe opening is great, I absolutely love it's high energy rock and high volume. It's very intense and strong and I love it, I also found myself head banging to the start of it almost every single episode. The ED is alright in terms of music but my god is it creepy and whenever I was watching in a public place like my uni I just felt slightly awkward and really hoped that no one would see since it's just a little intense. But it works and it didn't really make me like it less.\\n\\n\r\nI liked Kaiji I really did, the second season was a really good watch and if you liked the first one then there's no reason why you should dislike this one. It's not as good but it's still really good and in the same vain as the first season. However it also has better characters and the presentation is kind of a mixed bag of better and worse but overall I'd still rather watch the first season rathern then this. Towards the end I slowed down on watching this and I definitely wasn't enjoying it as much as this review would make you believe, but the overall enjoyment was high for me and the final episode is really good, I like it a lot so they was a worthy payoff for me which made the final slog worth it. I kinda keep going back and forth here but that's because I want you to really know what i find good and what I find bad and the reasons for it. Also no matter what way I look at it I have very conflicted feelings about this show and what was worth it and what wasn't. Most of its issued can come back to it dragging on for way more then it needs, it's to build tension and make for a big payoff with its great end but it causes more issues then things it helps, either way it's still a very good show.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind guys I have to Kaiji: against all rules 7/10.\\n",

Seriously, the history can conquer you with unthinkable ways, at first, the art isn't pleasurable, but the bad luck and some kind of miracle keeps you watching and wishing that everything goes all right.\r\nKaiji teachs you to never give up, to believe in friendship, and that you're more broke than you think! \r\nIt's funny, it's lovin and makes you pull all your hair from your head. I need other anime like this, please God, send me something like this!!!\r\nI recommend it for all the people that like games,and are masoquist (it's a joke) :D",

            "content": "My first review ^_^\r\nOkay so I go to a website I always go to for Anime and my friend and I every month choose a random anime. Go to number Generator and it chooses our letter and which anime. Anyway this one came up. \r\nStory:\r\nI found the story very interesting. I haven't actually seen anything like this (I don't really watch anime as much as I used to) and it caught my attention. The first few episodes is where it shined the most to me. It was very unexpected and it was very well played out. However as it drew closer to the end, Ifelt it was being dragged. I was just getting bored because it was basically watching DBZ where it just dragged on and on. I did find the ending a little disappointing. From starting out being amazing to the way it ended, it still kept you intrigued on what was going to happen next. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art designs were okay. Like if you watch, you noticed most of the characters have the same faces and same body structure other than the main characters that actually have a minor role. It does have a lot of moments where the art design is fantastic but I just wished they added more depth to the characters than just seeing the same faces over and over again. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe sound was good too. It flowed together well I just wished they didn't say Kanji-San so many times an episode. Trust me, you will be like really???? 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe main character Kanji, definitely stands out and I enjoyed his development and the thought processes to get passed his challenges he had to overcome. He had to go through a lot in this season and it's crazy to think where he started to the end. I found it enjoyable. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nNow there have been parts where I was excited and in joy to the victories but then I was angered and annoyed by the betrayal where I was like yooooo wtf??? But that was makes me enjoy it where I can get so into an anime to the point where I am pissed off at a character. So it definitely did a good job toying with my emotions like that. But I enjoyed up until the ending as I stated earlier just got boring and dragged on. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall it's a solid anime and I suggest it to anyone. But I feel that people will either love it or hate it after about 5-6 episodes. But give it a chance and maybe you will enjoy it.\\n",

            "content": "(Spoilers incoming) If you like engaging, binge-worthy, edge-of-your-seat shows, you'll love Kaiji.\r\nStory: 8/10. I found the motivations for Kaiji in this season to be stronger than those in Season 1, and it really helped establish Kaiji's character a bit more in this season while making all the risks he took seem organic and believable. There was an unbelievable sense of catharsis watching the show, perhaps one of the strongest I've felt in watching any sports anime (I consider Kaiji comparable to other anime of the sports genre despite gambling not being a sport persay). The story's nothing deep (win money and escape forced labor), butthat doesn't hold down the show at all. \\n\\n\r\nReally, the bulk of the story can be condensed into two situations: Kaiji escaping the underground and Kaiji reclaiming his freedom through the casino. I found the former situation somewhat underwhelming until its latter end, but I really enjoyed the second arc (famously known as the Pachinko arc). It's pretty much a consensus that the arc dragged on immensely, basically taking up more than half of the runtime of the show. However, I never felt bored watching it; ever episode introduced a twist or a new obstacle, and throughout we see the fruits of Kaiji and friends' labors as their plan to win is revealed bit by bit. It was a great balance of immersion and strategy, the latter of which is fairly impressive since you'd never expect a thorough strategy in gambling. Kaiji definitely exhibits a sort of innovation in this way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10. I really like the unique art style of Kaiji, some say it's weird but I like the unique take. Everything is bright and vibrant and this worked wonders when we actually got to the casino setting, since the color scheme + art style really brought more life to the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. Not being a fan of Season 1's music, I was pretty surprised to see how good the OST is here. Season 2 really outdid themselves compared to Season 1, the tracks have an intensity and rhythm absent in Season 1's tracks. There are a few unmemorable (or in my opinion just plain bad) tracks, but they're few and far between (I didn't like the ending song at all). All in all, each OST is unique and plays at the exact right time to up the intensity/drama of the moment\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. You're not gonna find deep characters in Kaiji, but the characters we do get are good enough at serving their purpose and having a strong individual persona. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10+/10. Despite the slow start, once things picked up I found myself binging the show within 3 days. While the last arc did drag out A TON, I never felt bored because of the twists they introduced and how the dynamics shifted in organic ways, which kept me wanting to see more. As I mentioned prior, the catharsis is real; there were moments I jumped for joy when Kaiji had a success. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. I was iffy on giving Season 1 a 9/10, but here I'm convinced the show deserves it. From start to finish I was immersed, and I enjoyed the show too much to not be able to recommend it. It's ridiculous but genius. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, the pros and cons of the show for me are:\\n\\n\r\n+great to binge\\n\r\n+engaging start to finish \\n\r\n+interesting scenarios and clever innovation within those scenarios\\n\r\n+likeable, distinct characters\\n\r\n+intense and unpredictable\\n\r\n-dragged out latter episodes might turn you off \\n\r\n-open ending + some loose ends from prior season not handled. If you expected Hyoudo to be relevant in this arc he doesn't play a significant role at all. And with no Season 3 and with the anime being 7 years old, I'm afraid we might not see this ever unless you're a manga reader (I'm not so I don't know if these conflicts are resolved in the manga).\\n\\n\\n\\n",

(Zawa)\r\nI was all aboard the first season of kaiji that i binged watch it in about two days so I had high expectations for this season as well. It started off well and I really enjoyed it up until later on in the series on the second arc. i wont spoil anything but it dragged on way longer than it needed to. it was like the story board artist gave up and just rinse and repeat the same premise of the last episodes until it ended. I was ready tojust drop the anime and move on, but I pushed through it. The ending was not as satisfying as it would have been if the story board artist did a well enough job but I am not blaming them at all. I guess it is hard for them to make a 26 episode long anime with little source material so I gave it a pass.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Guy gets put in shitty situations\\n\\n\r\nThe way they portrayed it gives it a 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nArt: I think nothing is wrong with the art style\\n\\n\r\nIt was good 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: ...\\n\\n\r\nZAWA ZAWa ZAwa Zawa zawa 5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Showed us how shitty people can be\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Up until episode 19 was pretty good\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nOverall: It was a good intense show but because of the drawn out episodes\\n\\n\r\nI have to give it a 8/10\\n",

            "content": "I think everyone's been in a position similar to Kaiji. Dirt poor and full of envy, and so desperate to succeed that you're willing to give everything. I saw both seasons in two sittings, and the second one finished at 4am leaving me with my eyes almost burnt out and my head throbbing in pain from watching so much all at the same time. It's a captivating tragedy, I literally couldn't bring myself to stop because I got so sucked in. Most great shows have lots of small lessons in them with many things happening at once. Kaiji is focused entirely on Kaiji himself andhis addiction to gambling. So few events within each episode, and yet the emotional pull is incredibly strong. The show has this real grounded, down to Earth feeling, everyone felt the feelings expressed in this show. The villians could be just like your boss at work. The friends Kaiji gained are like your friends you go to after punching out at work. The shit that piles on Kaiji is not dissimilar to how I feel when I get bills in the mail. Kaiji reflects adult life, it's cruel, cold nature, but also it's pockets of happiness between.\\n\r\nI would not watch this if you're feeling depressed, but if you're looking for a good drama or just something mature I highly, highly recommend.",
