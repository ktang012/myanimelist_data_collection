            "content": "I'd like more people to give this show a chance.\r\nAt first glance at the title, the first impression was that the show \"Tiger & Bunny\" will be a cutesy show with talking tigers and bunnies. It is not.\r\nThis may be a disappointment for some.\r\nAnd looking at the promotional art, people assume \"Oh it's some mecha anime. Since I don't like mecha, I won't watch it.\" I assure you, this show is not about mechas at all. Those \"mechas\" are in actuality the main characters of the show in their power suits. Calling them \"mechas\" is akin to calling Tony Stark (of Iron Man fame) amecha pilot. \\n\\n\r\nNow, you must be wondering what this show actually IS. To be blunt, it's a hyperactive fluffy kid's show, much like the 7:00 Saturday morning cartoons many people used to watch way back when. The plot is extremely simple, and fast moving. It's basically a show about good old fashioned superheroes (attempting to) kick some bad guy butt.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're here to know more details, it's better to just look at the description and watch the show. It's extremely simplistic.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that isn't to say that there isn't anything for the older viewer. Besides some of the nostalgia rush that I get from watching this show, I see some intriguing plot factors pop up that separate this from any other anime or superhero show (Western or otherwise). \\n\\n\r\n1.) This show is STUFFED TO THE GILLS in product placement. This is not a bad thing. To the contrary, it adds to the appeal to the show. Rather than tasteless placement, it adds to the setting. These superheroes are commodities. Capitalism has taken advantage of the charismatic heroes, and they are used to advertise products. It's not much different from now, with people slapping celebrity names onto products in order to sell. \\n\\n\r\n2.) This show is light. While modern day superhero stories tend to go for \"darker and edgier\" plots (Watchmen, Batman, etc.), this show remains untouched by such baggage and instead opts for optimism and feel good messages. \"Believe in yourself. Be proud of who you are.\" You'll be rooting for the heroes the whole time.\\n\\n\r\n3.) The main character is an older man with a daughter. Let me tell you: this is mind blowing. Instead of using a child/teenage character as the protagonist, they use an aging papa bear character. The protagonist is someone the audience has someone to sympathize with, and many anime go the lazy route and use a child/teenager as the protagonist for us to sympathize with due to age similarity to the target audience. But Kotetsu is genuinely likable despite his older age setting.\\n\\n\r\n^TL;DR: The story is great and unique, and is quite different from modern day anime offerings and superhero shows. It uses it's premise and setting to its advantage.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization is great. Kotetsu is an idealist, though not frustratingly so. He's basically balancing his own individuality against the expectations of his employers, and his ability to compromise prevents long drawn out misunderstandings. The other heroes seem to have their own agenda, especially Kotetsu's unwilling partner, Barnaby. Characterization through action, not description, is the series' strong point. These aren't just archetypes with faces.\\n\\n\r\nMany complaints with the show deal with the CGI. Honestly, it's not to much of a problem. With some of the Karas staff on board, the CGI is integrated well, with no glaring problems. It beats some of the cheap 2D \"QUALITY\" animation that we are subject to every anime season.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show is wonderful. It makes me feel excited to see what's in store next, though I realize this may not be everyone's cup of tea: the whole \"Western\" feel of the show can throw people off. But it is this exact \"Western\" feel that made Cowboy Bebop and Trigun so successful, and I hope that this show continues to appeal to various demographics. \\n\\n\r\nI say give this show a shot for the first episode, and see if you feel like a kid waiting for next week's 7:00 Saturday morning cartoons.",

            "content": "Superheroes have long been a staple of popular culture, especially in the West, and over the years characters like Superman, Batman, Spiderman, and even The Hulk have become household names. With their popularity at an all-time high thanks to video game tie-ins and movie adaptations, it's only natural that pretenders to the thrones that Marvel and DC sit upon should crawl out of the woodwork.\r\nThe most obvious attempts to capitalise on the success of these comic-book creations have come from television and cinema, but while shows like \"Heroes\", \"Chronicle\" and \"Misfits\" have found a degree of success, the majority of attempts to reinvent, reboot orrevamp the superhero genre have ended in ignominy.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is where Tiger & Bunny swagger onto the stage.\\n\\n\r\nSet in Sternbild City (a fictional version of New York), the story begins 45 years after super-powered humans known as NEXT first began to appear. In the decades that followed, individuals with superhuman abilities took on the roles of heroes and villains, and over time the constant to and fro between both sides became a form of entertainment. Fast forward to NC 1978, where the forces for good have their own specialised broadcast - \"Hero TV\", corporate sponsorships, and a chance to accrue points in order to win the coveted title of \"King of Heroes\".\\n\\n\r\nEvery day brings new challenges for these intrepid do-gooders, but Sternbild City has been built upon many secrets, and when Barnaby Brooks Jr. takes his place amongst those who stand for truth and justice, the shadows of the past begin to move once more.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance Tiger & Bunny may seem like nothing more than a super-powered \"buddy\" show, and to a certain degree that's a fair assessment. The plot is relatively straightforward (but also rather predictable), and although there are several elements that add a veneer of complexity, none of these affect the pacing or progression of the storyline - mainly because it has been split into two major chapters. This has the effect of setting a \"deadline\" for the conclusion of certain arcs, which in turn adds a brevity to the narrative that prevents the atmosphere becoming stale.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately some viewers may find themselves annoyed by the fact that certain episodes appear to deviate from the main plot by focusing on one or more of the supporting characters. Now while this usually a valid complaint, these \"fillers\" often serve as a platform to introduce themes, characters or events that may have a lasting effect on the story proper. In addition to this, the episodes in question have very little impact on the flow of the narrative, and in a very real sense this show is a good example of how \"fillers\" can add to the whole story.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the visuals, Tiger & Bunny certainly looks the part, but it's not without its flaws. The artwork is of a good standard, with a nice variety of character designs, settings, and outlandish costumes that uphold the reputation of superheroes everywhere. The series is well animated for the most part, and while there are the usual (and very minor), anime-related problems when it comes to wardrobes, one particular issue continues to crop up throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nTechnology has progressed to the point where computer generated imagery can often be blended with more traditional animation to good effect, but for some reason Sunrise has decided to be a little more ostentatious in its approach - which has led to a few complications. The main problem lies in the movement of the heroes after they don their costumes, and in several action sequences the studio's attempts to exaggerate the actions of the characters can make the entire scene look more than a little ... odd.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, many viewers may forgive the slightly weird feeling they get from the CG, but only because the overall look is decidedly refreshing and the show makes very good use of some rather nice visual effects.\\n\\n\r\nTiger & Bunny features two opening sequences, both of which introduce the main heroes (with particular attention paid to their sponsors), alongside a few short scenes that display their powers. The only real difference between the two OP's are the songs attached to them - \"Orion o Nazoru\" by Unison Square Garden (a rather upbeat rock song), and \"Missing Link\" by Novels (a surprisingly bittersweet rock ballad). The series also features two closing sequence, the first of which is a fairly simple affair that focuses on the characters of Kaburagi Koutetsu and Barnaby Brooks Jr. while \"Hoshi no Sumika\" by Aobozu plays out. The second ED is much more in keeping with the great traditions of the anime industry as it uses still images of the characters alongside some fairly basic visual effects - all to the J-Pop stylings of Tamaki's \"Mind Game\"\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to background music it seems like Tiger & Bunny is on firmer ground, and much of the soundtrack is littered with anthems that echo of heroism, action, and good old comic-book cheese. In addition to this there are a wide range of well defined audio effects, and overall the series is remarkably balanced in terms of its choreography.\\n\\n\r\nAs one might expect from a superhero tale, the dialogue is awash wish one-liners, catchphrases and other sentences that tend come out of the mouths of costumed vigilantes. That said, the script is surprising in both its intelligence and humour, and although there's the ever-present shadow of cheese, it's not enough to deter the voice actors from delivering some fine performances. Hirata Hiraoki and Morita Masakazu are in good form as the laconic veteran Kaburagi Koutetsu (a.k.a. Wild Tiger), and the fiery young Barnaby Brooks Jr., but while the two have a good on-screen rapport, the cornerstone of the dialogue is the camaraderie between the heroes as a group.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the nice things about Tiger & Bunny is that the characters represent a wide range of ages and backgrounds, and although the majority of them are adults, the show also tries to offer some insight into the personalities of the more prominent teenaged heroes. Koutetsu is a particularly interesting individual - a widowed father who rarely sees his ten-year old daughter (who lives with her grandmother), because of his \"work\", and this lays a very strong and unusual (for anime that is), foundation for development. A big plus is that rather than travel down the Ikari Gendou route towards a \"bad end\", the writers have decided to adopt an approach that's more akin to \"Lethal Weapon\", with Koutetsu in the role of the aging veteran.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Barnaby Brooks Jr. is Batman.\\n\\n\r\nNo, seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that where Barnaby is concerned, nobody has tried to think outside of the box (as they do with Koutetsu), and it's for this reason that his background is one of the biggest stereotypes in the world of superheroes. Because of his origins, many of the changes in his personality over the course of the series can feel derived, and this is especially true where his relationship with Koutetsu is concerned. Thankfully the show has a pretty good set of supporting characters, and unlike many other anime, the series uses the relationships between the majority of the characters rather well.\\n\\n\r\nIf one compares Tiger & Bunny to its Western counterparts then it manages to hold its own, but only just as the weight of the superhero genre in America and Europe is enough to crush almost any challenger. That said, the series is a refreshing change from the shounen fare that's being served these days, and one of the most laudable aspects is that Sunrise haven't been afraid to take inspiration from Western media.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings up one small but important point.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of popular heroes were created decades ago, and since then there have been many attempts to update them so that they always appear to be in keeping with modern trends and tastes. Unfortunately these changes are only skin-deep, and aside from recent titles like \"Heroes\", \"Misfits\", \"Kick Ass\", \"Chronicle\" and \"Super\", the majority of Western tales don't really serve as a good reflection of modern times, even if their core message remains valid. It's in this particular area where Tiger & Bunny stands above many other stories, mainly because of its focus on \"reality TV\", celebrity culture and corporate sponsorship. In a very real sense the anime highlights a direction that has been blatantly ignored, and while the whole concept may seem alien to diehard fans of Western comic-books, the simple fact is that modern superhero stories tend to follow the same formula that has been the mainstay of the industry for decades.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tiger & Bunny is an enjoyable take on the genre that blends several old ideas and puts them in a setting that, while futuristic, is more a reflection of modern society than many people might initially believe. The mixture of super-powered shenanigans, comedy and drama is very much in keeping with the best traditions of action movies everywhere, and in all honesty that's probably the best way to approach the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut that doesn't automatically make it no-brain entertainment.",

            "content": "Before it came out, I saw the title and a poster art, and I figured it would be Playboy-esque.  Or about Mafia.  Then on a fansub site, I saw it tagged as a shounen mecha with action and comedy.  Now I was confused.  But whichever it was (about Mafia or mecha) it wasn't gonna be good.\r\nThen I saw that episode 1 was on Hulu.  HULU?  Was this legitimacy?  OK, so I watched it.  It was not what I was expecting.  It's not about Mafia or mecha.  It's about SUPERHEROES!  Why couldn't somebody just comeout and say so?  But mind you, this isn't like the other Japanese superhero animes that are re-makes revolving around American-made characters.  This ain't Wolverine or Iron Man, folks.  No, this is good stuff.  GOOOOOOD.  Just count how many times I use \"awesome\" and \"cool\" in this review.\\n\\n\r\nHere we have bright and saturated visuals, comedy, some pretty sweet action sequences, loveable characters, and enough drama and melodrama to keep a sieve full.  And an interesting twist on athlete sponsorship.\\n\\n\r\nSYNOPSIS:\\n\\n\r\nThis is Stern Bild, the bright city of the (American) future, where citizens are kept safe by the troop of the city's resident heroes.  But these heroes aren't freelancers or government employees.  No, they're privately sponsored.  After all, it takes big bucks to get those suits done at the dry cleaners.  But that sponsorship doesn't just mean they get corporate logos slapped all over them like a biker or racecar.  No, they have to let camera crews follow them around, to broadcast their feats in reality-TV style.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character is one of these heroes, Kotetsu, whose hero name is Wild Tiger.  Back in the day, he was cool.  But now he's older, and has lost his shine.   And his tween daughter thinks he's an absolute dweeb.\\n\\n\r\nWhen his current hero company goes under, he gets transferred to another, where they aren't too thrilled about having an old has-been hero.  So they make the unusual decision to partner him up with another hero, and sell them to audiences as a team.  They pick one that has the exact same superpower as Wild Tiger.  And it happens that this guy's everything that Kotetsu is not: fresh, new, young, arrogant, no sense of humor, dutiful to the sponsors, and he uses his real name for his hero work.  Everyone knows that heroes are supposed to have a secret identity!  Young upstart.  \\n\\n\r\nSo Kotetsu's partnership with Barnaby Brooks Jr. gets off to a rough beginning.  And it stays that way for a loooooong time, while Kotetsu keeps trying to loosen \"Bunny-chan\" up.  (Yes, Barnaby is the 'Bunny' in Tiger & Bunny.)   But Bunny isn't a hero just to do good.  He has a specific goal in mind, and he won't let Kotetsu's goofiness distract him.  \\n\\n\r\nIt turns out they will both need to learn a lot about each other to get this partnership to work.\\n\\n\r\nMOST EVERYTHING ELSE:\\n\\n\r\nI tried a few minutes of some of the animes based on Marvel characters.  I didn't like them.  And judging by their low MAL ratings, most other people don't either.  But this is an original story.  Fresher, brighter, and with no comic book (or manga) to compare it to.  But you can still see classic superhero roots, in the villains particularly.  They're generally very flashy, unlike real criminals.  And hey, we even get a mad scientist.  \\n\\n\r\nEven though Tiger and Bunny are our main characters, there is a whole cast of heroes that they work alongside: ice-caster Blue Rose (who has a crush on Tiger), the fire-shooting Fire Emblem, wind-warping Sky-High, hunky Rock Bison, tomboyish Dragon Kid, and Japanophile Origami.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there's non-hero characters.  Kotetsu's daughter Kaede, his mom, his former boss Ben.  His suit-maker, Saito, with the quiet voice (he gets his own subtitles, since apparently Tiger is the only one who can hear him).  Agnes, the producer of HERO-TV, the reality show that follows the heroes around.  Legend, the hero that saved Kotetsu as a kid, and encouraged him to become a hero himself.  The rogue Lunatic, dispenser of vigilante justice, who I think most people wanted to get more screentime.  (I wanted to see more of him too; after all, he's the only guy whose suit had bell-bottoms.  BELL-BOTTOMS.)\\n\\n\r\nIt has a couple of story arcs.  Some are as short as one episode, and give us a close-up look at the life of one of the heroes in the story.  Other arcs span several episodes, as our heroes battle the villain of the moment.  But there are clues scattered throughout the series that are used later.  \\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are generally pretty cool.  There isn't one every episode, but when they come, they are, like, AWESOME!!!!  \\n\\n\r\nThere's comedy aplenty, of the light kind.\\n\\n\r\nBut what's at the core of the show is DRAMA.  Lots of it.  If the scene involving the little boy and the trading cards doesn't impact you some way, then you should just stop watching, because that's the melodramatic slant in this show.  There's the drama of a dad trying to get his kid to say he's cool.  Promising to meet with her, but then having to break his promise because he has been called to an assignment.  There's the drama of a man whose goal is to take revenge for his parents who were murdered.  You almost wonder if Barnaby suffers from depression, since he keeps getting bogged down in melodramatic angst, and takes it out on anybody who tries to get close to him.  And the one who tries to do that is our very own Kotetsu.  Barnaby is in serious need of some professional counseling.\\n\\n\r\nIncidentally, there is a bit racial variety.  Which is unusual for anime, but was probably obligatory since the story is set, after all, in a place much like the United States.  We have a couple of black characters: The mayor of Stern Bild (\u00e0 la Obama, I'm sure); Ben, who is Kotetsu's former boss and current mentor; and Fire Emblem (a lot of viewers chew out his character because he is the clich\u00e9 gay character you see a lot in anime; oh well, the makers are still Japanese after all).  And Kotetsu and his family, and Saito are Asian...or more specifically, Japanese.  No other kinds of Asians around apparently.  And all the other characters are probably white.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very awesome.  The setting is often the sparky-lit city at night.  Outlining is done in brown instead of the usual black, so the everything looks \"warm\" and alive.  Action scenes are done well.  And there's lots of CGI.  Which makes some purists mad.  The suits are where you see it most.  Some people squawk at this, which isn't fair, because it's usually done pretty well, especially for the chunky suits that Tiger and Barnaby wear.  The only place where it doesn't work very well is Fire Emblem's skin-tight suit.  Though his cape with the creeping-flames pattern is cool.  I'd want one of those myself.\\n\\n\r\nStyle.  There's lots of style.  There's something about this that almost says \"superheroes are a fashion statement.\"  Well, that and the fact that Tiger and Bunny almost ALWAYS wear the same clothes.  It's just begging for people to cosplay them.  And the music seems to fit in with the style.  The music is cool.  Awesomely awesome.  It varies from jazz to opera and places in-between.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Pixar movie \"The Incredibles.\"  Something about that retro-esque heroes-in-real-life feels very similar to this.\\n\\n\r\nMAKE SURE to watch after the ED in each episode.  Often, there's a little bit of extra story at the end before the previews roll.  And by then you might as well watch the previews too, since they're usually narrated by either Tiger or Barnany, and begin with him saying \"Hi, I'm Tiger, the member of Tiger and Bunny who wears a beard!\" or something else idiotic.  Also, the episode titles are all in English, and based off some proverb.  Tiger doesn't even try to say the next episode title, but Barnaby does, and sound pretty horrible.  Some people said it was worth it to watch each episode just to hear Barnaby's Engrish at the end.\\n\\n\r\nSome viewers felt that the final arc in the series was a bit lame.  I wouldn't say it was terrible, but it definitely did go for the cliche situations of \"superhero meets the big boss\" and more.  Not necessarily bad, but it raised the bar pretty high for itself by then.  But fans are waiting to see if there will be a second season\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nWHAT IT'S NOT:\\n\\n\r\nIt's not primarily action.  We don't get a full-blown action sequence every episode.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's not primarily comedy, unless you want to laugh at Barnaby's childish attitude, or Kotetsu's blunders.  Which ARE funny.\\n\\n\r\nThere's very little ecchi.  Unless you count Blue Rose's costume.\\n\\n\r\nThere's little romance.  Blue Rose obviously has a thing for Kotetsu, even though he's a generation older than herself.  (It's OK Blue Rose, I sorta do too.)  Yaoi fans may be disappointed that nothing goes on between our two main characters.  (Though that hasn't prevented scores of Yaoi doujinshi from being made.)\\n\\n\r\nIt's also not hugely\u2026.intelligent.  I have to say this for people who are expecting an amazingly intricate and solid plot.  While the story overall is good and throws a few cureveballs, there are some mental goofs.  But that is all forgiven because the drama is SOOOO feel-good, and the characters are so loveable.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nI can say I'm very happy to see this show as popular as it is.  I wrote a review after seeing episode 4, when the show's MAL rating was below 7.  Now it's above 8.  I'm happy it's getting love.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most shounen series which are primarily about an action or suspense-driven story, Tiger and Bunny's partnership, or attempt at a partnership, is the main draw.  You care about them, and the other characters.  You REALLY CARE.  You might even say this is meddling in seinen territory.  Which is probably why this attracts viewers from all sorts of demographics.  If you like drama, and a little action, comedy, nice music and animation, and an interesting setting, please, please give this a try.  But beware.  You might just get hooked.  \\n",

            "content": "Alright, it's time for a new season and there's a chance that Sunrise is gonna make it a good one with this gem. Of course, Sunrise is probably the most incompetent major studio when it comes to handling a story and has been for years, but I'm willing to put my hopes and dreams for anime's future on the line for Tiger&Bunny. \r\nThe premise: Superheroes are real, and they're the latest and greatest tool for capitalism. Anyone who's anyone that has a superpower is sponsored by a company, and they all compete on a reality TV show where they catch crooks and stop disasters fromhappening. Their catch phrases, names, costumes and everything else about the heroes are a corporate product designed to sell merchandise and stuff. \\n\\n\r\nBehind all this is our boy Kotetsu, an idealistic aging superhero who calls himself Wild Tiger. He's not cool anymore. His merchandise isn't selling, his sponsor's the victim of a corporate takeover and there's a new kid on the block with the exact same powers as him. The kicker is that he's been paired up with this new guy due to a new corporate deal and has to work with him on a daily basis. He also has a wife who's either dead or divorced and a daughter that he doesn't live with, opting instead for a semi-fancy apartment lined with empty booze bottles. The other heroes he works with are also real people, who have their own lives and takes on their situation.\\n\\n\r\nLike his superstar partner, Barnaby. Bunny-boy's a dead-serious realist who's all about efficiency, but still has lots of charisma and can lose his temper from time to time. His dynamic with Kotetsu is pulled off very believably. At the start, they both definitely have their issues with one another, but it becomes unclear who's really being the difficult one in the relationship. Their development and characterization is handled very well, with personalities and actions that change and interact believably in a well-paced manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe backstories behind these characters have all been enjoyable and unique so far. Everyone faces issues involving things like friends, family, uncertainties for their futures, self confidence, money, etc. You know, really relate-able things. Melodrama that we're all used to seeing in anime has been pretty sparse, and when it has popped up it's been handled professionally. T&B is very much a character driven series, and it knows what it's doing.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the show is pretty cool. People will bitch about the CGI used for some of the superheroes, but those are usually the same people who find great interest in anime like A-Channel, where the style is so banal that they don't even have to think about whether it's good or not. In terms of art design, the heroes remind me of a Ultraman/Marvel/Ultimate Muscle/Karas mix, which is neat. You get a good meld of Western comics and Eastern Tatsunoko. The animation and CGI themselves are just dandy, every motion is smooth and the art is crisp with no \"QUALITY\" in sight, and has maintained that level of goodness for a third of the series now.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing for the show is great, and delivers campy fun and a mature character-driven story to back it up. Dialogue is witty and engaging. The humor is actually funny and doesn't rely on outrageous visual gags, ecchi or references to Japan's asinine culture. The drama feels real and relate-able, especially in the later episodes, and doesn't rely on contrived nonsense, but rather on human emotion and conflict. The pacing for the episodes is wonderful, and even the parts without the CGI heroes jumping around had me interested and entertained. Each episode delivers a solid 23 minutes of content, with no meaningless filler or superfluous action. They're all put together very well. The series pacing as a whole has been fairly smooth, and even during the introduction episodes I felt like the show was going somewhere. Every episode develops the characters or background by a lot, this is a show that doesn't waste the viewer's time.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, I've seen some complaints about the \"lack of action\", which I can't do anything but shake my head at. I guess I have to keep reminding myself that we live in a world where wanton garbage takes precedence over originality and good execution, both of which this show has. I highly recommend it if you like those sort of things.",

            "content": "[Insert obligatory pretentious quote here]\r\n#3deep5me\r\nI have been told that I recommend this anime a bit too much.\r\nThat's because it's so underrated. Every time i tell someone to watch it, they give me shit like \"I don't watch mech\" or \"Looks gay\"\r\nIT IS NOT FUCKING MECH. Learn to read the damn tags.\r\nAs for the gay part, people can ship whichever characters they want, doesn't make it canon. As long as you avoid the doujins, you're good. Unless of course you like that kind of stuff, which is perfectly fine.\r\nI do admit the banner doesn't look too appealing. Trust me, the anime looks much better.\r\nStory-\r\nAnime about peoplewith special abilities are far from rare. But they are rarely done well. Tiger & Bunny is about people with special abilities called NEXT. Some of these NEXT are chosen by sponsors to be superheroes. These superheroes are in a competition on live TV. Hero TV is the most popular show on TV. The hero with the most point at the end of the season is crowned as the 'King of Heroes' \\n\r\nI found the idea of commercialised superheroes to be really fresh.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is more important, the competition or people's lives?\\n\r\nThe story explores the main duo. It highlights the contrast in their views of justice and what it means to be a superhero. Another notable character is a vigilante, Lunatic, who believes that all criminals must die. He also happens to be my favourite character, his backstory was really touching. I actually gave a shit about him, and I'm a sociopath.\\n\r\nIt's no just a mindless action, comedy though. It does make you think a bit. Since I didn't open with a real quote, here you go-\\n\r\n\"The justice you speak of is truly weak and frail.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\r\nThe character designs are unique and I quite like them. The costumes/suits are all very different.\\n\r\nThe visuals are stunning, even Redline pales in comparison. There's just a slight problem when the characters are in their costumes, the CGI is a bit jerky and looks weird. But this isn't a major problem and is only noticeable in a few scenes. Other than that Eyegasm.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe two openings were very different from each other, but both were excellent. Orion wo nazoru is a cheerful song while Missing Link is a more emotional. The first ending was decent and the second was even better.\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a brilliant job, especially Hirata Hiroaki.\\n\r\nI also checked out the english dub, but I wasn't too impressed. I didn't think Yuri Lowenthal was able to pull off Bunny's character very well.\\n\r\nSo I recommend sticking to the sub.\\n\r\nThe OST is absolutely brilliant.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\r\nThis is one of the major strengths of Tiger & Bunny.\\n\r\nEach and every character is well written. We are shown the backstory of all relevant characters. There is a considerable amount of development in most characters. The supporting characters especially standout. \\n\r\nTiger is a 40 year old man, with a teenage daughter. This is one of the things which sets Tiger & Bunny apart. The main character isn't a perfect teenager. He has several existing problems. Including his relationship with his daughter.\\n\r\nBunny is a cliched character. But that's one of the reason he stands out. cause he's the only one like that.\\n\r\nLunatic is my waifu.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\nWell we all love superhero movies and we all love anime. Why wouldn't we love this. \\n\r\nThe show really has something for everyone. Even a tad bit of fanservice, which you won't specifically notice unless you want to. It's pretty funny. And was a fun ride altogether.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nIt's a 10/10 Masterpiece you will love it.\\n\\n\r\nNow stop reading this shit and go watch it.\\n",

            "content": "Up in the sky, look!  It\u2019s a bird!  It\u2019s a plane!  \r\nNo, it\u2019s...  Billboard Man!  Fighting crime, defending the innocent, an whoring himself out like it\u2019s his first night in Hollywood!\r\nIt\u2019s the distant future for us, and a bizarre mutation has started to occur among our population.  Human beings with superhuman powers are popping up everywhere, and we\u2019ve taken to calling them Nexts...  Presumably because \u2018mutants\u2019 was taken.  We initially rejected these outcasts, until they decided to don costumes and assume the role of superheroes, defending the very people who judged them on live, national TV!\r\nUnfortunately forthe widowered single father Kotetsu Kaburagi, the human genome isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s been evolving.  In the decades since Hero TV was established, he finds that he\u2019s become irrelevant, with younger and more capable fighters joining to overshadow him.  His rank is low amongst his co-workers, nobody ever buys his merchandise, and to make matters worse, a new superhero named Barnaby Brooks has thrown his hat into the ring, sporting the exact same power that Kotetsu has...  And to keep himself from getting fired, he has to take up a new mantle as this rookie\u2019s partner!\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, Tiger and Bunny seems to have one of the most tired premises in recent anime history...  That is to say, a large cast of both heroes and villains who\u2019ve mysteriously developed their own unique powers.  Just off the top of my head, I can name several titles with that exact same premise...  Darker than Black, the Index Franchise, Canaan, S-CRY-ED, Speed Grapher, and Getbackers, to name a few.  And that view point isn\u2019t completely unfair, since the array of powers it features is probably the least imaginative in the bunch.  \\n\\n\r\nBut where Tiger and Bunny differs from these other shows is in it\u2019s core concept, which is essentially an amusing combination of X-Men and Nascar.  The heroes are sponsored and basically controlled by wealthy real-life corporations, who tell them how to act and dress while decorating their costume with different logos.  They advertise these logos by competing on Hero TV, earning points based on just how successful their defense of the city was that season.  I can honestly say I\u2019ve never seen an idea even close to that one in my entire life.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was produced by a company named Sunrise, a prolific animation studio with a lot of very impressive previous work under their belt.  They\u2019re known by fans as Sunrise Smooth, a reference to the fluidity of most of their efforts.  Unfortunately, the same can\u2019t really be said for Tiger and Bunny.  It uses both 3D and 2D style animation, but it doesn\u2019t blend them...  The 3D is used in action scenes, or just whenever the heroes are in costume, and the 2D is used practically everywhere else.  \\n\\n\r\nThe 3D animation is actually very impressive, and yes, very smooth.  It turns just about every action scene into a pulse pounding, exciting thrill ride that it should be.  Unfortunately, the 3D is still in effect when our heroes are wearing their costumes outside of action, as well...  Whether they\u2019re giving an interview, lounging around the company gym, or just interacting with one another, and at times, this can sometimes look really...  Really...  Awkward.  It\u2019s mostly due to the fact that with so much money going into the 3D animation, the regular animation obviously took a huge budget cut.  With this side of the coin, we get some of the cheapest looking animation I\u2019ve ever encountered, from hideous walk cycles to the heavy abuse of key frames.  Seeing that in the background, the three dimensional characters look out of place to an almost creepy degree.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork, however, almost completely makes up for it.  This show is set in a fictional American city, and as such, the art and character designs have a very surprising western aesthetic to them.  Aside from a few wide-eyed children, the characters almost always look more like American comic book characters than anime characters.  I\u2019m serious, too...  Virtually every single frame of this show looks like it could have been taken directly from a Marvel or DC comic book, which is a touch that makes the sometimes stiff animation a lot more palatable.  The backgrounds, too, are highly detailed, and the bustling metropolis known as Stern Bild looks like a dead ringer for a futuristic New York City.  The architecture of this setting is beautiful and imaginative, even if some of the structures look entirely implausible in  design.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters inhabiting this city, much like they would be in real life, are racially diverse, forming a shockingly progressive melting pot with nary a stereotype in sight.  Normally, if I were watching an anime that featured White, Black, Hispanic, Russian, Japanese and especially Chinese characters, I would be on the edge of my seat waiting for something offensive to happen.  But aside from a few exaggerated physical traits...  Nope!  Every character\u2019s given a proportionate amount of respect, with their ethnic backgrounds never even slightly becoming an issue in the story.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that is, except for the gay character.  Granted, he\u2019s cool and likeable, and I appreciate that they made him the only hero rich enough to own his own sponsor company, but the homophobia in his design is still pretty blatant.  He talks in a throaty, effeminate falsetto and flirts with pretty much every other male character in the show...  Especially Kotetsu, who already has the barely clad Blue Rose inexplicably pining for him.  If you were to create a sliding scale that ranked all of the LGBT characters in anime history in terms of how offensive they were, he\u2019d be somewhere close to the crossdresser from the Battle Royal manga.  It\u2019s a disappointing step backward for a series that\u2019s otherwise been able to take two giant steps forward against the abundant racial homogeny of the anime medium.\\n\\n\r\nIronically, though, if this show were ever adapted into live action, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that every single character would be Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters?  Well, the main focus of the series is on the ups and downs of Kotetsu and Barnaby\u2019s partnership, so several of the main characters got the short end of the screen time stick.  Characters like Dragon Kid and Origami Cyclone are barely featured outside of having an episode each to themselves, and Rock Bison doesn\u2019t even really get that much.  Fire Emblem, Blue Rose and Sky High get a bit more than that, but they all still play supporting roles to our two mains and their families.  \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, it wasn\u2019t for nothing...  The titular characters are fleshed out, interesting, and very well developed.  Kotetsu, or Wild Tiger as he\u2019s publicly known, is very thoroughly portrayed as the aging veteran trying his damnedest to keep up with new ideas and techniques while still holding on to his more traditional values by the skin of his teeth.  As altruistic as he may be, he\u2019s a very flawed character, who refuses to let anybody ever worry about him...  This stubborn attitude causes strain in both his professional and personal life, as he has a lot of trouble connecting not only with his partner but also with his ten year old daughter.  Despite his insistence that saving people is more important than earning points or selling merchandise, he still clearly cares about his placement in the rankings.  This could make a lot of leading men unlikeable, but in Tiger\u2019s case, it just serves to make him more sympathetic.\\n\\n\r\nHis partner, Barnaby Brooks Junior...  Or Bunny, as Kotetsu irritatingly came up with...  Is in many ways the exact opposite.  He\u2019s the newest super hero on the circuit, and he rejects a lot of the older notions to the point that he doesn\u2019t even bother keeping his identity a secret.  He fights with his head rather than his heart, preferring logical strategy to Kotetsu\u2019s bold, gallant approach.  He\u2019s very direct with people, to the point where he jumps to conclusions at all the worst times.  His tragic past is your typical \u2018Batman\u2019s parents\u2019 story, but the way it\u2019s portrayed...  And the way it shaped his views on justice... is so genuine that you can\u2019t help rooting for him.\\n\\n\r\nThey clash a lot in the beginning, working together solely out of the interest of their employment, but as time goes on they do become closer, and they stop having to pretend to be friends.  This development is shown very naturally throughout the series, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that it\u2019s portrayed through the outstanding, flawless performances of Wally Wingert and Yuri Lowenthal.  The entire dub is very well cast, with nearly all of the actors melting seamlessly and in some cases unrecognizably into their roles, but it\u2019s the main duo by far that takes the cake.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is the part where I have to talk about the writing, and it\u2019s not a part that I\u2019m really looking forward to.  The story in Tiger and Bunny is fast paced, well executed, and hits all the right notes, with exciting CG battles, edge-of-your-seat suspense, and just enough down time to let us form attachments to almost all of the main characters...  Even the ones that don\u2019t get a lot of screen time.  However, that story wouldn\u2019t have progressed at all without the help of inexplicably childish behavior, constant coincidences that directly challenge the suspension of disbelief, and foreshadowing so clumsily handled that a lot of the more serious plot twists can be seen coming from a mile away.  \\n\\n\r\nThere are dozens of conflicts and mysteries that could easily be solved in ways that the viewer will often wind up SHOUTING at the screen, and it almost feels insulting when the answers you come up with are put into play at the last moment for dramatic effect.  Yes, timing is important in a story, but even Dora the Explorer doesn\u2019t make the audience shout out obvious answers as often as Tiger and Bunny does.  Hell, some of the villains are so obviously villains that they might as well have had the last name Palpatine.  Early in the first few episodes, an astute viewer may start wondering things about the nature of Hero TV, ultimately coming to a conclusion that just has to be, and of course winds up being, one of the biggest reveals of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s to say nothing about the lack of originality at play.  While the two titular characters and the final villain have some interesting and unique abilities, there doesn\u2019t seem to be an original idea in the bunch.  Most of the heroic supporting characters have commonplace powers that manipulate ice, fire, lightning, and wind.  There are also powers based on Colossus, Morph, and a lighter version of Rogue from the Xmen.  As far as the villains go, you\u2019ll find characters who\u2019re based on Emma Frost(Or more likely the diamond woman from Speed Grapher), Sandman, The Hood, and others.  Even when you put Kotetsu and Barnaby\u2019s powers aside, the Iron Man suits they wear are just that...  Iron Man suits.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the vigilante Lunatic may have a somewhat original power, think about this;  He\u2019s a judge who experienced emotional trauma as a kid, and grew up believing all evil doers must be killed...  And he uses his powers to do just that, murdering the wicked while criticizing those who let them live.  He\u2019s basically Teru Mikami, except that he has the long white hair and shady face that have become trademarks of any obvious villain.  And by comparison, he\u2019s actually one of the better villains in the series...  He\u2019s nowhere near as obvious as the main villain, whose convoluted master plan and backstory turn the entire final story arc into a rat-king sized clusterfuck of plotholes that had me more confused than excited.  It\u2019s actually kind of amazing.\\n\\n\r\nTiger and Bunny was dubbed and released stateside by Viz Media, and is reasonably priced both online and on common store shelves.  Two films have also been released in the following years, but in typical anime fashion, they\u2019re just slightly altered retellings of the series.  In other words, they\u2019re full fledged cash grabs.  I haven\u2019t seen them myself, but apparently the first one is available stateside, undubbed, and also fairly cheap.  \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, I really enjoyed it.  I connected instantly with Wild Tiger, as his story was undoubtedly and very effectively the heart and soul of the series.  It\u2019s a really fun story, with an intriguing idea, great comedy, and it has a highly diverse cast of likeable characters.  It\u2019s not very original, but it\u2019s sincere, and it\u2019s clear that some very real heart went into it\u2019s creation.  It looks beautiful when it tries, but it doesn\u2019t try often enough.  It\u2019s also heavily flawed below the surface, and there\u2019s a lot of points where you have to turn off your brain to fully enjoy it...  I don\u2019t like doing that, so there were a lot of times where I just felt alienated from the fun that I should have been having.  But to it\u2019s credit, the story is so engrossing that those problems didn\u2019t really bother me as much until my second viewing, and even then, there\u2019s still a lot to love about it.  It\u2019s an enthusiastic love letter to American comic book lore, and it damn well feels like it.  I give Tiger and Bunny a 7/10.",

            "content": "I really hate it when a potentially fun premise finds itself eventually getting bogged down by the conventional elements it was seemingly trying to subvert. Tiger and Bunny's premise was unique in the fact you had superheroes on a reality show competing for points and being corporate-sponsored, which had me thinking this series would get its fun off exploiting the premise and poking fun of the absurdities commonplace with superhero formulas when I first heard about it. Instead, it creates plot development out of Kotetsu and Barnaby getting used to each other as a superhero duo when the former's company gets bought out and thetwo running into developments involving a vigilante hero and a crime organization. The series does decently flesh out both characters as the show prominently focuses on both of them and we get to learn what drove both men into becoming heroes. It also introduces some decent ideas explored such as said vigilante hero in the form of Lunatic and the idea of superheroes losing their powers, as what happens to a major character in the second half to Tiger and Bunny.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, Tiger and Bunny is easily one of the better-looking titles to come out for the year thus far sporting plenty of detail and color to go along with the vast environments shown through the city landscapes of Sternbild City. This same high-quality also went into creating the character designs as the costumes of the heroes are slick to look at, especially the costumes worn by Kotetsu and Barnaby. Action scenes are fluid to look at and get fairly diverse as there are chase scenes by foot and motorcycle, aerial fights and hand-to-hand combat.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Tiger and Bunny finds itself getting bogged down quite a bit by its conventional elements which make it almost seem like a cookie-cutter shounen anime. A number of the characters are tacked on with an archetype that has been done to death in typical plot setups such as Kotetsu being the slow-witted and impulsive hero of the series, Fire Emblem your stereotypical gay man and Blue Rose a tsundere. The show also gets into the annoying habit of resorting to contrived plot developments or conveniently ditching certain points of the plot to help advance any major plot developments that the Heroes are caught up in, particularly with its major baddies in both halves of the show. I couldn't help but wonder the number of times the show resorted to deus ex machina just to force the plot into a certain direction without making sense of things, especially when the Heroes were put into situations where they were seemingly on the losing end of fights as they fought against villains who were either too powerful to be defeated easily or developed an elaborate plot that fell apart due to contrived developments. Both major plots had their potential yet the series fails to provide a solid resolution to both because things get too messy and/or cliched in their developments towards the final moments of both arcs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tiger and Bunny had its potential yet fell flat due to it not escaping the more conventional elements that get tossed into its path. While still having some decent ideas it explores and having its moments in developments with Barnaby and Kotetsu, it still made for a fairly mediocre watch for me and I imagine enough folks will be eating up the news of the series having a sequel planned in the works.",

            "content": "It's an ok anime if you ignore the ending. Otherwise it's a pretty normal one, characters don't progress as much, but there is something at least. Art is pretty good and sounds and voice actors are ok. Good if you don't know anything you want to watch, I'd say overall for me a 7. If you don't mind inconsistencies and like superheroes, i'd say it could be an 8. If you ignore the last 2 episodes which were atrocious.\r\nThis gets a 2 because there are a lot of inconsistencies that happen sometimes that take me out of it (like stupid decisions of characters), but inthe last 2 episodes there are just sooo many ass pulls just to further the plot that i just can't give it more than that. I can't give examples because otherwise it would be a spoiler, but imagine a character without powers teleporting all over the place when there is no possibility of him ever being or doing things that fast, just to further the plot. And that's just one example, so many more in just those last 2 episodes. Just completely bad writing. Can't even tell if it was rushed or not, because several sequences have characters just staring at eachother when they should be moving or fighting. Even if rushed i doubt it could have ended this badly.",

I was shocked so I turned I  on ep 1 expecting to hate it and I ended up watching 14 eps in a single day loving it...... Never judge a book by it's cover  \r\nStory\r\nThe story is about heroes saving the day but on a tv show to get points yep every time they save someone orbeat the bad guy they get points the more points they get the more popular they are the better deals they get. The only hero who doesn't care about that though is tiger one of the main characters whose power is \"100 times\" which makes him stronger for 5 mins and he's been a hero for 10 years. Unfortunately he's one of the least popular heroes so he ends up getting a  partner who has the same powers as him. \\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\r\nThe is is pretty good but one thing does hold it back is the 3D it looks fine on the heros who wear armor but heros like fire emblem look awful cause he wears normal leather hero costume showing his mouth which confused me cause Dragon Kid and Blue Rose are 2D so it's really odd\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music and voicing acting are great I think op 1 of the show really has a good song \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are developed pretty well and are very likable I wanted to see more every ep with them \\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment \\n\r\nI had a blast watching this and even ended up watching the first and second movie right after I was done the anime \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI really recommend this anime it's fun watch \\n",

            "content": "Tiger & Bunny is definitely not your average action anime. Actually, it is more akin western superhero comics than to the shounen and seisen that make up most action anime. From the comic-bookish hero costumes to the loose and fun atmosphere, this very much like the Saturday morning cartoons western audiences grew up on... except better. It's a breath of fresh air and welcomed diversity in the world of anime, but more than that, it's a damn fun show.\r\nRight from the start, Tiger & Bunny sets itself apart from just about any other show with its 'superheroes meet capitalism' premise. You see, in the cityof Sternbild, being a superhero has become a profitable enterprise. Hero TV, a show that follows heroes as they fight crime, is the most popular thing on television; not only are heroes beacons of justice, they're celebrities, not to mention corporate cash-cows. But all that doesn't matter to Kotetsu T. Kaburagi (a.k.a Wild Tiger), an old-time veteran of Hero TV, he's just in it to be a hero. However, his popularity has dropped, and before he knows it the company he works under goes out of business and he has a new employer. What's more, he is going to be part of Sternbild's first hero duo; partnered up with the arrogant and glory-seeking new hot-shot, Barnaby Brooks. This idea feels fresh, unique, and is brimming with potential.\\n\\n\r\nWith this premise, Tiger & Bunny could have focused on capitalistic greed and corruption, but instead opts to be a story about friendship and heroism with a capitalistic backdrop, and this makes it infinitely more inviting. The show is filled with heart-pounding action, colorful characters, and has tongue-in-cheek atmosphere which all make it a roaring good time. Later, some intrigue gets thrown in with the tragedy of Barnaby's past and introduction of the super secretive crime syndicate, Ouroboros. And let's not forget Lunatic, the violent vigilantly who has a very different idea of justice. This all comes together to make Tiger & Bunny's first half a high-spirited superhero romp.\\n\\n\r\nComing into its second half, Tiger & Bunny shifts gears a bit. The second half has heavier emphasis on drama than the first, as Kotetsu, and later Barnaby, struggle with the life-style they have chosen because of forces beyond their control. Now, you'd think that this shift in dynamic would be cripplingly tone-dissident to the show until that point but surprisingly it isn't. This is in no small part due to the fantastic lead the show has in Kotetsu, and never loses its tongue-in-cheek charm even as it ramps up the drama. Kotetsu character shines here (even more than it already has), and his struggle between life as a hero and life with his daughter aims straight for the viewers' hearts. Barnaby's part is more melodramatic, but at the same time drives the plot forward, keeping the audience wanting to know what's next. The plot thickens with every episode, revealing unsavory truths about Hero TV, but at the same time never really loses its sense of fun, and once the clouds clear, Tiger & Bunny is the awesome superhero romp it always has been.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows cast is, for the most part, extremely likable. First and foremost there is Kotetsu, who is one of the most endearing lead characters in recent memory. He's a big goof and makes plenty of mistakes often coming off as an overgrown kid, but at the same time has a strong sense of right and wrong which makes it easy to stand behind him, and is incredibly charming in his own doofy way. His relationship with his daughter, Kaede, also provide the show with its biggest emotional punches. Barnaby is definitely not on the same level as his partner, simply lacking the charisma Kotetsu has, but serves the role as Kotetsu's foil well. All the heroes have their own distinctive traits which make them charming, whether it be Sky High's enthusiasm, Dragon Kid being a bit of a tomboy, or Blue Rose's crush on Kotetsu; they all also share a nice sense of comradery with one another which really makes you care bout them. Then of course, there is the anti-hero vigilante Lunatic and other antagonists like the Social-Darwinist Jake, who just bleed super-villain charisma. Unfortunately, the characters do have their short-comings, as most lack substantial depth which does cause problems for the series.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical-side, Tiger & Bunny looks and sounds great. Character designs are stylish and attractive, especially the superhero costumes, and the city of Sternbild is a booming, well-detailed metropolis. Of special note is the show's use of CG. Now, CG integration is kind of tricky because you want it to pop out, but not feel out of place; this is something that Tiger & Bunny does exceptionally well. The CG is noticeable but not distracting, and feels right at home amongst the vibrant streets of Sternbuild. The music is well composed and really pumps up the excitement. It really gets your blood pumping to hear the music while the heroes zoom around the city or are locked in battle. The show also uses its musical ques well, so you know when Lunatic is going to make an appearance, or when epic heroics are going to ensue.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, the show is not without some glaring flaws. For one, there is a gigantic number of plot conveniences in the story. Plot points will often be brought up, then pushed aside for a while until the story conveniently uses them to explain or trigger certain events. Many of these are also rather silly. The tongue-in-cheek nature of the show is enough to cover for this and makes it forgivable for the most part, but still the story is hard to take seriously sometimes. Less forgivable is the fact that the show almost solely relies on Kotetsu for emotional impact. Barnaby isn't the most likeable of characters, and some of the dramatic moments of his story feel overwrought. While all the other characters get fleshed out a bit, it isn't enough to make the viewers truly resonate with them emotionally. The only one to really emotionally grab onto is Kotetsu, and while that works just fine for the show, most of the characters feel unfulfilled because of this.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of what flaws it may have, Tiger & Bunny is well worth checking out. Its a show that constantly tossing up oohs and aahs, and will keep a smile on your face. Deep and thought provoking this is not, but when a show is this fun, being goofy and explosive works just as well.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Out of all the shows to debut for the Spring 2011 season, Tiger and Bunny was the only I had the most reservations about prior the actually seeing it. The description was non existent and the cover art made it look like some sort of yaoi mecha anime.\r\nI'm please to say that none of the above is true. The show is pretty awesome after two episode. The premise is a buncha of random people got super powers and some use them for good, others evil, but someone decided to cash in on this and now their exploits are set up on public television. \r\nThe showdoes have massive product placement, I mean BANDI and PEPSI and such flash all over the screen everywhere. In any other anime I'd drop it because of this, but it's almost amusing considering the backdrop. \\n\\n\r\nT&B has a large lineup of characters/heroes, but the titular ones, Tiger and Bunny are already looking like they'll have strong development just based on the first two episode. Wild Tiger, a passed his prime hero who believes a heroes duty is to do what is right, no matter what, is often at odds with his counterpart, Barney (bunny) who seems more considered with a level headed and calculated approach. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime seems a lot less focused on any form of super villain, or any type of villain, and more so on the conflicts of Tiger and Bunny themselves. I'm sure they'll be like an evil force in the works for later, but right now the plot progression is more of a personal journey for the characters instead of a point a to point b type of routine. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\nWatch. There is no reason not to pick this up and give it a try.",

            "content": "PLOT: 1/10\r\nStarted out promising, with an unique idea of capitalist super heroes competing for \"hero-points\" in a reality tv-show, their suits plastered with commercial ads. In the reality tv-show, good deeds yield points to the heroes (saving a human life +100p, catching a bad guy +200p, etc.). Brilliant start!\r\nBut! This original idea of capitalist heroes was not explored in any depth, which left me super disappointed. The story doesn't touch the subject of capitalism or commercial ads or anything like that. It's just silly super powers and silly villains one after the other. None of the characters question the scoring of saving human lives, andnot even the viewer is offered any food for thought on the subject. The only hints of critique are made of two characters in the show who are compulsive about the ratings of the hero tv-show, but even their compulsions are so shallow that they offer no surface for further analysis of deranged capitalist mentality.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the whole anime misses it's greatest premise. A waste of time, beyond the first episode which demonstrates the concept.\\n\\n\r\nOther than for the plot, I have no complaints. Everything else was pretty avarage.\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nART was ok with heavy use of above avarage 3D.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND was ok with some semi-memorable themes.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS were simple, but likeable nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT was avarage...

            "content": "I know another Tiger and Bunny Review when there is so many other great reviews. But I really wanted to say, or rather type, why I loved this show. And how it is the only 2011 anime that I have kept updated with constantly. \r\nFirst let's start with the Story. \r\nWhen you look at the title its a little off putting, but honestly the title is what drove me to try this series. An anime called Tiger and Bunny with a cover picture of Mecha suits. It raises the curiosity.  So I tired it. And I was surprised. It was funny and the artwas pretty neat (CGI is a little hard to get use to at first but I find that you eventually get use to it). Then the show really started. Episodes that seemed \"filler\" like, weren't. And it was brilliant. My only real issue with the story is that at times I found it to be predictable which didn't bother me to much, because if I wanted a serious anime I would've watch Code Geass, Deadman Wonderland, or something like Durarara!!. The story is well written and parts where it seems unimportant come back and become well, important. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier the art is hard to get use to with the mix of CGI and anime-style. But eventually you get use to it and then it works. I think if the CGI wasn't in Tiger and Bunny, I wouldn't have kept coming back. The CGI makes it Tiger and Bunny (or rather the art of TnB) It adds to its overall quirkiness.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI love the music for TnB. The second ending I listen to over and over. And when I watch the anime every Saturday I find myself not skipping the openings and endings like I normally do. Once you seem them its good enough. But the soundtrack is just amazing. Even the instrumentals in the backgrounds work so well. When they planned this show they didn't skimp out on small things, or the bkgd music. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nTnB's characters are amazingly brilliant. Kotetsu (MC) is your usual hero. Believes completely in justice and human lives and he can be a ditz at times. What makes his character better than every other one is his age. And the fact he is a father. Then you have Burnaby, that character you dislike in the beginning but grow to love by the end. His development through the story is well-written. Even the other characters and the way the interact with each other was well thought out. Each character has their story (except seemingly not Rock Bison (Idek what his NEXT is)) that affects the original storyline. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI love anime and I love following it. And when a new anime comes out I try to follow it weekly but it is difficult with life. This show is the only one I have tried to follow every week (airs on Saturday). And every Saturday I feel so sad because it means that I can't watch it for another week. TnB will hook you. The characters, the art, the sound, the story it all leaves you wanting more Tiger and more Bunny. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would love for this anime to be sold in North America so that I can buy it and watch it over and over and show all my friends. I would also love for it to become more popular and for people to try it out. And I would love it if you readers would give it a chance and not dismiss it because its mecha (which honestly it isn't) or that the name is childish. \\n\r\nTiger and Bunny is my favourite anime and I wish others would come to see why. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review and I hope you try the show out!~\\n",

            "content": "Hi, and thanks for taking the time to read my review of Tiger & Bunny! I have come to terms that I am obsessed with this show, and I'd like more people to give it a chance.\r\nStory: I'd say the biggest letdown is the story; the main plot has been done before. On the plus side, there is considerable effort put into the side characters' stories that helps add to the overarching plot. \r\nArt: Another iffy spot. At times, the art is gorgeous. Other times, the art is very simplistic and \"lazy\". I think that the CG implemented into the show is a bonus, ratherthan a hindrance. While it is noticeable, it is well-done and very smooth.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I've watched both the dub and sub, and I love them both. Every character has the perfect voice actor attributed to them. The background music was hit-or-miss. Most of the themes are great, and have a very 40's jazz / golden age feel to them. Akin to the music of Pixar's The Incredibles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The reason I fell in love with this show. Everything from the designs to the personalities is spot-on. While Kotetsu is my favorite, it is very hard to pick a second favorite, or even least favorite character. Almost every character goes through noticeable development, and they become even more endearing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A decent story backed by an incredible cast of characters and diverse themes. The show is equal parts action, drama, emotion (I connected with Kotetsu's storyline a lot) and comedy. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR 5 words/phrases to desribe Tiger & Bunny\\n\\n\r\ngreat characters, funny, emotional, good action, hot men :)",

            "content": "Tiger & Bunny is a hero series from 2011. It was brought to us by Sunrise. I've heard it mentioned a lot over the years, but never got around to watching it. But since it's hero month, it seems like a good time to check it out and form some opinions.\u00a0 \r\nStory:\r\nOur narrative is set in the future where mutants... I mean \"Next\" have started popping up. Naturally, this has led to a group of heroes who wear product placements like they think they're Captain Amazing from Mystery Men\u00a0and who fight criminals & rescue civilians alike to earn points for a television show. Enter newcomer,Barnaby, a hero with a dark past he's looking to unravel. He becomes the first hero duo with veteran, Wild Tiger. Unfortunately for both of them, they don't get along all that well and Barnaby's past may be creeping up on them.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems with the series is that it has severe tonal issues. It tries to strike a balance between darker and lighter moments like some of the best comic runs out there including Claremont's X-men run and the Wolfman/ P\u00e9rez Titans run. The problem is that it sucks at it and there are two reasons for that. The first is that it goes two far in both directions. If you look at those comics that shift tone well, they have pretty realistic degrees on both ends. For example, The X-men facing the brood and finding themselves in a seemingly hopeless situation on account of the royal eggs that have been implanted in them but still maintaining hope and doing everything they can versus Shadowcat telling little Illyana a bed time story for an issue. In Tiger & Bunny, the lighter elements cross into Silver Age goofiness. Think Batman and Superman having a slumber party at the fortress of solitude but somehow dumber whereas the darker elements cross into 90s darker and stupider territory. Which means there's a lot more of a shift between the tones. Tiger & Bunny also fails because it combines the elements. If you look at those good comics, they actually transition from one tone to the other instead of abruptly forcing the tone to change. In this, they'll have goofy silver age elements, like evil plush toys piloting mechs, side by side with more serious elements like Barnaby trying to get revenge for the loss of his parents and that's just highly dissonant.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is with the main villain's plan. I don't want to go deep into spoilers, so I'll keep this somewhat vague. Even though who the villain is going to be becomes really obvious as soon as our heroes have a certain conversation in hospital. In any case, our arch villain gets caught with a tiny contradiction and all he has to do to keep things from escalating is pretend he also doesn't know what the deal is. Instead he gives a huge villain speech revealing everything and tries to cover things up by messing with someone's mind. Then he makes things even worse by unnecessarily lying and trying to frame another hero. Even though said hero has had a costume where they can easily be identified just by visually comparing him with one of his old trading cards or videos. To make things even dumber, this guy supposedly wants Next to be treated well and that's why he's manipulated the Hero media but when things aren't looking so good he decides to have androids kill all the heroes that the citizens know and love even though that will clearly interfere with his big plan. I don't know how it's possible to be as egregiously stupid as this villain.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAlthough that does lead me with yet another problem I have with this series. They bring up this idea of their mutants being feared and mistrusted a couple times, but it's not something we see any real evidence of. There are, maybe, three scenes where someone is a dick towards the Next. Other than that, they're treated like heroes, people buy their merch, big companies sponsor them to make themselves look good. There's almost nothing to indicate that things are bad for them. The series also wastes its one opportunity to do something with some impact right at the end by having a cheap cop out. So, the ending is pretty shit. The series also likes to repeat itself way too much, going over plot points to a ludicrous degree. For example, the anti-hero appears and gives a big speech about how \"he is doing the true justice\" and there are about three conversations after that where our heroes can't figure out what he's after. It's like they think their audience is really, really slow.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI've already described how bad the antagonist is, so let's talk about the other major characters. Our big characters are Tiger, Kotetsu, and Barnaby. Kotetsu is a horrible, neglectful father and obnoxious cretin. Barnaby is just boring. Which is kind of the way things go in this series. At best, the heroes are trite and bland. At worst, they're gross homophobic stereotypes, Hi, Fire Emblem. Sky High is probably the most likeable of them all, even though he's dumber than a wet cardboard box, because he's a paragon character with a dog. Blue Rose is an insipid twit with a really annoying crush on a dude more than twice her age. Which might not be so bad if they didn't bring it up constantly throughout the series.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nDragon Kid and Origami Cyclone are dull. Rock Bison is so boring that even his \"best friend\" can't think of any personal information to give about him. Seriously, there's a scene where Tiger is giving out some information about all the other heroes and he has nothing to say about this guy. There's also Lunatic, one of those generic anti-hero characters. Although it is worth noting that he wants to be seen as seeking true justice, but he calls himself Lunatic. That would be like Mister Sinister trying to convince ordinary people he's actually the hero while still calling himself Mister Sinister.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt:\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is a bit mixed. Some of the city shots look impressive, but the character designs are kind of mediocre. and the action sequences aren't very interesting. One thing that's absolutely horrendous is the product placement. The hero costumes are plastered with logos to the point of it being really tacky. It's like Sunrise just decided this had no artistic merit whatsoever so they might as well just suck off some fat corporate guys for a bit of extra dosh.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nHere's one aspect where I can give the series some credit, the actors are pretty decent. Maybe not great, but they're about as good as they can be with characters this insipid. The best is probably Inoue Go, who does pull off the simple-minded paragon character pretty well. The only truly bad performance comes from Tsuda Kenjirou. It's not really his fault since he's voicing a super flamboyant gay stereotype, but it is awful to listen to.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIke Yoshihiro does the sound track and it's the best part of the series. They may not be the best tunes out there, but they're quite good and well put together.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nIt comes entirely from our gay stereotype, who has fire powers. Wow, that isn't the least bit subtle or clever. And I'm sure one person is going to say \"didn't you have a gay character with fire powers in Omicron Squad?\" Which is true but I had a lot of gay characters and Anastasia wasn't a stereotype. So, not really the same at all.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAreas of Improvement:\\n\\n\r\n1. Gives the characters personality beyond tropes. One of the things that makes for a good hero comic is a strong sense of personality from the characters and well developed interpersonal dynamics among them. Plus strong villains instead of total knob heads.\u00a0\\n\r\n2. Consistent Tone. If you want something stupid and goofy like the Silver Age, just go for it. If you want something darker and stupider like an early Image comic, go for it. This clearly doesn't have a strong enough writer to pull off something between, so let's not fluctuate between those two extremes.\u00a0\\n\r\n3. A Consistent World. If you want to be like the X-men and show powered heroes doing their best in a world that hates and fears them, that's fine. If you want to have a future where everything is built up around a culture of hero worship, that's also fine. These two things do not work together.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nTiger & Bunny\u00a0is a complete mess. It can't decide which extreme tone it wants and ends up awkwardly and really badly mixing them, its heroes range from boring to obnoxious & offensive. It has plot holes so massive you could fly a 747 through them. The world building is wildly inconsistent. The \"twists\" are really obvious to the point of being bland. They treat their audience like it's made up of a bunch of morons. The sponsorships are tacky as hell and it's just never interesting or entertaining. My final rating is going to be a 2/10. This anime sucks.\u00a0\\n",

            "content": "Coming in as a Western anime fan it is hard to not be skeptical of an anime about superheroes. Considering our own comic book industry and how it contrasts to anime in general, I almost would never consider the possibility of an anime successfully capturing the world of superheroes. Perhaps this is why I consider Tiger & Bunny to be one of the most pleasant surprises I have seen in quite a while.\r\nTiger & Bunny is a story about corporate sponsored superheroes called \"Next\", essentially mutants like those of X Men, who are constantly filmed on television in Sternbuild City. By engaging in heroic actsthe superheroes are given points in a contest to determine who the \"King of Heroes\" is, and by doing better in the competition the heroes provide better advertising for their sponsors.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the story lends itself to an interesting twist on superhero ideals. This is best represented by our two main characters Kotetsu who is known as the superhero Wild Tiger, and Barnaby, who Kotetsu nicknames Bunny. Kotetsu starts out the show as an old and washed up hero who believes in superhero ideals that are considered old fashioned by his peers. He values justice above all else, makes saving people his top priority, and could care less about what the sponsors want.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have Barnaby, or Bunny, who got into the hero business as an avenger seeking justice for his parents' death. At the start he only really cares about earning points in the hero competition, and doesn't place that much importance on Kotetsu's old fashioned ideas, and does everything to appease all the sponsors. The partnership that Barnaby would form with Kotetsu, Tiger & Bunny, would go on to be the defining relationship of the show. Their clash of ideals would lead both on to balancing each other out, as well as serve as one of the most amusing sources of comedy throughout the entire show's run.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be stressed that Tiger & Bunny, while not afraid to get serious at times, is overall a very fun and entertaining story about superheroes. The character interactions and development are often very amusing, and the world is built up magnificently. While also having nice action scenes throughout the story, Tiger & Bunny's greatest strength would definitely have to be its character building. As a great character driven story, the cast ends up being very likable and well made.\\n\\n\r\nAnother remarkable aspect of this show is its seamless ability to blend Western superheros into the world of anime. The costume and abilities of Kotetsu as Wild Tiger are all too familiar of more Western heroes, as are the villains like Jake Martinez who capture the Western psychopathic antagonist really well. I give the show a lot of praise because of its ability to connect to me as a Western fan, especially when so many animes are so confined in the Japenese markets.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show just manages to be a fun, and adventurous tale. It is one of the least offensive shows out there, and can be recommended to almost anyone. This show is perfect for anyone who gives a damn about superheroes, but is also compelling enough for almost anyone to enjoy. I hope to see more anime like this in the future.",

            "content": "Imagine a reality show focused around X-Men-este characters saving the day in very corny and clich\u00e9 ways. Now imagine that idea, but good and is actually very entertaining and has characters you seriously can't help but to cheer on, despite the corniness and clich\u00e9s.\r\nSTORY: Saturday morning cartoons about superheroes were awesome, but that's the past and those shows are near dead, but this anime here, this lovingly homage to those flashy costumed hero shows is quite frankly one of not only the best, but one of the most important anime created in 2011, it's one of those kind of anime while it isn't the mostoriginal thing ever, but the execution of its premise is executed hundred percent perfectly you'd look on similar anime and find them mediocre by comparison. Sure the series is heavy on being campy and borderline silly, but it's made that way, and works, it simply works. But there's a under taste of well thought up satire beneath the goofiness along with a future that is surprisingly dark and strongly character driven.\\n\r\nTiger & Bunny takes your average clich\u00e9 super hero show and almost turns the genre on its head by including the concept of a reality game like competitive television show with a points system where all of the heroes are sponsored by real life companies (Like Bandai for example) that adds an interesting depth to this series that others fail to achieve, challenging the characters to whether or not to take the call of justice and save the day or work for a superfluous award for popularity and bragging rights. That is where the most important development for the characters lay, and it's incredibly partnered up with two very fascinating main leads, Wild Tiger and Barnaby. \\n\\n\r\nTiger is one of the most realistically relatable character in anime I've personally ever seen, a single man in his thirties (Not a god damn teenager for once!) with a daughter with realistic problems such as putting his job as a hero (This show let's me say that being a superhero is job, like an office job even, if that's not unique, I wouldn't know what it would be) on a higher ground then his family, which isn't an easy decision to do, but with his dream that is important to himself he does what he has to do to achieve it despite that he comes off as, in the start of the show, a washed up has-been, the old fogey pass his prime who just can't keep up with the more popular heroes because he doesn't care for the points or for that matter what his TV directors tell him to do because all he wants to do is save the day, or for that matter get his merchandise based on him to even get looked at on the shelves, is forced to join up with the popular new comer, Barnaby, who even has the same powers as Tiger for the world's (Of this anime) first superhero team.\\n\r\nOpposite of Tiger, Barnaby is driven by revenge (Hold your moans and groans for a sec) to be become a superhero, he doesn't care for Tiger's old fashioned way of thinking what superheroes should be, he's out there to make himself as popular as possible, getting the points, all for the sake of his revenge, which quite frankly, is similar to popular anime. Barnaby comes off arrogant and somewhat cold, but he Tiger have an incredible chemistry that alone is entertaining to watch as they bicker and argue (Which has most of the show's comedy come forth) and their ideals clash despite that they are partners. As the show progresses, they become more understanding of each other, while they both gain equally outstanding character growth and development, yes, a revenge based character development that actually has favorable outcomes. You want to know why? Because the target(s) of revenge are developed adequately enough to be easily hated by both Barnaby and you the viewer, I guarantee that. \\n\\n\r\nNot only the characters Tiger and Barnaby are fleshed out to extraordinary lengths, but even the other heroes too, heck even the villains (Of course not to the point where Tiger and Barnaby are fleshed out, I mean they're the main characters, it's understandable they get the spotlight, if a series main cast has no priority development, you simply failed at making a show). Other Heroes include, Blue Rose the series, unfortunately, the real commercialized character (Pepsi anyone? No? I don't want one either) and main female character of the other heroes, she is pretty much that teenager the usual shonen action show would start with, SkyHigh, your typical boy scout of a man, who represents the typical hero of any superhero show, Origami Cyclone, the background character, literally the background character, Fire Emblem, the painfully stereotypical homosexual man with real fire power, Dragon Kid the tomboy little girl with kung fu skills paired with electricity powers, and Rock Bison, the least shown character in the series. Each of the other heroes do get their little background episode with brief development (With Blue Rose getting the most attention out of all of them) but are hardly deeper characters than respective character archetype, but along with the heroes, there's even a vigilante criminal killer, Lunatic, who even gets his own episode that completely rocks the world of Tiger&Bunny to its core, after kicking off the series surprisingly much darker tone later on than what the early episodes about friendship and whatnot was going about with.\\n\r\nBut it's each characters individual quirk that get fan reaction such as \"We want to see more of so-and-so\" is what makes these characters special to the series in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nWhile plot threads like Barnaby's revenge takes many twists and turns and Tiger's later on problems with his powers keep you on the edge of your seat with baited breath for happens next, Tiger&Bunny may come off as too cheesy, or too silly at times for some people, but it's that cheesiness and throwbacks to superhero shows with a satirical twist is what can keep viewers returning for more, and it helps that the core characters are interesting with satisfying developments.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: As great as the story this is, the animation is a bit iffy relaying on mostly CG animation (Similar but fortunately done better than that Gonzo is known for) is by Sunrises least talented animation crew, but this show is one of those kind of shows where it could only take off from the ground through endorsements from other companies, not just Sunrise. \\n\r\nDuring the CG scenes, the models look great, and the action scenes are well animated but the anime still falls into the category of \"3d on 2d\" so it looks awkward most of the time. While the 2d animation is fine, not terribly great, but fine either way. Character designs however, look great, very diverse, and very creative.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: As for the audio department, the background music sounds exactly like your average super hero show, which works perfectly for this series. The theme music however, is a bit bland, though as a bias opinion I like Unison Square Garden and their music is good enough to me. Voice acting is good and is probably the performance that stands out is definitely Tiger's, from bickering with Barnaby to just simple dialogue, he's a treat to listen to. No English dub has yet to emerge, but a show like this will definitely benefit from one.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Perfectly executed theme with a fun and exciting story to boot.\\n\r\n+ Great lead characters, Tiger is one of the best leads in an action anime I've seen in a good while.\\n\r\n+ Good humor and character interaction.\\n\r\n+ Legitimately love to hate villains.\\n\r\n+ Decent animation, with some of the best uses of 3d animation in 2d settings.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mixed:\\n\r\n+/- Side characters are likable / despite that they are stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Not enough attention to the rest of the cast.\\n\r\n- Might come off as too campy for some.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is this anime one of the most important anime of 2011? Because it has the potential to bring fans into anime with power equal to what Cowboy Bebop and Fullmetal Alchemist had, and is hopefully the first step of anime in general to finally move forward from the current and shameful trends of the anime of today.\\n",

            "content": "I wasn't going to watch this show. Nothing about the preview appealed to me in the slightest. Over the top action heros? Fighting in suits? Boring. \r\nThe funny thing is, that statement is absolutey correct, and absolutely false. Yes! it is over the top action heros fighting in suits. But it isn't boring in the slightest. From the first episode I was hooked. And the reason --> Kotetsu - Wild Tiger, the main character of the show. \r\nKotetsu is thick, honest, well meaning, and one of the most endearing characters I have come across in recent times! From the start, you find yourself totally onhis side. As others have mentioned, it is wonderful having a character who is not child/teenaged. Kotetsu is in his 30s, a dad to a 9 year old, has a kind of sensible head on his shoulders, and a penchant for destroying buildings. \\n\\n\r\nThe other superhaeros (which the exception of Bunny) play much smaller roles, but are still given their own story arcs. And, these were enjoyable too! I have noticed in some other shows where minor characters get their moment to shine the story is weaker, but these still ran along at a cracking pace, progressed the main story AND gave the viewer insight into the smaller ones. \\n\\n\r\nUnusually for me - I loved the end. I absolutely loved it! It has set it up perfectly for a second season (which I would welcome with open arms) but the if there wasn't one, I would be perfectly happy with it as is. \\n\\n\r\nSo, to summarise: charming characters, cracking pace, loads of humour, and lots of fun. I definitely reccomend Tiger and Bunny.",

            "content": "I'd like more people to give this show a chance.\r\nAt first glance at the title, the first impression was that the show \"Tiger & Bunny\" will be a cutesy show with talking tigers and bunnies. It is not.\r\nThis may be a disappointment for some.\r\nAnd looking at the promotional art, people assume \"Oh it's some mecha anime. Since I don't like mecha, I won't watch it.\" I assure you, this show is not about mechas at all. Those \"mechas\" are in actuality the main characters of the show in their power suits. Calling them \"mechas\" is akin to calling Tony Stark (of Iron Man fame) amecha pilot. \\n\\n\r\nNow, you must be wondering what this show actually IS. To be blunt, it's a hyperactive fluffy kid's show, much like the 7:00 Saturday morning cartoons many people used to watch way back when. The plot is extremely simple, and fast moving. It's basically a show about good old fashioned superheroes (attempting to) kick some bad guy butt.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're here to know more details, it's better to just look at the description and watch the show. It's extremely simplistic.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that isn't to say that there isn't anything for the older viewer. Besides some of the nostalgia rush that I get from watching this show, I see some intriguing plot factors pop up that separate this from any other anime or superhero show (Western or otherwise). \\n\\n\r\n1.) This show is STUFFED TO THE GILLS in product placement. This is not a bad thing. To the contrary, it adds to the appeal to the show. Rather than tasteless placement, it adds to the setting. These superheroes are commodities. Capitalism has taken advantage of the charismatic heroes, and they are used to advertise products. It's not much different from now, with people slapping celebrity names onto products in order to sell. \\n\\n\r\n2.) This show is light. While modern day superhero stories tend to go for \"darker and edgier\" plots (Watchmen, Batman, etc.), this show remains untouched by such baggage and instead opts for optimism and feel good messages. \"Believe in yourself. Be proud of who you are.\" You'll be rooting for the heroes the whole time.\\n\\n\r\n3.) The main character is an older man with a daughter. Let me tell you: this is mind blowing. Instead of using a child/teenage character as the protagonist, they use an aging papa bear character. The protagonist is someone the audience has someone to sympathize with, and many anime go the lazy route and use a child/teenager as the protagonist for us to sympathize with due to age similarity to the target audience. But Kotetsu is genuinely likable despite his older age setting.\\n\\n\r\n^TL;DR: The story is great and unique, and is quite different from modern day anime offerings and superhero shows. It uses it's premise and setting to its advantage.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization is great. Kotetsu is an idealist, though not frustratingly so. He's basically balancing his own individuality against the expectations of his employers, and his ability to compromise prevents long drawn out misunderstandings. The other heroes seem to have their own agenda, especially Kotetsu's unwilling partner, Barnaby. Characterization through action, not description, is the series' strong point. These aren't just archetypes with faces.\\n\\n\r\nMany complaints with the show deal with the CGI. Honestly, it's not to much of a problem. With some of the Karas staff on board, the CGI is integrated well, with no glaring problems. It beats some of the cheap 2D \"QUALITY\" animation that we are subject to every anime season.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show is wonderful. It makes me feel excited to see what's in store next, though I realize this may not be everyone's cup of tea: the whole \"Western\" feel of the show can throw people off. But it is this exact \"Western\" feel that made Cowboy Bebop and Trigun so successful, and I hope that this show continues to appeal to various demographics. \\n\\n\r\nI say give this show a shot for the first episode, and see if you feel like a kid waiting for next week's 7:00 Saturday morning cartoons.",

            "content": "Superheroes have long been a staple of popular culture, especially in the West, and over the years characters like Superman, Batman, Spiderman, and even The Hulk have become household names. With their popularity at an all-time high thanks to video game tie-ins and movie adaptations, it's only natural that pretenders to the thrones that Marvel and DC sit upon should crawl out of the woodwork.\r\nThe most obvious attempts to capitalise on the success of these comic-book creations have come from television and cinema, but while shows like \"Heroes\", \"Chronicle\" and \"Misfits\" have found a degree of success, the majority of attempts to reinvent, reboot orrevamp the superhero genre have ended in ignominy.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is where Tiger & Bunny swagger onto the stage.\\n\\n\r\nSet in Sternbild City (a fictional version of New York), the story begins 45 years after super-powered humans known as NEXT first began to appear. In the decades that followed, individuals with superhuman abilities took on the roles of heroes and villains, and over time the constant to and fro between both sides became a form of entertainment. Fast forward to NC 1978, where the forces for good have their own specialised broadcast - \"Hero TV\", corporate sponsorships, and a chance to accrue points in order to win the coveted title of \"King of Heroes\".\\n\\n\r\nEvery day brings new challenges for these intrepid do-gooders, but Sternbild City has been built upon many secrets, and when Barnaby Brooks Jr. takes his place amongst those who stand for truth and justice, the shadows of the past begin to move once more.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance Tiger & Bunny may seem like nothing more than a super-powered \"buddy\" show, and to a certain degree that's a fair assessment. The plot is relatively straightforward (but also rather predictable), and although there are several elements that add a veneer of complexity, none of these affect the pacing or progression of the storyline - mainly because it has been split into two major chapters. This has the effect of setting a \"deadline\" for the conclusion of certain arcs, which in turn adds a brevity to the narrative that prevents the atmosphere becoming stale.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately some viewers may find themselves annoyed by the fact that certain episodes appear to deviate from the main plot by focusing on one or more of the supporting characters. Now while this usually a valid complaint, these \"fillers\" often serve as a platform to introduce themes, characters or events that may have a lasting effect on the story proper. In addition to this, the episodes in question have very little impact on the flow of the narrative, and in a very real sense this show is a good example of how \"fillers\" can add to the whole story.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the visuals, Tiger & Bunny certainly looks the part, but it's not without its flaws. The artwork is of a good standard, with a nice variety of character designs, settings, and outlandish costumes that uphold the reputation of superheroes everywhere. The series is well animated for the most part, and while there are the usual (and very minor), anime-related problems when it comes to wardrobes, one particular issue continues to crop up throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nTechnology has progressed to the point where computer generated imagery can often be blended with more traditional animation to good effect, but for some reason Sunrise has decided to be a little more ostentatious in its approach - which has led to a few complications. The main problem lies in the movement of the heroes after they don their costumes, and in several action sequences the studio's attempts to exaggerate the actions of the characters can make the entire scene look more than a little ... odd.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, many viewers may forgive the slightly weird feeling they get from the CG, but only because the overall look is decidedly refreshing and the show makes very good use of some rather nice visual effects.\\n\\n\r\nTiger & Bunny features two opening sequences, both of which introduce the main heroes (with particular attention paid to their sponsors), alongside a few short scenes that display their powers. The only real difference between the two OP's are the songs attached to them - \"Orion o Nazoru\" by Unison Square Garden (a rather upbeat rock song), and \"Missing Link\" by Novels (a surprisingly bittersweet rock ballad). The series also features two closing sequence, the first of which is a fairly simple affair that focuses on the characters of Kaburagi Koutetsu and Barnaby Brooks Jr. while \"Hoshi no Sumika\" by Aobozu plays out. The second ED is much more in keeping with the great traditions of the anime industry as it uses still images of the characters alongside some fairly basic visual effects - all to the J-Pop stylings of Tamaki's \"Mind Game\"\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to background music it seems like Tiger & Bunny is on firmer ground, and much of the soundtrack is littered with anthems that echo of heroism, action, and good old comic-book cheese. In addition to this there are a wide range of well defined audio effects, and overall the series is remarkably balanced in terms of its choreography.\\n\\n\r\nAs one might expect from a superhero tale, the dialogue is awash wish one-liners, catchphrases and other sentences that tend come out of the mouths of costumed vigilantes. That said, the script is surprising in both its intelligence and humour, and although there's the ever-present shadow of cheese, it's not enough to deter the voice actors from delivering some fine performances. Hirata Hiraoki and Morita Masakazu are in good form as the laconic veteran Kaburagi Koutetsu (a.k.a. Wild Tiger), and the fiery young Barnaby Brooks Jr., but while the two have a good on-screen rapport, the cornerstone of the dialogue is the camaraderie between the heroes as a group.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the nice things about Tiger & Bunny is that the characters represent a wide range of ages and backgrounds, and although the majority of them are adults, the show also tries to offer some insight into the personalities of the more prominent teenaged heroes. Koutetsu is a particularly interesting individual - a widowed father who rarely sees his ten-year old daughter (who lives with her grandmother), because of his \"work\", and this lays a very strong and unusual (for anime that is), foundation for development. A big plus is that rather than travel down the Ikari Gendou route towards a \"bad end\", the writers have decided to adopt an approach that's more akin to \"Lethal Weapon\", with Koutetsu in the role of the aging veteran.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Barnaby Brooks Jr. is Batman.\\n\\n\r\nNo, seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that where Barnaby is concerned, nobody has tried to think outside of the box (as they do with Koutetsu), and it's for this reason that his background is one of the biggest stereotypes in the world of superheroes. Because of his origins, many of the changes in his personality over the course of the series can feel derived, and this is especially true where his relationship with Koutetsu is concerned. Thankfully the show has a pretty good set of supporting characters, and unlike many other anime, the series uses the relationships between the majority of the characters rather well.\\n\\n\r\nIf one compares Tiger & Bunny to its Western counterparts then it manages to hold its own, but only just as the weight of the superhero genre in America and Europe is enough to crush almost any challenger. That said, the series is a refreshing change from the shounen fare that's being served these days, and one of the most laudable aspects is that Sunrise haven't been afraid to take inspiration from Western media.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings up one small but important point.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of popular heroes were created decades ago, and since then there have been many attempts to update them so that they always appear to be in keeping with modern trends and tastes. Unfortunately these changes are only skin-deep, and aside from recent titles like \"Heroes\", \"Misfits\", \"Kick Ass\", \"Chronicle\" and \"Super\", the majority of Western tales don't really serve as a good reflection of modern times, even if their core message remains valid. It's in this particular area where Tiger & Bunny stands above many other stories, mainly because of its focus on \"reality TV\", celebrity culture and corporate sponsorship. In a very real sense the anime highlights a direction that has been blatantly ignored, and while the whole concept may seem alien to diehard fans of Western comic-books, the simple fact is that modern superhero stories tend to follow the same formula that has been the mainstay of the industry for decades.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tiger & Bunny is an enjoyable take on the genre that blends several old ideas and puts them in a setting that, while futuristic, is more a reflection of modern society than many people might initially believe. The mixture of super-powered shenanigans, comedy and drama is very much in keeping with the best traditions of action movies everywhere, and in all honesty that's probably the best way to approach the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut that doesn't automatically make it no-brain entertainment.",

            "content": "Before it came out, I saw the title and a poster art, and I figured it would be Playboy-esque.  Or about Mafia.  Then on a fansub site, I saw it tagged as a shounen mecha with action and comedy.  Now I was confused.  But whichever it was (about Mafia or mecha) it wasn't gonna be good.\r\nThen I saw that episode 1 was on Hulu.  HULU?  Was this legitimacy?  OK, so I watched it.  It was not what I was expecting.  It's not about Mafia or mecha.  It's about SUPERHEROES!  Why couldn't somebody just comeout and say so?  But mind you, this isn't like the other Japanese superhero animes that are re-makes revolving around American-made characters.  This ain't Wolverine or Iron Man, folks.  No, this is good stuff.  GOOOOOOD.  Just count how many times I use \"awesome\" and \"cool\" in this review.\\n\\n\r\nHere we have bright and saturated visuals, comedy, some pretty sweet action sequences, loveable characters, and enough drama and melodrama to keep a sieve full.  And an interesting twist on athlete sponsorship.\\n\\n\r\nSYNOPSIS:\\n\\n\r\nThis is Stern Bild, the bright city of the (American) future, where citizens are kept safe by the troop of the city's resident heroes.  But these heroes aren't freelancers or government employees.  No, they're privately sponsored.  After all, it takes big bucks to get those suits done at the dry cleaners.  But that sponsorship doesn't just mean they get corporate logos slapped all over them like a biker or racecar.  No, they have to let camera crews follow them around, to broadcast their feats in reality-TV style.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character is one of these heroes, Kotetsu, whose hero name is Wild Tiger.  Back in the day, he was cool.  But now he's older, and has lost his shine.   And his tween daughter thinks he's an absolute dweeb.\\n\\n\r\nWhen his current hero company goes under, he gets transferred to another, where they aren't too thrilled about having an old has-been hero.  So they make the unusual decision to partner him up with another hero, and sell them to audiences as a team.  They pick one that has the exact same superpower as Wild Tiger.  And it happens that this guy's everything that Kotetsu is not: fresh, new, young, arrogant, no sense of humor, dutiful to the sponsors, and he uses his real name for his hero work.  Everyone knows that heroes are supposed to have a secret identity!  Young upstart.  \\n\\n\r\nSo Kotetsu's partnership with Barnaby Brooks Jr. gets off to a rough beginning.  And it stays that way for a loooooong time, while Kotetsu keeps trying to loosen \"Bunny-chan\" up.  (Yes, Barnaby is the 'Bunny' in Tiger & Bunny.)   But Bunny isn't a hero just to do good.  He has a specific goal in mind, and he won't let Kotetsu's goofiness distract him.  \\n\\n\r\nIt turns out they will both need to learn a lot about each other to get this partnership to work.\\n\\n\r\nMOST EVERYTHING ELSE:\\n\\n\r\nI tried a few minutes of some of the animes based on Marvel characters.  I didn't like them.  And judging by their low MAL ratings, most other people don't either.  But this is an original story.  Fresher, brighter, and with no comic book (or manga) to compare it to.  But you can still see classic superhero roots, in the villains particularly.  They're generally very flashy, unlike real criminals.  And hey, we even get a mad scientist.  \\n\\n\r\nEven though Tiger and Bunny are our main characters, there is a whole cast of heroes that they work alongside: ice-caster Blue Rose (who has a crush on Tiger), the fire-shooting Fire Emblem, wind-warping Sky-High, hunky Rock Bison, tomboyish Dragon Kid, and Japanophile Origami.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there's non-hero characters.  Kotetsu's daughter Kaede, his mom, his former boss Ben.  His suit-maker, Saito, with the quiet voice (he gets his own subtitles, since apparently Tiger is the only one who can hear him).  Agnes, the producer of HERO-TV, the reality show that follows the heroes around.  Legend, the hero that saved Kotetsu as a kid, and encouraged him to become a hero himself.  The rogue Lunatic, dispenser of vigilante justice, who I think most people wanted to get more screentime.  (I wanted to see more of him too; after all, he's the only guy whose suit had bell-bottoms.  BELL-BOTTOMS.)\\n\\n\r\nIt has a couple of story arcs.  Some are as short as one episode, and give us a close-up look at the life of one of the heroes in the story.  Other arcs span several episodes, as our heroes battle the villain of the moment.  But there are clues scattered throughout the series that are used later.  \\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are generally pretty cool.  There isn't one every episode, but when they come, they are, like, AWESOME!!!!  \\n\\n\r\nThere's comedy aplenty, of the light kind.\\n\\n\r\nBut what's at the core of the show is DRAMA.  Lots of it.  If the scene involving the little boy and the trading cards doesn't impact you some way, then you should just stop watching, because that's the melodramatic slant in this show.  There's the drama of a dad trying to get his kid to say he's cool.  Promising to meet with her, but then having to break his promise because he has been called to an assignment.  There's the drama of a man whose goal is to take revenge for his parents who were murdered.  You almost wonder if Barnaby suffers from depression, since he keeps getting bogged down in melodramatic angst, and takes it out on anybody who tries to get close to him.  And the one who tries to do that is our very own Kotetsu.  Barnaby is in serious need of some professional counseling.\\n\\n\r\nIncidentally, there is a bit racial variety.  Which is unusual for anime, but was probably obligatory since the story is set, after all, in a place much like the United States.  We have a couple of black characters: The mayor of Stern Bild (\u00e0 la Obama, I'm sure); Ben, who is Kotetsu's former boss and current mentor; and Fire Emblem (a lot of viewers chew out his character because he is the clich\u00e9 gay character you see a lot in anime; oh well, the makers are still Japanese after all).  And Kotetsu and his family, and Saito are Asian...or more specifically, Japanese.  No other kinds of Asians around apparently.  And all the other characters are probably white.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very awesome.  The setting is often the sparky-lit city at night.  Outlining is done in brown instead of the usual black, so the everything looks \"warm\" and alive.  Action scenes are done well.  And there's lots of CGI.  Which makes some purists mad.  The suits are where you see it most.  Some people squawk at this, which isn't fair, because it's usually done pretty well, especially for the chunky suits that Tiger and Barnaby wear.  The only place where it doesn't work very well is Fire Emblem's skin-tight suit.  Though his cape with the creeping-flames pattern is cool.  I'd want one of those myself.\\n\\n\r\nStyle.  There's lots of style.  There's something about this that almost says \"superheroes are a fashion statement.\"  Well, that and the fact that Tiger and Bunny almost ALWAYS wear the same clothes.  It's just begging for people to cosplay them.  And the music seems to fit in with the style.  The music is cool.  Awesomely awesome.  It varies from jazz to opera and places in-between.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Pixar movie \"The Incredibles.\"  Something about that retro-esque heroes-in-real-life feels very similar to this.\\n\\n\r\nMAKE SURE to watch after the ED in each episode.  Often, there's a little bit of extra story at the end before the previews roll.  And by then you might as well watch the previews too, since they're usually narrated by either Tiger or Barnany, and begin with him saying \"Hi, I'm Tiger, the member of Tiger and Bunny who wears a beard!\" or something else idiotic.  Also, the episode titles are all in English, and based off some proverb.  Tiger doesn't even try to say the next episode title, but Barnaby does, and sound pretty horrible.  Some people said it was worth it to watch each episode just to hear Barnaby's Engrish at the end.\\n\\n\r\nSome viewers felt that the final arc in the series was a bit lame.  I wouldn't say it was terrible, but it definitely did go for the cliche situations of \"superhero meets the big boss\" and more.  Not necessarily bad, but it raised the bar pretty high for itself by then.  But fans are waiting to see if there will be a second season\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nWHAT IT'S NOT:\\n\\n\r\nIt's not primarily action.  We don't get a full-blown action sequence every episode.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's not primarily comedy, unless you want to laugh at Barnaby's childish attitude, or Kotetsu's blunders.  Which ARE funny.\\n\\n\r\nThere's very little ecchi.  Unless you count Blue Rose's costume.\\n\\n\r\nThere's little romance.  Blue Rose obviously has a thing for Kotetsu, even though he's a generation older than herself.  (It's OK Blue Rose, I sorta do too.)  Yaoi fans may be disappointed that nothing goes on between our two main characters.  (Though that hasn't prevented scores of Yaoi doujinshi from being made.)\\n\\n\r\nIt's also not hugely\u2026.intelligent.  I have to say this for people who are expecting an amazingly intricate and solid plot.  While the story overall is good and throws a few cureveballs, there are some mental goofs.  But that is all forgiven because the drama is SOOOO feel-good, and the characters are so loveable.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nI can say I'm very happy to see this show as popular as it is.  I wrote a review after seeing episode 4, when the show's MAL rating was below 7.  Now it's above 8.  I'm happy it's getting love.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most shounen series which are primarily about an action or suspense-driven story, Tiger and Bunny's partnership, or attempt at a partnership, is the main draw.  You care about them, and the other characters.  You REALLY CARE.  You might even say this is meddling in seinen territory.  Which is probably why this attracts viewers from all sorts of demographics.  If you like drama, and a little action, comedy, nice music and animation, and an interesting setting, please, please give this a try.  But beware.  You might just get hooked.  \\n",

Of course, Sunrise is probably the most incompetent major studio when it comes to handling a story and has been for years, but I'm willing to put my hopes and dreams for anime's future on the line for Tiger&Bunny. \r\nThe premise: Superheroes are real, and they're the latest and greatest tool for capitalism. Anyone who's anyone that has a superpower is sponsored by a company, and they all compete on a reality TV show where they catch crooks and stop disasters fromhappening. Their catch phrases, names, costumes and everything else about the heroes are a corporate product designed to sell merchandise and stuff. \\n\\n\r\nBehind all this is our boy Kotetsu, an idealistic aging superhero who calls himself Wild Tiger. He's not cool anymore. His merchandise isn't selling, his sponsor's the victim of a corporate takeover and there's a new kid on the block with the exact same powers as him. The kicker is that he's been paired up with this new guy due to a new corporate deal and has to work with him on a daily basis. He also has a wife who's either dead or divorced and a daughter that he doesn't live with, opting instead for a semi-fancy apartment lined with empty booze bottles. The other heroes he works with are also real people, who have their own lives and takes on their situation.\\n\\n\r\nLike his superstar partner, Barnaby. Bunny-boy's a dead-serious realist who's all about efficiency, but still has lots of charisma and can lose his temper from time to time. His dynamic with Kotetsu is pulled off very believably. At the start, they both definitely have their issues with one another, but it becomes unclear who's really being the difficult one in the relationship. Their development and characterization is handled very well, with personalities and actions that change and interact believably in a well-paced manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe backstories behind these characters have all been enjoyable and unique so far. Everyone faces issues involving things like friends, family, uncertainties for their futures, self confidence, money, etc. You know, really relate-able things. Melodrama that we're all used to seeing in anime has been pretty sparse, and when it has popped up it's been handled professionally. T&B is very much a character driven series, and it knows what it's doing.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the show is pretty cool. People will bitch about the CGI used for some of the superheroes, but those are usually the same people who find great interest in anime like A-Channel, where the style is so banal that they don't even have to think about whether it's good or not. In terms of art design, the heroes remind me of a Ultraman/Marvel/Ultimate Muscle/Karas mix, which is neat. You get a good meld of Western comics and Eastern Tatsunoko. The animation and CGI themselves are just dandy, every motion is smooth and the art is crisp with no \"QUALITY\" in sight, and has maintained that level of goodness for a third of the series now.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing for the show is great, and delivers campy fun and a mature character-driven story to back it up. Dialogue is witty and engaging. The humor is actually funny and doesn't rely on outrageous visual gags, ecchi or references to Japan's asinine culture. The drama feels real and relate-able, especially in the later episodes, and doesn't rely on contrived nonsense, but rather on human emotion and conflict. The pacing for the episodes is wonderful, and even the parts without the CGI heroes jumping around had me interested and entertained. Each episode delivers a solid 23 minutes of content, with no meaningless filler or superfluous action. They're all put together very well. The series pacing as a whole has been fairly smooth, and even during the introduction episodes I felt like the show was going somewhere. Every episode develops the characters or background by a lot, this is a show that doesn't waste the viewer's time.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, I've seen some complaints about the \"lack of action\", which I can't do anything but shake my head at. I guess I have to keep reminding myself that we live in a world where wanton garbage takes precedence over originality and good execution, both of which this show has. I highly recommend it if you like those sort of things.",

            "content": "[Insert obligatory pretentious quote here]\r\n#3deep5me\r\nI have been told that I recommend this anime a bit too much.\r\nThat's because it's so underrated. Every time i tell someone to watch it, they give me shit like \"I don't watch mech\" or \"Looks gay\"\r\nIT IS NOT FUCKING MECH. Learn to read the damn tags.\r\nAs for the gay part, people can ship whichever characters they want, doesn't make it canon. As long as you avoid the doujins, you're good. Unless of course you like that kind of stuff, which is perfectly fine.\r\nI do admit the banner doesn't look too appealing. Trust me, the anime looks much better.\r\nStory-\r\nAnime about peoplewith special abilities are far from rare. But they are rarely done well. Tiger & Bunny is about people with special abilities called NEXT. Some of these NEXT are chosen by sponsors to be superheroes. These superheroes are in a competition on live TV. Hero TV is the most popular show on TV. The hero with the most point at the end of the season is crowned as the 'King of Heroes' \\n\r\nI found the idea of commercialised superheroes to be really fresh.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is more important, the competition or people's lives?\\n\r\nThe story explores the main duo. It highlights the contrast in their views of justice and what it means to be a superhero. Another notable character is a vigilante, Lunatic, who believes that all criminals must die. He also happens to be my favourite character, his backstory was really touching. I actually gave a shit about him, and I'm a sociopath.\\n\r\nIt's no just a mindless action, comedy though. It does make you think a bit. Since I didn't open with a real quote, here you go-\\n\r\n\"The justice you speak of is truly weak and frail.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\r\nThe character designs are unique and I quite like them. The costumes/suits are all very different.\\n\r\nThe visuals are stunning, even Redline pales in comparison. There's just a slight problem when the characters are in their costumes, the CGI is a bit jerky and looks weird. But this isn't a major problem and is only noticeable in a few scenes. Other than that Eyegasm.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe two openings were very different from each other, but both were excellent. Orion wo nazoru is a cheerful song while Missing Link is a more emotional. The first ending was decent and the second was even better.\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a brilliant job, especially Hirata Hiroaki.\\n\r\nI also checked out the english dub, but I wasn't too impressed. I didn't think Yuri Lowenthal was able to pull off Bunny's character very well.\\n\r\nSo I recommend sticking to the sub.\\n\r\nThe OST is absolutely brilliant.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\r\nThis is one of the major strengths of Tiger & Bunny.\\n\r\nEach and every character is well written. We are shown the backstory of all relevant characters. There is a considerable amount of development in most characters. The supporting characters especially standout. \\n\r\nTiger is a 40 year old man, with a teenage daughter. This is one of the things which sets Tiger & Bunny apart. The main character isn't a perfect teenager. He has several existing problems. Including his relationship with his daughter.\\n\r\nBunny is a cliched character. But that's one of the reason he stands out. cause he's the only one like that.\\n\r\nLunatic is my waifu.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\nWell we all love superhero movies and we all love anime. Why wouldn't we love this. \\n\r\nThe show really has something for everyone. Even a tad bit of fanservice, which you won't specifically notice unless you want to. It's pretty funny. And was a fun ride altogether.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nIt's a 10/10 Masterpiece you will love it.\\n\\n\r\nNow stop reading this shit and go watch it.\\n",

            "content": "Up in the sky, look!  It\u2019s a bird!  It\u2019s a plane!  \r\nNo, it\u2019s...  Billboard Man!  Fighting crime, defending the innocent, an whoring himself out like it\u2019s his first night in Hollywood!\r\nIt\u2019s the distant future for us, and a bizarre mutation has started to occur among our population.  Human beings with superhuman powers are popping up everywhere, and we\u2019ve taken to calling them Nexts...  Presumably because \u2018mutants\u2019 was taken.  We initially rejected these outcasts, until they decided to don costumes and assume the role of superheroes, defending the very people who judged them on live, national TV!\r\nUnfortunately forthe widowered single father Kotetsu Kaburagi, the human genome isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s been evolving.  In the decades since Hero TV was established, he finds that he\u2019s become irrelevant, with younger and more capable fighters joining to overshadow him.  His rank is low amongst his co-workers, nobody ever buys his merchandise, and to make matters worse, a new superhero named Barnaby Brooks has thrown his hat into the ring, sporting the exact same power that Kotetsu has...  And to keep himself from getting fired, he has to take up a new mantle as this rookie\u2019s partner!\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, Tiger and Bunny seems to have one of the most tired premises in recent anime history...  That is to say, a large cast of both heroes and villains who\u2019ve mysteriously developed their own unique powers.  Just off the top of my head, I can name several titles with that exact same premise...  Darker than Black, the Index Franchise, Canaan, S-CRY-ED, Speed Grapher, and Getbackers, to name a few.  And that view point isn\u2019t completely unfair, since the array of powers it features is probably the least imaginative in the bunch.  \\n\\n\r\nBut where Tiger and Bunny differs from these other shows is in it\u2019s core concept, which is essentially an amusing combination of X-Men and Nascar.  The heroes are sponsored and basically controlled by wealthy real-life corporations, who tell them how to act and dress while decorating their costume with different logos.  They advertise these logos by competing on Hero TV, earning points based on just how successful their defense of the city was that season.  I can honestly say I\u2019ve never seen an idea even close to that one in my entire life.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was produced by a company named Sunrise, a prolific animation studio with a lot of very impressive previous work under their belt.  They\u2019re known by fans as Sunrise Smooth, a reference to the fluidity of most of their efforts.  Unfortunately, the same can\u2019t really be said for Tiger and Bunny.  It uses both 3D and 2D style animation, but it doesn\u2019t blend them...  The 3D is used in action scenes, or just whenever the heroes are in costume, and the 2D is used practically everywhere else.  \\n\\n\r\nThe 3D animation is actually very impressive, and yes, very smooth.  It turns just about every action scene into a pulse pounding, exciting thrill ride that it should be.  Unfortunately, the 3D is still in effect when our heroes are wearing their costumes outside of action, as well...  Whether they\u2019re giving an interview, lounging around the company gym, or just interacting with one another, and at times, this can sometimes look really...  Really...  Awkward.  It\u2019s mostly due to the fact that with so much money going into the 3D animation, the regular animation obviously took a huge budget cut.  With this side of the coin, we get some of the cheapest looking animation I\u2019ve ever encountered, from hideous walk cycles to the heavy abuse of key frames.  Seeing that in the background, the three dimensional characters look out of place to an almost creepy degree.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork, however, almost completely makes up for it.  This show is set in a fictional American city, and as such, the art and character designs have a very surprising western aesthetic to them.  Aside from a few wide-eyed children, the characters almost always look more like American comic book characters than anime characters.  I\u2019m serious, too...  Virtually every single frame of this show looks like it could have been taken directly from a Marvel or DC comic book, which is a touch that makes the sometimes stiff animation a lot more palatable.  The backgrounds, too, are highly detailed, and the bustling metropolis known as Stern Bild looks like a dead ringer for a futuristic New York City.  The architecture of this setting is beautiful and imaginative, even if some of the structures look entirely implausible in  design.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters inhabiting this city, much like they would be in real life, are racially diverse, forming a shockingly progressive melting pot with nary a stereotype in sight.  Normally, if I were watching an anime that featured White, Black, Hispanic, Russian, Japanese and especially Chinese characters, I would be on the edge of my seat waiting for something offensive to happen.  But aside from a few exaggerated physical traits...  Nope!  Every character\u2019s given a proportionate amount of respect, with their ethnic backgrounds never even slightly becoming an issue in the story.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that is, except for the gay character.  Granted, he\u2019s cool and likeable, and I appreciate that they made him the only hero rich enough to own his own sponsor company, but the homophobia in his design is still pretty blatant.  He talks in a throaty, effeminate falsetto and flirts with pretty much every other male character in the show...  Especially Kotetsu, who already has the barely clad Blue Rose inexplicably pining for him.  If you were to create a sliding scale that ranked all of the LGBT characters in anime history in terms of how offensive they were, he\u2019d be somewhere close to the crossdresser from the Battle Royal manga.  It\u2019s a disappointing step backward for a series that\u2019s otherwise been able to take two giant steps forward against the abundant racial homogeny of the anime medium.\\n\\n\r\nIronically, though, if this show were ever adapted into live action, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that every single character would be Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters?  Well, the main focus of the series is on the ups and downs of Kotetsu and Barnaby\u2019s partnership, so several of the main characters got the short end of the screen time stick.  Characters like Dragon Kid and Origami Cyclone are barely featured outside of having an episode each to themselves, and Rock Bison doesn\u2019t even really get that much.  Fire Emblem, Blue Rose and Sky High get a bit more than that, but they all still play supporting roles to our two mains and their families.  \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, it wasn\u2019t for nothing...  The titular characters are fleshed out, interesting, and very well developed.  Kotetsu, or Wild Tiger as he\u2019s publicly known, is very thoroughly portrayed as the aging veteran trying his damnedest to keep up with new ideas and techniques while still holding on to his more traditional values by the skin of his teeth.  As altruistic as he may be, he\u2019s a very flawed character, who refuses to let anybody ever worry about him...  This stubborn attitude causes strain in both his professional and personal life, as he has a lot of trouble connecting not only with his partner but also with his ten year old daughter.  Despite his insistence that saving people is more important than earning points or selling merchandise, he still clearly cares about his placement in the rankings.  This could make a lot of leading men unlikeable, but in Tiger\u2019s case, it just serves to make him more sympathetic.\\n\\n\r\nHis partner, Barnaby Brooks Junior...  Or Bunny, as Kotetsu irritatingly came up with...  Is in many ways the exact opposite.  He\u2019s the newest super hero on the circuit, and he rejects a lot of the older notions to the point that he doesn\u2019t even bother keeping his identity a secret.  He fights with his head rather than his heart, preferring logical strategy to Kotetsu\u2019s bold, gallant approach.  He\u2019s very direct with people, to the point where he jumps to conclusions at all the worst times.  His tragic past is your typical \u2018Batman\u2019s parents\u2019 story, but the way it\u2019s portrayed...  And the way it shaped his views on justice... is so genuine that you can\u2019t help rooting for him.\\n\\n\r\nThey clash a lot in the beginning, working together solely out of the interest of their employment, but as time goes on they do become closer, and they stop having to pretend to be friends.  This development is shown very naturally throughout the series, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that it\u2019s portrayed through the outstanding, flawless performances of Wally Wingert and Yuri Lowenthal.  The entire dub is very well cast, with nearly all of the actors melting seamlessly and in some cases unrecognizably into their roles, but it\u2019s the main duo by far that takes the cake.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is the part where I have to talk about the writing, and it\u2019s not a part that I\u2019m really looking forward to.  The story in Tiger and Bunny is fast paced, well executed, and hits all the right notes, with exciting CG battles, edge-of-your-seat suspense, and just enough down time to let us form attachments to almost all of the main characters...  Even the ones that don\u2019t get a lot of screen time.  However, that story wouldn\u2019t have progressed at all without the help of inexplicably childish behavior, constant coincidences that directly challenge the suspension of disbelief, and foreshadowing so clumsily handled that a lot of the more serious plot twists can be seen coming from a mile away.  \\n\\n\r\nThere are dozens of conflicts and mysteries that could easily be solved in ways that the viewer will often wind up SHOUTING at the screen, and it almost feels insulting when the answers you come up with are put into play at the last moment for dramatic effect.  Yes, timing is important in a story, but even Dora the Explorer doesn\u2019t make the audience shout out obvious answers as often as Tiger and Bunny does.  Hell, some of the villains are so obviously villains that they might as well have had the last name Palpatine.  Early in the first few episodes, an astute viewer may start wondering things about the nature of Hero TV, ultimately coming to a conclusion that just has to be, and of course winds up being, one of the biggest reveals of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s to say nothing about the lack of originality at play.  While the two titular characters and the final villain have some interesting and unique abilities, there doesn\u2019t seem to be an original idea in the bunch.  Most of the heroic supporting characters have commonplace powers that manipulate ice, fire, lightning, and wind.  There are also powers based on Colossus, Morph, and a lighter version of Rogue from the Xmen.  As far as the villains go, you\u2019ll find characters who\u2019re based on Emma Frost(Or more likely the diamond woman from Speed Grapher), Sandman, The Hood, and others.  Even when you put Kotetsu and Barnaby\u2019s powers aside, the Iron Man suits they wear are just that...  Iron Man suits.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the vigilante Lunatic may have a somewhat original power, think about this;  He\u2019s a judge who experienced emotional trauma as a kid, and grew up believing all evil doers must be killed...  And he uses his powers to do just that, murdering the wicked while criticizing those who let them live.  He\u2019s basically Teru Mikami, except that he has the long white hair and shady face that have become trademarks of any obvious villain.  And by comparison, he\u2019s actually one of the better villains in the series...  He\u2019s nowhere near as obvious as the main villain, whose convoluted master plan and backstory turn the entire final story arc into a rat-king sized clusterfuck of plotholes that had me more confused than excited.  It\u2019s actually kind of amazing.\\n\\n\r\nTiger and Bunny was dubbed and released stateside by Viz Media, and is reasonably priced both online and on common store shelves.  Two films have also been released in the following years, but in typical anime fashion, they\u2019re just slightly altered retellings of the series.  In other words, they\u2019re full fledged cash grabs.  I haven\u2019t seen them myself, but apparently the first one is available stateside, undubbed, and also fairly cheap.  \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, I really enjoyed it.  I connected instantly with Wild Tiger, as his story was undoubtedly and very effectively the heart and soul of the series.  It\u2019s a really fun story, with an intriguing idea, great comedy, and it has a highly diverse cast of likeable characters.  It\u2019s not very original, but it\u2019s sincere, and it\u2019s clear that some very real heart went into it\u2019s creation.  It looks beautiful when it tries, but it doesn\u2019t try often enough.  It\u2019s also heavily flawed below the surface, and there\u2019s a lot of points where you have to turn off your brain to fully enjoy it...  I don\u2019t like doing that, so there were a lot of times where I just felt alienated from the fun that I should have been having.  But to it\u2019s credit, the story is so engrossing that those problems didn\u2019t really bother me as much until my second viewing, and even then, there\u2019s still a lot to love about it.  It\u2019s an enthusiastic love letter to American comic book lore, and it damn well feels like it.  I give Tiger and Bunny a 7/10.",

            "content": "I really hate it when a potentially fun premise finds itself eventually getting bogged down by the conventional elements it was seemingly trying to subvert. Tiger and Bunny's premise was unique in the fact you had superheroes on a reality show competing for points and being corporate-sponsored, which had me thinking this series would get its fun off exploiting the premise and poking fun of the absurdities commonplace with superhero formulas when I first heard about it. Instead, it creates plot development out of Kotetsu and Barnaby getting used to each other as a superhero duo when the former's company gets bought out and thetwo running into developments involving a vigilante hero and a crime organization. The series does decently flesh out both characters as the show prominently focuses on both of them and we get to learn what drove both men into becoming heroes. It also introduces some decent ideas explored such as said vigilante hero in the form of Lunatic and the idea of superheroes losing their powers, as what happens to a major character in the second half to Tiger and Bunny.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, Tiger and Bunny is easily one of the better-looking titles to come out for the year thus far sporting plenty of detail and color to go along with the vast environments shown through the city landscapes of Sternbild City. This same high-quality also went into creating the character designs as the costumes of the heroes are slick to look at, especially the costumes worn by Kotetsu and Barnaby. Action scenes are fluid to look at and get fairly diverse as there are chase scenes by foot and motorcycle, aerial fights and hand-to-hand combat.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Tiger and Bunny finds itself getting bogged down quite a bit by its conventional elements which make it almost seem like a cookie-cutter shounen anime. A number of the characters are tacked on with an archetype that has been done to death in typical plot setups such as Kotetsu being the slow-witted and impulsive hero of the series, Fire Emblem your stereotypical gay man and Blue Rose a tsundere. The show also gets into the annoying habit of resorting to contrived plot developments or conveniently ditching certain points of the plot to help advance any major plot developments that the Heroes are caught up in, particularly with its major baddies in both halves of the show. I couldn't help but wonder the number of times the show resorted to deus ex machina just to force the plot into a certain direction without making sense of things, especially when the Heroes were put into situations where they were seemingly on the losing end of fights as they fought against villains who were either too powerful to be defeated easily or developed an elaborate plot that fell apart due to contrived developments. Both major plots had their potential yet the series fails to provide a solid resolution to both because things get too messy and/or cliched in their developments towards the final moments of both arcs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tiger and Bunny had its potential yet fell flat due to it not escaping the more conventional elements that get tossed into its path. While still having some decent ideas it explores and having its moments in developments with Barnaby and Kotetsu, it still made for a fairly mediocre watch for me and I imagine enough folks will be eating up the news of the series having a sequel planned in the works.",

That was my initial impression until my friend had highly recommend it. You definitely have to push through the first episode if you do not like episodic battle anime. The story will get better and you will have your darker plot!\r\nThe art needs getting use to, I guess it is not very traditional. I can't remember the sound but I like the opening.\r\nWhat I love about this story.. ohh the characters. There are so many hidden facets andthe characters are developed quite well (no one dimensional characters here). \\n\\n\r\nThis may not be that appealing to people looking for a romantic anime (there isn't much) but if you are looking for x-men themes  like superhero woes and supervillains motivations, you won't be disappointed.",

Art is pretty good and sounds and voice actors are ok. Good if you don't know anything you want to watch, I'd say overall for me a 7. If you don't mind inconsistencies and like superheroes, i'd say it could be an 8. If you ignore the last 2 episodes which were atrocious.\r\nThis gets a 2 because there are a lot of inconsistencies that happen sometimes that take me out of it (like stupid decisions of characters), but inthe last 2 episodes there are just sooo many ass pulls just to further the plot that i just can't give it more than that. I can't give examples because otherwise it would be a spoiler, but imagine a character without powers teleporting all over the place when there is no possibility of him ever being or doing things that fast, just to further the plot. And that's just one example, so many more in just those last 2 episodes. Just completely bad writing. Can't even tell if it was rushed or not, because several sequences have characters just staring at eachother when they should be moving or fighting. Even if rushed i doubt it could have ended this badly.",

I was shocked so I turned I  on ep 1 expecting to hate it and I ended up watching 14 eps in a single day loving it...... Never judge a book by it's cover  \r\nStory\r\nThe story is about heroes saving the day but on a tv show to get points yep every time they save someone orbeat the bad guy they get points the more points they get the more popular they are the better deals they get. The only hero who doesn't care about that though is tiger one of the main characters whose power is \"100 times\" which makes him stronger for 5 mins and he's been a hero for 10 years. Unfortunately he's one of the least popular heroes so he ends up getting a  partner who has the same powers as him. \\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\r\nThe is is pretty good but one thing does hold it back is the 3D it looks fine on the heros who wear armor but heros like fire emblem look awful cause he wears normal leather hero costume showing his mouth which confused me cause Dragon Kid and Blue Rose are 2D so it's really odd\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music and voicing acting are great I think op 1 of the show really has a good song \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are developed pretty well and are very likable I wanted to see more every ep with them \\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment \\n\r\nI had a blast watching this and even ended up watching the first and second movie right after I was done the anime \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI really recommend this anime it's fun watch \\n",

            "content": "Tiger & Bunny is definitely not your average action anime. Actually, it is more akin western superhero comics than to the shounen and seisen that make up most action anime. From the comic-bookish hero costumes to the loose and fun atmosphere, this very much like the Saturday morning cartoons western audiences grew up on... except better. It's a breath of fresh air and welcomed diversity in the world of anime, but more than that, it's a damn fun show.\r\nRight from the start, Tiger & Bunny sets itself apart from just about any other show with its 'superheroes meet capitalism' premise. You see, in the cityof Sternbild, being a superhero has become a profitable enterprise. Hero TV, a show that follows heroes as they fight crime, is the most popular thing on television; not only are heroes beacons of justice, they're celebrities, not to mention corporate cash-cows. But all that doesn't matter to Kotetsu T. Kaburagi (a.k.a Wild Tiger), an old-time veteran of Hero TV, he's just in it to be a hero. However, his popularity has dropped, and before he knows it the company he works under goes out of business and he has a new employer. What's more, he is going to be part of Sternbild's first hero duo; partnered up with the arrogant and glory-seeking new hot-shot, Barnaby Brooks. This idea feels fresh, unique, and is brimming with potential.\\n\\n\r\nWith this premise, Tiger & Bunny could have focused on capitalistic greed and corruption, but instead opts to be a story about friendship and heroism with a capitalistic backdrop, and this makes it infinitely more inviting. The show is filled with heart-pounding action, colorful characters, and has tongue-in-cheek atmosphere which all make it a roaring good time. Later, some intrigue gets thrown in with the tragedy of Barnaby's past and introduction of the super secretive crime syndicate, Ouroboros. And let's not forget Lunatic, the violent vigilantly who has a very different idea of justice. This all comes together to make Tiger & Bunny's first half a high-spirited superhero romp.\\n\\n\r\nComing into its second half, Tiger & Bunny shifts gears a bit. The second half has heavier emphasis on drama than the first, as Kotetsu, and later Barnaby, struggle with the life-style they have chosen because of forces beyond their control. Now, you'd think that this shift in dynamic would be cripplingly tone-dissident to the show until that point but surprisingly it isn't. This is in no small part due to the fantastic lead the show has in Kotetsu, and never loses its tongue-in-cheek charm even as it ramps up the drama. Kotetsu character shines here (even more than it already has), and his struggle between life as a hero and life with his daughter aims straight for the viewers' hearts. Barnaby's part is more melodramatic, but at the same time drives the plot forward, keeping the audience wanting to know what's next. The plot thickens with every episode, revealing unsavory truths about Hero TV, but at the same time never really loses its sense of fun, and once the clouds clear, Tiger & Bunny is the awesome superhero romp it always has been.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows cast is, for the most part, extremely likable. First and foremost there is Kotetsu, who is one of the most endearing lead characters in recent memory. He's a big goof and makes plenty of mistakes often coming off as an overgrown kid, but at the same time has a strong sense of right and wrong which makes it easy to stand behind him, and is incredibly charming in his own doofy way. His relationship with his daughter, Kaede, also provide the show with its biggest emotional punches. Barnaby is definitely not on the same level as his partner, simply lacking the charisma Kotetsu has, but serves the role as Kotetsu's foil well. All the heroes have their own distinctive traits which make them charming, whether it be Sky High's enthusiasm, Dragon Kid being a bit of a tomboy, or Blue Rose's crush on Kotetsu; they all also share a nice sense of comradery with one another which really makes you care bout them. Then of course, there is the anti-hero vigilante Lunatic and other antagonists like the Social-Darwinist Jake, who just bleed super-villain charisma. Unfortunately, the characters do have their short-comings, as most lack substantial depth which does cause problems for the series.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical-side, Tiger & Bunny looks and sounds great. Character designs are stylish and attractive, especially the superhero costumes, and the city of Sternbild is a booming, well-detailed metropolis. Of special note is the show's use of CG. Now, CG integration is kind of tricky because you want it to pop out, but not feel out of place; this is something that Tiger & Bunny does exceptionally well. The CG is noticeable but not distracting, and feels right at home amongst the vibrant streets of Sternbuild. The music is well composed and really pumps up the excitement. It really gets your blood pumping to hear the music while the heroes zoom around the city or are locked in battle. The show also uses its musical ques well, so you know when Lunatic is going to make an appearance, or when epic heroics are going to ensue.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, the show is not without some glaring flaws. For one, there is a gigantic number of plot conveniences in the story. Plot points will often be brought up, then pushed aside for a while until the story conveniently uses them to explain or trigger certain events. Many of these are also rather silly. The tongue-in-cheek nature of the show is enough to cover for this and makes it forgivable for the most part, but still the story is hard to take seriously sometimes. Less forgivable is the fact that the show almost solely relies on Kotetsu for emotional impact. Barnaby isn't the most likeable of characters, and some of the dramatic moments of his story feel overwrought. While all the other characters get fleshed out a bit, it isn't enough to make the viewers truly resonate with them emotionally. The only one to really emotionally grab onto is Kotetsu, and while that works just fine for the show, most of the characters feel unfulfilled because of this.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of what flaws it may have, Tiger & Bunny is well worth checking out. Its a show that constantly tossing up oohs and aahs, and will keep a smile on your face. Deep and thought provoking this is not, but when a show is this fun, being goofy and explosive works just as well.\\n\\n",

The description was non existent and the cover art made it look like some sort of yaoi mecha anime.\r\nI'm please to say that none of the above is true. The show is pretty awesome after two episode. The premise is a buncha of random people got super powers and some use them for good, others evil, but someone decided to cash in on this and now their exploits are set up on public television. \r\nThe showdoes have massive product placement, I mean BANDI and PEPSI and such flash all over the screen everywhere. In any other anime I'd drop it because of this, but it's almost amusing considering the backdrop. \\n\\n\r\nT&B has a large lineup of characters/heroes, but the titular ones, Tiger and Bunny are already looking like they'll have strong development just based on the first two episode. Wild Tiger, a passed his prime hero who believes a heroes duty is to do what is right, no matter what, is often at odds with his counterpart, Barney (bunny) who seems more considered with a level headed and calculated approach. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime seems a lot less focused on any form of super villain, or any type of villain, and more so on the conflicts of Tiger and Bunny themselves. I'm sure they'll be like an evil force in the works for later, but right now the plot progression is more of a personal journey for the characters instead of a point a to point b type of routine. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\nWatch. There is no reason not to pick this up and give it a try.",

In the reality tv-show, good deeds yield points to the heroes (saving a human life +100p, catching a bad guy +200p, etc.). Brilliant start!\r\nBut! This original idea of capitalist heroes was not explored in any depth, which left me super disappointed. The story doesn't touch the subject of capitalism or commercial ads or anything like that. It's just silly super powers and silly villains one after the other. None of the characters question the scoring of saving human lives, andnot even the viewer is offered any food for thought on the subject. The only hints of critique are made of two characters in the show who are compulsive about the ratings of the hero tv-show, but even their compulsions are so shallow that they offer no surface for further analysis of deranged capitalist mentality.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the whole anime misses it's greatest premise. A waste of time, beyond the first episode which demonstrates the concept.\\n\\n\r\nOther than for the plot, I have no complaints.

            "content": "I know another Tiger and Bunny Review when there is so many other great reviews. But I really wanted to say, or rather type, why I loved this show. And how it is the only 2011 anime that I have kept updated with constantly. \r\nFirst let's start with the Story. \r\nWhen you look at the title its a little off putting, but honestly the title is what drove me to try this series. An anime called Tiger and Bunny with a cover picture of Mecha suits. It raises the curiosity.  So I tired it. And I was surprised. It was funny and the artwas pretty neat (CGI is a little hard to get use to at first but I find that you eventually get use to it). Then the show really started. Episodes that seemed \"filler\" like, weren't. And it was brilliant. My only real issue with the story is that at times I found it to be predictable which didn't bother me to much, because if I wanted a serious anime I would've watch Code Geass, Deadman Wonderland, or something like Durarara!!. The story is well written and parts where it seems unimportant come back and become well, important. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier the art is hard to get use to with the mix of CGI and anime-style. But eventually you get use to it and then it works. I think if the CGI wasn't in Tiger and Bunny, I wouldn't have kept coming back. The CGI makes it Tiger and Bunny (or rather the art of TnB) It adds to its overall quirkiness.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI love the music for TnB. The second ending I listen to over and over. And when I watch the anime every Saturday I find myself not skipping the openings and endings like I normally do. Once you seem them its good enough. But the soundtrack is just amazing. Even the instrumentals in the backgrounds work so well. When they planned this show they didn't skimp out on small things, or the bkgd music. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nTnB's characters are amazingly brilliant. Kotetsu (MC) is your usual hero. Believes completely in justice and human lives and he can be a ditz at times. What makes his character better than every other one is his age. And the fact he is a father. Then you have Burnaby, that character you dislike in the beginning but grow to love by the end. His development through the story is well-written. Even the other characters and the way the interact with each other was well thought out. Each character has their story (except seemingly not Rock Bison (Idek what his NEXT is)) that affects the original storyline. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI love anime and I love following it. And when a new anime comes out I try to follow it weekly but it is difficult with life. This show is the only one I have tried to follow every week (airs on Saturday). And every Saturday I feel so sad because it means that I can't watch it for another week. TnB will hook you. The characters, the art, the sound, the story it all leaves you wanting more Tiger and more Bunny. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would love for this anime to be sold in North America so that I can buy it and watch it over and over and show all my friends. I would also love for it to become more popular and for people to try it out. And I would love it if you readers would give it a chance and not dismiss it because its mecha (which honestly it isn't) or that the name is childish. \\n\r\nTiger and Bunny is my favourite anime and I wish others would come to see why. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review and I hope you try the show out!~\\n",

            "content": "Hi, and thanks for taking the time to read my review of Tiger & Bunny! I have come to terms that I am obsessed with this show, and I'd like more people to give it a chance.\r\nStory: I'd say the biggest letdown is the story; the main plot has been done before. On the plus side, there is considerable effort put into the side characters' stories that helps add to the overarching plot. \r\nArt: Another iffy spot. At times, the art is gorgeous. Other times, the art is very simplistic and \"lazy\". I think that the CG implemented into the show is a bonus, ratherthan a hindrance. While it is noticeable, it is well-done and very smooth.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I've watched both the dub and sub, and I love them both. Every character has the perfect voice actor attributed to them. The background music was hit-or-miss. Most of the themes are great, and have a very 40's jazz / golden age feel to them. Akin to the music of Pixar's The Incredibles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The reason I fell in love with this show. Everything from the designs to the personalities is spot-on. While Kotetsu is my favorite, it is very hard to pick a second favorite, or even least favorite character. Almost every character goes through noticeable development, and they become even more endearing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A decent story backed by an incredible cast of characters and diverse themes. The show is equal parts action, drama, emotion (I connected with Kotetsu's storyline a lot) and comedy. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR 5 words/phrases to desribe Tiger & Bunny\\n\\n\r\ngreat characters, funny, emotional, good action, hot men :)",

            "content": "Tiger & Bunny is a hero series from 2011. It was brought to us by Sunrise. I've heard it mentioned a lot over the years, but never got around to watching it. But since it's hero month, it seems like a good time to check it out and form some opinions.\u00a0 \r\nStory:\r\nOur narrative is set in the future where mutants... I mean \"Next\" have started popping up. Naturally, this has led to a group of heroes who wear product placements like they think they're Captain Amazing from Mystery Men\u00a0and who fight criminals & rescue civilians alike to earn points for a television show. Enter newcomer,Barnaby, a hero with a dark past he's looking to unravel. He becomes the first hero duo with veteran, Wild Tiger. Unfortunately for both of them, they don't get along all that well and Barnaby's past may be creeping up on them.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems with the series is that it has severe tonal issues. It tries to strike a balance between darker and lighter moments like some of the best comic runs out there including Claremont's X-men run and the Wolfman/ P\u00e9rez Titans run. The problem is that it sucks at it and there are two reasons for that. The first is that it goes two far in both directions. If you look at those comics that shift tone well, they have pretty realistic degrees on both ends. For example, The X-men facing the brood and finding themselves in a seemingly hopeless situation on account of the royal eggs that have been implanted in them but still maintaining hope and doing everything they can versus Shadowcat telling little Illyana a bed time story for an issue. In Tiger & Bunny, the lighter elements cross into Silver Age goofiness. Think Batman and Superman having a slumber party at the fortress of solitude but somehow dumber whereas the darker elements cross into 90s darker and stupider territory. Which means there's a lot more of a shift between the tones. Tiger & Bunny also fails because it combines the elements. If you look at those good comics, they actually transition from one tone to the other instead of abruptly forcing the tone to change. In this, they'll have goofy silver age elements, like evil plush toys piloting mechs, side by side with more serious elements like Barnaby trying to get revenge for the loss of his parents and that's just highly dissonant.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is with the main villain's plan. I don't want to go deep into spoilers, so I'll keep this somewhat vague. Even though who the villain is going to be becomes really obvious as soon as our heroes have a certain conversation in hospital. In any case, our arch villain gets caught with a tiny contradiction and all he has to do to keep things from escalating is pretend he also doesn't know what the deal is. Instead he gives a huge villain speech revealing everything and tries to cover things up by messing with someone's mind. Then he makes things even worse by unnecessarily lying and trying to frame another hero. Even though said hero has had a costume where they can easily be identified just by visually comparing him with one of his old trading cards or videos. To make things even dumber, this guy supposedly wants Next to be treated well and that's why he's manipulated the Hero media but when things aren't looking so good he decides to have androids kill all the heroes that the citizens know and love even though that will clearly interfere with his big plan. I don't know how it's possible to be as egregiously stupid as this villain.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAlthough that does lead me with yet another problem I have with this series. They bring up this idea of their mutants being feared and mistrusted a couple times, but it's not something we see any real evidence of. There are, maybe, three scenes where someone is a dick towards the Next. Other than that, they're treated like heroes, people buy their merch, big companies sponsor them to make themselves look good. There's almost nothing to indicate that things are bad for them. The series also wastes its one opportunity to do something with some impact right at the end by having a cheap cop out. So, the ending is pretty shit. The series also likes to repeat itself way too much, going over plot points to a ludicrous degree. For example, the anti-hero appears and gives a big speech about how \"he is doing the true justice\" and there are about three conversations after that where our heroes can't figure out what he's after. It's like they think their audience is really, really slow.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI've already described how bad the antagonist is, so let's talk about the other major characters. Our big characters are Tiger, Kotetsu, and Barnaby. Kotetsu is a horrible, neglectful father and obnoxious cretin. Barnaby is just boring. Which is kind of the way things go in this series. At best, the heroes are trite and bland. At worst, they're gross homophobic stereotypes, Hi, Fire Emblem. Sky High is probably the most likeable of them all, even though he's dumber than a wet cardboard box, because he's a paragon character with a dog. Blue Rose is an insipid twit with a really annoying crush on a dude more than twice her age. Which might not be so bad if they didn't bring it up constantly throughout the series.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nDragon Kid and Origami Cyclone are dull. Rock Bison is so boring that even his \"best friend\" can't think of any personal information to give about him. Seriously, there's a scene where Tiger is giving out some information about all the other heroes and he has nothing to say about this guy. There's also Lunatic, one of those generic anti-hero characters. Although it is worth noting that he wants to be seen as seeking true justice, but he calls himself Lunatic. That would be like Mister Sinister trying to convince ordinary people he's actually the hero while still calling himself Mister Sinister.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt:\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is a bit mixed. Some of the city shots look impressive, but the character designs are kind of mediocre. and the action sequences aren't very interesting. One thing that's absolutely horrendous is the product placement. The hero costumes are plastered with logos to the point of it being really tacky. It's like Sunrise just decided this had no artistic merit whatsoever so they might as well just suck off some fat corporate guys for a bit of extra dosh.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nHere's one aspect where I can give the series some credit, the actors are pretty decent. Maybe not great, but they're about as good as they can be with characters this insipid. The best is probably Inoue Go, who does pull off the simple-minded paragon character pretty well. The only truly bad performance comes from Tsuda Kenjirou. It's not really his fault since he's voicing a super flamboyant gay stereotype, but it is awful to listen to.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIke Yoshihiro does the sound track and it's the best part of the series. They may not be the best tunes out there, but they're quite good and well put together.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nIt comes entirely from our gay stereotype, who has fire powers. Wow, that isn't the least bit subtle or clever. And I'm sure one person is going to say \"didn't you have a gay character with fire powers in Omicron Squad?\" Which is true but I had a lot of gay characters and Anastasia wasn't a stereotype. So, not really the same at all.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAreas of Improvement:\\n\\n\r\n1. Gives the characters personality beyond tropes. One of the things that makes for a good hero comic is a strong sense of personality from the characters and well developed interpersonal dynamics among them. Plus strong villains instead of total knob heads.\u00a0\\n\r\n2. Consistent Tone. If you want something stupid and goofy like the Silver Age, just go for it. If you want something darker and stupider like an early Image comic, go for it. This clearly doesn't have a strong enough writer to pull off something between, so let's not fluctuate between those two extremes.\u00a0\\n\r\n3. A Consistent World. If you want to be like the X-men and show powered heroes doing their best in a world that hates and fears them, that's fine. If you want to have a future where everything is built up around a culture of hero worship, that's also fine. These two things do not work together.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nTiger & Bunny\u00a0is a complete mess. It can't decide which extreme tone it wants and ends up awkwardly and really badly mixing them, its heroes range from boring to obnoxious & offensive. It has plot holes so massive you could fly a 747 through them. The world building is wildly inconsistent. The \"twists\" are really obvious to the point of being bland. They treat their audience like it's made up of a bunch of morons. The sponsorships are tacky as hell and it's just never interesting or entertaining. My final rating is going to be a 2/10. This anime sucks.\u00a0\\n",

            "content": "Coming in as a Western anime fan it is hard to not be skeptical of an anime about superheroes. Considering our own comic book industry and how it contrasts to anime in general, I almost would never consider the possibility of an anime successfully capturing the world of superheroes. Perhaps this is why I consider Tiger & Bunny to be one of the most pleasant surprises I have seen in quite a while.\r\nTiger & Bunny is a story about corporate sponsored superheroes called \"Next\", essentially mutants like those of X Men, who are constantly filmed on television in Sternbuild City. By engaging in heroic actsthe superheroes are given points in a contest to determine who the \"King of Heroes\" is, and by doing better in the competition the heroes provide better advertising for their sponsors.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the story lends itself to an interesting twist on superhero ideals. This is best represented by our two main characters Kotetsu who is known as the superhero Wild Tiger, and Barnaby, who Kotetsu nicknames Bunny. Kotetsu starts out the show as an old and washed up hero who believes in superhero ideals that are considered old fashioned by his peers. He values justice above all else, makes saving people his top priority, and could care less about what the sponsors want.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have Barnaby, or Bunny, who got into the hero business as an avenger seeking justice for his parents' death. At the start he only really cares about earning points in the hero competition, and doesn't place that much importance on Kotetsu's old fashioned ideas, and does everything to appease all the sponsors. The partnership that Barnaby would form with Kotetsu, Tiger & Bunny, would go on to be the defining relationship of the show. Their clash of ideals would lead both on to balancing each other out, as well as serve as one of the most amusing sources of comedy throughout the entire show's run.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be stressed that Tiger & Bunny, while not afraid to get serious at times, is overall a very fun and entertaining story about superheroes. The character interactions and development are often very amusing, and the world is built up magnificently. While also having nice action scenes throughout the story, Tiger & Bunny's greatest strength would definitely have to be its character building. As a great character driven story, the cast ends up being very likable and well made.\\n\\n\r\nAnother remarkable aspect of this show is its seamless ability to blend Western superheros into the world of anime. The costume and abilities of Kotetsu as Wild Tiger are all too familiar of more Western heroes, as are the villains like Jake Martinez who capture the Western psychopathic antagonist really well. I give the show a lot of praise because of its ability to connect to me as a Western fan, especially when so many animes are so confined in the Japenese markets.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show just manages to be a fun, and adventurous tale. It is one of the least offensive shows out there, and can be recommended to almost anyone. This show is perfect for anyone who gives a damn about superheroes, but is also compelling enough for almost anyone to enjoy. I hope to see more anime like this in the future.",

            "content": "Imagine a reality show focused around X-Men-este characters saving the day in very corny and clich\u00e9 ways. Now imagine that idea, but good and is actually very entertaining and has characters you seriously can't help but to cheer on, despite the corniness and clich\u00e9s.\r\nSTORY: Saturday morning cartoons about superheroes were awesome, but that's the past and those shows are near dead, but this anime here, this lovingly homage to those flashy costumed hero shows is quite frankly one of not only the best, but one of the most important anime created in 2011, it's one of those kind of anime while it isn't the mostoriginal thing ever, but the execution of its premise is executed hundred percent perfectly you'd look on similar anime and find them mediocre by comparison. Sure the series is heavy on being campy and borderline silly, but it's made that way, and works, it simply works. But there's a under taste of well thought up satire beneath the goofiness along with a future that is surprisingly dark and strongly character driven.\\n\r\nTiger & Bunny takes your average clich\u00e9 super hero show and almost turns the genre on its head by including the concept of a reality game like competitive television show with a points system where all of the heroes are sponsored by real life companies (Like Bandai for example) that adds an interesting depth to this series that others fail to achieve, challenging the characters to whether or not to take the call of justice and save the day or work for a superfluous award for popularity and bragging rights. That is where the most important development for the characters lay, and it's incredibly partnered up with two very fascinating main leads, Wild Tiger and Barnaby. \\n\\n\r\nTiger is one of the most realistically relatable character in anime I've personally ever seen, a single man in his thirties (Not a god damn teenager for once!) with a daughter with realistic problems such as putting his job as a hero (This show let's me say that being a superhero is job, like an office job even, if that's not unique, I wouldn't know what it would be) on a higher ground then his family, which isn't an easy decision to do, but with his dream that is important to himself he does what he has to do to achieve it despite that he comes off as, in the start of the show, a washed up has-been, the old fogey pass his prime who just can't keep up with the more popular heroes because he doesn't care for the points or for that matter what his TV directors tell him to do because all he wants to do is save the day, or for that matter get his merchandise based on him to even get looked at on the shelves, is forced to join up with the popular new comer, Barnaby, who even has the same powers as Tiger for the world's (Of this anime) first superhero team.\\n\r\nOpposite of Tiger, Barnaby is driven by revenge (Hold your moans and groans for a sec) to be become a superhero, he doesn't care for Tiger's old fashioned way of thinking what superheroes should be, he's out there to make himself as popular as possible, getting the points, all for the sake of his revenge, which quite frankly, is similar to popular anime. Barnaby comes off arrogant and somewhat cold, but he Tiger have an incredible chemistry that alone is entertaining to watch as they bicker and argue (Which has most of the show's comedy come forth) and their ideals clash despite that they are partners. As the show progresses, they become more understanding of each other, while they both gain equally outstanding character growth and development, yes, a revenge based character development that actually has favorable outcomes. You want to know why? Because the target(s) of revenge are developed adequately enough to be easily hated by both Barnaby and you the viewer, I guarantee that. \\n\\n\r\nNot only the characters Tiger and Barnaby are fleshed out to extraordinary lengths, but even the other heroes too, heck even the villains (Of course not to the point where Tiger and Barnaby are fleshed out, I mean they're the main characters, it's understandable they get the spotlight, if a series main cast has no priority development, you simply failed at making a show). Other Heroes include, Blue Rose the series, unfortunately, the real commercialized character (Pepsi anyone? No? I don't want one either) and main female character of the other heroes, she is pretty much that teenager the usual shonen action show would start with, SkyHigh, your typical boy scout of a man, who represents the typical hero of any superhero show, Origami Cyclone, the background character, literally the background character, Fire Emblem, the painfully stereotypical homosexual man with real fire power, Dragon Kid the tomboy little girl with kung fu skills paired with electricity powers, and Rock Bison, the least shown character in the series. Each of the other heroes do get their little background episode with brief development (With Blue Rose getting the most attention out of all of them) but are hardly deeper characters than respective character archetype, but along with the heroes, there's even a vigilante criminal killer, Lunatic, who even gets his own episode that completely rocks the world of Tiger&Bunny to its core, after kicking off the series surprisingly much darker tone later on than what the early episodes about friendship and whatnot was going about with.\\n\r\nBut it's each characters individual quirk that get fan reaction such as \"We want to see more of so-and-so\" is what makes these characters special to the series in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nWhile plot threads like Barnaby's revenge takes many twists and turns and Tiger's later on problems with his powers keep you on the edge of your seat with baited breath for happens next, Tiger&Bunny may come off as too cheesy, or too silly at times for some people, but it's that cheesiness and throwbacks to superhero shows with a satirical twist is what can keep viewers returning for more, and it helps that the core characters are interesting with satisfying developments.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: As great as the story this is, the animation is a bit iffy relaying on mostly CG animation (Similar but fortunately done better than that Gonzo is known for) is by Sunrises least talented animation crew, but this show is one of those kind of shows where it could only take off from the ground through endorsements from other companies, not just Sunrise. \\n\r\nDuring the CG scenes, the models look great, and the action scenes are well animated but the anime still falls into the category of \"3d on 2d\" so it looks awkward most of the time. While the 2d animation is fine, not terribly great, but fine either way. Character designs however, look great, very diverse, and very creative.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: As for the audio department, the background music sounds exactly like your average super hero show, which works perfectly for this series. The theme music however, is a bit bland, though as a bias opinion I like Unison Square Garden and their music is good enough to me. Voice acting is good and is probably the performance that stands out is definitely Tiger's, from bickering with Barnaby to just simple dialogue, he's a treat to listen to. No English dub has yet to emerge, but a show like this will definitely benefit from one.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Perfectly executed theme with a fun and exciting story to boot.\\n\r\n+ Great lead characters, Tiger is one of the best leads in an action anime I've seen in a good while.\\n\r\n+ Good humor and character interaction.\\n\r\n+ Legitimately love to hate villains.\\n\r\n+ Decent animation, with some of the best uses of 3d animation in 2d settings.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mixed:\\n\r\n+/- Side characters are likable / despite that they are stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Not enough attention to the rest of the cast.\\n\r\n- Might come off as too campy for some.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is this anime one of the most important anime of 2011? Because it has the potential to bring fans into anime with power equal to what Cowboy Bebop and Fullmetal Alchemist had, and is hopefully the first step of anime in general to finally move forward from the current and shameful trends of the anime of today.\\n",

            "content": "I wasn't going to watch this show. Nothing about the preview appealed to me in the slightest. Over the top action heros? Fighting in suits? Boring. \r\nThe funny thing is, that statement is absolutey correct, and absolutely false. Yes! it is over the top action heros fighting in suits. But it isn't boring in the slightest. From the first episode I was hooked. And the reason --> Kotetsu - Wild Tiger, the main character of the show. \r\nKotetsu is thick, honest, well meaning, and one of the most endearing characters I have come across in recent times! From the start, you find yourself totally onhis side. As others have mentioned, it is wonderful having a character who is not child/teenaged. Kotetsu is in his 30s, a dad to a 9 year old, has a kind of sensible head on his shoulders, and a penchant for destroying buildings. \\n\\n\r\nThe other superhaeros (which the exception of Bunny) play much smaller roles, but are still given their own story arcs. And, these were enjoyable too! I have noticed in some other shows where minor characters get their moment to shine the story is weaker, but these still ran along at a cracking pace, progressed the main story AND gave the viewer insight into the smaller ones. \\n\\n\r\nUnusually for me - I loved the end. I absolutely loved it! It has set it up perfectly for a second season (which I would welcome with open arms) but the if there wasn't one, I would be perfectly happy with it as is. \\n\\n\r\nSo, to summarise: charming characters, cracking pace, loads of humour, and lots of fun. I definitely reccomend Tiger and Bunny.",

            "content": "A Japanese take on Western superheroes\u2019 daily routines in the format of Big Brother. Earn points to ascend a league table by keeping peace, outdo other heroes to top the chart and be crowned The King of Heroes; or get left behind, lose sponsorship and retire early. All captured on live TV. I found it funny, engaging and nostalgic.\r\nWhen you have two well-known shounen seiyuu in Ichigo from Bleach and Sanji from One Piece, you would expect a good deal of action sequences for them to roar. Tiger & Bunny does not disappoint. From the director who brought us The Big O and the studiothat produced Accel World, Tiger & Bunny, a 2011 release, had MCs in the form of the perfect in-between of mecha and remote controlled robots, men in power suits, Iron Man style.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nIn a city with multiple Statue of Liberty lookalikes, some humans were mutated to have supernatural abilities and became known as NEXT. While some use their powers to rob banks and sneak into the VIP section of live concerts, others got themselves a job as superheroes working for their respective companies. Superheroes are used as billboards to promote their sponsors, their activities are directed by the boss and their morals are tested on the job. Would you catch a criminal on escape to earn 200 points or would you save the victim but earn 100 points? Would you team up with another hero and share the glory or would you sabotage them to move above them in the points system?\\n\r\nA protagonist without a school uniform, a man we could all look up to and sympathise with. Kotetsu is an irresponsible single parent who enjoys dressing up and running around the city to entertain the cameras. He is a hero but his daughter doesn\u2019t know it. As someone who has been in the business for too long, instead of leading the line and setting a positive example, Kotetsu, Aka Wild Tiger, often messes-up his criminal chases and embarrasses himself in front of millions of viewers, live. A goof, who genuinely believed keeping peace could make a living, is the most enthusiastic hero. Refuses to be wavered or side-tracked by the higher-ups of the brands he advertises all over his suit, is on a mission to get his daughter to call him cool. Degraded to near bottom of the league ranking, he is presented a chance to make a comeback by teaming up with Barnaby, a much younger and more attractive individual who appeared to be much more mature and intelligent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development\\n\r\nMost heroes have decent character backstories and progression throughout the 25 episodes.  Everyone have their own reasons to participate in HeroTV and their ideals sometimes clash. The main duo\u2019s partnership was particularly shaky at the start, where neither liked his partner and constantly bad-mouthing each other; but as the episodes count grew so did their relationship. Working together to catch criminals and climbing up the league table, they began to trust one another, become a real team and even formed link-up special moves.\\n\r\nSome characters had single episodes dedicated to them revealing the reasons for why they fight. To help the viewer feel attached to them, even their private lives were on exhibition, from their part time jobs to how often they walk their dogs.\\n\r\nThe character interactions are often amusing due to the mixture of personalities around the room. But when in action, there are serious tests of friendship, beliefs and doubts. Expect many cheesy scenarios and scripts because of some stereotypical character designs, making their character developments and their reactions anticipatable.\\n\\n\r\nWomen\\n\r\nBlue Rose is a sexy teenage superhero and she knows it; she wears high heels and reads books like \"100 ways to make a single father fall for you\u201d. As for a mature woman, HeroTV\u2019s boss lady is smart and spicy.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics\\n\r\nThe cityscape looks stunning. The lights are in tens of thousands; combined with the structures living in it, from bridges to statues, make the city look like a very lively place. The art in other areas are also first class; backgrounds are fitting of the Western style and are smooth around the edges. Drawings on costumes and their designs are very vibrantly coloured and appear to shine. Haters of CGI might not like the visuals of some heroes because Fire Emblem and Rock Bison, to name a few, are CGI when in suits. Despite some flaws in frame rate distortion, the CGI are just so detailed they will be your eye-candy; the costumes wrinkle with many lines and the shadows move like water.\\n\r\nWhen the occasion rises, a hair-lifter soundtrack plays. There are two opening and ending themes; personally, I preferred OP 2.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTiger & Bunny is PG-13, so don\u2019t expect blood drips. Even in the direst of situations, our heroes will have plenty of time to pose together, sometimes back-to-back. Tiger can at times move fast enough to dodge bullets like in The Matrix, but at times cannot out-run a normal human. Foreshadow are carefully stationed in each episode; you could argue they are too well done and had become overly clear, but I think the conventional characters are mostly to blame. The series has a slow start but picks up its pace quite fast and continues to accelerate. With the rapid increase in storytelling, many questions arose and some were left answered. Tiger & Bunny would have gained more fans if it answered those questions and gave insight to the characters it didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nNo one can say the setting was easy to direct. Like most anime taking on the Western style, if Tiger & Bunny is average or below, it would be regarded as shambolic; to go straight into anime as an original story without pre-made manga was brave. The concept of having Heroes to participate in a reality TV show was done in SpiderMan. But the formulae the director has copied were winning recipes that couldn't go wrong in a series about superheroes; they are mostly well built-up and executed to provide much entertainment; the Dragon Ball Z style tournament was a great example. To have real-life companies sponsoring the anime was intelligent in both increasing the series budget but also helped us immerse with its world.\\n\r\nTiger & Bunny ended like a true superhero series. Crimes never cease and heroes never rest, I wouldn\u2019t mind a sequel. Each hero had their own past and secrets to motivate what they do but it never overshadows their roles. Unlike The Dark Knight, the superheroes here, especially, our protagonist, exhibited everything good about superheroes. Watching this anime was very nostalgic, it reminded me of my childhood, spending my weekends with Totally Spies and Power Rangers, and the reason why I equipped myself with capes and plastic swords. Not turned into war weapons, sought after by every country, Tiger & Bunny made me believe in heroes again.\\n\r\nThe director looks up to superheroes, too, and I can relate to that. These 25 episodes made me feel good and warmed my heart. Forget all the other superhero series and movies; I want my kids to watch Tiger & Bunny.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Thanks to Vis4Vanity for recommending this series)\\n",

            "content": "My initial expectations of Tiger & Bunny were skeptical at best - a show about mascot superheroes plastered with corporate logos brings to mind some dubious product placement anime. Or even worse, the cutesy title could've foreshadowed some hybrid ecchi fest involving bestiality. Luckily, T&B isn't as shallow as it might suggest; instead, it's an unabashed parody that celebrates its superhero roots as well as deconstructs them.\r\nIn the corporatized world of Sternbild City, commercialism is king; heroes not only fight crime, but they also play up for TV ratings, their CEO's expectations, and \"profit-points\". With the companies calling the shots, these superheroes seem more likewalking ads for Pepsi, Amazon, and Bandai rather than selfless Samaritans. Only 30-some-year-old Kotetsu Kaburagi, aka \"Wild Tiger\", remains the old-school hero who puts peace above profits. As a man \"past his prime\" (and with a daughter back home), Kotetsu must adapt to the changing times where heroism has become a commodity; all the while, a younger, savvier crime fighter named Barnaby steals the limelight.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the cynical twist in its premise, T&B is an action-comedy first and foremost; the show playfully pokes fun at itself at every turn. The first arc of T&B is your typical buddy-cop show starring the eponymous duo, Kotetsu (\"Tiger\") and Barnaby (\"Bunny\"). As expected, the old lion veteran get paired up with the na\u00efve, reckless rookie. There's a clash between ideologies, the odd couple fights, and hilarity ensues. The situational comedic timing in T&B is brilliant, and several scenes made me genuinely \"lol\". Comic book fans may savor the subtle nods to X-Men, Batman, the Joker and Harley Quinn. Due to its tongue-in-cheek attitude, the anime's first half feels more like a spoof of Marvel comic duos rather than a serious critique on heroism.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough T&B executes its comedic bits fantastically, the same isn't always true for its drama. The show gradually evolves from the buddy cop antics of the first arc into more serious plot developments and characterization. Barnaby's tragic past involving his dead parents, already an unoriginal angle, comes off angsty and clich\u00e9. Kotetsu's conflicts are rarer and more compelling; not only does he face competition from a younger breed of heroes, but he also struggles to be a decent (albeit absent) father. The tension between the two partners in crime becomes a litmus test of trust while a darker, sinister plot brews just beneath the surface.\\n\\n\r\nAll too often, the show lapses into contrived situations in order to get viewers emotionally invested. Barnaby just happens to fly in at the right moment to save his falling partner; a miraculous typhoon creates the perfect rescue mission and the duo (surprise!) share the exact same powers. The show is full of convenient coincidences that just deflate the drama and dispel any sort of tension. As such, even though T&B has some genuinely funny and exciting moments, it also has some eye-rolling ones.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the sloppy (and at times illogical) writing, I nevertheless found the show wholly entertaining. Sunrise succeeds in executing the anime well enough to keep it fun, despite its narrative laziness. In the end, I didn't cringe from the cheesiness so much as I enjoyed the show as earnest entertainment. Due to the excellent direction and pacing, T&B manages to juggle action, drama and comedy with great ease.\\n\\n\r\nSunrise's superheroes look like they were cut straight out of a Western comic book \u2013 and that's a good thing. Character designs are refreshingly crisp and colorful; each one is distinctive and bursting with personality. There's also a nice contrast between the heroes' flashy, sponsor-splashed costumes and their unassuming day clothes.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation is somewhat of a mixed bag; occasionally, the quality drops due to some sloppily drawn stills. I'm not a fan of the CGI transformation sequences, and the clunky costumed fights don't exactly thrill. T&B is packed with these action scenes, but where it lacks in style it redeems itself in fluidity; motions and movements are quite natural throughout.\\n\\n\r\nT&B's soundtrack is smartly placed; slice-of-life portions are accompanied by rustic, bluesy guitars while drama scenes are suitably orchestral. During crime busting sequences, there's a jazzy, heart-pumping theme reminiscent of James Bond or The Incredibles. Newsflash jingles act as constant reminders that we're literally watching a show within a show, and Hero TV buzzes like a proper media microcosm. Although not download-worthy, T&B's score always answers its call of duty.\\n\\n\r\nShounen fans may recognize Barnaby's seiyuu (Masakazu Morita) as Bleach's Ichigo and Kotetsu's (Hiroaki Hirata) as Sanji from One Piece. In T&B, these two perform flawlessly, playing off each other with hilarious repartee. Even tense, dramatic scenes are well-acted and naturally convincing. Rounded out with a solid cast ensemble, voice acting in this series is stellar.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected, Tiger & Bunny's main duo drive the machinery of the plot. The dynamic between the heroes creates the perfect double act; Kotetsu endears himself as the dorky \"funny man\", whereas Barnaby is the naturally stoic \"straight man\". Their banter translates into comedic gold, but the show elegantly breaks down this stereotype as the two grow to trust one another. Kotetsu, in particular, is an extremely likable character; he's a washed-up ojisan whom everyone mocks, but his confidence and selflessness make him genuinely sympathetic and easy to root for.\\n\\n\r\nThe colorful side cast of superheroes adds an extra layer of perspective; minor characters are given spotlight episodes revealing the person behind the persona. How he/she became a hero and what motivates him/her are explored, forming a group of charismatic, lovable personalities. From the oblivious \"King of Heroes\", Sky High, to the \"Dragon Kid\" Pao-lin, T&B sports a lively, affectionate cast of characters. My only gripe is that Rock Bison and Fire Emblem didn't get enough attention while the Blue Rose episodes were by far the weakest; the skimpily clad superheroine seems more like fanservice fodder rather than a fleshed out character.\\n\\n\r\nAlas, T&B's villains are mere caricatures in comparison to their heroic counterparts. The plot begins with a rogue-of-the-week format that fails to develop the bad guys beyond your average thug. The morally warped Lunatic is a disappointing vigilante whose twisted sense of justice feels like a cheap imitation of Light Yagami. Although Jake Martinez is a crafty opponent, his character is stereotypically evil and frankly unmemorable. Not until the final act of the series does a worthy villain emerge.\\n\\n\r\nStill, T&B doesn't quite escape the pitfalls of predictability or the bland, uninspiring villains throughout the show. Although it's by no means perfect, Tiger & Bunny offers a brilliant twist on the classic superhero genre while remaining faithful to the charm of its conventions.",

            "content": "Sadly to say, this anime is not all that it's cracked up to be. When I first learned there was a super hero anime, I figured it might be worth a watch. I was wrong for a multitude of reasons.\r\nFirst reason: The ENTIRE story is predictable.  Not a single good twist was dropped on me. It's a typical revenge story/slice of \"super hero\" life with some comedy mixed in. None of the episodes really left me wanting to watch more.\r\nSecond reason: Few of the characters actually left a lasting impression. Instead, there was some character development every few episodes for one character or anotherin particular, but nothing was too relevant to the plot when it did so. Instead, Tiger and Bunny (obviously) go through the most development, and slowly grow more and more boring.\\n\\n\r\nThird reason: Action. In an anime about super heroes, you'd expect there to be more fighting, right? Well, not with this. Very few episodes actually had a memorable fight scene to draw in the viewer! Instead, everything (or most everything) was fixed after maybe 5-10 minutes max.\\n\\n\r\nFourth reason: The ending was sub-par. About half way through the series, some events happen and the story takes a shift in the wrong direction, which leads to the bad plot. It's a typical \"happy ending\" in a sense, but really leaves a couple strings untied. I feel that with 25 episodes, they they really could have done better.",

Though, she did change her mind but she's still a little brat, especially to Kotetsu.\\n\\n\r\nBarnaby is an underdeveloped superhero cliche as seen from when he saved Kaede in the second episode when we expected her to be dead or injured. Like, how did he turn invisible like that Clay Aiken song and save Kaede all of a sudden when he wasn't seen under the debris in the first place? Not to mention, how cold and vindictive he is makes him another unlikeable character.\\n\\n\r\nAgnes is the bossy woman who is incompetent at her job and should be fired for being such an angry woman.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think that anyone was good in there except for possibly the Dragon Kid. The other characters and their immature personalities just makes me want to give them a slapping.\\n\\n\r\nThe other props I can give to this anime is that it manages not to be boring like most superhero fiction and the story, while mediocre, was probably the most interesting aspect of the writing, and the art is quite good. The dub doesn't make their frustrating characters anymore tolerable to watch but they've done what they could do.\\n\\n\r\nJust watch My Hero Academia, it is so much better with better developed and kinder/mature characters (most of them at least, some of them aren't), less realistic and complex, more unique, and it's hilarious.\\n\\n\r\n3.7/10",

            "content": "Many of the complaints I hear about this show are because of misconceptions. I do feel that this show was named and advertised incorrectly, and so people think they are getting into something when really, it's completely different.\r\nTiger & Bunny - the name alone makes people think exactly the opposite of what this show is. People hear the name and immediately think that the show is cutesy animals (along the lines of, say, Hamtaro) or some form of children's show when, really, it isn't. It's adult-oriented action with a touch of comedy on the side between fights and adventures.\r\nThe way it is advertised is alsoan issue. Even the cover art displays the suits the character's wear as larger than other people when that isn't the case. It shows itself off as a large mecha style anime, when it's not. The only mecha in the show are suits that the characters wear, leaving them regular human sized. Think Ironman, but it's powered by super-human powers instead of technology.\\n\\n\r\nThe story line is rough, right now, this early in the series - I do feel it's moving a little slowly, but it's a solid storyline that I am sure will pick up. Lots of hints have been dropped, hinting at future plot devices and I hope to see a lot of these brought back up later in the series (Tiger's relationship with his daughter, Bunny's mysterious group that he hunts, just to name a few).\\n\\n\r\nAn issue I see brought up a lot are concerns over product placement. A viewing of the first episode reveals that all of the main characters are literally walking advertisements - they use their powers to help the city they live in, but are still sponsored by corporations and so their costumes and catch phrases are meant to advertise that company. This is usually very light, however - the vast majority of the show, the name of the company is simply plastered on a small part of a character's costume, and only when they are actually fighting. It's very easy to ignore.\\n\\n\r\nYes, there's product placement, but it really isn't that bad (if you can forgive the extremely blatant Pepsi ad in the intro every episode).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tiger & Bunny has been an enjoyable show and there's still a lot more to come (at writing, episode 11 out of 25 just aired), and I'm looking forward to more. It's an interesting show at the very least. It is far from the best, but it's keeping me watching so far.",

            "content": "T&B is a light-hearted bromance about sponsored superheroes in a glittering, colourful, retro-futuristic setting. I see you turning up your noses and going all \u201cmeh\u201d at me. Well, stop right there because if you miss out on this you miss out on one hell of a fun ride, mathematically proven to make you feel good even if you are mighty pissed and have the urge to kick something (I have personally tested this theory so you know it works).\r\nStory:\r\nI could write a whole PhD thesis on how good this show is, in storytelling terms\u2014but instead I\u2019ll be quick. Now, this show is 25 episodes longand each and every one of these episodes is 100% story and 0% filler/ random insane bullshit. In fact, it is so continuous it is more like watching a movie. This is a good thing and so rare I actually felt I had discovered a new species in the Amazon River. \\n\r\nAnyhoo, to be more specific\u2026this is a homage to the classic superhero adventures peppered with ample charm and witty lines. It does have its dark moments but it is essentially a light-hearted buddy comedy and to that it sticks. It is designed to make you feel good but is not stupidly na\u00efve and it has its shades of grey. There is a bit of predictability to it but that makes it part of the fun. At a time when shows are saturated with crazy, pointlessly angsty misery or abysmally lazy stupidity this comes as a welcome breather. \\n\r\nI guess the most impressive thing about the show\u2014besides its excellent pacing\u2014is that it uses every element it introduces in a way that makes perfect sense both emotionally and logically. The twists are always foreshadowed and a lot of them are so cleverly done they are sure to take you by surprise. \\n\r\nTo be brief, the story is generally made of more awesome than all the kittens you saw on the internetz today, plus a fridge full of chocolate. I\u2019ll give you a minute to wrap your mind around all the awesomeness this represents. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNo matter how good the story is, if you can't relate to the characters it all amounts to one big Zero. But look at this! Here we got both an excellent story and amazing characters. Oh my stars, was this a fluke or what? \\n\r\nSeriously, I'm giving you one episode and the characters will definitely reel you in. As an extra added bonus the main characters are NOT wimpy/ moe-tard teenagers but adults (didn't that turn your hair white from shock?). \\n\r\nObviously, the titular characters are the stars of the show. So, we have:\\n\r\nTiger: the old\u2014but not very successful\u2014veteran of the superhero reality TV shtick. He is such an easy going, kindhearted, honourable, silly and funny guy you will find yourself wanting to be his friend. \\n\r\nBunny: appears as the talented, know-it-all, new snotty rich brat on the block channelling some heavy Bruce Wayne vibes. \\n\r\nThe magic in this recipe is not these two characters per se but the way they interact with each other and the rest of the cast. The conversations and actions feel very natural and it is wonderful to see how the relationship (hey you, get that yaoi out of your head, this ain't that kind of relationship!) dynamics evolve over time and how major and minor events influence it. \\n\r\nAlso, speaking of the rest of the cast, it is just brilliant. Each and every character has their own personality and feels delightfully alive. Not once did a character do something out of\u2026well, character. Every little thing they did was justified. And I mean every single one. Trust me, I was keeping score. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nBring on the glitter and glitz! There is enough sparkle and colour in here to cure the colour blind. \\n\r\nThe animation style is heavily influenced by American mainstream superhero comics but still retains the distinctive anime feel, which amounts to total eye candy. Animation is fluid and quality rarely dips. \\n\r\nThe backgrounds are simply amazing in their complexity and consistency. Let your eyeballs roam all over that pretty cityscape. \\n\r\nLastly, this gets props for the least eye-gouging use of CG I have seen. All scenes that involve the power suits (NOT mecha, I must stress this) the heroes wear are done in CG and for a wonder they actually look good. \\n\r\nBonus points for the absence of gyrating torpedo boobs! The little fanservice there is goes both ways. Mmm, those boys sure are wearing some tight pants there. Not that I noticed, I wasn\u2019t really looking. Someone told me. \\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nCinematic and exuberant would be the words to describe the soundtrack. It is flamboyant and bubbly as well as dark and threatening when the occasion calls for it. Very good work here too.\\n\r\nOP/ED: while the first opening was my favourite by far, the rest of them are equally good. Easy on the ears and easy on the eyes. Lots of colour, lots of happy tunes.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nGo watch this show. It will give you a boost of optimism and bring a smile to your face. Ignore the offputting title and promotional material. This show focuses on characters, not some stupid mecha battle that lasts ten episodes. \\n",

            "content": "You know how Kids buy things what looks good and what looks bad. it has nothing to do with the product but if it has flames and a so called epic look? well thats what people have done to this for to long and ill admit i did it too.\r\nPeopel read this and saw it sounds meh nothing special and they look at it with no information of the actual series and think Oh there is a pink mecha and a green mecha. well in fact they are not mechas they are just suits to help the heros. Is this overrated no, is this underrated...well to some degree yes. this should be more popular and it should have a great following becuase it is just that good.  I will now explain.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nits a pretty simple little story, there is a tv program that revolves around heroes. these heroes get points for arrests, saving people, and any other hero deed. But that is not all the story is for everyone reading this. this story includes murder mysteries, love and relationship issues, the values of family and friends and Trust in one another. This story breeds fantastic morals with emotional highs and all time lows with conflict and struggle between heros and villains and even hero between hero. Where this story is so simple its hard to be bad but also hard to be good because its so simple. But this story does wonderful things and will make you feel nostalgic for what ever reason. And for every hero league the is an evil organization called.....well you will have to watch to find out the rest haha.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good, the suits the heroes wear and they way they move, attack, its just good.  the mellow moods and tense battles all have the same effect and same presence. it just works very well with the overall development of the story and the overall super powers, relaxing family moments, and stressful environments.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nAs i have said in other reviews sound only really matters when it either doesnt fit with the situation or its so annoying that you cant concentrate. the sound is typically  suspenseful when there is a struggle and typically low key when there isnt much going on, be it family times or just the sweet random nothings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe character for me are what made this anime. Tiger and Barnaby a.k.a. bunny are the two main characters that revolve the story. Tiger is the veteran and most would say he has lost his touch and is more of a hazard than a help. He upholds the old school superhero mentality and not the new school mind set. He is more concerned about saving other people than racking up points, he even tries to keep his identity a secret as older heros wanted, he is a kind, hardworking, and overall great and trustworthy person and will leave you saying he is the man, he will be on my favorites. Barnaby Brooks Jr is also a main character who is focused on getting points and making his name sell he is also known as bunny. Like every hero story he has a dark past and is trying to solve the mysteries that haunt him in episode 1 as well as the last episode. Tiger and Bunny both share the 100 power and become the first hero team in hero tv history. the rest of the cast is still interesting but not much is really known about them, blue rose is more of a pop start than hero, she then falls in love with a certain hero,  origami cyclone is just a side character whos power is interesting and he is often seen in the back ground usually when blue rose arrives. sky high is mr perfect but has his own struggles as you will eventually see. rock bison is tigers long time friend. if you watch and give this a chance you will see the rest of the characters as well as the criminal organization.  \\n\\n\r\nEjnoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nheroes vs villains with great action, sentimental moments with sure genius and loving sweet moments that will overall move you to the next episode. I Take enjoyment as how much did i like/love it right after watching, and for how long can i remember the characters. both of these are very strong feelings for me and i really enjoyed this XD\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nI wont bore you with the same info over and over again, but just to be clear great characters, simple plot, nice overall finish, and heartwarming moments from beginning to end the will make you sympathize with every character, more people should give this a chance and you should watch this you wont regret it.",

            "content": "-Expect the unexpected\r\nSurely we have a lot of anime series that gave us excitement on twisting what already is twisted from their stories and I'd say Tiger and Bunny is a one great example of it all.\r\nCharacters 9/10\r\nWell, I love the characters and though there will always be those common(or usual) traits you'd find similar in other anime series, characters in Tiger and Bunny will surely leave a mark on you specially the two main characters Kotetsu and Barnaby. They may have the cat and dog relationship but they executed their conflicting attitudes in a lighter way that the audience won't find annoying or tiringto see over and over again. The other heroes as well have different behaviors towards each other but when united goes with a nice mix of teasing and fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves establishes the idea that anyone can be a hero as long as they have the passion to do so and speaking of passion there is also Agnes and his cameraman who will always be passionate on their job of getting higher ratings and is always on the go with adding spice to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is really great, I love how the characters were drawn and it was actually their appearance that made me watch the anime at first thinking, I like the art and how it's mixed with lil 3d effects specially the colors incorporated with the heroes. I totally love Kotetsu and Barnaby's art with AND without their cool suits.\\n\\n\r\nMusic 8/10\\n\r\nAll the music used(specially ot & et)goes well with the whole series though they are not the kind of OST you'd love putting on your ipod to play again and again, nevertheless, It wasn't so great but not a let down either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI'm not into action genre because I'm an adventure and horror freak watcher and I honestly thought that Tiger and Bunny is a mecha-anime series but thank god I know how to read reviews, synopsis and information that I decided to give it a try. If you're looking for an anime worth the watch and knows how to tickle you here and there while filling you up with tons of action scenes then this series have all the qualities not to be missed out.\\n\\n\r\nWatching the anime didn't disappoint me one bit and I'm totally satisfied to have seen such a great series after a long time. ^__^\\n\\n",

            "content": "I think it's safe to say that I think Tiger and Bunny is one of the best anime shows I have ever seen.\r\nTiger and Bunny, I believe, is a homage to American pop culture: pop stars, superheroes--heck, even Sternbild city is modeled after New York! Usually, things like this aren't really pulled off quite well--they come off sloppy, they come off cheap, their creators appear like they're trying a little too hard to squeeze references everywhere--but Tiger and Bunny pulls it off beautifully. They manage to give enough nods and winks to American culture, yet still makes everything seem unique and seamlessly done.\r\nThe designs areoriginal, and I really like them! It's really interesting to see the characters in their day-to-day lives, and as superheroes; I love how the design and the art still reflects who they really are (the diversity in their body types, their body language, et cetera) yet seems to conceal their identity as well if you don't know who their alter egos are. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are wonderful! We have a single dad--Kotetsu--who's quite the idealist, and who seems too old-school yet is ready to fight for his beliefs; the blonde Barnaby, Kotetsu's new partner, who has different layers to him (he appears to be quite the charmer at first, with all his winks and hair-flips, then seems to be quite pretentious off-screen)--if you've finished the series, and you've actually seen Barnaby's backstory and seen him at his rawest, most vulnerable, you'd understand; there's also Kaede, Kotetsu's hot-blooded and talented daughter, who seems to have some kind of daddy issues; Nathan Seymour, who, in fact, is one of my favorites (Nathan's definitely queer, and it's really nice and refreshing to see LGBT POC representation!) and loads, loads more.\\n\\n\r\nNow comes the plot. Ah, yes, the plot...at first, everything seems light-hearted, but don't let that fool you. I won't give you spoilers, but the show manages to keep its humorous tone yet brings darker, edgier things to the palate, causing drama and so on and so forth. It's also quite interesting to see the various things that happen to Barnaby and Kotetsu that leads to their relationship developing from irritated, to indifferent, until finally we see that they're best friends. (Don't even talk to me about what happens in the latter parts of the episodes; I was an emotional wreck during that part...)\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Tiger and Bunny is fantastic and wonderfully written and original. It's one of my favorite anime shows. I may be biased but please give it a go; it's not one of your average, fanservice-y anime/manga and it actually has a lot of depth and uniqueness to it!",

            "content": "It's been a while since I last saw an anime that I couldn't stop watching and yet never wanted to end, and Tiger & Bunny just made me feel very conflicted in that sense.  The show is, simply put, absolutely amazing.\r\nFrom the stunning animation and graphics and the fast-paced and polished plot, this anime is everything that I have been missing since Cowboy Bebop.  I love how the series seems episodic at first glance, but eventually everything falls into place so smoothly and perfectly with one barely noticing.  Very few details that were given attention were insignificant, showing how much attention wasgiven to the story.\\n\\n\r\nMore than the story, however, I fell in love with this anime because of the characters.  And what brilliantly imagined and lifelike characters they are.  Without going into extended, horribly long-winded exposition, we get to see deep into every character's essence -- even the ones in secondary roles!  Everyone is so consistent and well-defined, they just seem incredibly real and relatable.  I like that 1/2 of the titular pair was an older guy, not quite the epitome of cool, silly, middle-aged, and with a child -- a perfect foil to Barnaby, who was basically Batman.  I also expected the heroes to have more of an active rivalry going on and was pleasantly surprised to find that while they did like getting points, it was a priority below saving people and working as a team.\\n\\n\r\nMy attachment to these awesome characters is actually the reason why I couldn't stop watching -- I just had to find out how they'd get out of their last predicament every time.  Even though I had been accidentally spoiled about certain events (including the ending), I still felt anxious and excited at all the appropriate times BECAUSE I empathized with the characters so much.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, the anime has lovely music and sound effects.  Everything is timed perfectly, and the score is just amazing, always enhancing the overall atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure I can ever adequately rave about this anime -- I'm trying way too hard to be coherent right now when all I want to do is squee and flail and sob over Tiger and Bunny and Blue Rose and EVERYBODY.  Especially Sky High.  Boy, do I love Sky High's character.  This series is funny, heartwarming, maybe not particularly insightful, but still with a kind of depth by way of its utter humanity.  Which is kind of funny, being a series about superhumans. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, worth watching.  Again and again.",

            "content": "In this day and age, I have often resigned myself into thinking that an anime, no matter the explosive and exciting start it has, will always fail to live up with the hype and expectation at the very end due to the virtue of just being an anime, since to a lot of titles(such as Code Geass S2, Guilty Crown, Valverave, etc.), having a trainwreck of a plot has totally become a standard. Rarely does an anime stay solid, explosive and exciting from beginning to end like Tiger & Bunny, and I will go as far as to say that it is one of thebest anime ever made in the last decade.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nTiger & Bunny is pretty much the usual superhero fare, with the protagonist duo embodying the usual red and blue, on red you have Kaburagi Kotetsu, the hotblooded, naive and passionate hero who tends to be the leap-before-he-looks kind of character, on the other is the cool and calculated Barnaby Brooks, Jr, the type of hero who tends to do his job as a hero as perfectly as possible. It's a dynamic we have seen almost everywhere in the Superhero staple, the twist here is like Captain Amazing in the movie Mystery Men, each superhero has sponsors, and their exploits are televised, and Kaburagi Kotetsu(who is under the name \"Wild Tiger\", the \"Crusher of Justice\") has to weigh the choices of whether he should be obeying his sponsors to make rescues and arrests look sensational and flashy or follow his superhero ideals wherein he has to do whatever is necessary to save people. Along with Wild Tiger and Barnaby Brooks Jr., the story also tackles the backstory of other superheroes as well and how their lives are no different from normal people, except for, y'know, them being superheroes.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe visuals in this anime is delicious to watch, the CGI is amazing, so good to the point that it gives high budget visual anime such as Karas a run for its money. The superhero designs are cool as well. Wild Tiger and Barnaby's outfits look radical, and their tag team sequences never fail to keep my adrenaline running. I wouldn't even complain about their sponsors being in their outfits, it all fits seamlessly. Arguably though, my favorite here in terms of costumes has to be Sky High, his outfit just looks glorious. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nYou may have seen me mention Karas in terms of costumes and CGI earlier, and the influence of Karas can be seen all throughout the entire series, one is featured prominently on the second arc alone. Same goes with the soundtrack, the soundtrack is highly reminiscent to Karas' Soundtrack mainly due to the fact that they employed the same person(Both anime have their soundtracks composed by Yoshihiro Ike) for it, and bloody hell they sure picked the right man for the job. Each track that plays in the series just oozes with badassery and heroism, from Wild Tiger's Power To The Future to Lunatic's Voice of Thanatos, each tracks deliver their theme way too perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWhat makes Tiger & Bunny unique and fun is that for an anime with a simple premise, it's very well-written and well-executed, to the point that when you do see live ads in the anime, it doesn't feel forced or shoehorned in at all, each thing in the anime is there because the plot needs them to be there, it's not as blatantly offensive as Pizza Hut's portrayal in Code Geass, or H\u00e4agen-Dazs in Yuru Yuri and Kara no Kyoukai. The anime is sincere in its attempt to tell an amazing story, lastly, not only is it about superheroes, but it's an anime about friendship and teamwork, and I wouldn't take it any other way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nTen across the board, every anime should be as sincere as Tiger & Bunny. Rating it a nine is a slight disservice. I would gladly add this to my list of reasons as to why anime is worth defending, and I believe that you should do the same.\\n\\n\r\nDo yourself a favor, drop whatever you're doing and watch this show, you won't find something as good as this anytime soon.",

            "content": "Rewritten and rearranged. [SPOILERS WARNING]heavy spoilers in the entire review as I believed you have followed the story up to the current point already when reading this, if not then you might want to skip this review\r\nStory : (5) Concept is outstanding, taking American Superhero theme into anime format, but still needs much improvement, each characters\u2019 backstory are common and clich\u00e9d(guy who had his parents killed and is seeking revenge, big boss guy turned bad, troubled teenage girl, etc)\r\nRole distribution among supporting characters are poor. They each get 1ep to star on their story and that\u2019s about it, their significance is simply done at thatpoint. The story struggles to put in transitions between major events as many episodes appear to start a minor conflict to resolve by the end of that very ep and seldom have any effect on the story after then. Simpler said is how you can skip 70% of the episodes and watch the bigger events that take more than 3eps, and still would not feel like you missed anything.\\n\\n\r\nI disliked how Karina fell in love with Kotetsu, not only that I am totally against the 10+ years age difference, along with how Kotetsu is married and already have a child.(Though exact age unknown, estimated age for Karina and Kotetsu are 17-18 and 32-40 respectively). How the development happen is very weak. Kotetsu have never personally save Karina from any danger and act nice in the same way he did to everyone else, and she is well aware of that. The reason for this romantic development is simply the same old \u201cmost attractive female in the same character category as the protagonist must fell for him, ignoring any logic that may get in the way\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot villains made are pure stupid, Maverick\u2019s \u201cscenario\u201d that everyone loathe wouldn\u2019t make any benefits to himself even if he succeeded. He\u2019s trying to dispose of his own faithful heroes that are at the point still loyal to him and had made him billionaire he is now, then replace them with powered soda cans that can\u2019t even talk, expecting the media will be stupid enough to see their beloved heroes all turning lifeless at the same time. Indeed realistic voice synthesis seemed to be possible at that age, but as demonstrated by Cis the gynoid in earlier ep, the programming of anything else apart from battle is poor, the bots seem to have a totally absurd amount of memory storage available for vocal capability, and if they are going to replace the heroes without anybody noticing, interviews on the heroes will still be made regularly, try manage that Mr. Mav. (Also I\u2019m wondering how creating bots with aerokinesis, cryokinesis, or transformation power is possible, if they\u2019ve achieved that then I don\u2019t see any need to try kill the heroes, just make a bot that can create a black hole and kick the heroes normally into unemployment would be enough)\\n\\n\r\nMaverick\u2019s plots are not only non-beneficial, but gives a lot of risks to himself. As how he cannot delete corporal objects,  Kotetsu could have simply point out his innocence by showing material objects(such as photo) he took with the other heroes. Which unlike Emperor Charles in Code Geass, Maverick have no records of the heroes daily life so it is nigh impossible to send in Ouroboros henchmen in the heroes or anyone who have any relation to Kotetsu\u2019s houses, cars or whatever place a photo or physical evidence may be and destroy all of those countless things without anyone noticing.\\n\\n\r\nHow Barnaby suddenly remembers Kotetsu\u2019s identity when he heard \u201cBunny-chan\u201d is absurd, it\u2019s like Fairy Tail which is saying \u201cfriendship can break any barrier, heck it can do anything anyway\u201d, it is certainly not what I was expecting, I know people would not want Barnaby to act all Sasuke much longer anyway but there certainly are better solutions to it.\\n\\n\r\nCountless plotholes, too many to even point out but for an example is how an Ouroboros henchman have Lunatic's flamethrower when Lunatic isn't in their organization, or how Lunatic, thinking that he should kill all evil, kill prisoners only in 1 cell rather than burning the whole block, indeed he might have been concerned about the innocent guards or those whose sin isn't really severe(such as stealing something small), still he got the chance to kill more guilty men but just didn't use it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (7) The art is nice, I personally do not mind the CGIs and think they have all the rights to use it in this era anyway, though certain designs seem to be just to blend with the character theme and not for their maximum usability in their superhero job(I did not mean Blue Rose\u2019s extremely short skirt that reveal much of her ass, but most of the heroes seem to be able to fight indifferently anyway, with suit on or not, making the superhero suit pretty much just for show otherwise pointless) Some facial expressions can be better, such as the point where Barnaby is slowly losing his consciousness as Maverick brainwash him, his face doesn\u2019t contain as much agony from being blinded and betrayed for years, anger, sadness, and hatred as he\u2019s supposed to have, but he did more of like \u201cdamn I\u2019m sleepy\u201d face and that\u2019s it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (6) Average, the songs are not very memorable(honestly a bit annoying for the first few times I listened to it), the BGM are pretty bland but will get the job done anyway, and the sound effects are just fine, nothing good but nothing bad either. The voice acting of the show is nice, though often time more impact should have been put into the voices, Sky High and raging Barnaby\u2019s voices are fine anyway but I felt Jake could have been better.(It is not Fujiwara-san\u2019s fault, he did fine with Ladd Russo and Kihara Amata, its more with the director who should have control how the voice is done)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (3) Most characters lacks depth by far, so far only Yuri Petrov manage to show some logical depth(which still could\u2019ve been deeper), the remaining characters act according to their clich\u00e9d roles, Kotetsu as the immature adult and typical protagonist who wish to save everyone and might as well say \u201cPeople die if they are killed\u201d like some other random guy who had similar philosophy to him. Barnaby is the Sasuke of the show(with some maturity) calm and cool guy who would go berserk against a man he hate, abandoning all his calm he had earlier. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting heroes and characters are also typical, Blue Rose as mentioned earlier as the troubled teenage girl who fell for the protagonist for whoknowwhat reason. Rock Bison should have gotten more roles as Kotetsu\u2019s best friend, but is inevitably beaten up on every major battle he had engaged despite his power that should have rendered him nigh-immortal and invulnerable upon activation, even with that he will be knocked unconscious against an enemy with only physical means of attack anyway. Sky High as the typical dutiful and always positive guy which only concern would ALWAYS be his fear of losing authority. Dragon Kid as the youngest member of the group, which though can vary greatly in personality, a young girl is almost always there to be found in most Japanese action media anyway(present in almost very JRPG there is), so even if she is not girlish, her status did not make her interesting to me either. Origami Cyclone is lastly, the troubled teenager, guy version which lacks confidence in his duty and would often consider himself the weakest of the group.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the superpower given out to every characters in this show is rather boring and none are really unique. Conjuring elements can be found in 4 of the heroes(though I would actually praise the writer if these elemental manipulation ability can be utilized uniquely the way rarely used before, including further extra points for scientific accuracy), and its not like superstrenght, invulnerability and transformation are not mundane anyway. Memory alternation had become a common ability since Code Geass and blue flame are still just flames. Indeed the ability to smell stuffs the kidnapper sisters have are unique, but I don\u2019t see any charm in the power as they are near-useless plotwise. Jake\u2019s usage of force field projection is by far the best usage the story had presented(but still far from perfect), his mind-reading power though, did make him look much weaker as an actual fighter since he would require much less experience to become strong that way.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting heroes are too absurdingly weak, they are barely using their powers correctly and are always defeated by the major enemy presented at the moment, I mean 6 heroes up against a single bot that should only have high physical capabilities and no other flashy powers(indeed we have not seen the bot fight in its full glory yet but as a bot designated to replace Wild Tiger, no further power should have been included if they did want to fool the media, not to mention the bot got easily thrown over by Kotetsu and could not escape from Lunatic's flame circle when its program should have been prioritized in capturing Kotetsu, so I'm assuming that's the best it can do) and lose? That is simply too lame, and no one did even try to escape from the bot to meet up with Kotetsu and Barnaby.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (5) Clich\u00e9d usage of clich\u00e9d plot with clich\u00e9d characters and clich\u00e9d powers, so I\u2019m thinking the clich\u00e9d enjoyment it gives should be also given a clich\u00e9d score, don\u2019t worry, being clich\u00e9d mean there are many other media out there who share the same clich\u00e9",

            "content": "Tiger and Bunny turned out to be quite a fun series, surprisingly so when you consider how it has some heavily commercialized overtones to it. Sunrise decided to try experimenting here, and plastered real-life company logos on the characters in this series, which initially sounded like a bad move. However, this series turned out to have a rather solid main cast, and although the plot got cheesy and stale at times, it\u2019s the charming characters that kept this series fun to watch. Aside from that, the extra money from the advertising is probably the reason why the production quality was solid throughout the series, andit seems that this series was popular enough to leave an open-ended conclusion (and leave the potential for a season two).\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the story itself is rather simple when you break things down; there are guys that have superpowers, and they use them to fight evil. Only, the twist is that these heroes are sponsored by corporations, and their heroic exploits are followed on TV. It\u2019s an interesting, light satire of modern day society, where everything is commercialized in some way or form.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the heroes themselves were quite charming. To be more specific, \u201csuperheroes\u201d are portrayed as very human figures,  where each balance their crime-fighting duties with their own simple little problems. Common problems such as dealing with love, single parenthood, grieving for a lost friend, and paying the bills, are all part of the cast here, and makes them rather easy to relate to. On top of that, the gradual buildup of the chemistry between the awkward main cast eventually leads up to a rather close group of \u201chero\u201d friends that help each other in their times of need, where they all work together to get things done. The flawed characters, and how they try to make up for their flaws by depending on their close friends, makes for a very endearing cast, especially when you consider everybody\u2019s individual personalities. From the goofy Kotetsu to the stoic Barnaby, from the love-struck Blue rose to the hot-headed Bison, all of the heroes mesh together well to create a rather competent cast.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, while the cast itself is a joy to watch, I can\u2019t say the same for the plot. The best way to describe the plot would be that it is \u201cvery convenient and chessy\u201d. There are many individual arcs where the heroes solve smaller crimes, which are meant to highlight some of the unique character traits to the cast (or just show everybody goofing off in some way or form, lol). Many of these arcs, while they were silly fun, were also very cliche at times. The cliche-ness did make for some great character development, and added to the charm of the cast. Therefore, I could mostly look over the cheesiness.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s really the big main arcs where the story ends up very flawed. The main arcs are very dramatic, and makes for a compelling watch. And yet, at the same time, there are just so many convenient and coincidental factors that unfold during critical moments in these arcs. That in itself is lazy writing on Sunrise\u2019s part, and while the arcs were captivating, at the same time they have quite a few areas they could\u2019ve significantly improved in. Sometimes the arcs would get too trite and corny, which at times would detract from the viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Tiger and Bunny is really a showcase for it\u2019s stellar cast, where watching the bumbling journey of Wild Tiger and Barnaby proved to be the star attraction to this show. The real charm factor to this series are the characters, and their interactions throughout all 25 episodes. I know for a fact that I followed this series until the end because of the cast, such as the rather idealistic yet clumsy Kotetsu, the stubborn and hot-headed Barnaby, the naive yet earnest Kaede, and the rest of the cast. The plot here might not be the best out there, but Tiger and Bunny is enjoyable because of it\u2019s flaws. Tiger and Bunny is an endearing tale of an upbeat, corny, goofy, and hardworking, bunch of heroes.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nSetting: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.0/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7.0/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 8.0/10",

No, of course not, it's not trying to be, and that's a very relaxing thing.\r\nI first watched Tiger and Bunny after finishing watching both Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, and then Neon Genesis Evangelion, and after what was essentially a marathon of Gainax shows, I found this to be the coolest cooldown anime I could have possibly asked for.\r\nAll the characters are strikingly memorable, and the animation is ridiculously good.   It doesn't require an overtly cute style to endear characters to me, they're able to dothat through means like breaking stylistically and generally making the characters seem sympathetic.\\n\\n\r\nSure, some of it is subject to classic cliches, but there's no reason that should make it any worse, because the rest of it is so original, it raises questions of justice but doesn't let those questions get in the way of it generally being a fun anime to watch, not that focusing on questions of morality ruin an anime, it simply lets itself flow.\\n\\n\r\nIt should also be said that you could think Kotetsu T. Kaburagi is the worst thing to ever exist before watching Tiger and Bunny, and after be willing to slit your own throat just to keep him still in print and tv.",

            "content": "Tiger and Bunny begins with an interesting premise. The idea of fitting superhero stereotypes reminiscent of the Western comic books into the framework of a reality TV show was a good idea. Tiger and Bunny ultimately works as an anime, but it does fall flat in some parts. \r\nThe art is the main thing which will grab your attention. This anime uses a mixture of 2D and 3D art in a way that I haven't seen done before to this level of quality. The 3D is mainly used for the characters and generally doesn't clash with the rest of art because of the stylistic wayit's produced. It was a little distracting at first because I'm not used to seeing a character move so much, but this is generally forgotten as the art is so different to most animes that a few flaws can be forgiven. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty great all around really. Watching Tiger punch a super villian in the face to the sound of a sweet guitar rift and some strings was always good. The music was a bit overpowering during the action scenes, I guess to give a feeling of epicness to them, but the score just ends up feeling cluttered and indecipherable in some parts. The sound design is generally excellent other than that though. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters play off all of the  archetypes you can think of. You have Kotetsu, the aging hero with good morals battling against not only his enemies but also against his age and the world surrounding him. He's the classic underdog. Barnaby Junior is Batman, Kriem is Harley Quinn, Jake is Magneto etc. The characters, aside from Batman, are all generally written really well, and this is really the highlight of the series. The supporting cast of heroes are all great. Kotetsu, the main character, generally the steals the show, but episodes are devoted to the support cast and this is in my opinion the highlight of the show. However, the rest of the plot is devoted to Barnaby's sob story and the crime syndicate named \"Ouraboras\". Herein lies the main problem of Tiger and Bunny. \\n\\n\r\nIt gets quite heavily bogged down in the plot, and honestly the series could do without half of it and it would work a lot better as a whole. It got to a point near the end that I was kind of wishing for one of the happy go lucky episodes from the beginning of the series. By the end of the series I was tired of the cliched plot elements. There comes a twist in the story which you'll get way before the show seems to expect you to. They make it out to be some big reveal, but it's not. \\n\\n\r\nThe final blow in the story came for me during the last two episodes. Now, I'm going to spoil something that happens so if you're really concious about it, stop reading it now. It won't effect your enjoyment at all. Kotetsu dies, only... he doesn't die. We get the very familiar death scene where Barnaby holds Kotetsu in his arms while he dies. But then the next episode, Kotetsu suddenly gets up and finishes the fight. There was no attempts at pacing this well, no build up or tension, no epic moment. It's as if they got a memo from the marketing department telling them that they have to keep everyone alive for the movies that have now been announced. I knew Kotetsu wasn't going to die because I'd seen the pages on here about the movies, but I at least expected a little more to what should have been the climactic battle of the story. I could go on all day about the way the story fails in terms of pacing, originality and plot, but I'll let you all decide that for yourselves. \\n\\n\r\nSo that's Tiger and Bunny, a generally excellent anime that is let down by the lack of a decent story.",

I was just assuming that it was like any other show aimed at boys, full of action and cool superpowers. Usually I don't go for that stuff. \r\nHowever! I was really surprised at the way it turned out. Five minutes into the first episode, I was hooked. The action isn't overbearing, the characters and story are interesting and you can't help but speculate on some things. The character designs and animation remind me of older anime in a good way. Evenwithout a manga, even with only 2 out of 26 episodes watched, I can tell I'm going to love this show more and more. \\n\\n\r\nI hope it gets the recognition it deserves! :)",

            "content": "Superheroes in general has got the impressive resume nowadays, starting from animated and live-action shows and comics like Superman, Batman, Justice League, Wonder Woman, The Flash and now today, they are part of the every medium, such as movies where many of the all-time highest grossing movies happen to involve superheroes including this one (well, two) movie(s) in 2012 that happened to earn $1 billion worldwide and it really has an appeal out in the western world so how will anime be able to do that subject well? Well, let\u2019s just see right here right now.\r\nSternbild City is home to people called \"Next,\" who usetheir special abilities to protect the people as superheroes. These heroes solve cases and save lives so they can wear sponsor logos or acquire \"hero points.\" Their activities are documented on the popular program \"Hero TV,\" which picks the \"King of Heroes\" in a yearly ranking. The veteran hero Wild Tiger has always preferred to work alone, but now he's been assigned the rookie Barnaby Brooks Jr., who has a different perspective on being a superhero.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing with Tiger and Bunny is that it has the elements of a buddy cop show but takes out the cop element and put in superheroes with the added-in element of reality TV, which I was okay with (considering my disdain for reality TV) and it was an execution in that it succeeded for me. I dug the premise of reality TV superheroes although I get some problems including why there is product placements posted on their costume but that\u2019s for them to get some publicity and of course to make some money, as some aspect turned more into business than just doing it because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, Kotetsu T. Kaburagi aka Wild Tiger is the old-school veteran superhero, who of course is eventually way past his prime and is losing popularity to the other growing heroes and I definitely saw Tiger as that guy who knows his stuff about being a superhero and can be noble about it but unfortunately, Tiger has this problem of trying to be a father but fails to do it whenever it involves his daughter Kaede and him failing to do with fatherly duty. Barnaby Brooks aka Bunny is the new shot rookie partner for Tiger and basically, he\u2019s Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne combined but Bunny can be a bit arrogant and a bit of a diva to the point where I don\u2019t give a fuck about him but thankfully, he was as unbearable as that TV producer Agnes, who was a major bitch especially when it involves the heroes saving people\u2019s lives and use their advantage for ratings and I wish I can talk about the other heroes but they weren\u2019t covered with much character development such as Blue Rose, Sky High, Dragon Kid, Fire Emblem, Rock Bison & Origami Cyclone. I would have loved to watch more of their stories and they do get an episode centered on each of them but only one episode but I hope that someday someone in Sunrise thought about expanding more of those characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of Sunrise, they were the ones who were in charge of the animation and it is very impressive in my eyes. The CG didn\u2019t feel too clunky at a few times but it can stand out on some times. Character designs are good as well and the art style has the futuristic but modern feel to it. The opening and ending songs were really a delight to listen to and it definitely fits the tone of the series. I can\u2019t say which one I liked more but that means that I couldn\u2019t find a thing wrong with that factor.\\n\\n\r\nFor the dub by Viz Media & Studiopolis, which aired on Neon Alley, Wally Wingert as the voice of Tiger felt a little too young for somebody that was a veteran but it didn\u2019t exactly bother me as his performance was decent and Yuri Lowenthal as Barnaby Brooks did have the sound of a young guy fitted into the right area though.  Other performances including from Patrick Seitz, Laura Bailey, Kari Wahlgren, Stephanie Sheh & Steven Blum as one of the major villains in the show were spot-on and impressive as well.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: For what is it, I can easily say that this show is worth checking out and may be even worth buying in stores. I think this could be one of those anime that can attract a lot of the western audience and can have a good time watching it. I solely recommend this series to anyone, especially people who are getting into anime.\\n",

The mc shows his family life and social life with his work life also.  The world of Tiger and Bunnyis full of great characters that often seemed very realistic and human.  The interactions between them was very interesting.  The partner hero dynamic was also done very well which makes one of the greatest cast of characters for any superhero story.  \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime for many reasons.

            "content": "I never expected that I would enjoy this show as much as I did. I came here after \u2018My Hero Academia\u2019 and an interest in another superhero story. The first few minutes weren\u2019t that promising, but soon I came to love this show more than most anime I\u2019ve watched.\r\nWhere \u2018Tiger & Bunny\u2019 really manages to distinguish itself from other shows, is the concept and the characters. This superhero story doesn\u2019t only evolve about people trying to save people. There\u2019s a popularity race involved, and most of the character\u2019s goals aren\u2019t that noble at all. I also like the idea of sponsors for the hero\u2019s, makesit even more believable that everything is just one big commercial stunt.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really stand out. Each of them had there own voice and is recognizable. They do things and the things they do, just fit their personality perfectly. There wasn\u2019t a single moment when I thought: damn, isn\u2019t he acting out of character? Each of the characters have their strong and weak points: no (semi) perfect characters are seen here \u2013 yes, I really do love flawed characters. The villains had their own motivation, that wasn\u2019t as simple as \u2018I\u2019m evil because being evil rocks\u2019. (I do think Jake would have been more interesting if he wasn\u2019t a half madman, since his goal is pretty damn interesting.)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the relationship between the characters is done pretty damn well, especially Barnaby and Kotetsu. They started off as rivals and totally didn\u2019t like each other. But, the more they worked together, the more they learned that they could learn from each other. Still, their friendship isn\u2019t flawless: they still argue, they still have trouble telling each other everything on their mind. And I like this, because it\u2019s believable. No single friendship exist without a fight every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nThough I really enjoyed \u2018Tiger & Bunny\u2019, not everything about it is perfect. One of my struggles with this show (although it\u2019s just a detail) was [very minor spoiler] relationship between a certain hero and an android. I get why the android needed to be introduced, but I don\u2019t really get why there had to be this little romantic relationship? It was a subplot developed very poorly, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the fact that Barnaby\u2019s parents worked with androids did come out of nowhere for me. I think it would be better if they dropped some hints in the first arc about this, because now it seems like the whole parent-android thing was just dropped there to make everything work out. What I\u2019m trying to say: it seemed more like a plot device and therefor it felt kinda forced.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore I didn\u2019t like the fact that, at a certain point, some characters lost their memories and had false one\u2019s implanted (tough it was executed pretty well). But I personally don\u2019t like this trope, so my judgement could just be based of my personal bias. \\n\\n\r\nI also would have been happier if [spoiler, but not really] a certain character would have stayed dead. I just really despise the \u2018I\u2019m dead, WAIT NO, just kidding\u2019 thing. But again, could have been my personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, to round it up, [spoiler] what the hell happened to Lunatic afterwards?  Again, this looks like a subplot that was left hanging. He didn\u2019t really win, the hero\u2019s didn\u2019t catch him\u2026 there is just no closure to this subplot, unless there was a sequel \u2013 but there isn\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nBesides all that: I liked the animation, though it\u2019s a bit flashy at some points. And I did really enjoy the music and the voice acting in \u2018Tiger an Bunny\u2019. Action scenes were pretty nice to look at.",

The low ratings I'm seeing show that the viewers didn't bother to give this anime a chance (as always) and chose to have tunnel vision. \r\nI believe this is a well-balanced anime. Instead of relying on pure action/shock factor most of the time (I'm looking at you, SAO and Attack on Titan), it has that classic teamwork, fight badguys spirit. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone is basically a muntant/metahuman. The heroes are at the mercy of sponsors and their PR standing. They're treated like athletes, where they're backed by sponsors. Because of that, you often see the conflict between each hero's fighting spirit and their sponsor's desire to run a business off their fame. How do you save the world and still have people like you? On one hand, it may seem like they're slaves to PR, but on the other hand, this could keep wild tigers in line (pun fully intended).\\n\\n\r\nSo far, I've seen that this anime is pretty tame. While it does have its tropes, that isn't a bad thing. The only 'fan service' would be Blue Rose's costume, but they point that out during her story focus. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this reminds me of anime I grew up with loving. I find it refreshing to stumble across a show with a plot and setup that reminds me of my teen years, during a time it wasn't cool for girls to like anime or be nerdy.",

            "content": "Heavily inspired by western superheroes, Tiger & Bunny at it\u2019s core is a \u201cbuddy cop\u201d series, that follows the superheroing adventures of an odd couple: Kotetsu a.k.a. Tiger, a failing middle age superhero who makes up for his goofiness with his enthusiasm and sense of justice, and Barnaby, a young humourless upstart, who got into superheroing to make light on some mysterious events in his past.\r\nWhile this is a setup that may ring extremely familiar, what makes the premise of Tiger & Bunny stand out is its setting, which in some ways can bring back to mind One Punch Man. Heroes in this universe arenot motivated by the goodness of their heart, but are part of a heavily sponsored institution that fights for justice as much as it fights for rating. All the heroes\u2019 deeds are broadcasted live as they compete in a pseudo reality-show, trying to outhero each other while at the same time working on their promotion tours and trying to score sponsorships, like any other celebrity.\\n\\n\r\nNow\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be that person, but like, that\u2019s a dystopia, right? Outsourcing public security to an extremely powerful set of cult-of-personality individuals who are literally in the literal hands of corporations? Which in most cases apply way more force than needed endangering more lives than what they save? Like that\u2019s\u2026 not good, right? And I know that these are the basic problematic aspects of any superhero settings, but Tiger & Bunny exaggerates them to the point that, realizing that the show doesn\u2019t actually intend to provide any commentary on them feels\u2026 odd.\\n\\n\r\nThe show sets up this very interesting world, exaggerating and caricaturizing all the problematic aspects of superhero fiction, then creates characters which would naturally come at odds with such system\u2026 and then\u2026 it just tells a pulpy superhero story which never questions or explore the situation it sets up. And while this approach might be just mildly annoying in a regular superhero story, the fact that Tiger & Bunny is extremely charged with hyper-capitalistic and celebrity-culture imagery, makes its nonchalant approach to its setting slightly more uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about uncomfortableness, there are a couple of odd uncomfortable character things that I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention before going forward:\\n\\n\r\n-One of the heroes is a non-binary, drag queen-ish kind of character. While they are generally characterized flamboyantly but relatively tastefully, it is a running joke in the series that their team-mates are constantly off-put and disgusted by them. Nothing particularly new in term of anime tropes, but your mileage may vary on how much this bothers you.\\n\r\n-The main character\u2019s sort of love interest is a 16-year-old high schooler (Kotetsu is supposed to be in his mid-30s). If on one hand this is depicted as a one-way crush, with Kotetsu being mostly unaware of it, on the other the series is vastly uncritical of such crush, and that character\u2019s ending scene is literally her still trying to get in Kotetsu\u2019s pants. Yeah, uncomfortable.\\n\r\n-This is a pet peeve of mine, but I absolutely hate the \u201ctomboy has to learn to be more feminine\u201d trope. That\u2019s pretty much the arc of one of the minor characters. So yeah, I dislike that, if she doesn\u2019t want to wear dresses, she doesn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d to learn to wear dresses, fuck off.\\n\\n\r\nAll these awkward choices regarding some of the characters are quite honestly a shame as, aside from the ones I mentioned above, if there\u2019s one strong aspect in Tiger & Bunny it\u2019s the character work. The main duo of Kotetsu and Barnaby in particular, is extremely pleasant and, while clich\u00e9, watching their friendship grow through the show is sweet and entertaining. The story is mainly depicted from Kotetsu\u2019s point of view, and the show does an actually great job in painting a really compelling portrait of an aging doofus who\u2019s just trying to do some good in the world and be seen like less of a failure by his peers. Despite a fair bit of the show\u2019s runtime being generally taken by less-than-stellar fight scenes, there\u2019s more than enough character development to make the show more of a character-driven piece than a straight up action sentai thing. The actual linear plot of the show, on the other hand, is vastly forgettable, as it seems to waste so much plot threads to setting up eventual sequels, that nothing, at the end of the show itself, feels conclusive, neither thematically nor narratively.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I end this, it is also worth to give a quick note on the aesthetics, as I actually quite like the art style, and don\u2019t even mind that much the fact that all the superhero costumes are done in 3d (it actually creates a really interesting contrast when you see Kotetsu wearing his old costume which, unlike all the other costumes, is depicted in 2d). The one problem that I have with the visuals of the show is that the blocking and editing now and then feel a bit awkward and clumsy, especially during the fights. While this never gets too bad, a couple of moment throughout the show are definitely eye-roll worthy.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I don\u2019t find Tiger & Bunny a particular stand out, it\u2019s not completely awful (as long as you don\u2019t mind the slightly uncomfortable elements I mentioned before), but at the same times it does not do enough with its premise to actually be interesting or insightful. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll eventually get on to making the sequel that the show so clearly is trying to call out for, but as a stand-alone product I found this show mildly entertaining but ultimately lacklustre.\\n",

            "content": "This was an anime I had to watch cuz of its genre. I'm BIG into the superhero genre and when I heard about this my mind forced myself to watch it. Ive watched only one other superhero anime(One-Punch Man) and I loved it. What's unique about this series is that unlike most animes it has an American setting. Its whole concept does seem to want to attract the Western audience and as a person who lives in the states I was hoping it wasn't going to be a typical Sunday morning cartoon. After finishing the whole thing last night here's what I think. ***contains MINORspoilers***\\n\\n\r\nStory:8/10\\n\r\nVery unique and original. The plot starts off focusing on the relationship of the two titular characters and it did a great job on going beyond their conflicting personalities and builds the more substantial parts in their relationship such as trust and looking out for each other. The second main plotline is a lil more clich\u00e9d as it focuses on a character trying to avenge their parents' death. However what it does so well is take the series to a dark path and adds mystery to the story. It made the story more interesting and gives it a lot of depth. Well paced, well written, and its use of effective plot twists is what sets up a great conclusion to the story. It's main flaw here is that it can at times fall under western superhero clich\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nVery good all around, the biggest standout here are its character design. Each character was detailed very well it did a great job on not having everyone look like each other like what a lot of animes do. CGI work was incredible and what's most impressive is how well it combined with the series' normal animation. The costume design was also great and use a lot of range with some that have use of CG. Its art style had a great comic book feel to itThe minor flaw here is that at times the normal animation wasn't given that much attention. For example in some action scenes the facial features would be altered and it would look stiff. Other stand that, this was the area where the series excelled the most imo.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting here was superb. Their wasn't a single voice that made me cringe here and all the character's voices fit them. Wally Wingert and Yuri Lowenthal really did a great job as Tiger and Bunny they brought their characters to life. A lot of characters had their own catch phrase and the voice actors really nailed it. The music here didn't really stand out, there wasn't a single track that wowed me unfortunately. However it did a good job with matching most of the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8/10\\n\r\nA very likeable cast. So many characters here that are just so interesting. Tiger and Bunny may have very different personalities but it stand outs very well in their own way. The relationship development was a huge highlight as they started off as guys who couldn't trust each other at all to being able to rely on each other. Most of the side heroes had their own episode to shine in but I really wished we were given more backstory to some of them. There was an anti hero we were given who I thought was so cool and his backstory fleshed out his motives very well. My main problem with that character was that he/she didn't get a lot screen time which was too bad it stopped him/her from really being a HUGE standout. The villains in the show were great at being in bulk of its storyline. There was one villain that was a lil clich\u00e9d due to his philosophy but did a great job in adding tension in the final arc.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\\n\r\n+A well written story with good amounts of twists that centers around sponsorship making it unique\\n\r\n+Excellent CGI animation and cool character designs\\n\r\n+Good characterization and several heartfelt moments that really touch you\\n\r\n+Conclusion is well executed\\n\r\n+Tiger and Bunny's relationship is a beauty to watch\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\\n\r\n-Second half gets into superhero cliche territory\\n\r\n-Some interesting characters that never got enough attention\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis an anime that definitely deserves a chance. Some people may look at the title and cringe a lil but for anyone who can just watch the first episode I think they'll definitely gain interest from it. What really impressed me about this series is that although its heavily influenced by American culture its more original than a lot of western superhero works. Tiger and Bunny is an original anime that doesn't have tremendous popularity but its one of the superhero stories anime has ever told and its one of the most underrated animes we've had thus far.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSub or Dub Recommendation: Dub",

            "content": "Ok this is not a freakin mecha ok? People really otta try it out , its exceptionally REALLY good. I try writing reviews for good things. But a few, this one is really well done.\r\nStory: 10\r\nOk you may think this is the basic kinda hero story but really it's not. It's different. Focused on an older male for once than the usual young teenager in middle school or high school. The story is in a way, a bunch of smaller stories that lead to the actual big plot, which you'll understand if you watch the show. Which I recommend.\r\nArt: 9\r\nThe art, at first i wasn'tso fixed on cuz it seemed abit..old for the time it was being produced, which at the time of this review wasn't too long ago. But really it just helps with the character emotions, and the color is really well done, the backgrounds aren't overlly boring and drab their actually designed, you can tell. Nothing should really bug you about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are good though to me they sound abit the same *sweatdrop* referring more to the 2 openings , the background *ost* music is good it doesn't bore anyone and it fits to the storyline, characters mood, and the setting of the time. It can be abit catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are all really different and they don't really mash, except maybe a few times. I liked most of them apart from the two girl hero's  , other girl characters are fine as they should be. The males are good looking and the main main guy actually has personality which is ALWAYS  a good thing in making good main leads.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nThis series had me waiting on edge every weekend to watch the new episode it was so good. So well done. You will find yourself wanting more of the series when it ends. You may even be shocked to the end. You will find urself going 'YES' at the outcomes of the final episode. So really. Watch it. I dare you. Go on. Just go. Turn it on. :I....\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10\\n\r\nLike i said, watch it",

            "content": "The greatest Heroes from all around the world are assembled at the metropolitan city of Stern Bild to compete in the greatest reality show about superheroes in the planet, Hero TV!! These mighty Heroes, who are also in the group of extraordinary humans with special powers known as NEXT, will test their physical, mental and their ultimate super power to fight off criminals and protecting Stern Bild from vicious crime and evil and compete for reputation points and popularity to become Most Valuable Hero of  Hero TV, thus making their name marked in the history books. LET THE BATTLE BEGINS!!\r\nWell, sounds quite intriguing, isn\u2019tit!?\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re still hiding in the cave or something, that is actually the main premise for this unique and ASTRONOMICALLY POPULAR anime that is taking the world by storm! From the studio which does the infamous Gundam franchise, I present to you one of the revolutionary animes of 2011. (Other than Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, of course.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give to you, a popular anime with the weirdest title name I ever seen in an anime, TIGER AND BUNNY!\\n\\n\r\nTiger and Bunny is, in my opinion, a bold move by Sunrise to fuse American superhero cartoons with Japanese cultures like Tokusatsu (mostly Kamen Rider) to interpret this anime into one hell of an experience to view the Heroes\u2019 life to protect Stern Bild from villain syndicates and massive crimes and at the same time, focusing on how humans with supernatural powers adapt to being a normal citizen in a real life situation, which makes this kind of anime feels like a mix of tokusatsu, action anime and real life all into one neat package.  In my mind, I just felt like I\u2019m watching good old Batman or Superman cartoons from the 90\u2019s which has interesting characterization and some significance in the story. Heck, even I felt that I was watching a Kamen Rider anime that makes more sense! (THIS ANIME IS 1000 TIMES BETTER THAN THAT AWFUL SD KAMEN RIDER ANIME WHICH I WILL NEVER EVER GOING TO WATCH EVEN FOR 1 SECOND\u2026 I\u2019M SERIOUS HERE\u2026) that is one of the many WOW factors that makes Tiger and Bunny stand out from most of the animes from 2011. This is also THE CORE REASON that Tiger and Bunny becomes a hot cake sensation in the anime world! I mean, rights now, many daring cosplayers suit up as their favorite Heroes like a swarm of Heroes emerging out of nowhere! (Especially Wild Tiger and Barnaby. They\u2019re everywhere. In anime expos, in public photo shoots, it\u2019s THAT popular! I even had me with a cosplayer dressed up as Barnaby as profile pictures on my Twitter and Facebook accounts! That photo is the best thing I ever had in my entire life! BUUUUUNNNYYYY!!) Making it one step further, they even have their own action figures, towel, plushies, even model kits too! Heck, even real-life companies sponsored their Hero suits as their product placement on their suits!! (Never ever seen in an anime before! PERIOD!) THAT\u2019S RIGHT, THEY\u2019RE EVERYWHERE!! That is how Tiger and Bunny become UNEXPECTEDLY POPULAR, it all thanks to the strategic minds of the Sunrise anime staffs, implementing the popular American superhero genre into this one amazing anime! Kudos for Sunrise for strategically impressed the hearts and minds of all otakus into this one huge phenomenon that is Tiger and Bunny!\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10):\\n\r\nThis series mainly focused on the main character, Kotetsu T.Kaburagi, who endures a \u2018wild\u2019 journey (No pun intended.) as the most justified Hero of all, Wild Tiger, in facing the real life of protecting civilians of Stern Bild while do some funny antics to brighten up his character. And then we have Barnaby Brooks Jr., a rookie Hero that took Stern Bild and Hero TV by storm with his savvy handsomeness and his amazing fighting skills in fighting criminals. Together, Tiger and Bunny (Barnaby) worked together as an amazing crime fighting duo to protect Stern Bild citizens and at the same time, becoming the town\u2019s favorite MVP Hero in Hero TV. The director of this anime, Keiichi Satou, has planned the setup of the story really well with how he managed the back story of the entire character roster. For instance, I love how he fleshed out Kotetsu\u2019s character by explaining about his philosophy of fighting as a Hero not to gain respect and popularity of citizens all because of looks and physique, but to save lives of the citizens of Stern Bild and protecting the city from evil like the Ouroboros (the main villain group of the show) in the name of true patriotism. Not to mention, his backstory with Kaede (his daughter) being involved really marks some thinking to the viewers well. Speaking of Ouroboros, I absolutely love how the director manages Barnaby\u2019s dark past well. Furthermore, love how the rest of the NEXT Heroes fleshed out their back story well. Love Karina Lyle\u2019s (Blue Rose) interaction with Kotetsu, especially when Karina confessed her intimacy towards Kotetsu a lot. Could we probably see Karina X Kotetsu blossoming to love in future movie and potential Season 2? I\u2019m sure cannot wait for this. Also, love the other Heroes\u2019 back story like how Ivan Karelin (Origami Cyclone) being the Master of Appearance in Hero TV, Pao Lin Huang (Dragon Kid) and her cuteness and not to forget the EVER HOT AND SPICY Nathan Seymour (Fire Emblem)! Yeah... However, I do find some questions still left in the dark and should be reconsidered for the second season. All in all, I thought that the script writers have done some decent job with the balance of focus of all of the NEXT Heroes, even though I do find the ending of the anime quite a bit rushed.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nMasakazu Katsura is a true genius when it comes to how the color palette works in the anime. The most noticeable one is how he designed the Hero suits, especially Tiger and Barnaby. Both Tiger and Bunny has that Kamen Rider-esque feel in their armor suits with CGI effects adding some magic to their fighting actions which some critics might feel doubtful with how Sunrise handles the CGI effects but in my opinion, Katsura and his Sunrise crew have done it pretty well. Plus, when Tiger and Bunny activates their Hundred Power, that\u2019s when the magic of CGI really shines with their armors light up SO EPICLY! (SO SHINY!!) Not only that, other NEXT Heroes also have their uniqueness and awesome X-Factor to their suits like the Idol Heroine of Stern Bild, Blue Rose with her icy sexy idol diva heroine suit that will make everyone\u2019s hearts shivering cold like ice! (NO BAD PUNS INTENDED...) Furthermore, Sky High might not have the epic Unicorn Gundam light shine, but his armor suit looks pretty patriotic and reflects the awesomeness that is SKY HIGH!! Origami Cyclone looks like a pretty epic Japanese ninja hiding in the shadows which I also love! Other Heroes also have pretty decent design of their suits so I have to give props to Sunrise for this achievement. Even the \u2018OH-SO-PEAUGH\u2019 Fire Emblem has some flare to his (her?) Hero suit. LOVE IT!As for the background, it feels like I\u2019m in a futuristic New York City, with some Asian spice to the scene! It feels like I\u2019m in a world crossing between Tokusatsu and American superhero comics, which blends really well! The animation quality is what to be expect for today\u2019s anime standard but the CGI effects is executed pretty well although sometimes, the CGI effects can deter a bit on how the normal 2D animation looks. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nThe music during the fights really amped up the experience that you are watching a superhero movie, only that it\u2019s anime. The composer has arranged the sounds with balance from fighting and action packed music to more subtle and calm mood, all packaged into one nice soundtrack collection. From the more convenient music during the Heroes\u2019 everyday life situation to some suspenseful and dramatic soundtrack when the Heroes are fighting the villains and the Heroes facing tough situation, the music stamps the mark for Tiger and Bunny as an American superhero-esque anime with nice blend of music. The first opening by Unison Square Garden is full of excitement with the great drum beats and the pace of the song that anticipated the viewers even more as if this song is PERFECT for superhero animes. The second one by NOVELS though was quite generic and nothing spectacular there. Also, I like the first ending by AOBOZU than the other one from TAMAKI for the same reason as the opening, though Missing Link by TAMAKI is quite a weird song, if I may comment. Overall, good combination of songs to make the vibe of Tiger and Bunny as an American superhero anime more visible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\r\nThe Tiger & Bunny philosophy when it comes to character is delve into the daily lives of the Heroes who protect Stern Bild from evil and at the same, become popular idols in Hero TV. And I should say the director did manage to interpret the entire Heroes\u2019 characters pretty decently.  Tiger and Bunny\u2019s character chemistry shines quite well when they are the dynamic duo. Sure Tiger and Bunny always in the crossroads at first but once they knew their own selves; they actually make a really great characterization when they fight crime or when they socialize to each other outside of Hero work. And then, there\u2019s Blue Rose (Karina Lyle), the Hero Idol, who always freeze crime and she\u2019s one HOT HEROINE!! However, at the same time, Blue Rose\u2019s secret love affection with Tiger quite mesmerized me but I wish that we can see more of Karina X Kotetsu chemistry because who loves Karina and Kotetsu team up as lovers? I AM. Keith Goodman (A.K.A Sky High) is a good man (NO BAD PUNS INTENDED...) who with his handsome looks and his flair with his fighting style makes him the TRUE MVP HERO of Stern Bild, no doubt about it. Dragon Kid (Pao Lin Huang) is one true kung-fu master with the pulsating lightning techniques but also one HELL OF A CUTE Hero as well. Fire Emblem (Nathan Lyle), well, he\u2019s quite a scary looking tranny to start with but hey, at least he\u2019s one entertaining and funny Hero with his own flare he had shown with the Heroes. Origami Cyclone (Ivan Karelin), always hiding in the shadows behind the Heroes on camera. (HE\u2019S A CAMEO MASTER, OF COURSE... SNEAKY.) And Rock Bison (Antonio Lopez), Kotetsu\u2019s friend and one strong Hero, being like a desperado of some sort. I mean, these main 7 Heroes have their unique character traits and each of them has shown their personalities well blended. Even the villains and side characters have their own story to tell with how they expressed in this anime like the Kotetsu family being one of the main character spots for Kotetsu. Even the mysterious vigilante known as Lunatic (Yuri Petrov) has his own tragic memories that shapes up his character pretty decently into who he is in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nIn retrospective, Tiger & Bunny has delivered really excitement action; intriguing suspense, interesting characters and decent music that shapes up into a Japanese take on the American superhero genre that have been adoring anime fans for the past few years. I think that Tiger &Bunny is quite unique and abnormal from most of the animes nowadays, full of Ecchi and fanservice. (YEAH...) And I think this anime definitely adores a lot of anime otakus worldwide as proven by the popularity alone. However, I felt that there are some mysteries and plot holes that should had been resolved, like the Ouroboros and the history of Stern Bild in detail. Sure, we have to wait for the 2nd Tiger & Bunny movie in 2013 if there\u2019s any chance of resolution but I think the Tiger & Bunny anime workers there at Sunrise quite delivered a pretty good anime. Overall, if you wanting to escape from the boredom of the same fanservice time to time again, then Tiger & Bunny should break the barrier and delivers something different but really full of excitement for every Anime fans to enjoy. \\n\\n",

            "content": "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE\r\nOkay in my reviews i am going to tell my opinion on three things: plot, characters and overall. I may write some additional note if something was particularly good or not (like art or the characters voice).\r\nI am going to try to be impartial, even if i like the anime a lot or i dislike it and put things in the right setting (i can't expect a deep plot for an harem)\r\nREVIEW\r\nWhat's wrong with the name? When i read this title i thought it was on a stupid comical duo with a slice of life plot but a friend of mine said \"watchit! you are not going to regret it!\"; i listened him and i don't regret it.\\n\\n\r\nPlot - 9\\n\r\nAbosolutely Great: A cool shounen with a deep plot and a bit of comedy: the perfect mix for my tastes! The setting is a metropolis where heroes with different kinds of power fight the criminal, sometimes criminal even with superpowers like them. Fights aside they are not machine so plot will show you how they start being hero and WHY THEY FIGHT. Some things are pretty clich\u00e8 keeping the plot from getting a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\r\nThe show it's pretty much focused on tiger, all the other characters (barnaby included), sometimes will looks just \"backgrounds\" chars and they will do nothing in particular that we'll make you remember them (i mean things like \"wow xxx said that cool thing\" or \"xxx was totally cool\"), that's my opinion. So hey, why 8 to characters then? Because even if they \"lack\" a true personality they are well made: they have their own beliefs , their own goal and their own way to do their job so they are fine while tiger is so far one of the best deep characters ever seen so far: if you like heroes, you are going to like him!\\n\\n\r\nNotes - There are minor flaws, both in the plot and the action. Example of this are: while jumping and run out of power tiger he fell down (if my physics' knowledge is not wrong the duration of the jump depends just from the might of starting jump might (the vector)) and some almost impossible coincidence happen to make the plot more interesting\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nNice show and if you like action and a good plot you MUST ABSOLUTELY SEE IT. I just saw it the 2 time and i really like it; it made me remind why i am still helping people :)",

            "content": "Damn I wish more people talked about this show. Y'know, I remember hearing from a friend that the creator fought to have our main character be a thirtysomething man rather than another goddamn high schooler, and I'm kinda wondering if that would have in fact made a difference. This show doesn't really stick to the anime cliches. Frankly, if you told me this was written and animated in like France or Canada or something I'd probably nod my head and say \"yeah, that sounds about right.\" And that's why I love this show so much. It's not an anime, it's a goddamn story. \r\nLet's talkvisuals. This is a show that blends CGI with flat animation, and I have not seen it done better than here. It flat out works. Also, the animation uses red lines instead of black so it blends with the 3D better. It's a bit jarring at first, but you get used to it. Now that we've addressed the elephant in the room, this show is gorgeous. I don't throw 10s around willy-nilly, but Tiger and Bunny earned it. It takes place in a city covered in dazzling lights, it simulates news footage expertly, and the characters look anime-esque while being part of the show's own art style. The lighting is good, the angles are good, it's just a good looking show in general. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all fantastic too. Our two totally hetero leads play off each other well. Sure, their relationship is a bit cliche, one's a strict by the books cop who uses new tech, one's a free spirit who does what he thinks is right, but it goes deeper than that. I won't spoil much, but both their personalities were influenced by... important people, in one way or another. The side characters are all great too, you get a feeling they're real people and not just cardboard cutout cliches. I really enjoyed the time spent in the superhero workout room, it felt like I was really chilling out with complex, normal people. Well, sorta normal.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is by far the best part. I'm afraid I can't get into much detail, but there's conspiracies, moral ambiguity, and some interesting reveals. The setting is honestly pretty well thought out too- a world where there are superheroes, but they're all sponsored by companies like race car drivers, and the whole heroing is used for reality TV, only it's actually real. (sick burn, bruh). Kinda like Futurama- taking something otherworldy and wish-fufilly and throwing some harsh realities at it. Like Futurama, what you end up with is something smart, interesting, and entertaining.",

            "content": "I only recently created an account on this site (as I realized it was useful in organizing anime I plan on watching), but after finishing this anime just today I felt I had to write a review for something so wonderful.\r\nI love this anime and will probably hold it close to my heart for a very long time. The characters are so well written and the way the anime portrays them makes them even realer. The side characters don't even seem like side characters and the ones I had bad impressions of at first I found myself loving by the end of the story. FireEmblem's battle with accepting himself and his nonbinary gender (being neither girl nor guy) was so great and it wasn't even a necessity but they animated it and put it in the anime anyways.\\n\\n\r\nI found every character likable, but most surprisingly of all I loved the main character Kotetsu. He is a single dad with a young daughter who he cares deeply about. His character is optimistic but not to the point of being obnoxious or ignorant of realistic expectations, which is what made him so great. None of those edgy dark teenagers with a broken past, here is Kotetsu, a middle aged man with a really positive outlook on life, even when everyone tries to push him down. \\n\\n\r\nBarnaby, our deuteragonist is my favorite character of the series by far (I can't help but love the pretty boys). His background and story help develop his character and explain his reasoning for his assholery in the beginning of the show. He's had a bad life man.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I know it's probably for the sake of setting (very American-esque) I love the racial diversity within the cast and the people in the background. Kotetsu our main is obviously Japanese, Barnaby I'm not so sure but he might be British, Fire Emblem is black, Rock Bison is Latino, Blue Rose is white (not sure of ethnicity), Dragon Kid is Chinese, Sky High is your typical white American dude, and Origami Cyclone is Russian. This is the main cast of heroes but racial and ethnic diversity is present throughout the series with background characters and side characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read my profile you can see I'm a gay squid on the lookout for gay anime, and seeing as there are so many fan works of Kotetsu and Barnaby together I just had to watch it myself to see what all the fuss was about. I came for the gay but I also ended up falling in love with the story and nearly everyone in the anime.",

            "content": "T&B is a curious meeting of anime and American superhero lore. It has plenty of influences from both, which results in a unique style that probably won't work for everyone. Another thing which might be something of an acquired taste is its character-centric approach. While action of the villain-defeating and people-saving sort is far from absent from the show, at the heart of the story is a buddy-cop style forced partnership between two people who seemingly couldn't be more different. \r\nKotetsu and Barnaby aka the titular Wild Tiger and Bunny \u2013 a nickname the former comes up with for his younger partner, and the evolutionof which from insulting to affectionate is a beauty to witness \u2013 are widely regarded as the past and future of the hero business: Kotetsu as the old-fashioned, \u201cuncool\u201d relic of simpler times who'll always do The Right Thing with no regards to the consequences to his image or the infrastructure of the city; Barnaby as the icy, PR-savvy young professional who goes about everything in life with ruthless efficiency and not a moment spared for untelevised pleasantries. On a deeper lever, however, the duo's problems stem not primarily from their different backgrounds and the generation gap between them \u2013 which are often exploited to comedic effect \u2013 but from their complete inability to open up in order to establish anything resembling a genuine partnership. They're both people unused to sharing their burdens, who've made a career out of helping others despite \u2013 and the bittersweet irony couldn't be clearer \u2013 not even being able to help themselves. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Barnaby is consumed by the singular goal of avenging his parents' deaths a la Batman, Kotetsu \u2013 who talks a good game of being social and cheerful \u2013 is just as isolated and stuck in his own head, having lost with his wife not only the love of his life but also his most important confidant and supporter of his heroing. The fact that her death had nothing to do with his profession does not stop him from feeling guilty about not being there for her in her last moments \u2013 a sensitive choice on the writers' parts, because while any method of killing off a protagonist's spouse has its dramatic possibilities, choosing to portray the irrational guilt and self-flagellation the loved ones of the terminally ill frequently go through is far more emotionally resonant than any villain-inflicted alternative would have been. Add to this some more irrational-but-true-to-life guilt of a parent who always tries to make the best choices for his kid yet always seems to fall tragically short of making her \u2013 or himself \u2013 happy, and you've got rich character drama for miles.\\n\\n\r\nIf the initial problem the two face is their respective lone wolfing, it seems apt that this is precisely their point of connection, too; the thing they share that eventually allows them to understand the other and be understood in return. If that seems cheesy, it's because it kind of is. It's one of the charms of the show, along with a plot which could be described as nostalgic or predictable depending on one's general fondness of old school superhero stories, and a supporting cast nicely balanced to be big enough to offer diversity yet small enough to avoid making the story feel crowded.",

            "content": "TIGER & BUNNY. A personal favorite of mine. \r\nBefore I watched this amazing anime, I thought that this would be one of those really lame kids' show like Sesame Street or what not. After watching it I can confidently say that this is one of those really awesome kids' show. To be more honest, it feels like watching a TV version of Pixar's 'The Incredibles'. \r\nThis anime focuses on the genre of superheroes. Not animals, not mechas (if you were mislead by the artwork or title) but superheroes. Superheroes who have mutated over the last 45 years and are now saving the futuristic city ofSternbild from evil misdoings and crime. However social media and attention have been given to these superheroes and now the 8 most famous superheroes are 'owned' by companies who participate against each other in the TV show 'Hero TV Live', which ranks heroes by the number of criminals captured and the number of civilians saved. It is indeed a very interesting setting which had not been explored in many western superhero cartoons such as the X-Men or the Incredibles. \\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is an old sort-of guy called Kotetsu Kaburagi, or by his superhero name, Wild Tiger. He is one of the 8 most well known superheroes who participates in 'Hero TV'. Eventually he becomes unpopular by the masses and his company is forced to close down. Wild Tiger is 'bought' by a new company who is then forced to partner up with a guy called Barnaby, and together they bring together the first 'superhero duo', Tiger and Barnaby. However, due to the appearance of Barnaby's hero suit and his name, Tiger nicknames him 'Bunny', which is how the title of the series comes to be. \\n\\n\r\nIn every aspect, (and my points may be very subjective from now on), this anime ticks off what it tried to be. \\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nThe first few minutes of the first episode really captures what the anime is about. How social media and attention wraps itself around the opportunity that these \"NEXTs\" (The fancy word for mutants) bring with them. Later on though, the story dives into each of the 8 superhero's pasts. Not very interesting so far, but once these pasts are established and the superheroes solve a few crimes, things then get really intense. We dive into an actual tight plot which will won't go away until the very last episode. Story-wise, I think that the producers of this anime have done a fantastic job and have achieved what they have set out to do.\\n\\n\r\nSound etc:\\n\r\nThe voice acting was done very neatly and smoothly, I didn't feel as if they weren't half-hearted into their acting. Voice acting was done pretty decently.\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs were pretty catchy to me too. No problems for me there. I didn't pay much attention to the EDs (my apologies)\\n\\n\r\nAnd the background music is very distinct. It's not annoying but it will stick in your head in a good way. The music used will very much remind you of western style movies and tv shows regarding the superhero/action genre.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation:\\n\r\nThere are lot of bright and flashy colors in Tiger & Bunny, which I appreciate. It doesn't overdo the flashes either. Each of the 8 superheroes have a specific design and color for them so it wasn't hard for me to remember all 8. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself wasn't done too badly either. A lot of CGI was used to create most of the effects but that didn't hinder my experience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTiger & Bunny presents a wide range of personalities. On one hand you've got Tiger, the old aged guy who cares only about saving civilians and bringing justice to criminals. On the other hand, you've got Bunny, who doesn't really care about saving civilians or bringing justice to criminals but rather accumulating points and popularity. As you can expect, partnering these two together will bring some very loose teamwork. And that's how they start off, but towards the end they demonstrate the importance of trust, friendship and teamwork. And of course there are the other 6 superheroes and other main characters whom I fell in love with thanks to their intriguing and well developed characteristics. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment:\\n\r\nI really, really, really, really enjoyed watching this series. It was nice to explore a new, refreshing genre other than Romantic Comedies, Normal High School Life or Action in a far distant future. Tiger & Bunny has hit the target of what the show wanted to be and I am more than happy to say that this anime has been a real enjoyment to me. \\n\\n\r\nTo everyone out there, this is an anime for everyone to enjoy. It isn't hard to understand the context or to fall in love with the characters. It's an anime worth watching.",

With that history in mind they have been turned into justice enforcing TV casts in their own show.\r\nThe so called heroes are sponsored by may different companies, advertising while getting paid for being a walking billboard, just like in our current world of advertisement revenue.\r\nTiger and Bunny both act as the opposite end of the spectrum; Tiger focuses on simply saving and helping people regardless of rulesand damages, while Bunny tries to follow all the guidelines while doing his hero duty.\\n\\n\r\nLunatic is the anti-hero and also antithesis of duo Tiger and Bunny, punishing villains with death penalty. These three represent different aspect of what justice should be: protection of civilians, politically correction, capital punishment; which ultimately questions oneself if they are truly doing the right thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe show ends with each having come to their own conclusion of justice and neither of any opposite extreme is simply the best, as there are many varieties of villains that requires mix of the three ideals.\\n\\n\r\nColours and style both influenced by western comic coupled with Japanese animation. The character design, setting, visuals all blend well together to produce authentic western experience.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was consistent throughout with well above average quality, and although 3D superhero suit seemed a little out of place at times; it was still well blended in for minimal annoyance.\\n\\n\r\nAs a disclosure I am biased as ads when it comes to superhero content.\\n\r\nShould you recommend Tiger & Bunny? Eh, if you enjoy watching info-mercials at 3am\\n\\n",

            "content": "I first time watched this anime in 2011 and I never forget the enjoyment till now. The first time I decided to watch this anime is because my friend recommended this to me, but at the first time, I feel the title is not too appealing. But, it is really good actually!\r\n==============================================\r\nSYNOPSIS\r\n==============================================\r\nThis is a story about superheroes in a city (take place in America). What make it different is: there are agents that make use of them for television shows purpose! So, imagine if in the city there are burglary, then immediately a helicopter is coming and they broadcast the fight between the superhero andthe burglar to the viewers. The superhero itself is a kind of job to get money and become superstar!\\n\\n\r\nNow the main characters are Kotetsu, an old man with a daughter.\\n\r\nWhy the anime name is Tiger and Bunny is because Kotetsu wears the TIGER suit when doing the job as superhero, and he pairs with a \"seems promising and intellectual\" guy named Barnaby Brooks who wears a BUNNY suit. They are not really friends but they have to work together in the field because of their job...\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\nWHY I LIKE IT\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\nIt is because the concept is good. I never watched other anime like this before. It is face paced 25 episode-anime with a great characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe 1 to 8 first episode might quite slow,but episode above 8 is addictive. I never find any other anime that the villain is like this and to how to beat it is also different with other anime. The main characters have to have a plan to beat a villain, not just doing push up or sit up or etc, etc. The other characters' background are presented well in certain episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many conflict presented in this series as example: How to handle the job as superhero. How to have time with family while you are busy with your job. How to beat a villain who are impossible to beat. Who is actually the villain.\\n\r\nAh. You might think that the conflict is the same like another superheroes movies like SUPERMAN or SPIDERMAN, aren't you? It is different, because the main character here, Kotetsu and Barnaby, are actually not as strong as spiderman or superman, and many is different including the power they have and the villain. Tiger and Bunny is not the only superheroes in the city, but actually there are many other superheroes.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is funny, but most of the time it is serious. When it is in serious moment, I can feel the thrill and excitement.\\n\\n\r\nThe action fight is really short. 10 minutes maximum. THAT'S WHY I LIKE IT. If the fight take above 10 minutes, it will be too dragging and boring. I don't want to watch one thousand punch fighting or kamekameha fighting like dragonball that each battle might take 5 episodes or more... I don't want to see another fight punch here and punch there with the tactic of super hero manipulation. I don't want to see fight where the main characters evolve the punch from version 3 to 4, or from 4 to 5, because if it is like that, again it will be too boring. However, Tiger and Bunny is not like that. It is short but the action is exciting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows present predictable moment and also unpredictable moment quite fairly. It is easy to predict that the main characters will win of course, but the problem is the \"what\", \"why\", \"how\", and \"what the impact if you win\" is something you cannot predict.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending might be unsatisfying by the others, but for me it is quite good and realistic. If there is second season, I definitely will watch it.\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\nTHE BAD SIDE\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\nI cannot find the bad side of this anime except: The first episodes are quite slow because this anime needs to present the background before it goes to the main conflict.\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\nI recommend you this anime as it is the same tier with FMA:brotherhood and steins gate. Please don't judge the anime by its title alone.",

            "content": "This is by far the only show I have rated full 10s for. I really enjoyed this anime a lot, it was entertaining from beginning to end. I am a little irritated with the ending however, for it feels like their should be more. Guess that means I'll have to go and read the manga ^^ But hey, it was an amazing anime, so I'm sure the manga is just as good. On with my review.\r\nStory - 10 - The story was indepth and had a lot happening within it. But it wasn't too much and had a nice flow to it. It went smoothlyand wasn't hurried. All the little fillers had meaning and there was a reason for all of them. The story was also understandable, you knew what was going on and I believe there was never a dull nor confusing moment within the anime. Even the first episode was easy to understand, it explained a lot about the anime and what went on. Truely well thought out it was.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10 - The art was always eye-catching and the normal art with the advanced animation clashed well. And the expressions were clearly visiable at every moment, it was not hard to tell what was going on during the show. The style used was also very catching, I loved the way it looked and after referring back to the manga, the styles are almost identical. I did not see any changes between drawing and animation, which is a good point to me, for I feel if they do not resemble the manga much, then it is a difficult transition from the anime to the manga and vice versa. But this is not one of those and I am glad I will be able to read the manga with ease.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10 - The sound was always spot-on. The music gave a good feel to the anime, at what was happening and the mood of the scene. The openings and endings were also enjoyable and seemed to fit well with the show and the story. I have only watched the dubbed version of this and I have to say, Funimation picked the right people for the characters. I could feel the feeling within the acting and I now always imagine those voices with those characters, even when I am just looking at pictures. The sound effects fit with the style of the anime and were always believable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10 - I noticed that they had a little bit of everyone in the main cast, and I like that. It was not just showcasing one certain character, it was showing them all. Yeah, the main focus may have been Barnaby and Kotetsu but you could tell that the other heroes had just as important roles as well. Everyone had a reason for being there and were not just an extra to fill in time. Even the extras had a reason, which is good in my books. And the personalities of them all were perfect, you could really connect with a lot of them and even more, you could enjoy the way they reacted to different stuff. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 - I thoroughly enjoyed myself, it was entertaining from beginning to finished. I always wanted to watch more whenever I finished an episode. The only down point was that I had trouble trying to find the dub, I had to stop twice because the episode couldn't be found. Once at episode 14 (couldn't find 15) and again at 24 (couldn't find 25). And really, at those points, you don't want to stop watching. I really hated the fact that I couldn't find the final episode, since episode 24 was such a cliff-hanger. That's another interesting thing with this anime, the cliff-hangers, they were good ones. It made you want to watch more, not annoy you to no end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10 - I state again, this is by far the ONLY anime I have ever given full 10s for, and that is saying something, for I am REALLY picky in what I watch. Again, I enjoyed myself a lot during this experience and am a little sad that it is finished. But that won't stop me from loving the show, I will continue to look for stuff about Tiger&Bunny even now that I am finished. \\n\\n\r\nWARNING - Though, I will warn to those who may not like even slight 'Yaoi-ness', there is a hint at it, you can deffiently sense it between some characters. So, those of the light heart for Guy-Affection, don't watch. It may bring down your watching experience. \\n\\n\r\nThat is my review of this amazing show. I hope this helps a lot of you in wanting to watch it ^^",

            "content": "After typing up my review for Angel Links this morning, I realized that most of the time when I review an anime, I tend to focus on the ones I dislike. It's MUCH more fun to complain about a bad show than it is to extoll the merits of a good one, but that's also highly biased. So let's do one that I love.\r\nThis show might be called \"Tiger & Bunny\", but honestly, this is Tiger's show. A middle aged, single father, Tiger is our lead character. He's a bumbling, honest, hard working guy and at first I was a bit dismayed. All the otherheroes in the show are so much more visually interesting or have cooler powers. Tiger gets increased strength, speed, and endurance when he activates his powers - but only for 5 minutes. Wow. But the power fits his personality so well. And it also puts him into a unique position amongst the rest of the heroes, whose abilities last forever. Tiger's powers give him a time limit and that makes any situation he gets into that much more intense. Outside of his powers, it's Tiger's relationships with his partner, Bunny, the other heroes, and his family that push the show forward, and that focus makes for a united narrative.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, Bunny plays a large role. When watching the first few episodes, I figured we'd get a series of episodes featuring the extended cast - setting up the world - and then we'd go into a Tiger based story and a Bunny based story. But interestingly, the show uses Bunny's quest to kind of frame the entire show. You see, Bunny is the Batman of this world, seeking justice/vengeance for the death of his parents. I thought this was going to be the over-arching plot for the WHOLE show, but no, the writer's actually end this plotline relatively quickly. I was totally taken off my feet and after that, it was near impossible to guess how the show would move forward. I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, T&B is a VERY well executed show. The city in which it's set, Sternbuild, has this amazing design to it, evoking the urban landscapes that I've come to know reading Marvel Comics, but also the over-the-top architecture of Batman & Robin-era Gotham City. ENORMOUS statues litter the city and are worked into buildings or support columns, creating an very interesting visual. All of the characters have very unique designs, both in costume and out, which also helps ground the show. Tiger looks like an older guy when he stands next to Bunny, enhancing the fact that he's supposed to be middle aged.\\n\r\nRather than being all animated though, the heroes are CG models when in costume. At first it was a bit jarring - especially when Tiger lifts his facemask and there's an animated face combined with a CG body. But that quickly moves into the background as you move further into the show and pretty soon you don't even notice it.\\n\\n\r\nI have only 3 complaints that I can think of, so I'll make this simple.\\n\\n\r\n1) The initial fight with the first \"BIG\" villain. When he's introduced, we're unsure of the Villains powers or plan, but he challenges ALL of the heroes while holding the city hostage. I was absolutely impressed by not only his chutzpah, but the idea that he would take on all the heroes at once! Or even more interesting, how all of these rivals would work together to take down such a powerful foe. Instead, he proposes the classic anime tournament and I had to sigh. \\n\r\n2) Fire Emblem. Give the gay guy flame powers. HOW VERY CLEVER. I couldn't tell if I was supposed to laugh at this or cringe. Emblem is actually a pretty cool character in show, I loved how much he teased the rest of the cast while still keeping a \"den mother\" type feel.\\n\r\n3) The fact that Lunatic's plotline wasn't further addressed. I got a bit giddy when they introduced this Punisher-esque character and I love how he was used in the show. However, we never got any real plot for him. I understand that there is only so much the writers can fit in without sacrificing SOMETHING and I'm happy with the show as is. I just wish that this story could - or will? - be told somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThis show looks good, has excellent pacing, and is incredibly well written. Tiger & Bunny manages to focus on it's characters without sacrificing it's plot movement or vice versa. Well executed acting helps sell the characters drama and modern, clean visuals convey both the drama and actions scenes well. Absolutely a show worth watching.",

The plot was solid and quite original seeing how I usually don't see Japanese Super Hero animes Japanize American Comic Super Hero ones don't count. It has adventure, comedy, drama, romance and super heroes all the fixing for a awesome show. The\r\nstory never gets boring, it keeps continuing to go up and more interesting after each episode, I didn't think any episode was boring at all. It was either me laughing, tearing up, or omfgwtfbbqsaucepinappleXD. \r\nThe sound and art was spectacular especially the music must get the ostwhen it comes out XD. The are was anime to me somewhat similar to other hero type anime, but still has a flare of it's own originality. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were nicely drawn out with their own personality so each one of they were quite lively. Tiger the O.G, Rock Bison another O.G & Tiger's best friend, Fire Emblem the flamboyant one, Dragon Kid the tom boy, until understanding the true value of the hair clip her parents gave her then she act more girly. Blue Rose typical love struck teenager lol all I really want to say or else spoilers XP, Origami Cyclone is just a back ground hero until he encounter with his old friend then he vows to try more, Sky High is the Hero of Heroes and hot shot till Bunny shows up, Bunny is the hot shot new comer, and partner to Tiger however he doesn't acknowledges Tiger till later on. He calls Tiger old man which is why Tiger calls him bunny be cause of his suit which I thought was cool.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a very enjoyable show, great story, great character, and the music is awesome. The show keeps getting more interesting as the episodes goes on especially the major plot twist around 18 - 20 which I totally called and was like I totally knew it. All in all one of the only Perfect 10/10 animes I seen and I highly recommend it to anime lovers",

            "content": "If an anime involved mech or mechanized suits, Studio Sunrise is a good guess to be involved. The extremely popular Japanese anime Tiger and Bunny is no exception. What is interesting is the director behind this operation was the relatively unknown Keiichi Sato with his only previous work being the creator behind The Big O. He was an animation supervisor, so this work was his first real step into directing. How did the advertisement heavy Tiger and Bunny turn out?\r\nOne can basically sum up this anime as what if people with super powers made money by working on a T.V. show sponsored by companies toprotect the city from crime. In this world, people whom have powers are called \u201cNext.\u201d The story follows a veteran hero by the name of Kotetsu Kaburagi aka Wild Tiger at the end of his career is paired to work with an up and coming cocky young hero, Barnaby. Thus the adventure of stopping crime on T.V. and an evil villain begins. The twist of the story is finding out who killed Barnaby\u2019s parent when he was but a child.\\n\\n\r\nTiger and Bunny is a very \u201cwestern\u201d concept and rolls with it. It does start extremely slow in its build of the world and characters. Any sort of plot does not occur until about the half-way point which can easily sway viewers to it mediocrity on a surface level. It is not a bad guy vs good guy approach, but rather looking at these heroes have real world problems from teen adolescence to parental distance from their kid. These episodes are very singular and episodic. Some character development occurs, but really misses the opportunity for continuity despite the writing being pretty solid for each episode. Being that each hero is an anime character trope does not really help matters. At least the banter between our two main characters is pretty funny and convincing.\\n\\n\r\nOther areas where the show falters is the sense of an actual conflict or real villain. Each villain is introduced, but never truly explored on other than a surface level reason or appearance. The worst offense of this is the anti-hero Lunatic whom never gets screen time and is hardly developed yet plays important roles in the story. The CG is pretty good for its time and should not deter from the show.\\n\\n\r\nTiger and Bunny has a good plot yet the pace of production is a bit messy, but written without plot holes. Villains are gradually revealed, but never hold much meaning to the story later or their place other than surface level. It does require patience from the audience, and any fan of Western super hero comics should give this a chance.",

            "content": "LIKE ONE SPOILER\r\nTo be honest, the only reason why I watched this 2011 anime by Sunrise studios (of \u2018Gintama\u2019 and mecha anime fame) was because I recently read that there was going to be a Hollywood adaptation of this starring Tom Cruise. I was surprised to have found that out because, as far as I\u2019m aware, this would have been the second anime/manga inspired movie in recent time featuring him (the first movie was \u2018Edge of Tomorrow\u2019 based on \u2018All You Need Is Kill\u2019).\r\nSo I wondered\u2026 Why was Tom Cruise going to be a part of a children\u2019s movie? From the name, it\u2019s apparent that\u2018Tiger & Bunny\u2019 sounds like a romantic \u2018Doraemon\u2019 or \u2018Ninja Hattori\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nBoy, was I marvelously wrong.\\n\\n\r\nTiger & Bunny turned out to be a kind of superhero anime I would proudly recommend to my elder brother who was big fan of 80s and 90s cartoons like \u2018TMNT\u2019, \u2018Centurion\u2019, \u2018Thundercats\u2019, and \u2018Swat Kats\u2019. It\u2019s the sort of cheesy goodness you\u2019ll enjoy on a Saturday morning \u2013 especially now when Western-style superhero shows, comics, and cartoons are full of darkness and edginess rivaling that of a fusion of obsidian and bismuth.\\n\\n\r\nTo properly talk about the very simple and straight-forward story of Tiger & Bunny, I first have to say that the show is laid out in a basic formulaic pattern. It\u2019s mainly divided into two halves. Each half has two or three beginning episodes which have to do with the conflict of that half and the over-arching plot which begins to roll out in the second half. This is followed by a few episodes of \u2018filler\u2019 to provide a bit of background on the anime\u2019s world and flesh out the one-dimensional supporting characters. Finally, the last three or four episodes take the pacing up a few notches and end matters with a bang.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to rate just the first half then I would give it a 6 out 10. I (and you probably too when you watch the show) found myself being irritated by the fact that superpowers of the heroes and villains aren\u2019t really explained along with no elaboration on the influence of the reality TV show in the anime called \u2018Hero TV\u2019 outside of the anime\u2019s city of Sternbild.\\n\r\nYou see, people with powers are called \u2018NEXT\u2019 by the public. Some NEXT become bad guys while some enroll in an academy to train to become a \u2018Hero\u2019 for Hero TV and save the day. These powers are probably due to technology. Or maybe because of the awakening of the human mind. I don\u2019t know. Are these powers inheritable. It seems like it but I\u2019m not sure. There are some fanatics who hate NEXT but exactly how bad is it? No clue. Sparse world-building really brings down this great anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in the last paragraph I did some major bashing on an ensemble of plotholes carefully selected from many, right? Then you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m calling this anime great.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that\u2019s because in the second half of Tiger & Bunny, I realized the kind of identity the show was going for and enjoyed it as such by choosing to ignore very loose world-building and the numerous plotholes put on glaring display. Tiger & Bunny wanted to be a light-hearted anime with an optimistic positive image while striking a JoJo-pose with one foot firmly planted in a shadow. And that\u2019s what I accepted it as.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the second half was just a tad above the first half in terms of character interactions and the overall plot, I still rate it significantly higher. An 8.5 out of 10, I guess. Why? Because I massively enjoyed it. And what caused this weirdly huge enjoyment?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters.\\n\\n\r\nKotetsu aka Wild Tiger is hands-down my favorite Marvel superhero (lol). No really, he feels exactly like a Stan Lee character but with most of the cheese and camp replaced with an actual human heart. He\u2019s probably the weakest Hero in the show but his aging widowed dad with a golden heart really warms you up. He\u2019s kind of slow in the first half but he really picks up in the second half when things go bad for him and his personal family life is brought into focus.\\n\\n\r\nHis partner is Barnaby Brooks Jr. (that\u2019s also his Hero name) aka Bunny lovingly by Kotetsu. Bunny is Batman. Literally. He\u2019s a less edgier, more human, and leaps and bounds not perfect at all. He\u2019s the best iteration of Batman ever. There\u2019s not much to say about him without spoiling but, let\u2019s just say that his development is choppy as hell and yet works quite nicely like that which is something I consider a remarkable feat in itself.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the supporting characters are one-dimensional to the bone. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they are bad. They are actually really fun and their interactions with each other and especially Kotetsu is just great. I like how the American isn\u2019t super patriotic; how the Russian isn\u2019t a vodka-holic, and how one of the black men isn\u2019t a raging gangster faggot. Japan, you did right here.\\n\\n\r\nFor 2011, the animation looks much better than some 2015 and 2014 shows I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s crispy, it\u2019s fluid, and it\u2019s consistent. Though, for an action show the combat choreography could have been better. People have claimed that the CGI in this is bad. I think those people are blind and whining for no reason. The CGI in Tiger & Bunny is extremely detailed and blends well with the 2D animation. In hindsight, the animation would have been very bland without the CGI.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve got nothing much to say about the music. The background music is typical Western superhero music. Fits the show well but isn\u2019t something I\u2019d save on my phone. The Openings and Endings are objectively good but they didn\u2019t tickle my ears.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this show and give it a startling 8 out of 10. If the plotholes weren\u2019t aplenty and so obvious and if the world-building wasn\u2019t so half-assed then this would have been an easy 9+ out of 10 show.",

            "content": "We've all seen and grown used to the multitude of film adaptations and video games based on various superheroes aimed at Western audiences. So when I first heard about this anime, I expected it to be more of the same but simply done from a Japanese perspective and wasn't hoping for that much. Boy, was I wrong! This anime quickly became one of my all time favourite series! \r\nThe series revolves around the main heroes, Kotetsu T Kaburagi (Wild Tiger) and Baranby Brooks Jr. who are forced to team up and work together. Now first of all, the idea of superheroes working for a companyto entertain people on television, as well as their suits being covered in sponsorship is a real novel idea. But it actually makes a lot of sense considering the capitalist world we live in, and this twist on the whole superhero genre makes it all the more interesting. Kotetsu's character represents the traditional \"I want to save people because that's what heroes should do!\" trope we've seen before, but Barnaby contradicts this completely. He is simply a hero because it's his job, and cares more about popularity. \\n\\n\r\nAt a pretty decent length of 25 episodes rather than the standard 12 episodes, all the characters have an opportunity to be in the spotlight and have their various personalities and backstories explored. Despite them all being superheroes, there's some great variety in the main cast as they all have their own reasons for doing what they do. The villains of the series also have their histories explored and are very engaging. The plot is very well planned out, and is all tied up pretty nicely at the end. No ambiguous \"wait, so are we getting a season two or not?\" ending. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs didn't exactly wow me, but sound nice all the same. The character designs and the art style is wonderfully done, and as well s action scenes there's plenty of comedic scenes to make you laugh out loud too. It was also really nice to see characters from different age groups interacting with each other. Overall, this is a fantastic series with it's main appeal being the engaging characters, and is definitely underrated. Even if you don't particularly like the superhero genre, I highly recommend you give this a watch.",

There were times when I thought, \u201cgee every character has a tragic past,\u201d though, and that did feel like an overused plot device, but it wasn\u2019t awful. It was interesting to see how each character coped with this past of theirs, not everyone was depressed about it or what have you. The basic plot reminds me of X-Men in the sense that there\u2019s people with powers (NEXTs) whoare being bullied or worse as kids, some of them resolve to use these powers for good, but others\u2026 not so much. There\u2019s even a villain in the first season that is very much like Magneto in the sense that he thinks NEXTs are evolved humans and should therefore be treated as gods and that regular humans aren\u2019t worth saving. I feel like these kinds of stories do put into perspective a very important point: don\u2019t bully others just because they\u2019re different, because you never know what they might resort to because of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe series had some great music, I especially liked the 2nd opening theme \u201cMissing Link\u201d by NOVELS and the 1st opening, \u201c\u30aa\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3\u3092\u306a\u305e\u308b\u201d (Orion wo Nazoru) by Unison Square Garden.

            "content": "This is a very humor orientated anime which I do not often watch many of. The main character Kotetsu (Tiger) is a very silly and modest person which makes it easy to like him. Bunny is more of the cool kid who everybody wants to be friends with and so Tiger & Bunny clash against each other, at least in the beginning. \r\nAfter episode 15 it starts to get a bit boring, so I just played it 2x faster than normal with VLC player. If you are a superhero fan you will find the whole NEXT hero thing very fun. I must say, this showis SHAMELESS about advertising! Since all of the heroes are on a TV show their outfits are branded with advertisements, which I'm sure the producers were happy to do. Near the end the story also touches on the whole machine vs humans idea and humans being obsolete. This is a really fun anime that I think everyone will enjoy :)!",

            "content": "Okay, first off, Tiger and Bunny is a super hero show.  It starts off with the idea of super heroes for commercial enterprise and runs with it throughout.  Even if that's not your thing though, I'd still recommend Tiger & Bunny.  The commercialism is ever present, but only sometimes in the foreground.  It often steps aside to let other aspects take the spotlight. \r\nAlso, the show gets better as it goes along.  The plot is relatively simple, but engaging.  The show's structure is reminiscent of Witch Hunter Robin's.  On small scale, each episode is just the incident ofthe week, but as it progresses, the show slowly builds up to a truly grand finale. \\n\\n\r\nTiger & Bunny is also good, old-fashioned fun.  It's relatively upbeat.  The characters are likeable, and have a certain genuineness to them that is lacking in most shows.  In particular, Kotetsu, who is a single parent, brings much to this show that feels new and different after all the shows with angsty high school protagonists.  He is self-sacrificing, but without the usual saviour complex that has grown so tired since Trigun.  His faults are an important part of his character, and they often define his friendships with other characters.",

            "content": "I definitely recommend this show to fans of Marvel en DC Comics, but also to anime fans who enjoy a silly joke in between a punch or two. The number of light-hearted scenes and life-threatening situations is very well balanced.\r\nAs a superhero fan I couldn\u2019t resist watching Tiger & Bunny. Needless to say, the synopsis on MAL doesn\u2019t prepare you for the diversity of hilarious characters and their eccentric styles of crimefighting and neither does it indicate how well thought of the plotline is.\r\nAt first the show felt a bit silly, with heroes earning points by capturing criminals, but as the story introduces the charactersand their backgrounds, it becomes more serious. There are several twists that totally caught me off guard and transformed Tiger & Bunny from a silly show to a real superhero story where they have to make use of each other\u2019s strong points to compete with the unexpected villain of the story.",

            "content": "I honestly love Tiger & Bunny as much as I love life. It really is amazing to me since it was indeed my first anime finished. Out of all, I'm glad this was my first anime. \r\nThe story/plot itself really is great, I could say it's one of my favorite plots of all time. How it all came together was amazing, especially the ending. There's nothing I could change about it, it really was that great for me.\r\nThe illustration was simply fantastic as well, I really loved Kotetsu's drawing more than anything. I really loved his suit and his normal clothes. Just the way helooked like was enough for me, what he wears and looks like is something I would love to look like one day. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack for this anime was simply art. Especially the battle theme, \"Power for the Future\" was stuck on repeat on my end for months and months to come. A more fitting sound could not be made for the battle scenes, it's really that unique. I simply love every part of this anime, really.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I would give the characters a 9 out of 10 is simply because of Fire Emblem. I'm not against black people or homosexuals, but the way he dressed and looked like, really, was so annoying for me. I'm not sure why but he just annoyed me to death. I loved all the characters too, except him. I found him the most annoying thing I ever came across. SORRY FIRE EMBLEM FANS. All in all, the characters were so amazing. I really loved how Kotetsu's daughter was such a big influence in the last few episodes, since she isn't seen a lot throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nI started watching anime in May 2013, Tiger & Bunny being my first finished anime. To this day I'm still obsessed with it. I love this anime to death, I simply do. I can't stress how much I do since it's not enough. All in all, watching this anime was one of my favorite decisions. I can't wait for the movie coming up next month, The Rising. Thanks for reading.",

            "content": "I was unsure about watching this show first i thought it would be about mecha then i thought it might be episodic since it is about superheroes (i dont like shows about mecha or those which are episodic). But i was wrong this anime is not at all about mecha guess i just thought so after seeing the poster, thats just the main characters suits and although the first few or some in between look episodic but they have a linear plot.\r\nStory:\r\nthe story is quite good although it seems episodic and dull at times but all episode bring some depth to the characters. The showsis not all serious just because it is an anime about superheroes it has good comedy especialy in case of the interactions between the main character and the others. If u can stick with this show through the end it will give u many suprises, and is not as predictible as i thought. Sometimes a bad ending ruins a perfectly good anime but the ending is also done quite well in my opinion and was quite satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI dont have muc artistic sense so i can't tell much about the art, all i can say is it was not irritating, just fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nthe background music is great it fits the atmosphere of the show. Openings didnt quite catch my attention, but the first ed was cool. The vioces fit the characters well especially for tiger\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe main characters along with the supporting characters are well done although one or two are annoying. Tiger is a very lovable character and was the sole reason i kept watching, he is not overpowered, is funny, shows character growth, although is optimistic and dense but not a braindead idiot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show might watch in future again although didnt expect much from this show. Although it can get dull at times but i hope ppl will give it a chance.\\n\\n\\n",
