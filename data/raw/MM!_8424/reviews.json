            "content": "There are many animes out there that have perverted characters in them, in fact most do, but animes that focus completely on one characters perversion are few and far between. Most are terrible porn like crap, but some like MM manage to do all that is necessary to be respected in this genre, namely be funny and have good characters. \r\n-Story-\r\nThe story follows Tarou who on the surface seems like a normal high school guy but in actual fact he's got a problem, he\u2019s a hard core masochist (he experiences sexual pleasure from pain for those who didn\u2019t know).Trouble is  he wants to benormal, so on the advice of a friend he seeks help from a club called the 2nd Voluntary club. Were the leader of the club is a sadistic, egotistic girl who accepts the challenge of ridding Tarou of his masochism\u2026\\n\r\nWhile this story line is far from revolutionary it\u2019s still something that I\u2019ve never came across before, which makes it refreshing to know there\u2019s still new ideas out there. It\u2019s funny as hell watching Tarou get tortured or put in embarrassing situations. The idea of characters from anime being S or M has been around for a long time but this is the first show I\u2019ve seen to make it the central theme of the story and it works great with plenty of great comedy and romance moments\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\n The characters of this show are great and have more depth than you would first expect, while most seem clich\u00e9 this actually make the show that much funnier as it\u2019s great to see your stereotypical girls thrown into the world of S and M. Of course the backbone of this show is the strange relationship between Tarou (masochist) and Mio (sadist) which is no surprise but there is some good side characters in this show too, like Yuno Arashiko a girl with a terrible fear of men but she is able to like Tarou because his masochism makes so that he is very unlikely to hurt her. And another sadist (the school nurse) and Taros friend who i can\u2019t say much about or id spoil too much.\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nAs this anime is mostly a comedy there's quite a lot of jokes in it naturally. Most are S and M jokes but thankfully there's little to no echhi in this anime. The rest of the comedy is at the expense of Taro as he gets his gets violently beaten by women (mostly Mio) which does little to cure his problem, rather it aggravates it. The humour won\u2019t appeal to everyone but i think it\u2019s quite good and better than many other animes of this type out there at the moment.\\n\\n\r\n -Art-    \\n\r\nThe art work is good, clean, clear but nothing that you wouldn't expect in this day and age but it helps make the show and its endless stock of jokes that much better.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\r\nOverall I greatly enjoy watching this anime and will continue to watch it to the end, the story\u2019s refreshing , the humour is great, the characters are interesting, the arts good and overall it\u2019s fun to watch. . Any fans of S&M will really love this anime as it\u2019s filled it so if you\u2019re looking for something funny and not too serious then this is perfect for you. \\n",

            "content": "Pre-notice: If you don't like bad things said about this, then don't read it. I don't want people having seizures and breaking stuff. Otherwise, keep in mind that this is based on the first 3 episodes. Maybe it'll get better later, maybe it'll get worse.\r\nWhen I first saw this anime on one of the download sites, I thought \"oh what the hell, let's give it a try. The art looks good\". Well the art WAS good, but that was ALL that was good about this anime. A few episodes into the anime, I stopped seeing the point. I was tricked.\r\nArt (10/10)\r\nAs I said before, theart is amazing. In fact, very few anime has art this good. The character figures and coloring really gives the viewer a sense of how great anime can be without the horribly disfigured eyes that take up 2/3 of the face or hair that looks like helmets. Around 99% of my attention to this anime was put into studying the art in the first minute or so of the first episode. Unfortunately, this enthusiasm did not last...\\n\\n\r\nStory (2/10)\\n\r\nThe story is horrible and completely pointless. Before some of you decide to send me death threats and whatnot, read on because it's NOT because I'm biased against masochism and other sexual disorders. This story is about a masochist guy Taro Sado, who wants to cure himself of the disorder so he can confess his love to a girl he sees while working at a shop. At this point I thought, \"ok that's fine, at least there is a goal in this anime plus the art is good\". He joins the Second Volunteering Club to cure himself of this problem. At the club he gets beaten around by the loli president (who I later learned was Sadist. Crap that made sense) and the girl who caused his masochism in the first place. But then after the second episode, it turns out the girl he fell in love with  is just a cross-dressing guy who also happens to be his only best friend. Now, to me the plot is dead here. Given that the reason he was trying to cure his problem was to confess to that girl, now that he knows his first love was actually his best friend as a girl, what's the point of trying to cure his masochism? There is no reason why he's putting up with the three girls just beating the crap outta him and treating him crap other than \"because he enjoys it\". But seriously, I'm not going to watch an anime about people beating each other up because they all enjoy it. I've got better things to do.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3/10)\\n\r\nThe characters suck because what they do doesn't make sense; it's like they lack half a brain or something. Sado is just pathetic. For example, although Yuno was the girl who caused Sado's masochism, she has no problem BAKA punching the crap out of him when he gets close due to her androphobia (fear of guys) even though it's mostly an accident. Not only does she NOT apologize for causing his \"perverted\" disorder, she treats him like a dog and constantly disparages him for the disorder that she caused. What's even more stupid is, despite this, Sado tries his hardest to help her and understand her. He even beats up the guy who caused her androphobia. Ironic isn't it, how he helps the girl who caused his disorder by beating up the guy who caused her disorder. What's more, ANOTHER arrogant little girl (OH BAT FLIPPIN GREAT) comes into the series and together, those three just beat the crap out of people day and night. Nothing annoys me more than little brats acting like all high and mighty and this anime hit that peeve in the face. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10)\\n\r\nOverall, the 3 came mostly from art. Other than that, nothing else seemed to be too great. I stopped watching after the 3rd episode. My lips were torn from biting my lips because I had to do so to bear watching it. It seems to me that although this anime could have been an attempt to combine romance and comedy, it had neither. There were too many scenes that I didn't even know HOW to respond to. I couldn't laugh because it wasn't funny; I couldn't feel sad because it wasn't sad and I couldn't say \"awwwwww, kawaiiii\" because I'm not that kind of a person and there wasn't that kind of a scene. If you want to watch an anime with great art but otherwise just that, the try MM! out. Otherwise people like me who actually like to see something get done in anime have much better choices.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Don't bother sending me the \"you're a cold hearted bast**d!\" and \"You're too immature to understand the love and devotion\" comments because frankly, I Don't Care. If you think you understand, then don't read this review and just watch it.",

            "content": "If you're looking for more of the same, then you're in luck. MM!, wittily titled after the protagonists masochism fetish, takes every character design and comedic gag as by the book as possible, for the absolute level of comfort viewing. MM! is enjoyable for what it is, a harem anime centered around a club that helps people, but it doesn't strive to go beyond it's original premise and ultimately that is where it falls short. Note that the numerical value I have awarded this anime with does not mean anywhere near as much as what I've said textually about it.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story begins with Sadohaving an uncontrollable urge to yell in joy about being abused by women. He seeks help by going to a certain club led by a self-proclaimed God named Mio. He later is introduced to an androphobic girl, a school nurse, crazy inventor, and even discovers his best friend enjoys cross-dressing. That's about as how deeply as the plot goes - you've seen all of this before no doubt. MM! is like the foundation of a house that doesn't get built on. It doesn't provide anything more than a mindless viewing. Though I enjoyed a fair portion of the story about Yuno, even her story was riddled with cliche and lacked the depth other androphobic females have had in the past. I just felt let down after a very interesting exposition with nothing to support it thereafter. I had hopes Sado's masochism would be psychologically analyzed, possibly a reason why he enjoys being abused so much, but I was hoping for too much. The comedy in MM! was a turn-off for me. The anime is riddled with over-referenced anime and the physical abuse humor wears off by about the second episode. In short, MM! is not a show you watch for plot nor is it a show you watch for humor. I'm unsure why you watch it then.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nHarem's never let me down - every female had different color hair! Sadly though, the creativity doesn't extend further into the show. The art design looks like a sloppily made Kanokon or Ladies vs Butlers with a huge gloss effect applied. There are numerous moments of re-used animation, ridiculous unattractive facial distortion, and awkward movements. As for the backgrounds, nothing to complain about for a school anime, but once again nothing that sets it apart.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nA saving grace in my opinion. I enjoyed Ayana Taketatsu (Azusa Nakano from K-ON!) as Mio, and at first I was a little worried on how I'd feel about her voicing a dirty-mouthed blonde girl but there was no reason for fretting. Her voice was the funniest thing in the anime. The OP \"Help!!\" was great in both versions of it being sung. The ED was also pleasant to my ears but it was nothing too notable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nSado - likes being hit by women\\n\r\nMio - likes hitting Sado, and her excuse is that by hurting him a lot he will be cured of his masochistic illness\\n\r\nYuno - like Inari from Working! but less cute and less believable as a character\\n\r\nNoa - loli who invents things that usually end up with a Dragon Ball reference (frustrating amounts of them)\\n\r\nThe rest - characters that a harem anime would most likely have in it\\n\\n\r\nI should be grateful that at least one character had decent development in this anime, because expecting any development from a harem anime is silly to begin with. The characters were all good enough, but once again they were weak and for the most part unlikable. Between all the fists flying in this anime (used as tools of perversion for Sado) and the ridiculous plot development (Noa tries to make all men in the world perverted at one point - this is not an anime to take seriously) it was hard to really make room for characters I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nI watched an episode of MM! a week, and then it ended. I will undoubtedly delete this anime off my computer and move along with the next anime Xebec has to offer. MM! did nothing but consume my time each week without instilling any feelings for the anime. Of course as harem standards go, MM! is not poor - it has a decent amount of fanservice and the protagonist isn't an asshole. That in and of itself is enough to make it passable, but there are harem anime that are at least more interesting out there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nUnless you're new to anime MM! won't spark more than a passing glance. The phrase holds true - once you've seen one harem anime, you've seen them all.",

            "content": "Taro is sick in the head. Mio is sick in the head. Yuno is sick in the head. I think you can understand where this leading. Fundamentally, every single character in this anime is sick to the extreme at one dimension of their personality.\r\nMM! is a story about the curing of a closet masochist by a sadist and the resulting shenanigans involving an androphobic, cross dresser, cult leader, prodigious inventor, lolicon etc. etc. It's basically a freak show, a twisted school drama, an exhibition of corrupted youths. But is that good?\r\nWell, overall, the fetish humor had its moments. I especially found it golden when theyspoofed another classic of an anime during a pervert battle sequence. I know it's been parodied a hundred times before but I still liked it. And I chuckled when the mom and sister had their scenes. Other than that, most of the time it jumped back and forth between the boundary of funny/distasteful.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really brought the enjoyment down a level for me was that from beginning to end Taro made as much progress in his rehabilitation as a homosexual trying to turn straight. It's funny because that situation is the primary conflict in one of the episodes and yet I found it irritating instead of entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nI really believed from the first few episodes that there would be some honest character development for Sado and the others even with the mass amounts of bodily abuse and constant vulgarity. After sitting through half of the season, I realized it wasn't going anywhere in terms of plot advancement. How frustrating. As for romance, that portion sort of rubbed me in a familiar fashion. Not in a good way, however, because it's a formula that's been done and done better by other animes.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's not a memorable show. If you're strictly seeking potent perverted comedy and nothing else then I recommend you watch this. If you're not of the \"scum of the Earth\" or \"pig boy\" demographic than I beseech you to pass up MM! in light of something aimed at \"upstanding citizens of society\"... \\n\\n\r\nJust a joke. You're not scum. Don't hurt me.",

            "content": "~Multilingual review, English & Espa\u00f1ol: MM!~\r\nSadomasochism, Comedy and Romance are the keywords for this series. Considering the bad times I had with similar series featuring these same themes, I would actually say this was a show I should have definitely passed, even if everyone tells me that I shouldn't judge a book by its cover I'm not able to don\u2019t give a first impression to something I haven't seen yet, I can't be helped. But since I'm a baka that doesn't learn from his previous errors I started this show anyway. Oh boy I did good...\r\nIn my opinion a successful romance doesn't resides only inits girls, since also the guy must be likeable, cool and funny. Many romances just focus on its girls leaving the guy with just a plain, lame and clich\u00e9 setting, thinking that only the girls are the soul of the show. That actually might be true, in part, because as always the main attractions are girls but I can't stop thinking if maybe am I the only one that think that a group of good girls liking a lame, boring and over clich\u00e9 guy just feels just too wrong, I really hope I'm not alone in that. Even if our protagonist, Sado Taro, might fall into a bit of clich\u00e9 traits, he manages to be everything, a cool, likeable and funny character either way, as well as our female leads, so even if a bit clich\u00e9, the characters result charming and likeable, is there anything wrong in that?\\n\\n\r\nSado Taro happens to be masochist, a completely hardcore pervert. He spend his miserable life between boring school lessons in the morning and a part-time job in a mini market in the afternoons, in all his misery the only spark in life is Shiori, a beautiful maiden that often goes to that mini market Taro works. His misery doesn't end after the job's schedule, as soon as he arrives home there's his older sister and mother that tortures him with their 'incestuous' love. Ah poor Taro!, no one understands him, all he wants is a pretty girl that kicks quite hard his ass, he question himself why this cruel world doesn't pleases him?, but after all, we know that a pervert doesn't have an easy life!. In order to express his love for Shiori, Taro decides to get cured from masochism and he revolves to the Second Voluntary Club, a club that's famous for helping the students with their problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe event that triggered the beginning for a more, new, painful life was the suddenly interest that Shiori express for Taro, but it seems she doesn't have the courage to talk with him, so Taro takes the lead and affront her. It's revealed that Shiori is actually Hayama, Taro's best friend, cross dressed. After the initial shock, Taro accepts Hayama's secret, grieving that his first love revealed to be a boy. Second Voluntary Club's president, Mio Isurugi, a girl with a BIG god complex had not forgotten the request from Taro and she's determinate to cure him from his masochism. This is where the show truly starts, Taro's being cured by any means possible by Mio, in the Club there's also Arashiko Yuuno, an androphobic girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe 3 main characters are Taro, our pervert protagonist, manages to be funny every time he have screen time, he's quite cool when the situation requires so that's probably the only and good point of him. The girl with an enormous god complex, Isurugi Mio, she's a sadistic tsundere, that's quite clich\u00e9 but since the protagonist is a masochist then that's makes of them a really nice duo. She does everything to cure Sado but that often offer her a possibility to express her inner sadistic side. To close our equilateral triangle, because Sado doesn't have a preference, there's Arashiko Yuuno, the kind and cute girl but those probably aren\u2019t her unique traits since she's a violent androphobic girl, through the show she revolves almost every of her attacks to Taro, to the fortune of this last one. If you're looking for original characters you won't find them here, our protagonists are cliche, I'll just throw it there, but it's how they determinate the evolvement of the anime what impressed and made me appreciate them.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a good contrasts between romance and comedy scenes, so it didn't feel off time or inappropriate never through the show, there was an excellent balance of them Rather than following a linear plot each episode offers a new plan to cure Taro and the consequences that derives from it. Very clever and original plans I must say, and thankfully, quite funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was quite nice, I really liked the character's design, they were detailed whiteout being too flashy. The animation was good, nothing overwhelming or below average, anyway it didn't influence or determine at all in the enjoyment. The OSTs were nice even if a bit forgettable; anyway it fitted each moment in the series. The OP single was really nice, both versions of it, Heaven and Hell. A really nice cast did the voices, Fukuyama Jun, Taketatsu Ayana and Hayami Saori, their voices fitted perfectly the personality of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed very much while watching this show. Definitely judging by only the cover, synopsis or wherever it\u2019s not the right thing to do, anyway if you're a baka like me then you shouldn't have problems skipping a win show like this. To those who aren't, just give it a try, the comedy is awesome.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Espa\u00f1ol]\\n\\n\r\n~Multilingual review, English & Espa\u00f1ol: MM!~\\n\\n\r\nSadomasoquismo, Comedia y Romance son las palabras claves de esta serie. Considerando la malas experiencias que he tendido con series similares, con temas similares, hubiera dicho seguramente que esta era una serie que deber\u00eda pasar de alto, aunque s\u00ed todo el mundo me repite que no deber\u00eda juzgar s\u00f3lo por la portada no soy capaz de no dar una primera impresi\u00f3n, mala o buena que sea, sobre algo que siquiera he visto, no tengo remedio.

Muchos romances se enfocan solo en las chicas dejando al chico con un arquetipo bastante aburrido, simple y clich\u00e9, pensando que el coraz\u00f3n de la serie son las hero\u00ednas. Algo que no es completamente errado, porque como siempre, la atracci\u00f3n principal es la chica, pero no puedo dejar de pensar que si soy el \u00fanico al que le parece que un grupo de chicas que guste de un pendejo s\u00faper clich\u00e9 y sin personalidad sea algo completamente est\u00fapido, estoy seguro que no soy el \u00fanico. Aunque s\u00ed nuestro protagonista, Sado Taro, caiga un poco en lo que consideramos clich\u00e9, se demuestra ser un personaje agradable, simp\u00e1tico y sobre todo, divertido, al igual modo que nuestras hero\u00ednas, clich\u00e9 pero simp\u00e1ticos y agradables, que hay de malo en eso?\\n\\n\r\nSado Taro es un masoquista, un completo pervertido. El pasa su miserable existencia entre las aburridas clases en la ma\u00f1ana y su trabajo de medio tiempo en un mini market en las tardes, en toda su miseria hay una sola luz en su vida, Shiori, una bella chica que suele ir de compras al mini donde trabaja Taro. Su miseria no termina despu\u00e9s del horario de trabajo, apenas llega a casa, lo que le espera son su hermana y su madre que lo fastidian continuamente con su \"amor\". Oh pobre Taro!, nadie lo comprende, todo lo que quiere es que una bella chica le pate\u00e9 el culo, se pregunta a el mismo que porque este mundo cruel no lo satisface, pero como todos sabemos, un pervertido no tiene una vida f\u00e1cil!. Para poder expresar su amor por Shiori, Taro decide de buscar ayuda, y la encuentra en el Segundo Club de Voluntarios, un club que es famoso por ayudar estudiantes a lidiar con sus problemas personales.\\n\\n\r\nEl evento que da inici\u00f3 a una nueva vida, m\u00e1s miserable, para Taro, es el repentino inter\u00e9s de Shiori hacia el, pero la chica no tiene el coraje suficiente para dirigirle palabra, entonces Taro decide de enfrentarla. Se da a conocer que Shiori no es nadie m\u00e1s que Hayama, su mejor y \u00fanico amigo, despu\u00e9s de un shock inicial decide de aceptar este lado secreto de el, al mismo tiempo, maldiciendo porque su primer amor fue un hombre. Es aqu\u00ed donde entra Mio Isurugi, presidente del Segundo Club de Voluntarios, una chica con un ENORME complejo de dios, la cual no ha olvidado el pedido de Taro de liberarlo de su masoquismo, comienza la nueva vida de Taro a merced de los planes de Mio para \"ayudarlo\", junto a ellos hace parte tambi\u00e9n del club una chica androphobica, Arashiko Yuuno. El tr\u00edo se revela ser muy divertido y capaz de coordinar una buena comedia.\\n\\n\r\nNuestros tres personajes principales son, Taro, nuestro pervertido protagonista, el cual logra ser divertido cada vez que aparece, el es admirable cuando la situaci\u00f3n lo requiere, su \u00fanica y sola buena cualidad. La chica con el complejo de dios, Mio, ella es una s\u00e1dica tsundere, algo clich\u00e9 pero desde que el protagonista es un masoquista, eso los hace una buena y divertida pareja. Ella hace de todo para curar a Taro de su perversi\u00f3n, lo cual a veces le ofrece ocasi\u00f3n de dar desfogo a su lado s\u00e1dico. A cerrar este tri\u00e1ngulo equil\u00e1tero, porque Taro no tiene preferencia alguna, esta Arashiko Yuuno, la chica dulce y gentil, pero esas no son seguramente sus \u00fanicas cualidades, desde que ella es una chica s\u00faper violenta debido su fobia hacia los hombres, violencias dirigidas exclusivamente hacia Taro, para la suerte de este \u00faltimo. Si estas buscando personajes originales no los vas a encontrar aqu\u00ed, lo dir\u00e9 claramente, pero fue como estos personajes determinaron los eventos sucedidos en la serie que me hicieron apreciarlos tanto.\\n\\n\r\nLa serie presenta un buen contraste entre el romance y las escenas c\u00f3micas, as\u00ed que no se sintieron fuera de lugar o inapropiadas en ning\u00fan momento, excelente balance de ambas. La serie no sigue un desarrollo linear, m\u00e1s bien presenta un formato epis\u00f3dico que ofrece siempre un nuevo plan de Mio para curar a Taro y las consecuencias que derivan de el. Planes que resultan brillantes y originales, y por suerte, tambi\u00e9n divertidos.\\n\\n\r\nEl arte estuvo bastante bien, me gustaron mucho el dise\u00f1o de los personajes, fueron detallados sin ser muy sobresalientes. La animaci\u00f3n fue buena, nada fuera de lo normal o por debajo, de todos modos no determina o influye para nada en el disfrute. El reparto musical, las OSTs, no fueron \u00fanicas, a decir verdad algo f\u00e1cilmente olvidables pero justas para cada momento y escenario durante la serie. El OP single estuvo bastante bueno, ambas versiones de la canci\u00f3n, Heaven y Hell. Un cast de Seiyuus de verdad experto hicieron las voces, Fukuyama Yun, Taketatsu Ayana y Hayami Saori, sus voces eran perfectamente en sinton\u00eda con los personajes.\\n\\n\r\nA mi personalmente me divirti\u00f3 mucho este anime. Juzgar solamente por la portada, por la sinopsis, o lo que sea no es la cosa justa de hacer, de todos modos si eres un baka como yo, entonces no hay riesgos de que te pierdas un anime tan bueno como este, pero si no lo eres, dale una oportunidad, la comedia es simplemente genial.",

            "content": "I usually hate when people write reviews judging by the first few episodes, but I think by now I have a pretty good grasp on it.\r\nThis is also my first review so bare with me, please.\r\nStory 9: The story is about Sado Tarou who is a \"hard core sexual masochism\"; someone who has pleasure in getting hurt. To cure his problem he visits the Voluntary Club, a place where they \"grant your wishes\". There, everyday, they try to \"torture\" him out of his masochism. He ends up joining the club with Mio Isurugi, Yuno Arashiko, and Michiru Onigawara. There he \"encounters\" more adventures into theirlives (though I'm not sure if that's the write choice of words...)\\n\\n\r\nArt 9: I'm a fan of the \"big eyed-moe\" art, so sorry if this also comes up a bit bias. Very colorful, and 'cute'. Not much to say about the art, it pretty much follows into the current style of anime these days (if you notice it's kind of changing).\\n\\n\r\nSound 7: Nothing much about the sound, it's just average? I really like the opening sound, the ending is okay, but that's just me. I'll leave the sound up to yourself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10: The characters is the best part. We have Mio Isurugi, or \"God\", one of the main characters. She is the heroin, a sadist and tsundere. (in my opinion is a great combination, since I love tsundere anyways haha;;) She and Michiru are the main people who try to help cure Sado. Her best friend is Yuno. She has a soft spot for her friends, and usually does nothing more than to help them. She often gets dressed up in clothes because Michiru makes her.\\n\r\nSado Taro, the one with masochism, Mio always refers to \"M! Pervert\". He, as well, will do almost anything for his friends. In middle school, he had been apparently been abused by a girl, who is at fault for turning him into a masochism. He gets abused every day by the Voluntary Club, to try to cure him. At home, he has a mom and a sister, who are obsessed with loving him. He works part-time at a convenience store. His best friend is Hayama Tatukichi, who seemed to be just about the only one who accepted him as a masochist.\\n\r\nYuno Arashiko is another \"moe-fragual-big-breasted-girl\" but, there's more to her than that. She is androphobic; a phobia towards men. By her past, you can tell she can stick through just about anything that you throw at her. She also joined the second Voluntary Club to help cure herself. Her best friend is Yumi Mamiya and Mio. Her dog's name was Taro, so to try to cure her phobia, she calls Taro her \"dog\", which is another strategy to help cure her phobia of men.\\n\r\nMichiru Onigawara is the schools nurse, and the second Voluntary Club's adviser. She enjoys dressing up Mio and taking pictures of \"cute girls\".\\n\r\n(that's all I'll do for now since there's not enough information on the other characters yet....look forward to another review!)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10: Sorry if this review came off as a bit bias. I love this! Most ecchis are focused on ecchi only, but the characters and Story line pull it together to make it over all a great watch. Very funny most of the time, drama is smooth and makes sense. Overall, I'm going to give it a 10. :D",

            "content": "Konichiwa, mina-san, this is akinari-kun from SUTORAIKUanime, here to bring you my first impression of MM!.\r\n\"T-the truth is, I'm a masochist! I get pleasure when women abuse me. It feels so good that I lose myself! I'm tellin' ya it gets really bad! What do I do!? I cannot control myself at all!!!\"\r\n And there you have it, the outline of Tarou Sado, a high school freshman with a sexual masochism fetish, or whatever the hell you call it. Whatever it is, it's funny, it's catchy, and it makes Mio look absolutely sexy.\r\nAnd that's how the first episode of comedy romance \"MM!\" started. Along comesthe OP, \"Help!\" by Ayana Taketatsu, with a catchy beat and suitable lyrics. I found it a little interesting that there hasn't been any pantsu flashes yet, not that it matters, but it's just there have been so many camera angles that refer to pantsu, but no pantsu are to be seen, strange...anywho, based on the OP, it is implied that this series is a harem, with all the kawaii desu girls and what not, but who knows, I'm just making an educated guess.\\n\\n\r\nHere we have the same guys who brought us Kanokon and Ladies versus Butlers (notice the animation similarities), XEBEC and AT-X. However, the character designer and directors are different, therefore the slight difference in animation, which I actually think looks even better than Kanokon and Ladies versus Butlers. First thing's first, I absolutely loved the character designs of both Kanokon and LvB, so I don't see why I wouldn't feel the same way about MM!. It's only the first episode and I'm already in love with the character designs AND their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nBasically the entire episode we are shown Tarou being tortured, kicked, slapped, tied, being hit by baseballs, etc. while he laughs hysterically and enjoys it all. I find this quite hilarious, and the fact that Mio is trying to cure his masochism by hurting him even more just elevates the humour of the storyline to a whole new level. But Mio isn't the only person that is involved with the torturing of Tarou...cue Yuuno Arashiko, a cute purple haired girl who finds Tarou absolutely disgusting (and also doesn't mind giving him a good beating).\\n\\n\r\nSeems like everything has happened in just one episode, even Tarou's sister Shizuka has a brother complex (yaay for brother complex!), and Tarou's mother has a son complex (err...yaay for son complex? Hmm...)! And what's even more amazing is that...IS THAT...AHHHHHHH I'm itching to say it, but I won't spoil the most epic scene of the first episode for anyone.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that wraps up my first impression of \"MM!\", I must say, I didn't expect much from this series, but I got quite a pleasant surprise and a huge load of hilarious laughs out of it, so I'm going to continue covering this series. And I'm quite grateful that Ryuumaru subbed it so fast, since I just happened to have a lot of time on my hands today.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, last but not least, COULD MIO BE A TSUNDERE!? \\n\\n\r\nThat's all for now, happy watching, mina! Join us next week as we cover the second episode of \"MM!\"",

            "content": "Believe me. I was skeptical at first. A show about a masochist? Hah! Probably it's just gonna be centered around hundreds of repetitive slapstick jokes. Turns out to be true. But hold on! Mr Masochist here has his own harem? What?! How can a masochist has his own harem when us normal people out here are trying so hard to get one! He's not even that good looking...\r\nTurns out like every male harem lead, all you have to do is be nice and overflowing girls will come after you. Now, this isn't realistic of course because guys like us aren't nice. Chances is if youhave your harem right now, its probably because you're loaded with good looks and money. (More towards the money department)\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10\\n\r\nThere's not much of a story here. Don't expect much of a plot development as I may remind you this is a harem anime. However I was expecting the story to revolve around other \"unique\" characters but the only thing you're getting is masochist mayhem. Nevertheless I do enjoy seeing them trying out new ways to cure his masochism (and inevitably failing)\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nWow! Everything look so bright and new! Such a cheerful image is portrayed in every episode. You wouldn't expect this much since the story is about a masochist. Shouldn't it be very.. I don't know how to describe it... Urrm.. Masochistic? \\n\r\nAnyways, if you're looking for a bright and cheerful type of anime and you're not a lolicon, then look no further!\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nOk.. I gotta to be frank here. I'm amazed at the Sado's seiyuu's constant orgasmic sound he makes when he gets screwed. And to couple with that masochistic bliss is a heavenly themed sound effect. I mean if your mum was to walk into your room while Sado is moaning in lust, she would think that you're watching porn!\\n\r\nOther than that, I love the individuality theme song each character gets when they make an entrance. Especially Noa's. I mean, how can you not like the sound of xylophones! It portrays Noa perfectly as a kid!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nWhen I started watching this, I thought to myself, \"Wow, an anime about every characters having some sort of psychological disorder! This is going to be interesting!\"\\n\r\nYeah I know, doesn't take a lot to interest me.\\n\r\nBut hey he has a harem! Let's take a look into that shall we.\\n\r\nOK so we got a Tsundere girl with a superior complexity and doesn't know how to cook, a big b**b girl who's afraid of men, we got a loli character, and some incestuous family members. (Geez what's wrong with the Autumn line up and all it's incest shows)\\n\r\nOk looks like he has everything a typical \"Chaotic\" type harem needs.\\n\r\nOther than that, male harem leads are suppose to have pervertic best friends. Well this one cross dress so I don't know how much pervertic can you get other than that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nHey, it's something new. You never heard an anime about a masochist before. Could be entertaining. And they added a bunch of DBZ parodies. Wow! That is until they run the joke dry. Well I hoped that each girl was given their personal arc with Sado but nope, it's mostly revolved around Mio and Yuuno. Still it is entertaining to see dense male harem leads getting beaten up. I mean, I would like to do it myself but seeing Sado won't get turn on getting beaten up by a guy.\\n\r\nAnd aside from DBZ superpowers, Sado do have one power that I insist all male harem lead should have. A twisted taste bud. One of the positive side about being a masochist is that you actualy ENJOY eating badly cooked food (A common anime troope for certain anime girls)\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nConclusion this anime is pretty unique in its own way but solely meant for entertainment only. Like many harem anime, do not expect a conclusion, I mean most of the time it's because the male leads are too dense. The slapstick comedy can get old really quick. But dont worry, like many modern day animes, fanservice is thrown in to momentarily grab our attention as usual. Nevertheless you would still enjoy the different variety of characters they have to offer.\\n\\n\r\nHaremu Kingu,\\n\r\nSigning off!",

            "content": "Since I mostly watch romance and harem animes, I figured why not give this a try. While reading through the story, I thought it wasn't going to be good. I thought it was one of those echhi anime with a lot of fan service, but then the word \"masochist\" caught my eye. Then, I didn't know what a masochist was, so I decided to look it up. I was so shocked the male protagonist is a lot like me, since i didn't know that I was a masochist. So I decided to watch the first episode to know if I was going to continue watchingthe series, I was really shocked, I was impressed and amazed. The art was good, the characters make me so lol. Though in the ending of the first episode, I felt like there was a huge possibility it was to become a yaoi anime. But overall it's an 8 out of 10 for me. \\n\r\n(I did enjoy it very much, not only in the first episode, but in the latter episodes as well. I felt sad after watching the last episode, because I had to let this anime go(due to this being a good anime), I felt sad partly because Akinari Matsuno died, therefore no way in hell there would be a second season. :(  ) \\n\r\nP.S. I'm still new to making reviews, so please feel free to comment on what i did wrong.",

            "content": "'MM!' is a slapstick comedy about a high school student who's masochist to the core.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story starts with Sado Tarou visiting Volunteer Club #2 to get his masochist nature fixed. He was immediately dubbed \"Butarou\" (pig bastard), and obviously a poor plan of fixing him through extreme pain was devised, and he gets to enjoy the masochism play everyday. Beyond that, there isn't really a story to this show, but this series is a hardcore slapstick, so a real story isn't needed nor desired. It focuses on the comedy and perversion of the protagonist as he gets into all sorts of strange situations thatmade 'MM!' a very enjoyable show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nNot many protagonists are so openly M and enjoys BDSM as much as Butarou. Having such a perverted and out of ordinary protagonist alone was a fresh breeze of originality that made this show hilarious. Pretty much all the girls around him are sadists who beat the crap out of Butarou, and become attracted to him. All the support characters were cardboard cutouts, but they managed to gather all the the stereotypical harems girls: Obvious tsundere; androphobic attacker; loli prodigy; jealous masseur, and a hot teacher to put Butarou into all sorts of difficult situations. Character development is once again very limited, but not really required.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\r\nSame faces, big eyes, all sorts of hair colors... it's your typical anime character design, but the Sado Tarou's hentai form is pretty funny, and all the girls are pretty attractive. Lots of fan service as well. Very vibrant colors and heavy glossy filter was used, and visually pleasing.\\n\r\nVery good camera work and angles, it's the type of animation that you don't get tired of just by watching the video.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nVoice acting was done pretty well, distinct voices for the protagonist and two main heroines. Taketatsu Ayana as Mio was identical to what she did with Kirino in Oreimo, but suited the character really well. Especially when she verbally abuses Tarou.\\n\r\nOP/ED were typical otagei anime songs, but the labeling of S/M for producers was a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nAlthough this show is very technically flawed, I enjoyed it a lot. Not many shows are as daring in exploiting fetishes as 'MM!'. The absurd situations like bondage in high school club room, memory loss, hypnosis etc were hilarious, and there was a lot of fan service as well as verbal and physical abuse. What this show really excelled was the energy and pacing. As far as slapstick comedy goes, this is among the best.",

            "content": "At first glance I expected it to be the crappy ecchi comedy of the season, and it pretty much was. Yet, despite the episodic nature and lack of progression I had a lot of hope.\r\nExpectation: 6-7\r\nEpisode scores: -,-,-,-, 4, 7, 4, 10, 7, 5, 9, 10\r\nActual: 5 (Average)\r\nThere was many episodes where I was stunned by the romance, and the quality of some of the jokes; I of course have always been a sucker for the pseudo date episodes, and this show played that card heavily. The only time scenes which truly bored me were the handful of long masochistic scenes.\r\n Yes, a lot ofthe time is spent beating up Sado in cosplay. While a little of this is fine the span of time wasted on these types of scenes was overdoing things. The story revolves around his masochistic personality, but they should of at least weaved it into an actually interest story at times.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of this the level of randomness and variety was also overbearing. After the first few were rather good and had a believable serious tone, all of a sudden people are pulling of dragonball parodies based on the power of prevertedness. While it was not all that bad i was somewhat surprised with what i was seeing. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no character development either, and they are all pretty one dimensional; nothing more than there single oddity. While i liked some of them i can not admit that any were actually interest characters. The caveat is that this is a comedy as well so I was not expecting much.\\n\\n\r\nIt was not a bad watch, and at times extremely amusing. However, an entire episode is either hit or miss; there is not really divided segments which i find allows me, in comedies, to at least enjoy one part. Due to this inconsistancy i can't say it was anything more than average.",

The show becomes focused on random events between the characters, the final episode coming out of no where completely in terms of plot relevance.  On the plus side, it isn't hard to follow, easy to digest, and would be a good choice if you watched an anime that recently blew you away.  Treat this show like a Saturday morning cartoon.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art is pretty average, butin a good way.  The scenery is vibrant, the characters look distinguished, the ecchi is appealing and well censored. Very colorful and eye catching.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nTo be honest I watched this show today and I don't remember anything about the sound.  I'm a musician so I automatically catch on to something if it peaks my interest.  Nothing here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nCharacters are Okay.  There's some good development and some mannerisms they get stuck on the entire series (which gets annoying for me at least).  The personalities for each of the characters are nice though, a fun cast over all.  I found it easy to match characters with their names, I usually have trouble with this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall\\n\r\nIt was a good way for me to spend my sick day, but I wouldn't recommend this for anyone looking for something life changing.

            "content": "NOTE: This anime was DROPPED by me, and as such the following review will only take into account things I actually saw during the short time I watched the series.\r\nDisclaimer: The following review is based on my personal opinions, and does not feature many objective analyses. As such, this may not coincide with yours, or the general publics opinions.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIn a lot of anime, we see lots of perverts, or weird fetishes amongst some people, and this all serves to make them who they are as a character (in most cases), but what if an anime would focus almost solely on one pervert, and his fetish,or rather his quest to get rid of his perversion?\\n\\n\r\nThat could be a pretty funny series (especially in the case of a masochist) if done right, but unfortunately, I don\u2019t feel like MM! succeeded.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (3 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nSo we have our MC, Sado Taro - masochist, who wants to get rid of this perversion of his. To do this, he seeks the help of a special club at his school, devoted to helping people with their problems. Enter Isurugi, a sadist with god-complex.\\n\\n\r\nNow, how is this sadist going to help this masochist get rid of his perversion? Well, the obvious thing is to... Torture... him...\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the entire series is about Sado being tortured and beaten in various ways, to cure him of his perversion, with some romantic sub-plot (at least in the first couple of episodes), and the rest of the time it\u2019d just be about Sado\u2019s daily life as a sadist.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (7 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality and character designs are actually pretty good, to be honest. While not anything fantastic, the backgrounds make for a nice setting, and the characters are detailed enough to not make you think of them as just paint on a background.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from an ecchi show, it also has quite the amount of fanservice. Ofcourse, if you like that stuff, then by all means...\\n\\n\r\nSound: (6 / 10)\\n\\n\r\n2 episodes isn\u2019t really much to judge the sound quality by, but I did actually continue to listen to the first OP & ED songs. The OP, \u201cHELP!! -Hell Side-\u201d, really helps set the mood for the series, in a way. The ED is also quite the cute song, and overall I don\u2019t really think there\u2019s any big flaws in the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (5 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I found most of the characters kinda dumb, or at least the way they behave. Yes, I understand they\u2019re all this way for the comedic purposes of the show, but still...\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the cast consist of: (as far as episode 2 goes)\\n\\n\r\nSado - The masochist.\\n\\n\r\nIsurugi - Sadist with god-complex.\\n\\n\r\nYuuno - The reason for Sado\u2019s masochism, and has a fear of men.\\n\\n\r\nHayama - Sado\u2019s best friend, and avid crossdresser.\\n\\n\r\nMostly ignoring Hayama, all character interactions are pretty much predictable, regarding the first 3 characters. A sadist and a masochist would obviously result in a \u201cfunny\u201d scene where she beats him, he likes it, so then she beats him some more.\\n\\n\r\nA man trying to interact with a girl with a fear of men would result in the girl being freaked out, probably hurting the man, and running away.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of some of the stupid choices some of the characters keep making, it all feels very forced and makes it hard to like, or care about certain characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (3 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nReally, I\u2019m not the type of person to drop anime this easily, but man, I just couldn\u2019t take it with this one. The entire time during these first two episodes (mind you, that\u2019s almost 40 minutes), was spent repeating the same type of scene for comedic purpose, with some attempts at making a story fit in among the chaos.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, it just all felt pretty forced, and was all rather annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, if you find this type of stuff funny, and don\u2019t mind repetitiveness, then boy, is this show for you!\\n\\n\r\nPersonally though, I wouldn\u2019t touch it with a ten foot pole...\\n\\n",

            "content": "I originally watched the first few episodes around a year ago and instantly dropped it. This was because I just got into the whole romance/harem/comedy genre of animes and I was looking for something more \"romance\" heavy and more \"harem\" based in the sense that all the girls wanted the main characters *you know what* right off the bat.\r\nSo judging off that idea MM! was a strict no no and I never looked at it again.\r\nHowever a few days ago, seeing how there is literally NO good romcom/harems that I haven't seen (at least good by my standards) I was like f*ck it, watching MM!.\r\nIwas completely blown away. MM! is an amazing series and usually I am too lazy to write reviews (I've only written a handful of reviews for the select few animes that really touched my these past 1-2 years).\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my eyes  the story was very nice. You have a masochist protagonist who was shunned his whole school life because of his past tendencies of being a \"pervert\" or \"freak\" whenever he would get a M orgasm. He now seeks help from a club who is known for helping those in need. On top of that you find out about the problems of his friends and club members that all add on to the hilarity and cuteness of the series. It really meshes together very nicely. Especially the touching moments who Tarou defends the girls and brings out his manly side.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: The colors are very vibrant and nice. I tend to like the same kinds of artwork that are similar to the ones found in MM! (such as Sora No Otoshimono or Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari). They might not have the same art STYLE but the vibrant colors and the depth of the artwork is what I am talking about. The visuals are very pleasing. I recommend watching them in the highest quality you can find since it makes every anime in my opinion a lot better and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: The OP isn't my favourite BUT that does not mean it is not enjoyable. It wasn't as catchy as Isekai No Seikishi's OP (which is a masterpiece in my eyes) or even Mirai Nikki's first OP BUTTTTTT it is very VERY nice. If I was trapped in a room and had to watch MM! all over again but I could not skip the OP I would not mind one bit. It's very cute and catchy. It's just not the heart wrenching style that I tend to like.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10: The characters were great. They all brought something to the table. M male protagonist, his S counterpart female protagonist, androphobic club member that originally hated him for being a pervert but ended up falling in love with him, cross dressing best friend, jealous lesbian childhood friend of one of the girls who likes him, and the loli genius. Very good cast, and the voices were great too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: very funny romCom and I highly recommend it to anyone who dropped it and those who are thinking of watching it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really worth another look. I really enjoyed it these past few days. I was really happy to see that there are MM! specials but I was disheartened to find out that they are only 1 min long :(((( I need something more substantial\\n\\n\r\nOh well. It was a great series. Now I'm sad that I have to rummage through MAL AGAIN FOR ANOTHER SERIES TO WATCH. I honestly hate doing this every time. I finish a good series and then I have to find ANOTHER series to match it/beat it -____- so sad",

            "content": "This is one of the funniest animes you will come across that isnt like many others. The plot is hilarious and it confidently fullfills its job as being a comedy, harem and romance. \r\nStory 9\r\nIf you havnt read the synopsis yet MM! revolves around Taro Sado not your average male lead seeing as he is a masochist ( a person who finds sexual pleasure from feeling pain or humiliation) and your average 2 female leads who both have feelings for Taro. The storyline consist of following these characcters and how their relationships with each other differ while trying to cure Taro of his masochism hehehe.For a harem the story is one that many have come across before, nothing fresh but its the way that they incorporate the story and the backgrounds of each character together that makes this anime one that you will not regret seeing.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\n\"wow really a 10 I doubt it\" is what most people would think of my scoring but for being a relatively 'new' anime being released in mid 2010 its animation is top notch. The colours used are so vibrant and the quality put into each character is obvious. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8\\n\r\nAt first as with many animes the op for the series felt a bit....blah. After the first 3 episodes i went up to my mirror and slapped myself. The op song is very energetic and catchy it is one i now have on my playlist :D. The ending as well is one you should spend 1 extra minute to enjoy as with the op it is very catchy and one you will bound to be listening over and over. Apart from that the music used throughout the anime all compliment the scene and make it trully beautifull.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9\\n\r\nTHe main male lead Taro will be one of my favourite characters of all time just because of how funny he is in a unintentional way. The female leads personalities differ so viewers can choose which is their favourite. Mio Isurugi is an extreme tsundere. She feels a certain responsibility to help Taro cure his disease and does it in the funniest of ways. Arashiko Yuno is the nice and romantic one.....at times. She too has a disease many anime viewers are aware of, androphobia the fear of males.With this bonus in the anime Taro recieves pain from left and right whether it be on purpose or accidental. The charcters development is good considering how the anime is only 12 episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoymet 9\\n\r\nThis anime is one that i will never forget it has to be one of the funniest animes I have seen. Every episode made me laugh so hard. THe thing about MM! is that although it has some plain aspects it somehow utilizes these and makes it enjoyable to see. Wathing how Taro gets tortured physically might seem sort of funny but its the fact he loves the pain and wants more yet at the same time he finds it a curse is just hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\r\nThis was a once in a lifetime anime and the twists and turns in MM! is one that will keep you wanting more. I enjoy romance ainime and even thought it isnt solely based around romance it makes up for this is the comedy. IF you are a romance or comedy fan that dosent mind the usual harem I defininetely recommend this too you. ENJOY!!!\\n\\n",

Mio Isurugi and her nurse elder sister, who are sadist, Yuno Arashiko who's  androphobic  ( somehow, I'm beginning to think that she might be lesbian) and Tatsukich Hayama who's a cross dressing gay ( I wonder if she has any romantic feelings for Sado? EEEEEwwww). Anyway, I think that this anime should have been made as full encchi all the way instead of  a subtle one, that way it'll add more to the comedy. As for the other characters.....I guess we'll find out laterif what other sexual disorders do they have or is it just limited to these few individuals. Hummm, I guess we'll just have to wait and watch for the succeeding episode.",

            "content": "There are many animes out there that have perverted characters in them, in fact most do, but animes that focus completely on one characters perversion are few and far between. Most are terrible porn like crap, but some like MM manage to do all that is necessary to be respected in this genre, namely be funny and have good characters. \r\n-Story-\r\nThe story follows Tarou who on the surface seems like a normal high school guy but in actual fact he's got a problem, he\u2019s a hard core masochist (he experiences sexual pleasure from pain for those who didn\u2019t know).Trouble is  he wants to benormal, so on the advice of a friend he seeks help from a club called the 2nd Voluntary club. Were the leader of the club is a sadistic, egotistic girl who accepts the challenge of ridding Tarou of his masochism\u2026\\n\r\nWhile this story line is far from revolutionary it\u2019s still something that I\u2019ve never came across before, which makes it refreshing to know there\u2019s still new ideas out there. It\u2019s funny as hell watching Tarou get tortured or put in embarrassing situations. The idea of characters from anime being S or M has been around for a long time but this is the first show I\u2019ve seen to make it the central theme of the story and it works great with plenty of great comedy and romance moments\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\n The characters of this show are great and have more depth than you would first expect, while most seem clich\u00e9 this actually make the show that much funnier as it\u2019s great to see your stereotypical girls thrown into the world of S and M. Of course the backbone of this show is the strange relationship between Tarou (masochist) and Mio (sadist) which is no surprise but there is some good side characters in this show too, like Yuno Arashiko a girl with a terrible fear of men but she is able to like Tarou because his masochism makes so that he is very unlikely to hurt her. And another sadist (the school nurse) and Taros friend who i can\u2019t say much about or id spoil too much.\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nAs this anime is mostly a comedy there's quite a lot of jokes in it naturally. Most are S and M jokes but thankfully there's little to no echhi in this anime. The rest of the comedy is at the expense of Taro as he gets his gets violently beaten by women (mostly Mio) which does little to cure his problem, rather it aggravates it. The humour won\u2019t appeal to everyone but i think it\u2019s quite good and better than many other animes of this type out there at the moment.\\n\\n\r\n -Art-    \\n\r\nThe art work is good, clean, clear but nothing that you wouldn't expect in this day and age but it helps make the show and its endless stock of jokes that much better.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\r\nOverall I greatly enjoy watching this anime and will continue to watch it to the end, the story\u2019s refreshing , the humour is great, the characters are interesting, the arts good and overall it\u2019s fun to watch. . Any fans of S&M will really love this anime as it\u2019s filled it so if you\u2019re looking for something funny and not too serious then this is perfect for you. \\n",

            "content": "Pre-notice: If you don't like bad things said about this, then don't read it. I don't want people having seizures and breaking stuff. Otherwise, keep in mind that this is based on the first 3 episodes. Maybe it'll get better later, maybe it'll get worse.\r\nWhen I first saw this anime on one of the download sites, I thought \"oh what the hell, let's give it a try. The art looks good\". Well the art WAS good, but that was ALL that was good about this anime. A few episodes into the anime, I stopped seeing the point. I was tricked.\r\nArt (10/10)\r\nAs I said before, theart is amazing. In fact, very few anime has art this good. The character figures and coloring really gives the viewer a sense of how great anime can be without the horribly disfigured eyes that take up 2/3 of the face or hair that looks like helmets. Around 99% of my attention to this anime was put into studying the art in the first minute or so of the first episode. Unfortunately, this enthusiasm did not last...\\n\\n\r\nStory (2/10)\\n\r\nThe story is horrible and completely pointless. Before some of you decide to send me death threats and whatnot, read on because it's NOT because I'm biased against masochism and other sexual disorders. This story is about a masochist guy Taro Sado, who wants to cure himself of the disorder so he can confess his love to a girl he sees while working at a shop. At this point I thought, \"ok that's fine, at least there is a goal in this anime plus the art is good\". He joins the Second Volunteering Club to cure himself of this problem. At the club he gets beaten around by the loli president (who I later learned was Sadist. Crap that made sense) and the girl who caused his masochism in the first place. But then after the second episode, it turns out the girl he fell in love with  is just a cross-dressing guy who also happens to be his only best friend. Now, to me the plot is dead here. Given that the reason he was trying to cure his problem was to confess to that girl, now that he knows his first love was actually his best friend as a girl, what's the point of trying to cure his masochism? There is no reason why he's putting up with the three girls just beating the crap outta him and treating him crap other than \"because he enjoys it\". But seriously, I'm not going to watch an anime about people beating each other up because they all enjoy it. I've got better things to do.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3/10)\\n\r\nThe characters suck because what they do doesn't make sense; it's like they lack half a brain or something. Sado is just pathetic. For example, although Yuno was the girl who caused Sado's masochism, she has no problem BAKA punching the crap out of him when he gets close due to her androphobia (fear of guys) even though it's mostly an accident. Not only does she NOT apologize for causing his \"perverted\" disorder, she treats him like a dog and constantly disparages him for the disorder that she caused. What's even more stupid is, despite this, Sado tries his hardest to help her and understand her. He even beats up the guy who caused her androphobia. Ironic isn't it, how he helps the girl who caused his disorder by beating up the guy who caused her disorder. What's more, ANOTHER arrogant little girl (OH BAT FLIPPIN GREAT) comes into the series and together, those three just beat the crap out of people day and night. Nothing annoys me more than little brats acting like all high and mighty and this anime hit that peeve in the face. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10)\\n\r\nOverall, the 3 came mostly from art. Other than that, nothing else seemed to be too great. I stopped watching after the 3rd episode. My lips were torn from biting my lips because I had to do so to bear watching it. It seems to me that although this anime could have been an attempt to combine romance and comedy, it had neither. There were too many scenes that I didn't even know HOW to respond to. I couldn't laugh because it wasn't funny; I couldn't feel sad because it wasn't sad and I couldn't say \"awwwwww, kawaiiii\" because I'm not that kind of a person and there wasn't that kind of a scene. If you want to watch an anime with great art but otherwise just that, the try MM! out. Otherwise people like me who actually like to see something get done in anime have much better choices.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Don't bother sending me the \"you're a cold hearted bast**d!\" and \"You're too immature to understand the love and devotion\" comments because frankly, I Don't Care. If you think you understand, then don't read this review and just watch it.",

            "content": "If you're looking for more of the same, then you're in luck. MM!, wittily titled after the protagonists masochism fetish, takes every character design and comedic gag as by the book as possible, for the absolute level of comfort viewing. MM! is enjoyable for what it is, a harem anime centered around a club that helps people, but it doesn't strive to go beyond it's original premise and ultimately that is where it falls short. Note that the numerical value I have awarded this anime with does not mean anywhere near as much as what I've said textually about it.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story begins with Sadohaving an uncontrollable urge to yell in joy about being abused by women. He seeks help by going to a certain club led by a self-proclaimed God named Mio. He later is introduced to an androphobic girl, a school nurse, crazy inventor, and even discovers his best friend enjoys cross-dressing. That's about as how deeply as the plot goes - you've seen all of this before no doubt. MM! is like the foundation of a house that doesn't get built on. It doesn't provide anything more than a mindless viewing. Though I enjoyed a fair portion of the story about Yuno, even her story was riddled with cliche and lacked the depth other androphobic females have had in the past. I just felt let down after a very interesting exposition with nothing to support it thereafter. I had hopes Sado's masochism would be psychologically analyzed, possibly a reason why he enjoys being abused so much, but I was hoping for too much. The comedy in MM! was a turn-off for me. The anime is riddled with over-referenced anime and the physical abuse humor wears off by about the second episode. In short, MM! is not a show you watch for plot nor is it a show you watch for humor. I'm unsure why you watch it then.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nHarem's never let me down - every female had different color hair! Sadly though, the creativity doesn't extend further into the show. The art design looks like a sloppily made Kanokon or Ladies vs Butlers with a huge gloss effect applied. There are numerous moments of re-used animation, ridiculous unattractive facial distortion, and awkward movements. As for the backgrounds, nothing to complain about for a school anime, but once again nothing that sets it apart.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nA saving grace in my opinion. I enjoyed Ayana Taketatsu (Azusa Nakano from K-ON!) as Mio, and at first I was a little worried on how I'd feel about her voicing a dirty-mouthed blonde girl but there was no reason for fretting. Her voice was the funniest thing in the anime. The OP \"Help!!\" was great in both versions of it being sung. The ED was also pleasant to my ears but it was nothing too notable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nSado - likes being hit by women\\n\r\nMio - likes hitting Sado, and her excuse is that by hurting him a lot he will be cured of his masochistic illness\\n\r\nYuno - like Inari from Working! but less cute and less believable as a character\\n\r\nNoa - loli who invents things that usually end up with a Dragon Ball reference (frustrating amounts of them)\\n\r\nThe rest - characters that a harem anime would most likely have in it\\n\\n\r\nI should be grateful that at least one character had decent development in this anime, because expecting any development from a harem anime is silly to begin with. The characters were all good enough, but once again they were weak and for the most part unlikable. Between all the fists flying in this anime (used as tools of perversion for Sado) and the ridiculous plot development (Noa tries to make all men in the world perverted at one point - this is not an anime to take seriously) it was hard to really make room for characters I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nI watched an episode of MM! a week, and then it ended. I will undoubtedly delete this anime off my computer and move along with the next anime Xebec has to offer. MM! did nothing but consume my time each week without instilling any feelings for the anime. Of course as harem standards go, MM! is not poor - it has a decent amount of fanservice and the protagonist isn't an asshole. That in and of itself is enough to make it passable, but there are harem anime that are at least more interesting out there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nUnless you're new to anime MM! won't spark more than a passing glance. The phrase holds true - once you've seen one harem anime, you've seen them all.",

            "content": "Taro is sick in the head. Mio is sick in the head. Yuno is sick in the head. I think you can understand where this leading. Fundamentally, every single character in this anime is sick to the extreme at one dimension of their personality.\r\nMM! is a story about the curing of a closet masochist by a sadist and the resulting shenanigans involving an androphobic, cross dresser, cult leader, prodigious inventor, lolicon etc. etc. It's basically a freak show, a twisted school drama, an exhibition of corrupted youths. But is that good?\r\nWell, overall, the fetish humor had its moments. I especially found it golden when theyspoofed another classic of an anime during a pervert battle sequence. I know it's been parodied a hundred times before but I still liked it. And I chuckled when the mom and sister had their scenes. Other than that, most of the time it jumped back and forth between the boundary of funny/distasteful.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really brought the enjoyment down a level for me was that from beginning to end Taro made as much progress in his rehabilitation as a homosexual trying to turn straight. It's funny because that situation is the primary conflict in one of the episodes and yet I found it irritating instead of entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nI really believed from the first few episodes that there would be some honest character development for Sado and the others even with the mass amounts of bodily abuse and constant vulgarity. After sitting through half of the season, I realized it wasn't going anywhere in terms of plot advancement. How frustrating. As for romance, that portion sort of rubbed me in a familiar fashion. Not in a good way, however, because it's a formula that's been done and done better by other animes.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's not a memorable show. If you're strictly seeking potent perverted comedy and nothing else then I recommend you watch this. If you're not of the \"scum of the Earth\" or \"pig boy\" demographic than I beseech you to pass up MM! in light of something aimed at \"upstanding citizens of society\"... \\n\\n\r\nJust a joke.

            "content": "~Multilingual review, English & Espa\u00f1ol: MM!~\r\nSadomasochism, Comedy and Romance are the keywords for this series. Considering the bad times I had with similar series featuring these same themes, I would actually say this was a show I should have definitely passed, even if everyone tells me that I shouldn't judge a book by its cover I'm not able to don\u2019t give a first impression to something I haven't seen yet, I can't be helped. But since I'm a baka that doesn't learn from his previous errors I started this show anyway. Oh boy I did good...\r\nIn my opinion a successful romance doesn't resides only inits girls, since also the guy must be likeable, cool and funny. Many romances just focus on its girls leaving the guy with just a plain, lame and clich\u00e9 setting, thinking that only the girls are the soul of the show. That actually might be true, in part, because as always the main attractions are girls but I can't stop thinking if maybe am I the only one that think that a group of good girls liking a lame, boring and over clich\u00e9 guy just feels just too wrong, I really hope I'm not alone in that. Even if our protagonist, Sado Taro, might fall into a bit of clich\u00e9 traits, he manages to be everything, a cool, likeable and funny character either way, as well as our female leads, so even if a bit clich\u00e9, the characters result charming and likeable, is there anything wrong in that?\\n\\n\r\nSado Taro happens to be masochist, a completely hardcore pervert. He spend his miserable life between boring school lessons in the morning and a part-time job in a mini market in the afternoons, in all his misery the only spark in life is Shiori, a beautiful maiden that often goes to that mini market Taro works. His misery doesn't end after the job's schedule, as soon as he arrives home there's his older sister and mother that tortures him with their 'incestuous' love. Ah poor Taro!, no one understands him, all he wants is a pretty girl that kicks quite hard his ass, he question himself why this cruel world doesn't pleases him?, but after all, we know that a pervert doesn't have an easy life!. In order to express his love for Shiori, Taro decides to get cured from masochism and he revolves to the Second Voluntary Club, a club that's famous for helping the students with their problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe event that triggered the beginning for a more, new, painful life was the suddenly interest that Shiori express for Taro, but it seems she doesn't have the courage to talk with him, so Taro takes the lead and affront her. It's revealed that Shiori is actually Hayama, Taro's best friend, cross dressed. After the initial shock, Taro accepts Hayama's secret, grieving that his first love revealed to be a boy. Second Voluntary Club's president, Mio Isurugi, a girl with a BIG god complex had not forgotten the request from Taro and she's determinate to cure him from his masochism. This is where the show truly starts, Taro's being cured by any means possible by Mio, in the Club there's also Arashiko Yuuno, an androphobic girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe 3 main characters are Taro, our pervert protagonist, manages to be funny every time he have screen time, he's quite cool when the situation requires so that's probably the only and good point of him. The girl with an enormous god complex, Isurugi Mio, she's a sadistic tsundere, that's quite clich\u00e9 but since the protagonist is a masochist then that's makes of them a really nice duo. She does everything to cure Sado but that often offer her a possibility to express her inner sadistic side. To close our equilateral triangle, because Sado doesn't have a preference, there's Arashiko Yuuno, the kind and cute girl but those probably aren\u2019t her unique traits since she's a violent androphobic girl, through the show she revolves almost every of her attacks to Taro, to the fortune of this last one. If you're looking for original characters you won't find them here, our protagonists are cliche, I'll just throw it there, but it's how they determinate the evolvement of the anime what impressed and made me appreciate them.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a good contrasts between romance and comedy scenes, so it didn't feel off time or inappropriate never through the show, there was an excellent balance of them Rather than following a linear plot each episode offers a new plan to cure Taro and the consequences that derives from it. Very clever and original plans I must say, and thankfully, quite funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was quite nice, I really liked the character's design, they were detailed whiteout being too flashy. The animation was good, nothing overwhelming or below average, anyway it didn't influence or determine at all in the enjoyment. The OSTs were nice even if a bit forgettable; anyway it fitted each moment in the series. The OP single was really nice, both versions of it, Heaven and Hell. A really nice cast did the voices, Fukuyama Jun, Taketatsu Ayana and Hayami Saori, their voices fitted perfectly the personality of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed very much while watching this show. Definitely judging by only the cover, synopsis or wherever it\u2019s not the right thing to do, anyway if you're a baka like me then you shouldn't have problems skipping a win show like this. To those who aren't, just give it a try, the comedy is awesome.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Espa\u00f1ol]\\n\\n\r\n~Multilingual review, English & Espa\u00f1ol: MM!~\\n\\n\r\nSadomasoquismo, Comedia y Romance son las palabras claves de esta serie. Considerando la malas experiencias que he tendido con series similares, con temas similares, hubiera dicho seguramente que esta era una serie que deber\u00eda pasar de alto, aunque s\u00ed todo el mundo me repite que no deber\u00eda juzgar s\u00f3lo por la portada no soy capaz de no dar una primera impresi\u00f3n, mala o buena que sea, sobre algo que siquiera he visto, no tengo remedio. Pero si como soy un baka que no aprende de sus errores, inicie de todo modos esa serie. Eh si, hice bien..\\n\\n\r\nEn mi opini\u00f3n un buen romance no se basa s\u00f3lo en las hero\u00ednas, porque tambi\u00e9n el protagonista deber\u00eda ser agradable, cool y divertido. Muchos romances se enfocan solo en las chicas dejando al chico con un arquetipo bastante aburrido, simple y clich\u00e9, pensando que el coraz\u00f3n de la serie son las hero\u00ednas. Algo que no es completamente errado, porque como siempre, la atracci\u00f3n principal es la chica, pero no puedo dejar de pensar que si soy el \u00fanico al que le parece que un grupo de chicas que guste de un pendejo s\u00faper clich\u00e9 y sin personalidad sea algo completamente est\u00fapido, estoy seguro que no soy el \u00fanico. Aunque s\u00ed nuestro protagonista, Sado Taro, caiga un poco en lo que consideramos clich\u00e9, se demuestra ser un personaje agradable, simp\u00e1tico y sobre todo, divertido, al igual modo que nuestras hero\u00ednas, clich\u00e9 pero simp\u00e1ticos y agradables, que hay de malo en eso?\\n\\n\r\nSado Taro es un masoquista, un completo pervertido. El pasa su miserable existencia entre las aburridas clases en la ma\u00f1ana y su trabajo de medio tiempo en un mini market en las tardes, en toda su miseria hay una sola luz en su vida, Shiori, una bella chica que suele ir de compras al mini donde trabaja Taro. Su miseria no termina despu\u00e9s del horario de trabajo, apenas llega a casa, lo que le espera son su hermana y su madre que lo fastidian continuamente con su \"amor\". Oh pobre Taro!, nadie lo comprende, todo lo que quiere es que una bella chica le pate\u00e9 el culo, se pregunta a el mismo que porque este mundo cruel no lo satisface, pero como todos sabemos, un pervertido no tiene una vida f\u00e1cil!. Para poder expresar su amor por Shiori, Taro decide de buscar ayuda, y la encuentra en el Segundo Club de Voluntarios, un club que es famoso por ayudar estudiantes a lidiar con sus problemas personales.\\n\\n\r\nEl evento que da inici\u00f3 a una nueva vida, m\u00e1s miserable, para Taro, es el repentino inter\u00e9s de Shiori hacia el, pero la chica no tiene el coraje suficiente para dirigirle palabra, entonces Taro decide de enfrentarla. Se da a conocer que Shiori no es nadie m\u00e1s que Hayama, su mejor y \u00fanico amigo, despu\u00e9s de un shock inicial decide de aceptar este lado secreto de el, al mismo tiempo, maldiciendo porque su primer amor fue un hombre. Es aqu\u00ed donde entra Mio Isurugi, presidente del Segundo Club de Voluntarios, una chica con un ENORME complejo de dios, la cual no ha olvidado el pedido de Taro de liberarlo de su masoquismo, comienza la nueva vida de Taro a merced de los planes de Mio para \"ayudarlo\", junto a ellos hace parte tambi\u00e9n del club una chica androphobica, Arashiko Yuuno. El tr\u00edo se revela ser muy divertido y capaz de coordinar una buena comedia.\\n\\n\r\nNuestros tres personajes principales son, Taro, nuestro pervertido protagonista, el cual logra ser divertido cada vez que aparece, el es admirable cuando la situaci\u00f3n lo requiere, su \u00fanica y sola buena cualidad. La chica con el complejo de dios, Mio, ella es una s\u00e1dica tsundere, algo clich\u00e9 pero desde que el protagonista es un masoquista, eso los hace una buena y divertida pareja. Ella hace de todo para curar a Taro de su perversi\u00f3n, lo cual a veces le ofrece ocasi\u00f3n de dar desfogo a su lado s\u00e1dico. A cerrar este tri\u00e1ngulo equil\u00e1tero, porque Taro no tiene preferencia alguna, esta Arashiko Yuuno, la chica dulce y gentil, pero esas no son seguramente sus \u00fanicas cualidades, desde que ella es una chica s\u00faper violenta debido su fobia hacia los hombres, violencias dirigidas exclusivamente hacia Taro, para la suerte de este \u00faltimo. Si estas buscando personajes originales no los vas a encontrar aqu\u00ed, lo dir\u00e9 claramente, pero fue como estos personajes determinaron los eventos sucedidos en la serie que me hicieron apreciarlos tanto.\\n\\n\r\nLa serie presenta un buen contraste entre el romance y las escenas c\u00f3micas, as\u00ed que no se sintieron fuera de lugar o inapropiadas en ning\u00fan momento, excelente balance de ambas. La serie no sigue un desarrollo linear, m\u00e1s bien presenta un formato epis\u00f3dico que ofrece siempre un nuevo plan de Mio para curar a Taro y las consecuencias que derivan de el. Planes que resultan brillantes y originales, y por suerte, tambi\u00e9n divertidos.\\n\\n\r\nEl arte estuvo bastante bien, me gustaron mucho el dise\u00f1o de los personajes, fueron detallados sin ser muy sobresalientes. La animaci\u00f3n fue buena, nada fuera de lo normal o por debajo, de todos modos no determina o influye para nada en el disfrute. El reparto musical, las OSTs, no fueron \u00fanicas, a decir verdad algo f\u00e1cilmente olvidables pero justas para cada momento y escenario durante la serie. El OP single estuvo bastante bueno, ambas versiones de la canci\u00f3n, Heaven y Hell. Un cast de Seiyuus de verdad experto hicieron las voces, Fukuyama Yun, Taketatsu Ayana y Hayami Saori, sus voces eran perfectamente en sinton\u00eda con los personajes.\\n\\n\r\nA mi personalmente me divirti\u00f3 mucho este anime. Juzgar solamente por la portada, por la sinopsis, o lo que sea no es la cosa justa de hacer, de todos modos si eres un baka como yo, entonces no hay riesgos de que te pierdas un anime tan bueno como este, pero si no lo eres, dale una oportunidad, la comedia es simplemente genial.",

            "content": "I usually hate when people write reviews judging by the first few episodes, but I think by now I have a pretty good grasp on it.\r\nThis is also my first review so bare with me, please.\r\nStory 9: The story is about Sado Tarou who is a \"hard core sexual masochism\"; someone who has pleasure in getting hurt. To cure his problem he visits the Voluntary Club, a place where they \"grant your wishes\". There, everyday, they try to \"torture\" him out of his masochism. He ends up joining the club with Mio Isurugi, Yuno Arashiko, and Michiru Onigawara. There he \"encounters\" more adventures into theirlives (though I'm not sure if that's the write choice of words...)\\n\\n\r\nArt 9: I'm a fan of the \"big eyed-moe\" art, so sorry if this also comes up a bit bias. Very colorful, and 'cute'. Not much to say about the art, it pretty much follows into the current style of anime these days (if you notice it's kind of changing).\\n\\n\r\nSound 7: Nothing much about the sound, it's just average? I really like the opening sound, the ending is okay, but that's just me. I'll leave the sound up to yourself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10: The characters is the best part. We have Mio Isurugi, or \"God\", one of the main characters. She is the heroin, a sadist and tsundere. (in my opinion is a great combination, since I love tsundere anyways haha;;) She and Michiru are the main people who try to help cure Sado. Her best friend is Yuno. She has a soft spot for her friends, and usually does nothing more than to help them. She often gets dressed up in clothes because Michiru makes her.\\n\r\nSado Taro, the one with masochism, Mio always refers to \"M! Pervert\". He, as well, will do almost anything for his friends. In middle school, he had been apparently been abused by a girl, who is at fault for turning him into a masochism. He gets abused every day by the Voluntary Club, to try to cure him. At home, he has a mom and a sister, who are obsessed with loving him. He works part-time at a convenience store. His best friend is Hayama Tatukichi, who seemed to be just about the only one who accepted him as a masochist.\\n\r\nYuno Arashiko is another \"moe-fragual-big-breasted-girl\" but, there's more to her than that. She is androphobic; a phobia towards men. By her past, you can tell she can stick through just about anything that you throw at her. She also joined the second Voluntary Club to help cure herself. Her best friend is Yumi Mamiya and Mio. Her dog's name was Taro, so to try to cure her phobia, she calls Taro her \"dog\", which is another strategy to help cure her phobia of men.\\n\r\nMichiru Onigawara is the schools nurse, and the second Voluntary Club's adviser. She enjoys dressing up Mio and taking pictures of \"cute girls\".\\n\r\n(that's all I'll do for now since there's not enough information on the other characters yet....look forward to another review!)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10: Sorry if this review came off as a bit bias. I love this! Most ecchis are focused on ecchi only, but the characters and Story line pull it together to make it over all a great watch. Very funny most of the time, drama is smooth and makes sense. Overall, I'm going to give it a 10. :D",

            "content": "Konichiwa, mina-san, this is akinari-kun from SUTORAIKUanime, here to bring you my first impression of MM!.\r\n\"T-the truth is, I'm a masochist! I get pleasure when women abuse me. It feels so good that I lose myself! I'm tellin' ya it gets really bad! What do I do!? I cannot control myself at all!!!\"\r\n And there you have it, the outline of Tarou Sado, a high school freshman with a sexual masochism fetish, or whatever the hell you call it. Whatever it is, it's funny, it's catchy, and it makes Mio look absolutely sexy.\r\nAnd that's how the first episode of comedy romance \"MM!\" started. Along comesthe OP, \"Help!\" by Ayana Taketatsu, with a catchy beat and suitable lyrics. I found it a little interesting that there hasn't been any pantsu flashes yet, not that it matters, but it's just there have been so many camera angles that refer to pantsu, but no pantsu are to be seen, strange...anywho, based on the OP, it is implied that this series is a harem, with all the kawaii desu girls and what not, but who knows, I'm just making an educated guess.\\n\\n\r\nHere we have the same guys who brought us Kanokon and Ladies versus Butlers (notice the animation similarities), XEBEC and AT-X. However, the character designer and directors are different, therefore the slight difference in animation, which I actually think looks even better than Kanokon and Ladies versus Butlers. First thing's first, I absolutely loved the character designs of both Kanokon and LvB, so I don't see why I wouldn't feel the same way about MM!. It's only the first episode and I'm already in love with the character designs AND their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nBasically the entire episode we are shown Tarou being tortured, kicked, slapped, tied, being hit by baseballs, etc. while he laughs hysterically and enjoys it all. I find this quite hilarious, and the fact that Mio is trying to cure his masochism by hurting him even more just elevates the humour of the storyline to a whole new level. But Mio isn't the only person that is involved with the torturing of Tarou...cue Yuuno Arashiko, a cute purple haired girl who finds Tarou absolutely disgusting (and also doesn't mind giving him a good beating).\\n\\n\r\nSeems like everything has happened in just one episode, even Tarou's sister Shizuka has a brother complex (yaay for brother complex!), and Tarou's mother has a son complex (err...yaay for son complex? Hmm...)! And what's even more amazing is that...IS THAT...AHHHHHHH I'm itching to say it, but I won't spoil the most epic scene of the first episode for anyone.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that wraps up my first impression of \"MM!\", I must say, I didn't expect much from this series, but I got quite a pleasant surprise and a huge load of hilarious laughs out of it, so I'm going to continue covering this series. And I'm quite grateful that Ryuumaru subbed it so fast, since I just happened to have a lot of time on my hands today.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, last but not least, COULD MIO BE A TSUNDERE!? \\n\\n\r\nThat's all for now, happy watching, mina! Join us next week as we cover the second episode of \"MM!\"",

            "content": "Believe me. I was skeptical at first. A show about a masochist? Hah! Probably it's just gonna be centered around hundreds of repetitive slapstick jokes. Turns out to be true. But hold on! Mr Masochist here has his own harem? What?! How can a masochist has his own harem when us normal people out here are trying so hard to get one! He's not even that good looking...\r\nTurns out like every male harem lead, all you have to do is be nice and overflowing girls will come after you. Now, this isn't realistic of course because guys like us aren't nice. Chances is if youhave your harem right now, its probably because you're loaded with good looks and money. (More towards the money department)\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10\\n\r\nThere's not much of a story here. Don't expect much of a plot development as I may remind you this is a harem anime. However I was expecting the story to revolve around other \"unique\" characters but the only thing you're getting is masochist mayhem. Nevertheless I do enjoy seeing them trying out new ways to cure his masochism (and inevitably failing)\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nWow! Everything look so bright and new! Such a cheerful image is portrayed in every episode. You wouldn't expect this much since the story is about a masochist. Shouldn't it be very.. I don't know how to describe it... Urrm.. Masochistic? \\n\r\nAnyways, if you're looking for a bright and cheerful type of anime and you're not a lolicon, then look no further!\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nOk.. I gotta to be frank here. I'm amazed at the Sado's seiyuu's constant orgasmic sound he makes when he gets screwed. And to couple with that masochistic bliss is a heavenly themed sound effect. I mean if your mum was to walk into your room while Sado is moaning in lust, she would think that you're watching porn!\\n\r\nOther than that, I love the individuality theme song each character gets when they make an entrance. Especially Noa's. I mean, how can you not like the sound of xylophones! It portrays Noa perfectly as a kid!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nWhen I started watching this, I thought to myself, \"Wow, an anime about every characters having some sort of psychological disorder! This is going to be interesting!\"\\n\r\nYeah I know, doesn't take a lot to interest me.\\n\r\nBut hey he has a harem! Let's take a look into that shall we.\\n\r\nOK so we got a Tsundere girl with a superior complexity and doesn't know how to cook, a big b**b girl who's afraid of men, we got a loli character, and some incestuous family members. (Geez what's wrong with the Autumn line up and all it's incest shows)\\n\r\nOk looks like he has everything a typical \"Chaotic\" type harem needs.\\n\r\nOther than that, male harem leads are suppose to have pervertic best friends. Well this one cross dress so I don't know how much pervertic can you get other than that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nHey, it's something new. You never heard an anime about a masochist before. Could be entertaining. And they added a bunch of DBZ parodies. Wow! That is until they run the joke dry. Well I hoped that each girl was given their personal arc with Sado but nope, it's mostly revolved around Mio and Yuuno. Still it is entertaining to see dense male harem leads getting beaten up. I mean, I would like to do it myself but seeing Sado won't get turn on getting beaten up by a guy.\\n\r\nAnd aside from DBZ superpowers, Sado do have one power that I insist all male harem lead should have. A twisted taste bud. One of the positive side about being a masochist is that you actualy ENJOY eating badly cooked food (A common anime troope for certain anime girls)\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nConclusion this anime is pretty unique in its own way but solely meant for entertainment only. Like many harem anime, do not expect a conclusion, I mean most of the time it's because the male leads are too dense. The slapstick comedy can get old really quick. But dont worry, like many modern day animes, fanservice is thrown in to momentarily grab our attention as usual. Nevertheless you would still enjoy the different variety of characters they have to offer.\\n\\n\r\nHaremu Kingu,\\n\r\nSigning off!",

I love this trio of misfits. the art style of the game is great and so is the sound, especially when there is a dragon ball Z reference in the anime andit just made me relive my childhood.  \\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not saying that this anime is perfect, there are one or two things that I wasn't that keen on. there was a bit of a story, but it didn't feel interesting, it was mostly just scenario after scenario which was enjoyable, i just wanted more of a story. Also that it just sort off ends and is slightly disappointing as i wish there were more episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all i loved the characters and art style, just wish that the story was more of a story. However i would buy this with money, so let me know what you think of it.",

I thought it was one of those echhi anime with a lot of fan service, but then the word \"masochist\" caught my eye. Then, I didn't know what a masochist was, so I decided to look it up. I was so shocked the male protagonist is a lot like me, since i didn't know that I was a masochist. So I decided to watch the first episode to know if I was going to continue watchingthe series, I was really shocked, I was impressed and amazed. The art was good, the characters make me so lol. Though in the ending of the first episode, I felt like there was a huge possibility it was to become a yaoi anime. But overall it's an 8 out of 10 for me. \\n\r\n(I did enjoy it very much, not only in the first episode, but in the latter episodes as well. I felt sad after watching the last episode, because I had to let this anime go(due to this being a good anime), I felt sad partly because Akinari Matsuno died, therefore no way in hell there would be a second season. :(  ) \\n\r\nP.S.

            "content": "'MM!' is a slapstick comedy about a high school student who's masochist to the core.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story starts with Sado Tarou visiting Volunteer Club #2 to get his masochist nature fixed. He was immediately dubbed \"Butarou\" (pig bastard), and obviously a poor plan of fixing him through extreme pain was devised, and he gets to enjoy the masochism play everyday. Beyond that, there isn't really a story to this show, but this series is a hardcore slapstick, so a real story isn't needed nor desired. It focuses on the comedy and perversion of the protagonist as he gets into all sorts of strange situations thatmade 'MM!' a very enjoyable show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nNot many protagonists are so openly M and enjoys BDSM as much as Butarou. Having such a perverted and out of ordinary protagonist alone was a fresh breeze of originality that made this show hilarious. Pretty much all the girls around him are sadists who beat the crap out of Butarou, and become attracted to him. All the support characters were cardboard cutouts, but they managed to gather all the the stereotypical harems girls: Obvious tsundere; androphobic attacker; loli prodigy; jealous masseur, and a hot teacher to put Butarou into all sorts of difficult situations. Character development is once again very limited, but not really required.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\r\nSame faces, big eyes, all sorts of hair colors... it's your typical anime character design, but the Sado Tarou's hentai form is pretty funny, and all the girls are pretty attractive. Lots of fan service as well. Very vibrant colors and heavy glossy filter was used, and visually pleasing.\\n\r\nVery good camera work and angles, it's the type of animation that you don't get tired of just by watching the video.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nVoice acting was done pretty well, distinct voices for the protagonist and two main heroines. Taketatsu Ayana as Mio was identical to what she did with Kirino in Oreimo, but suited the character really well. Especially when she verbally abuses Tarou.\\n\r\nOP/ED were typical otagei anime songs, but the labeling of S/M for producers was a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nAlthough this show is very technically flawed, I enjoyed it a lot. Not many shows are as daring in exploiting fetishes as 'MM!'. The absurd situations like bondage in high school club room, memory loss, hypnosis etc were hilarious, and there was a lot of fan service as well as verbal and physical abuse. What this show really excelled was the energy and pacing. As far as slapstick comedy goes, this is among the best.",

Yet, despite the episodic nature and lack of progression I had a lot of hope.\r\nExpectation: 6-7\r\nEpisode scores: -,-,-,-, 4, 7, 4, 10, 7, 5, 9, 10\r\nActual: 5 (Average)\r\nThere was many episodes where I was stunned by the romance, and the quality of some of the jokes; I of course have always been a sucker for the pseudo date episodes, and this show played that card heavily. The only time scenes which truly bored me were the handful of long masochistic scenes.\r\n Yes, a lot ofthe time is spent beating up Sado in cosplay. While a little of this is fine the span of time wasted on these types of scenes was overdoing things. The story revolves around his masochistic personality, but they should of at least weaved it into an actually interest story at times.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of this the level of randomness and variety was also overbearing. After the first few were rather good and had a believable serious tone, all of a sudden people are pulling of dragonball parodies based on the power of prevertedness. While it was not all that bad i was somewhat surprised with what i was seeing. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no character development either, and they are all pretty one dimensional; nothing more than there single oddity. While i liked some of them i can not admit that any were actually interest characters. The caveat is that this is a comedy as well so I was not expecting much.\\n\\n\r\nIt was not a bad watch, and at times extremely amusing. However, an entire episode is either hit or miss; there is not really divided segments which i find allows me, in comedies, to at least enjoy one part. Due to this inconsistancy i can't say it was anything more than average.",

The show becomes focused on random events between the characters, the final episode coming out of no where completely in terms of plot relevance.

The scenery is vibrant, the characters look distinguished, the ecchi is appealing and well censored. Very colorful and eye catching.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nTo be honest I watched this show today and I don't remember anything about the sound.  I'm a musician so I automatically catch on to something if it peaks my interest.  Nothing here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nCharacters are Okay.  There's some good development and some mannerisms they get stuck on the entire series (which gets annoying for me at least).

            "content": "NOTE: This anime was DROPPED by me, and as such the following review will only take into account things I actually saw during the short time I watched the series.\r\nDisclaimer: The following review is based on my personal opinions, and does not feature many objective analyses. As such, this may not coincide with yours, or the general publics opinions.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIn a lot of anime, we see lots of perverts, or weird fetishes amongst some people, and this all serves to make them who they are as a character (in most cases), but what if an anime would focus almost solely on one pervert, and his fetish,or rather his quest to get rid of his perversion?\\n\\n\r\nThat could be a pretty funny series (especially in the case of a masochist) if done right, but unfortunately, I don\u2019t feel like MM! succeeded.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (3 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nSo we have our MC, Sado Taro - masochist, who wants to get rid of this perversion of his. To do this, he seeks the help of a special club at his school, devoted to helping people with their problems. Enter Isurugi, a sadist with god-complex.\\n\\n\r\nNow, how is this sadist going to help this masochist get rid of his perversion? Well, the obvious thing is to... Torture... him...\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the entire series is about Sado being tortured and beaten in various ways, to cure him of his perversion, with some romantic sub-plot (at least in the first couple of episodes), and the rest of the time it\u2019d just be about Sado\u2019s daily life as a sadist.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (7 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality and character designs are actually pretty good, to be honest. While not anything fantastic, the backgrounds make for a nice setting, and the characters are detailed enough to not make you think of them as just paint on a background.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from an ecchi show, it also has quite the amount of fanservice. Ofcourse, if you like that stuff, then by all means...\\n\\n\r\nSound: (6 / 10)\\n\\n\r\n2 episodes isn\u2019t really much to judge the sound quality by, but I did actually continue to listen to the first OP & ED songs. The OP, \u201cHELP!! -Hell Side-\u201d, really helps set the mood for the series, in a way. The ED is also quite the cute song, and overall I don\u2019t really think there\u2019s any big flaws in the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (5 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I found most of the characters kinda dumb, or at least the way they behave. Yes, I understand they\u2019re all this way for the comedic purposes of the show, but still...\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the cast consist of: (as far as episode 2 goes)\\n\\n\r\nSado - The masochist.\\n\\n\r\nIsurugi - Sadist with god-complex.\\n\\n\r\nYuuno - The reason for Sado\u2019s masochism, and has a fear of men.\\n\\n\r\nHayama - Sado\u2019s best friend, and avid crossdresser.\\n\\n\r\nMostly ignoring Hayama, all character interactions are pretty much predictable, regarding the first 3 characters. A sadist and a masochist would obviously result in a \u201cfunny\u201d scene where she beats him, he likes it, so then she beats him some more.\\n\\n\r\nA man trying to interact with a girl with a fear of men would result in the girl being freaked out, probably hurting the man, and running away.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of some of the stupid choices some of the characters keep making, it all feels very forced and makes it hard to like, or care about certain characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (3 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nReally, I\u2019m not the type of person to drop anime this easily, but man, I just couldn\u2019t take it with this one. The entire time during these first two episodes (mind you, that\u2019s almost 40 minutes), was spent repeating the same type of scene for comedic purpose, with some attempts at making a story fit in among the chaos.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, it just all felt pretty forced, and was all rather annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, if you find this type of stuff funny, and don\u2019t mind repetitiveness, then boy, is this show for you!\\n\\n\r\nPersonally though, I wouldn\u2019t touch it with a ten foot pole...\\n\\n",

MM! is an amazing series and usually I am too lazy to write reviews (I've only written a handful of reviews for the select few animes that really touched my these past 1-2 years).\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my eyes  the story was very nice.

He now seeks help from a club who is known for helping those in need. On top of that you find out about the problems of his friends and club members that all add on to the hilarity and cuteness of the series. It really meshes together very nicely. Especially the touching moments who Tarou defends the girls and brings out his manly side.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: The colors are very vibrant and nice. I tend to like the same kinds of artwork that are similar to the ones found in MM! (such as Sora No Otoshimono or Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari). They might not have the same art STYLE but the vibrant colors and the depth of the artwork is what I am talking about. The visuals are very pleasing. I recommend watching them in the highest quality you can find since it makes every anime in my opinion a lot better and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: The OP isn't my favourite BUT that does not mean it is not enjoyable. It wasn't as catchy as Isekai No Seikishi's OP (which is a masterpiece in my eyes) or even Mirai Nikki's first OP BUTTTTTT it is very VERY nice. If I was trapped in a room and had to watch MM! all over again but I could not skip the OP I would not mind one bit. It's very cute and catchy. It's just not the heart wrenching style that I tend to like.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10: The characters were great. They all brought something to the table. M male protagonist, his S counterpart female protagonist, androphobic club member that originally hated him for being a pervert but ended up falling in love with him, cross dressing best friend, jealous lesbian childhood friend of one of the girls who likes him, and the loli genius. Very good cast, and the voices were great too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: very funny romCom and I highly recommend it to anyone who dropped it and those who are thinking of watching it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really worth another look. I really enjoyed it these past few days. I was really happy to see that there are MM! specials but I was disheartened to find out that they are only 1 min long :(((( I need something more substantial\\n\\n\r\nOh well. It was a great series. Now I'm sad that I have to rummage through MAL AGAIN FOR ANOTHER SERIES TO WATCH. I honestly hate doing this every time. I finish a good series and then I have to find ANOTHER series to match it/beat it -____- so sad",

            "content": "This is one of the funniest animes you will come across that isnt like many others. The plot is hilarious and it confidently fullfills its job as being a comedy, harem and romance. \r\nStory 9\r\nIf you havnt read the synopsis yet MM! revolves around Taro Sado not your average male lead seeing as he is a masochist ( a person who finds sexual pleasure from feeling pain or humiliation) and your average 2 female leads who both have feelings for Taro. The storyline consist of following these characcters and how their relationships with each other differ while trying to cure Taro of his masochism hehehe.For a harem the story is one that many have come across before, nothing fresh but its the way that they incorporate the story and the backgrounds of each character together that makes this anime one that you will not regret seeing.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\n\"wow really a 10 I doubt it\" is what most people would think of my scoring but for being a relatively 'new' anime being released in mid 2010 its animation is top notch. The colours used are so vibrant and the quality put into each character is obvious. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8\\n\r\nAt first as with many animes the op for the series felt a bit....blah. After the first 3 episodes i went up to my mirror and slapped myself. The op song is very energetic and catchy it is one i now have on my playlist :D. The ending as well is one you should spend 1 extra minute to enjoy as with the op it is very catchy and one you will bound to be listening over and over. Apart from that the music used throughout the anime all compliment the scene and make it trully beautifull.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9\\n\r\nTHe main male lead Taro will be one of my favourite characters of all time just because of how funny he is in a unintentional way. The female leads personalities differ so viewers can choose which is their favourite. Mio Isurugi is an extreme tsundere. She feels a certain responsibility to help Taro cure his disease and does it in the funniest of ways. Arashiko Yuno is the nice and romantic one.....at times. She too has a disease many anime viewers are aware of, androphobia the fear of males.With this bonus in the anime Taro recieves pain from left and right whether it be on purpose or accidental. The charcters development is good considering how the anime is only 12 episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoymet 9\\n\r\nThis anime is one that i will never forget it has to be one of the funniest animes I have seen. Every episode made me laugh so hard. THe thing about MM! is that although it has some plain aspects it somehow utilizes these and makes it enjoyable to see. Wathing how Taro gets tortured physically might seem sort of funny but its the fact he loves the pain and wants more yet at the same time he finds it a curse is just hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\r\nThis was a once in a lifetime anime and the twists and turns in MM! is one that will keep you wanting more. I enjoy romance ainime and even thought it isnt solely based around romance it makes up for this is the comedy. IF you are a romance or comedy fan that dosent mind the usual harem I defininetely recommend this too you. ENJOY!!!\\n\\n",

            "content": "OK, so this anime is about sexual disorders, we have the main character, Taro Sado, who's a masochist. Mio Isurugi and her nurse elder sister, who are sadist, Yuno Arashiko who's  androphobic  ( somehow, I'm beginning to think that she might be lesbian) and Tatsukich Hayama who's a cross dressing gay ( I wonder if she has any romantic feelings for Sado? EEEEEwwww). Anyway, I think that this anime should have been made as full encchi all the way instead of  a subtle one, that way it'll add more to the comedy. As for the other characters.....I guess we'll find out laterif what other sexual disorders do they have or is it just limited to these few individuals. Hummm, I guess we'll just have to wait and watch for the succeeding episode.",

            "content": "Sometimes an anime will get you by its title, such as the long titled ones like \"Oreimo\" (for short) or like the really short ones like MM!. Now if you ever read the synopsis and have seen the cover of this anime which is Mio in a maid uniform with a bat, then you know that this would be another typical harem genre anime with an annoying tsundere character. However if you stick around you might reconsider that conclusion like me.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe excuse plot of this anime is to cure Sado's masochism  because it is starting to bother him. Thus he goes to askhis senior Mio for help and her brilliant idea is to torture him until he is cured which if you ask me, IS THE WORST IDEA EVER. The anime is divided by arc in which individual characters have a problem and they are solve by Mio and Sado's club. So basically its a slice of life in which our main casts deals with the problems of other people. But the interesting part is that most of the problems they solve are problems we could encounter and could happened in real life. These problems have a psychological effect on them that even if they want to stop or change they can't do it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good but nothing really stands out because its kinda normal. However the animation is kinda arousing, I don't know maybe its just me or the fact that the AT-X is in it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like both the opening and ending song of this anime. The opening will get you pump up for the episode and the ending theme \"More-More LOVERS!!\" by Natsuko Asou is just the best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are somewhat cliche but most of them have depths or reason why they have such personality and problems. Though most  of the time I feel like most of the characters are just thrown in for the comedy . The main cast are as follows:\\n\\n\r\nTaro Sado- He is your typical punching bag character in every anime but the twist is he likes it. Nothing could really much be said because he is your standard nice guy protagonist. The anime never really told us why he is a masochist even though he has a caring mother, sister and best friend.\\n\\n\r\nMio Isurugi- The sadistic tsundere with a God complex character, because if there is M there has to be a S. She is already a formula for disaster even if she has reasons behind her actions. Her plan to cure Sado's masochism is ridiculous and sometimes she just makes the problems worse with her God complex.\\n\\n\r\nArashiko Yuuno- The androphobic classmate of Sado. Her a andrphobia is quite convincing and her story was great. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the comedy and the deep stories of the characters. They would make you laugh and sympathize to the character to a point that you want to help them. However the main selling point of this anime is its humor because as much as you would like the stories, you would really love the wacky humors that this show have.The downside of this show is that most of the events are so cliche that you would already know what will happen miles away. Then there is Mio. Now if you don't like tsundere then you won't like this because she is not just what you hate, she is also a sadist and has a God complex. Also the scenes where Sado is being tortured or beaten up is overused, unnecessary and painful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPositive\\n\\n\r\n-The comedy is good with its slapstick and wacky jokes\\n\r\n-It has a in-depth story on why certain characters have such personalities, hobbies and problem.\\n\r\n-The Opening and ending song will make you want to watch it and stay at the end.\\n\\n\r\nNegative\\n\r\n-Cliche story\\n\r\n- Overused running gag like the torture or beat up the main protagonist\\n\r\n-If you cannot tolerate tsundere then watch this at your own risk.",

Mio was cute at times but Yuno was by far my favorite character, the most adorable character in any anime I've seen in a long time! It also had nice character development, especially between Toaru and Yuno. The opening and ending themes were also great andextremely catchy!\\n\nThis series gets a 9 out of 10 and is one of those series I would definitely love to add to my personal collection when I'm able! :)",

The twist is he is a machoist , basically he loves getting abused as it turns him on.\r\nSTORY 4/10\r\nWhile the story does start off original it falls into the typical \" boy trying to help girls with their problems while no progression on his own problems is done \". Of the 10 currently aired episodes only 2 have any focus on his \"MM \" problem , while the other 8 are basically character arcs.\r\nCHARACTERS 8/10\r\nEach character is basically a stereo type but they pullof their personalities well. For example you have the shy/timid girl but the reason she is shy/timid is what really makes her an unique character. You have the girl who acts like she hates the main even though she doesn't. You also have plenty of other characters who have their own little twists.\\n\\n\r\nART 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very well done. Most anime give you really plain school settings and colors. MM! makes everything bright and stands out , even the uniforms are a bright color. The characters look great as well , without any noticeable drops in quality.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in MM! is not good but it is not bad. No songs stand out , though they do tend to repeat the same songs over and over. The OP and ED are good.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 6.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe series started out great. It then tried to make too much out of the main character's problem without actually progressing with solving it. This turns into the enjoyment factor going down a lot for me.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a decent series with good characters , good art , and that is about it. The rest of the series is decent at best.",

            "content": "MM! is a fairly simple show about a guy who is an extreme masochist, but he doesn't like how he is so he enlists the help of a school club and is forced then to join as the leader, Mio, promises to cure him of his habbit, although there are only two members of the club before he join they don't exactly go about curing him, if anything fuelling it even further, with a sadist and an androphobe.\r\nThere is nothing new about having a character suffer (if you call it suffering) from S & M, but this show does something original by having the wholeshow focused around this condition rather than having a side character use the gimmick. This makes the show enjoyable and funny as the protagonist is treated to various acts of violence and torture and the different comedic and embarrassing situation this gets hime into, not discounting the crossdressing elemnts and Dragonball parodies.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not particualry great, hair seems to really large compared the the heads but thats just its style and the wide use of colors for hair, blue, green, purple, yellow just to name a few. Animation is simple but the characters do stay proportioned for the most part. Backgrounds are very simple and don't have a lot of detail put into them and the people in the background lack movement but there are a few scenes that look like a painting and do look nice. So the art and animation has its ups and downs but its style suits the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is quite the earworm but has an air of unoriginality about its tune, ending song is a little all over the shop its got fast paced beat which makes you want to nod your head along but then slows into a ballad but then instantly speeds up, still a decent listen. Voice acting can be a little annoying but it fits with each characters stereotype and this type of show, though i personally found them to be annoying they do add and help towards the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nTarou our main character is a 'hella masochist' but doen't like the fact so he enlists the help of the 2nd Volunteer Club to try and rid him of ot so he has the possibility of having a normal relationship, despite his condition he will always help his friends even when he feels embaressed. Mio is the leader of the club and frequently abuses tarou, (which she nicknames 'Pig boy') verbally and physically in the hoe of curing him. Yuuno has Androphobia due to an incident prior to the main stories time so if she ever gets too close to Tarou she ends up beating him but does genuanlly have feelings for him. Side characters all add variety to the comedy, the nurse likes fuelling situations and taking girls pictures, Noa is a scientist and won't stop at anything to get tarou to return her feelings with her inventions, Hayama is tarous best friends but tends to cross dress that alters his personality greatly, and not forget out lead characters sister and Mother who love him a little too much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show does have a few cliches, characters suffer from stereotypes, tsunderes, genius' etc and has a few cliched episodes but with the added masochism is creates a new feel and definitely helps make this show funny. The show does like to tease us with romance but nothing is ever played out fully. Enjoyable but not the best comedy out there.",

The main being a masochist, one being completely scared of men and a third thinking she's a god. What hilarity continues.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nI found the story very fun and entertaining and since I am really into romance, that part of the anime makes it alot better in my eyes. It has great comedy and that is the main reason I really, really enjoyed this anime. \r\nArt: 9/10\r\nI love the art. Really nicely made and I find it really nice looking.\r\nSound: 9/10\r\nI have no complaints aboutthem. They fit very well and I didn't see anything wrong with them. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI am not a real critic, so I can't really judge them that much. I found the characters fun and entertaining. I love it when they realise they have feelings and situations just get super funny. Ordinary in the sense of romance animes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the animes I enjoyed the most. The comedy and romance in a great mixture make it very enjoyable. I love comedy animes and this had me laughing every episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's great anime. If you love comedy, watch it. You'll also like it if you enjoy romance.

Not since the release of Full Metal Panic have i seen a series where i have gotten a great combination of physical comedy and character creation that appealed to the sadistic side of me. This series set itself from others by relying more on the content jokes, setups, and character reactions and rather than excessive use of fan service and/or repetition. It most definitely has my vote if you are looking for something with laughs, romance and a littleS&M (all done in good taste of course!).\\n",

            "content": "MM! is the harrowing story of a man plagued by masochism who attempts to overcome his love of pain through the help of a girl two years older who runs a club that grants wishes. Together with this lovely female companion he embarks on an epic quest through the streets of Tokyo in an attempt to cure himself. Along the way he meets a girl who has a severe dislike for men and hits any man who touches her and they fall in love. It both touches your heart and warms your body with its realistic portrayals of masochism, androphobia, and human relationships.\r\nNo, I\u2019m justscrewing with you. You can only wish for an anime that good when watching this giant pile of mediocre donkey droppings. You may notice how lately I\u2019ve been reviewing romantic comedies in the small hope I\u2019ll find something with a decent romance, funny comedy, and likeable characters. But I\u2019ve been failing miserably.\\n\\n\r\nMM! is a typically boring, rarely funny, and overly clich\u00e9 anime with one redeeming characteristic. It\u2019s kind of like Baka and Test, but not the funny first season. More like the drab, underwhelming second season.\\n\\n\r\nMM! has a fairly basic make-up. A guy named Tarou Sado (Teeheehee, sadomasochism) is a total masochist and gets off to when girls beat him up and violently attempt to kill him. To cure this he goes to the Second Volunteer Club where he meets a tiny, feisty girl named Mio Isurugi. He also reacquaints himself with the girl who originally started his masochistic ways, Arashiko Yuuno. She has androphobia and beats on men who touch her, due to a near rape by a male student in her middle school years. I likened her to Lisbeth Salander, though a much, much, much more shallow version. There\u2019s also a cross dressing friend and a loli inventor girl with no friends. But that\u2019s not too important.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s more important is how Mio goes about attempting to cure Tarou\u2019s masochism. This is the major problem with the whole show for me. We see that Tarou, unlike real people, does not have a limit to how much pain he can take. He enjoys his genitals being thoroughly destroyed, he enjoys his face getting rearranged, he enjoys eating bad food made by a girl. This guy must be like Superman or something, because he takes more pain than anyone should possibly be able to. And Mio doesn\u2019t appear to understand that he likes it, and I guess she thinks she will eventually get him to reach a limit or something? She continually beats him and does terrible things to him but he enjoys it all. So it\u2019s not working, maybe you should try something else?\\n\\n\r\nI mean, she does. We have the classic hypnotism episode that goes in directions I wish it hadn\u2019t. Maybe I\u2019m just not used to crossdressing/gay humor. But I didn\u2019t find it funny as much as I did disturbing.\\n\\n\r\nSo is there really a story? Can I stop this long tirade here and quit with the complaining? NO! There are two rather random episodes. One introduces the obligatory loli character, Noa. She\u2019s an inventor and has no friends. So, she decides to invent a machine that will turn everyone in the world into perverts.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026\\n\r\n\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that being idiotic and not even funny (maybe when I was fourteen I would have laughed my ass off but at this point in my life I find that to just be a lame excuse for a laugh) it turns into some sort of Kamen Rider/Dragon Ball Z referencing fight that is  ridiculous. I know it\u2019s a cartoon, and I need to suspend my belief in reality, but it\u2019s just so inconsistent with the rest of the show. The episode felt like it didn\u2019t belong. It came out of nowhere, it did nothing but introduce our little inventor, and it wasn\u2019t funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with pretty much every episode minus maybe two or three is that it has no far-reaching consequences, does nothing to progress the story or build the characters, and this isn\u2019t a straight up comedy. We\u2019ve seen before that you can mix a good plot with good characters and some comedy elements. The problem here is that whatever romance is developing is undefined. Especially toward the end when you wonder whether there is a love triangle going on or Tarou likes only one girl.\\n\\n\r\nI complained about this with Baka and Test and will do it here too. DEFINE THE ROMANCE! The last episode wasn\u2019t even a good last episode, it felt like it belonged mid-way through the series. The episode before that was the only time anyone came out with their true feelings and Tarou forgets about it before he can act upon this. Thus, we\u2019re left with what feels like an incomplete anime. Maybe they were expecting a second season?\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, I know it\u2019s based off of a light novel series. But the least that we can get is a clear ending. Just admitting feelings is all I ask. It is not a romantic comedy if there is not a romance developed and defined at the end.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I\u2019ve raged over nothing, let\u2019s talk about the animation.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s good. Characters and backgrounds are colorful. I especially liked the girls school uniform, it was purty. As far as smoothness goes, it\u2019s alright in that respect. Otherwise not much to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSound? Well, the opening is pretty bad. Never have I heard truer words in an opening theme song than \u201cOh my God is Jesus Christ\u201d. Why do the Japanese try to speak English and fail miserably? It\u2019s like the song from Clannad, just listening to the lyrics is laughable. I mean, they make more sense than the lyrics to a Red Hot Chili Peppers song, but are still awful. The ending song is not bad as much as mediocre. Music during the show is once again mediocre. Nothing that evokes emotions or you want to put on your iPod. Character\u2019s voices are all lovely.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while on the subject of characters, they are all fairly underdeveloped and boring. Tarou is nothing more than an oblivious teenage guy with an issue that needs to be fixed. He doesn\u2019t seem to have any emotions besides pleasure and fear, though sometimes he does exhibit some sentimentality that could have developed his character if there had been more moments like it. Mio is like a combination of Haruhi Suzumiya and Taiga Aisaka. She believes herself a god and is a feisty little high schooler. Yuuno is the only character of any worth, though not much. She has a defined background and a reason for being the way she is, and she is the only character that seems to exhibit any kind of emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAll the minor characters fit their roles as either: A.)Useless or B.) Useless but for fan service. Michiru the photographer/nurse, Noa, Tarou\u2019s mom and sister. They all seem to just be there for fan service and maybe to create some stupid plot device. One of these is the fact that Tarou\u2019s mom and sister are fighting over Tarou because they both love him in a creepy way. Now, the sister thing I\u2019ve kind of gotten used to, it seems to be used in comedies a lot. But the mom wanting to marry her own son? What? What about Tarou\u2019s father? Maybe that could have used some explaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character I found to be funny was Tarou\u2019s manager at the convenience store. He loves his body pillow and at one point has an action figure he carries around and asks what he should buy. That was funny for some sort of psychotic reason. Otherwise, the characters are all cardboard cut outs and unexciting.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like MM!. I wanted to like Mio, who I found to be absolutely adorable. I wanted to laugh and revel in the sheer craziness. But I couldn\u2019t. Or more precisely, I rarely could. MM! has so many conventional plot devices (club goes out to do something), characters (Mio, Noa), and settings (the obligatory beach and school festival episodes) that it just feels like it stitched together other anime in a caricature of what a romantic comedy should be.\\n\\n\r\nMM!\u2019s only redeeming factor is that it has pretty animation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if I had the choice between ripping out my eyeballs with serrated spoons coated in poison while simultaneously being burned alive, and watching MM!, I\u2019d probably tentatively choose watching MM!. But if I did not have to choose in such extreme circumstances, then I would not watch MM!. It\u2019s mediocrity at its absolute finest.",

They all follow a formula that barely would be entertaining if it was applied to just a single show, let alone a whole genre.\r\nBut this worn formula is what makes MM! so great. This anime follows the harem doctrine to the letter, but turns it up to eleven on all fronts. The whole cast sports some kind of perversion, the violence is out of control, the characters take the harem cliches to the extreme and the panty shots... oh, wait, there are none of those. Right. \r\nGraphics are colourful,crisp and nice enough and the characters may look a bit too stereotypical with wild hairdos and -colours, but that's kind of the point. The music fits the hysterical theme of the show very well, even though it's far from good enough to make it into my \"good shit\" mp3 folder. Character and story depth are nothing to write home about, but it does its job. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, MM! is a great comedy and an even better parody of a tired genre that really needed this vitamin injection. Let's hope it evolves from this, alternatively dies off completely when it is realized it can't get any better than MM!",

            "content": "Ah, MM.  One of the few animes that get a certain score all across the board.  Without further ado, let us begin.\r\nStory (7/10): Raise your hand if you don't know what a masochist is.  By my guess, I would say maybe about 1/2 of the people reading this won't know.  (Just a guess)  A masochist is basically someone who enjoys being abused.  The story of MM is basically following our main protagonist Sadou Tarou, as he tries to get rid of his \"intense\" masochism by the help of a tsundere that loves abusing people named Mio.  From this,the plot is quite predictable as the main focus has little or no effect on the anime as a whole.  Meaning, any method that is tried ultimately fails to accomplish the goal at hand.  Instead, the anime gets filled with random plot points like a slice of life.  Which, I don't have a problem with as the characters do sort of get closer.  They do spend some time getting into the 2 main female protagonists and giving them something of a backstory, which does fall sometimes on the fact that they give a general gist rather then specific details.  Meaning, there are plot holes and less information then there should be.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10): Sadou Tarou is your basic male protagonist in any harem anime where he is nice and kind to everyone, while being denser then a brick of gold.  One thing that sets him apart from other harem kings like Junichi from Akane and Rito from To Love-ru, is the fact that he is, a masochist.  Rather then hinting at it, or showing it from time to time, this anime shoves his masochism in your face, every episode.  So much to the point that I got annoyed with it.  Well, to be fair, he did say that he wanted to get rid of it, so it makes a bit of sense.  Next is Yuuno Arashiko.  As the \"fanservice\" of the anime, Arashiko is a soft spoken girl who is terrified of men.  Due to reasons I wish not to reveal, she will hit any guy who touches her.  Any, guy.  Aside from that, there's not really much to say other then the fact that she does get a \"backstory\".  Finally, Mio Isurugi.  A tsundere that thinks that she is god.  Yep, that about sums it up.  Mio is a strange person, seeing as how many tsunderes in anime refuse to do anything.  Heading the second volunteering club, she tries to help anyone she can with their problems, and won't stop at trying to help them.  She goes to the extreme to the point that she will seemed obsessed with trying to cure someone's issue.  For example, bringing military grade weapons to cure Tarou's masochism.  Apart from that, she does get a backstory at the very end of the anime, that does bring it to a great end.  Apart from these 3, you have various archtypes that swim in the supporting cast, such as incestuous relatives, a loli, best friend character, and so on and so forth.  \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound(7/10): The art in MM is brightly colored and vibrant, as well as easy to look at.  It's not bad, but, I'm not too keen on it.  It just looks average for a school anime.  The sound on the other hand is average as well.  It sounds good with its energetic sounding OP and ED, but it's not really that good.  Within the anime are a bunch of mood fillers and nothing else is really standoutish, except the track that appears at the VERY end of the anime.  That is good.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment(7/10): When I watched MM, I didn't see it as a harem anime to be honest.  Yes, there were a bunch of girls and such, but I just didn't see it.  (Trust me, I've watched A LOT of harems.) From a comedy aspect, the show excels with its over the top, balls to the wall, \"punishment\" scenes and \"training\", seeing as how the main character basically gets thrown out a third story window and skid across the dirt for about 100 meters.  (Not even kidding)  But from a romantic aspect, I could see something budding, but it really wasn't there.  Personally, I would've liked to see more, but seeing as how the Novel's creator has passed away, I guess I won't be getting anything.  In all fairness, MM is not for people who would like a serious plot, rather, if you want to watched something slightly perverted coupled with random comedy and mindless entertainment, then congratulations, MM is for you!",

            "content": "So unforeseeable is the nature of life. Who would have thought this  would be the show I'd write a review for? But here I am. There are some reasons for me doing this. First of all, this show is not well known compared to others in its genre. Secondly, I've finished it in such a short time that I think I just made a new record for myself. (Actually I still think I finished Hentai Ouji quicker but that show was meh). Thirdly, I like the characters in this one. \r\nWell, let's get to the main part while we're on it. Why you maywant to watch this show? The answer varies. There comes a night when you're supposed to do something but you cannot get your mind to it and find yourself looking for something interesting on the net instead. Unexpectedly, you come across a show that intrigues you because of the masochism theme set in school life. Or you could just be listening to anime ops/eds on Youtube and come across this one's. Regardless, the show is interesting so once you complete the first episode, you reluctantly click on the second, then the  third, and so on. Before long, you have watched all 12 episodes in approximately 4 and a half hours, and the clock ticks morning. That is what happened to me anyway. I didn't find it a waste of time, however. The plot may appear over exploited and repetitive at times but the attempts at humour are spot on. I will spoil you with just one minor (major) cue, there's a freaking spirit bomb. The last eps tend to be a bit boring compared to the first half but saved by the ending, which was fitting in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show is not something to be amazed by. So is the music. The voice acting is brilliant though. There are some fanservice here and there but you cannot look away from it, otherwise there'd be hardly any anime these days to watch. Apparently the show was adapted from a LN, whose author died mysteriously without giving the series a conclusion. That alone was enough for some to check out the show and see what force was at work behind the scene which caused him to leave early. All in all, this is not a pain to watch like some other ones I have and dropped recently. Hope this helps. \\n",

            "content": "At this point, most people cringe when the words 'harem anime' manages to escape someone's mouth.  The formula is tired and boring, and at most you get a chuckle/giggle by the end of the series. However MM! manages to flip the script, so to speak, by making a unique harem anime.\r\nBy making all the characters insane.\r\nEvery single character has something wrong with them. The main character is a major MM, masochist/pain lover, there's a girl who think she's a god, another that has a fear of men, a pedophile, a mother and daughter duo that's obsessed with their brother/son, an evil genius...Basically EVERYONE inthis anime is messed up on some level. \\n\\n\r\nSo the plot of this story is that our masochistic lead decides he hates his peculiar fetish and wants to get it fixed. So he goes to a special club run by a kami-dere that tries to make all wishes come true...In the most painful-I mean pleasuring way possible. In the process getting his own harem, and trying to keep his masochism a secret. \\n\\n\r\nIn general I think this was an awesome anime. The characters are all very three dimensional, the harem is given time to make sense, and the main character is so likable that I didn't mind the high school set up.  There's also enough time for the harem to develop. You get the feeling he could get with any of the girls presented. And then you ship them...Hard.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in the English and the Japanese are both solid. I personally prefer the English, but you're free to like whatever you like. The character designs are pretty standard, but the art is still lovely. All in all I highly recommend this anime, and think it's a shame that it won't get a second season on account of the novelist's death.",

            "content": "S&M is a genre that I don't like too much, let alone plan to watch if it's the core genre of an anime, but I watched MM for the Harem genre it had. I was disappointed that it didn't have much harem in it, rather it had a lot of comedy and cute romance that made up for it.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nI don't see many anime that successfully depict perverted characters without leaning in to the Ecchi and in most cases borderline Ecchi genre. MM is an exception to this. There is little to no Ecchi which eases out the plot and makes it more plot heavy(as many Ecchi fans like me agree that Ecchi is somewhat of a plot-killer). Thanks to that, MM wonderfully presented a story about a pervert without Ecchi, a commendable feat which I give a standing ovation too. Nevertheless, even without Ecchi the story wasn't all too great as almost every single episode was a cliche. I don't have much problems with cliche as long as they contain even a pinch of originality in them, which I couldn't see much of in MM. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was really good. I don't watch much of Xebec's other anime but for a first impression I'm impressed. It looked really good and fit in with the Masochistic aspect of our MC Tarou. Although the eyes looked quite big on the female characters (especially Yuuno) but it wasn't a bother.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe VAs did a really good job portraying the characters. Sado sounded like a pervert, Mio sounded perfectly like a Tsundere (I should know, I love the Tsundere archetype) and Yuuno also perfectly matched her personality, that of a shy girl. The disappointment comes with the OP/ED as niether appealed to me at all. They sounded fake and lame and wasn't at all fun to listen too. It was so bad that after listening to it in the first few episodes I completely skipped it for the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was present, but was quite disappointing and I won't be kind or overlook it because it isn't a slice of life (which doesn't focus on character development) as MM is not a slice of life anime. I wasn't impressed at all by how the characters developed. Once again I had to witness a second MC to develop while the core MC (Tarou) doesn't develop any character, and I don't mean the DBZ reference. \\n\\n\r\nTarou: As I mentioned, Tarou doesn't develop and so he's the exact same person you saw in episode 1, except maybe he has feelings for the other characters, which I don't think counts as character development as he doesn't *change*. Although him not being a huge pervert is a relief as we either have the super straight MC who can't talk to girls or a super pervert who wants to make his own harem, with no one in between. Thankfully Tarou fits in the middle, but I think that's all we can be thankful of, there's nothing much.\\n\\n\r\nMio: Our resident Tsundere, her character was pretty disappointing (coming from a Tsundere fan) as she falls for him quite late and her actions are more tsun than dere, a situation that's a complete turnoff for any RomCom fan (unless you're a Masochist). Nevertheless, if she wasn't an MC, she would've gotten more praise from me, but she holds back the show. Either I'm not into Tsunderes anymore or TsunDeres are too flawed and cliche driven to satisfy all those hooters who are literal Masochists who have body pillows of their favorite TsunDeres. I guess it's the latter. Because of that, people like me who want a proper Tsundere never get one, as they wanna satisfy the perverted desires of all those snotty teenage boys.\\n\\n\r\nYuuno: Ah. What a relief. Much like her personality, Yuuno is a relief to write about. The shy girls type, she is androphobic and lashes out at Tarou whenever he touches her. Although cliche, it's bearable knowing that she's not being a Tsundere wannabe. She is the only character who develops wonderfully during the whole anime. And I'm not saying that because if her feelings towards Tarou (which altthough is true, is not a deciding factor of character development as I mentioned before) but how she deals with her androphobic tendencies. Much like Mayo Chiki's Jirou, the way she deals with it is something I'll applaud. You could say that 5 of the 6 points I gave the character section is because of Yuuno\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though it was riddled by cliches, I enjoyed watching MM because of it's amazing unique comedy and cute soft Romance, it was really satisfying in the end too as unlike other harem anime, this felt kinda like a proper ending. I came for harem, didn't get it but got a good lot of comedy and romance out of MM. Another thing I liked was how the creators rated themselves either S or M in the credits, it looked really nice and felt that the creators like what they're making.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 (7+9+7+6+8/50*10=7.4)\\n\\n\r\nQuite the fun anime. If you're expecting Harem and Ecchi, you'll be severely disappointed but if you came for the Romance and Comedy then you'll really enjoy MM. Although not the best of it's genre, MM can guarantee a cute romance and lots of laughs. It's truly a feel-good anime and cheers you up if you're down. Definitely one of the funniest animes of 2010!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Yuuno is best girl <3 If traps are allowed Hayama is best girl XD",

If you have already seen this anime and are reading this then you are just along for the ride. \r\nAlso I don't normally like romantic comedy anime, so just I'm letting you know.\r\nStory/Characters:\r\nThis anime starts out really strong, I mean it's interesting and it's really well written and has a compelling concept, ifonly it were all like that. A little more than half way through the series I feel like this anime kind of just gave up and stopped progressing and became a slice of life show that went fucking nowhere which is really sad considering how much potential this anime had but this show just doesn't follow through or conclude or have a resolution. The ending to this anime wasn't like a cliff hanger or anything but it was just kind of a cop out to me and I was left a little disappointed.\\n\r\nThe Characters on the other hand were not disappointing, in fact they were the real meat of the show, they all had their own unique problems that they had to face and I found them to be pretty relatable to some extent which is weird considering one guy's a masochist, and another guy's a crossdresser but they play these things off so well.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nI actually liked some of the characters designs but that's about it. As for the soundtrack, it was kind of forgettable accept for the opening which kind of reminded me of the opening to \"Toredora\".\\n\\n\r\nSub/Dub:\\n\r\nThe dub for this anime is passable and I would even go as far as saying that it was a little above average but it's nothing that I would get exited about so take your pick on which version you want to watch.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nI'm giving this anime a 6/10.\\n\r\nThis anime isn't bad but it really doesn't follow through.",

            "content": "Hey females and fella, first review I\u2019m gonna attempt to write cause I\u2019m bored and I need a reason to finish anime\u2019s I keep delaying, and please don\u2019t kill me over the grammar and chance\u2019s of contradictions I\u2019m honestly just typing this as I watch the show and jotting down the things I see and what not and in all honesty the grammar shit doesn\u2019t matter as long as my point gets across thats all I honestly care about, so enjoy.\r\nThis anime is absolutely amazing as a comedy and strictly that,the girlies are cute as shit, art is beautifully bright but easy to look atand the whole super masochism thing I found myself laughing at more times than I can remember. But anything other than that it gets a meh score from me.\\n\\n\r\nStory: There uh really isn\u2019t one. It pretty much goes like this. \\n\r\n\u201cFix my problem!\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cOf course I love to help, But I also really wish I was Taiga *Get\u2019s angry*\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThats about it besides episode 3 which really pissed me off, like the show got super serious Out of no where. I could give two shits about handsome boxer guy (who\u2019s name I\u2019m too lazy to look up). Adding this whole scene with the forced dating scenario and him ending up hitting her was a sad and weak attempt at making us feel sympathetic and giving us an unnecessary explanation for her man-phobia. Which they could just have easily used her parents divorce for. It honestly just completely took me out of the show. Story gets like a 2/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: What rhymes with \u201cdish hay\u201d that\u2019s right every body cliche. They literally matched each and every character up with one word and based everything about them with it.\\n\\n\r\nMio: Tsundere\\n\r\nTaro: Masochist (I know that\u2019s the whole idea of the show but besides masochist his other \u201credeeming\u201d quality is being the main character so still not much creativity to work with)\\n\r\nYunoo: Feminist ( Now don\u2019t get triggered, Get it ha! But her whole thing is hating guys and thats it)\\n\r\nHayama: Yaoi\\n\r\nNoa: Science \\n\r\nYumi: Yuri \\n\\n\r\nI could deal with the weak characters as long as the humor was still present but once they got into the unnecessary serious segments the show literally became back ground noise while I scavenged the collective tab on ifunny. Which i only stopped to look up from when I heard Taro screaming in excitement. Characters get like a 5/10, it\u2019s a cliche for a reason.\\n\\n\r\nComedy: If it\u2019s your first time watching this show you\u2019ll most likely find yourself laughing multiple times through out. One of the few good things about this show is it\u2019s over-exaggeration of masochism, Taro takes that shit to another level, but sadly even that gets kind of tiresome after one viewing and thats also where the creativity comedy wise stops. The jokes are mediocre at best and with out the whole you\u2019re a pervert so I\u2019ll hit you hard enough to kill you, thing going on which by the way is 80% of the jokes. This show would bomb ever harder than it already has. First Time Viewing: 8/10 (Simply cause it\u2019s my kind of humor)\\n\r\nRepeats: 4/10 (It\u2019s get stale as shit)\\n\\n\r\nArt: This shows biggest redeeming quality. It\u2019s art is super beautiful and super bright while somehow still being easy on the eyes (Even at 3 in the morning). Characters are the brightest and clearest things on the screen which they should be, complementing nicely with the multiple settings. I don\u2019t really have much to say about the art since I\u2019m not much of an art guy myself, so I sadly can\u2019t critique every defining feature of an episode sorry haha. Art: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s sums up a few points to the show there was much more I could have wrote about but decided agonist simply cause I\u2019m lazy and if you\u2019re interested enough in this show to read some random ass person\u2019s review, you can watch the show and see if you enjoy it yourself, every body\u2019s got an opinion for a reason right haha go figure our your own. Overall this show get\u2019s a 6/10.",

Is for one of the most Out there type animes I know, Now I do not go into a lot if details about animes I review, I just put My own thought of what I think so, if you do not need this type of review then I suggest read another. \r\nMM! Is a anime about A High school Guy who is a Masochist and he Enjoys being put through pain by the Opposite sex. He in a way does not enjoy this fetish of his so He goes and ask's the Second Voluntary club Of his school for help, Where he meetsa girl who claims she is god and Will Help him be cured from his Masochist\\n\\n\r\nNow like I said I do not go much into it but my thoughts, I am not here to explain everything but add my opinion on it as I am that type of reviewer. \\n\\n\r\nTHIS ANIME Is not so much perverted but its way funny, I laughed constantly as I watched it and sat there with my mouth dropped because They added References from Other animes and do not even try to hide it. Its almost like they ripped it straight out of the other animes themselves and just used it, ITS CRAZY But funnier then hell. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is crazy but it adds in its little side stories to kind of get you attached to some characters and just look at their past a little, so in a way they try to keep you watching, cause if you are like me, Watching a anime with no actual set line plot, its kind of crazy and gets boring. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are way out there and just weird and thats what we love about funny/perverted/Crazy anime right??? Crazy characters that just keep you laughing and just wondering \" What the fuck am I watching\" In a good way though. That's what this anime has and I think they fit very well\\n\\n\r\nNow I could not give this a straight 10 or 9 because it has its flaws, Like some of the characters just never seem to grow and its kind of boring seeing them just stay the same and again, the story is for this guys Masochist to be cured, but its just crazy and Its all over the place. But there are some side stories and CRAZY Ones that keep you in to watch more and you just have the love the randomness of this anime. I say go watch it if you are into weird/somewhat perverted/Crazy Type anime. I know I got a laugh off of it, I hope you do also",

            "content": "The Story- MM! is a little anime that came out in 2010 by Studio Xebec that tells the story of a guy named Taro Sado trying to get rid of his  masochistic ways so that he can confess to his love. His friend, Tatsukichi Hayama, recommends he goes to the second volunteer club so that they could cure his problem. When Taro visits the club, he meets Mio Isurugi, a very sweet girl too short for her size, at least that's what she seemed like at first. It was not only 5 seconds later that she showed her true colors, a blond hair tsunderewho proclaims herself as god. Taro also meets Arashiko Yuno, a girl which has a phobia of men and is the reason Taro is a masochist in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe Review- Oh my f***ing god, this was the worst anime I ever watch this far. I mean the characters are one dementional, the two main female leads don't interest the viewer in the slightest, and the ending is a cliffhanger that doesn't resolve anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art- Now, I must admit, the art looks good for a 2010 anime, even if it is a piece of crap anime. However, it looks to cartoony, and what I mean is that at the end of every episode, we have the main character blasted into space in a non-realistic way like if he was a member of team rocket (We're blasting off again! *Sparkle*). But, it pulls itself up in the serious scenes of this anime, especially in episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound- The Opening and End themes are catchy, but after a while, I found myself skipping theme because the lyrics and the sequences were stupid as all get out. None of the background music stood out and basically just left me bored in every scene until a \"funny moment\" occurred.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters- My favorite character was Yumi Mamiya, mostly because she made the whole anime worth it every time she was on screen. Also because YURI! As for the other characters, the main protagonist is just another pervert with a nice side who gets hit around by the loli- er, I mean tsundere of the show every time he's in his \"masochist state\". Then, there is the females, who drag this show down. There is Arashiko Yuno who hits the main character every time she even touches him or vise versa, even if she loves him. Then there is the worst female in any anime ever besides  School Days, Mio Isurugi, the tsundere of the show. Not only does she have a god complex, but she is also mentioned to be a sadist who hits the main character and puts him through hell for her own pleasure, which makes this x10 worse because she's suppose to help him in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- I give this show a 4/10. Why? Because this show is a waste of time and space. You could just watch episodes 1-4 and call it a day. Even the ending is mediocre. SPOILER!!! In the ending, there is no confession, no moment of truth, no anything (except a little fanservice for the pervert inside us all.) The two female leads have a competiton to help two stores get customers and they set up a birthday party for a little girl, only to find out it was Mio's birthday all along (aww *throws up from the writer giving the tsundere sympathy). So, while the main character destracts Mio (i.e he says the one thing you're never suppose to call a tsundere) the other characters set up a party for Mio, which they celebrate to end the show. After the show, I literally sat still, looking at the black screen on my tablet, wondering WTF did I just watch.\\n\\n\r\nDON'T WATCH THIS ANIME! GO WATCH HYOUKA, AT LEAST THEY KNOW HOW TO WRITE A GREAT SHOW!\\n\\n",

One day he decided he should find a way to get rid of it. He encountered a girl name Isurugi Mio, which in term is the club president and promised that she will do anything and everything to cure his masochism. The series was full of laughter as our main female protagonist failed several times trying to cure his masochism. As the story went on, theydeveloped their feelings or each other, with them having different feelings for each others as the story went on.\\n\r\nArt and Sound - 8: The art and sound is not really something to brag about though the anime did quite a good job on choosing their scenery and settings as the story move on with some moments that will touch your heart.\\n\r\nCharacter - 9: The characters are perhaps one of MM's strong point, with our characters have their own personal problems as well as their feelings that are fabulously developed and well played. The story continue with each characters gradually and kind of overcoming their phobia. \\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall - 9: I liked \"MM!\" with it's story line and characters which are properly designed as well as the settings with fillers and others characters that come along with it. I found the anime quite interesting to watch, hilarious, and heart warming. I definitely recommend this to anyone that want to try something unique.\\n\r\nThank you for reading my first review as well as probably and possible putting up with my grammar. Have a good day folks!",

            "content": "What an odd yet silly anime.  The character's all have some weird or strange behavior or habits.  Sado is a sadist.  He enjoys being hit, beaten, stomped, kicked, or any other type of physical punishment immensely.  He knows it's odd and as much as he'd like to have the typical relationship with a girl he can't.  Girls start coming into his life and the funny part is they all have some weird thing going on with them as well.  Isurugi takes masochism to a whole new level and is constantly trying to \"help\" Sado with his problem.  Yuunois deathly afraid of boys and boys touching her.  So if you get where this is going the anime is all around an odd combination of strange behavior and comprised of odd moments where you may find humor.  There were things I liked about this anime and there were things I didn't like about this anime.  Some of the things I liked about this anime is that they weren't serious about it.  They made it funny, silly, and ridiculous.  If you like this type of anime, and the typical guy who has four or five girls who likes him but he may not even realize it than this is something for you.  I gave it a lower score because I don't always like those anime.  As there are funny parts in the anime I didn't find it all that appealing.  There is better out there if you like harem, romance, or even ecchi.",

            "content": "Having a problem is one thing and admitting it to people takes guts beyond what most people have. But to end up gaining friends also with problem but still treat you equally as everyone helps one another to get over their problem, is a whole new level of heartwarming life stories.\r\nMM! is the story of one male Masochist character who decides he needs to get help for solving his masochism. The help he finds is certainly unexpected and what he learns about the other members of his newly joined club are just as unexpected as the plans they come up with to \"help\" one another.While nothing in terms of \"curing\" anyone really progresses, the story seems to be one of making good memories from school and attempt to solve the little issue in life before they never get a chance to later on.\\n\\n\r\nArt style seems to be a main character focus only, style as you can tell if they don't have odd colored hair, they don't have much to do with the main story. Many things are bright, vibrant colors that catch the eye but can sometimes be too colorful as even in sad moments the scene can be ruined by everything being too joyous a color. This aside shading and tones only seem to exist either in sunrise/sunset, night illumination scenes and angered individual scenes. everything else that is the majority of the anime, are simplistic cell shading that almost makes it seem boring\\n\\n\r\nMusic on the occasion its used is fairly par as when its playing, it's either an over the top comical scene or a major emotional keystone in the story with little to none, BGM in the rest of the show. Sounds as well are fairly sub standard as not much at all is original content and most sound effects are stock samples. Opening and ending themes are hard to like as well, with starting off decent, they quickly get overboard to try too hard to keep their theme and end up going way the chart to sounding pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are possibly the one thing done decently in MM! (Except the main characters family which come off as highly annoying and pointless to the show) While everything else is hugely over the top, characters are always having new flaws revealed instead of being a god complex throughout the entire show. (except for the one character introduced half way through that the anime honestly would be better off without) The main flaws and problems that each character has are quickly brought to light because of the club's goal as well as proper back stories as to why and are slowly (some only attempted) fixed as their progression is easily noted later on.\\n\\n\r\nLastly enjoyment. Put simply, yes it was humorous. No, I personally did not enjoy it. To get the over the top biased out of the way, I found my self constantly pausing the anime and doing other things, not wanting to go back to this anime because of the times it goes far beyond ridiculous. The believable humor is good and will produces a few chuckles and laughs. However when referencing another anime, MM! sometimes forgets what it it's about and goes completely alien towards it own genre in an attempt to be funny that ends up crashing with enough force that could kill its own animators.",
