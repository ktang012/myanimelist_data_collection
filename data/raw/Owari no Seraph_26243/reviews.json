            "content": "Alright, this is one of the most popular shows last season so I found it reasonable for it to serve as my first review for the season.\r\nStory 2/10:\r\nThe story is surprisingly bad. Episode one was almost perfectly copied from popular WIT series Attack on Titan. The premise is pretty generic. Main character is trapped and enslaved in a city by vampires along with many other kids. He ends up the sole survivor as he and friends attempt to escape from the city of Vampires. He then vows to get his revenge. Oh boy. He joins the military force to combat the vampires and for someodd reason the MC goes through school while receiving his training. His school life was irrelevant other than for making friends so the school setting was unnecessary as he could've made friends anywhere else. The setting is extremely unnatural considering the situation\\n\\n\r\nThe story continues to progress predictably while MC meets a typical cast of characters which I'll get into. But the absolute worst thing about the series is the dialogue. It's beyond generic and incredibly predictable. From \"I'll kill all the vampires\" to \"I'll make sure no one dies lol\". Just as no one seems to think before they spout whatever trash they want to say, they author doesn't seem give much thought to what dialogue can convey. It's as if he tried to take every cool sounding line from previously anime and manga and apply them where possible only to receive the opposite effect of what he hoped.\\n\\n\r\nThe weapons systems is retarded. They are controlled by demons and you must make a contract with a demon using some arbitrary and nonsensical show of \"willpower\", Which will lead to yet again some more predictable scenes. The fights are strangely favorable to MC and his party even though the power level between humans and Vampires is revealed to be huge. The upper level Vampires never go all out for whatever reason and constantly miss chances to kill, in contrast to episode one where the kids are cut apart in seconds. The thing I realized about this series is there is nothing unique about it. There is nothing that make it stand out and be recognized as \"that anime\". This isn't simply in comparison to AOT, but many good or at least decent anime. This goes back to the blandness of the dialogue, and the blandness of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2/10:\\n\r\nNot much to say here. The character are all dull as I said. The MC is a typical angry little kid who wish to exterminate the vampires. He spouts the expected edgy lines all throughout the first few episode thinking he doesn't need friends to kill, he wants to hurry up and kill, etc. He meets a typical shy kid who seems completely useless but can actually be somewhat helpful, and a typical rival character who is an ass but is actually nice on the inside. Shinoa was actually decent and entertaining as well. Maybe that's why I remember her name along with just a few others. Her smug playfulness drew an interesting contrast with her serious attitude on the field. But that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nStrangely enough with all the emphasis on teamwork you'd think there'd be more tactics in fights but I guess not. The vampires didn't appear enough to do anything other than say the usual antagonistic lines and how things seemed interesting. MCs friend survives and turns into a Vamp, no surprise here. The show does a terrible job drawing sympathy for the viewer for either side, though it clearly aims to do so with MC's friend being turned while MC fights the vampires and a few other reasons.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10:\\n\r\nThe character designs are good but the animation can be inconsistent with one hilarious episode standing out in terms of poor quality. The water color-esque background are unique and works well for indoor scenes, but outdoors draws an huge contrast with the 2D character figures which can be annoying. Fight scenes were done decently at best, as seems WIT is saving the shekels for AOT.\\n\\n\r\nMusic 6/10:\\n\r\nMany people take the opportunity to shamelessly cream themselves when Hiroyuki Sawano is revealed to be handling the music composition for an anime. This is certainly not on the level of AOT or Kill la Kill and it's not anything special. It's has some good moments but nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment 5/10\\n\r\nEven with all I mentioned the series managed to remain entertaining enough for me to at least complete it. I may or may not be watching season 2, but I don't feel like I've completely wasted my time somehow. Maybe I still retain hope for the show to get better and haven't been completely let down (considering my expectations were pretty low in the first place)\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10:\\n\r\nIf you like something generic yet can kill time without causing you to die of boredom, this may be the show for you.",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph, or Seraph of the End, is the quintessential example of a \"generic\" anime title. It's a show you've undoubtedly seen many times before and one you'll continue to encounter way after its time in the limelight is up. It's a throw-away title that'll be replaced by the next factory-assembled one to take its place. It's the store brand cereal at anime's supermarket; bland, cheap, packaged in a box with little creative effort, always at the bottom shelf, and does very little to distinguish itself from its competitors. At worse, it's a forgettable hodge-podge of clich\u00e9s and overused tropes, and at best, it'sa cheap knock-off of a much superior product. It's an entry level show in every regard and depending on how accustomed you've grown to these formulaic setups will determine how much you like/tolerate it. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Owari no Seraph is so standard-fare that if someone were to tweak it with a few name and setting changes, they will be able to use the same synopsis to describe any other show with a familiar setup. Use the template below and see how many bottom-of-the-barrel shows you an insert:\\n\r\n.......................................................................................................................... \\n\r\nOne day humanity is suddenly attacked by a group of [insert name of threat here] and was brought to the brink of annihilation. [insert amount of years] later, leftovers of this time in mankind's history attempts to scrape together what's left to form a new society out of the event that felt like an act of divine punishment. And with the discovery of [insert name of weapons or power here], they were able to fight back. We follow our protagonist [insert name here] as he and his comrades use [insert name of weapon or power] to fight the [insert name of threat here] and reclaim humanity in this post-apocalyptic world. And in the process of doing so, they slowly discover the mystery of their sudden appearance that might be closer to home than what was intially thought. \\n\r\n..........................................................................................................................\\n\\n\r\nTo say that there's little to talk about when discussing Owari's story would be an understatement. Everything I can say here can apply to any other cheaply patched-together narrative. Instead, I'll discuss if the execution of this setup was done right nor not. Despite harping on its overused premise, it can still be done well if executed and presented with some tact... and to the surprise of no one, Owari didn't even manage to do that. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is supposed to document the power struggle between humanity and vampires, with our protagonist and his friends being in the centerfold of all the events taking place. You'd think with such a setup that we'd at least get an action-filled romp to keep us entertained but sadly, all we got were less than 2-episodes worth of skirmishes. That's right, a show that boasts \"action\" as its primary genre couldn't even fulfill that simple quota. That's like ordering a Porterhouse steak and receiving a White Castle slider instead. To add insult to injury, the pacing for Owari was painfully slow, despite what the erratic time-skip-filled 1st episode would have you believe. Plot points that would normally be wrapped up in 10-15 minutes with proper pacing are now extended to 2-3 episodes. This made some events that barely held any plot relevance to adopt the type of pacing akin to long-running battle shounens. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as if that wasn't enough to seal its fate, the story of Owari is also plagued with plot conveniences happening in rapid succession:\\n\\n\r\nA virus wipes out humanity but \"conveniently\" doesn't kill anyone 13 and below. Enslaved kids attempt a big escape from their vampire capturers and our protagonist is \"conveniently\" the only one to get away, where he \"conveniently\" meets a resistance force that was \"conveniently\" waiting right outside the escapee's exit. Humanity has \"conveniently\" discovered a way to infuse demon's energy into weapons to fight against the vampires with the scriptwriters' explanation being \"just because.\" And since shounen protagonists are always special snowflakes, he \"conveniently\" mastered this infusion where many others have been known to fail. And no, he never practiced, because God knows he's the special snowflake. And the rest of the story adheres to this painfully forced path from beginning to end. There isn't an episode that goes by where you're not thinking \"well that sure was convenient.\" The screenplay is plagued with the artifice of fatalistic storytelling while pretending that aspect to its writing doesn't exist. \"You can't have your cake and eat it too\" perfectly encapsulates the issue on display.\\n\r\nHaven't done a lick of training but need a power boost? Well, how about this \"conveniently\" placed power-boost pill that was never foreshadowed or properly introduced beforehand. Stuck in a dire situation where all your friends are in trouble? Well, how about a \"conveniently\" timed supernatural powerup using the trite \"dark side\" shounen cliche.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again, a formulaic setup isn't inherently a bad thing if done with finesse but this show just doesn't demonstrate any concern for decent storytelling whatsoever. It's a show that would rather abuse every literary device in the book if it'll get it the results it wants rather than achieving the same end-result through careful consideration. Owari is sloppy writing 101.\\n\\n\r\nAn area that demonstrated some effort, however, was the art and animation. By itself, the art and animation were fine but when brought together, they mixed as seamlessly as oil and water. The 2D character designs in contrast to the watercolor/oil-pastel inspired backgrounds felt very out of place. This was made apparent in open environments where the individual scenes showed no proper separation between its foreground and background. There's no dimension or depth in the background, which result in the characters moving awkwardly across the landscape. It's like watching them play things out on a green screen, which is made all the more amusing given that it's animated and not live-action. \\n\\n\r\nWhile they didn't mesh well together, the creators still deserve credit for at least attempting to make it different, as the backgrounds did look quite nice at times, with a nice range of color choices and purposeful brush stroke-like textures. The character designs were all fine as well, being distinct enough to tell apart from other series. However, I am disappointed that they never had any well-choreographed fights, especially considering the limited amount of physical encounters they chose to have, to begin with. As a whole, the art and animation were passable, it wasn't the best but it did demonstrate some creative decisions in its visual output. At worst, a bit off model and at best, a serviceable piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nIf Owari had any saving graces it'll be the opening theme that came with it. It was a toe-tappingly infectious tune with well-timed visuals that I found myself playing on repeat. A catchy pop ballad that hit just the right notes and visual presentation that kept it in tempo. Surprisingly enough, the soundtrack had some restraint to it, which is uncommon for Hiroyuki Sawano, especially when taking into consideration his previous work on Attack on Giant Naked People and Kill La Wincest. While it still had his signature use of orchestric soundbites and digital glitch-pop buildup, it was often intertwined with shyer melodic tunes. It was refreshing if only unexpected for what Sawano is known for. \\n\r\nThe voice acting was all fine, with the standout being Takahiro Sakurai's performance for the vampire antagonist, Ferid Bathory. He did a good job giving him a playful yet sinister tone, which really helps to sell how much of a baddie he was. But enough appraisal, time to address the biggest crux of Owari, and that were the characters. \\n\\n\r\nLike the underbaked story, the characters suffered from an equal amount of problems. On top of being indistinguishable from your garden variety shounen lineup, they were also all grossly underdeveloped. Our protagonist, Yuu Hyakuya, is yet another hot-blooded teen who's on a quest for revenge. His one-track mindset is only topped by his regurgitated \"I will defeat them all!\", \"I don't need friends!\" mantras that he seems to want to yell out every 10-minutes. What's disheartening about the protagonist is that if given the proper time, he could have actually received decent characterization. There were several opportunities that could have allowed for this to occur but they were never taken advantage of. If you want the audience to get invested in a conflict, there needs to be proper time given to let the events unfold. If something life-altering happens to our protagonist that would cause a metamorphosis upon conquering that mental dilemma, it would benefit the story to let the audience see that play out. But instead of giving the proper time to allow this to happen, they simply time skipped pass this rough stage altogether. So not only was the story written with a sense of artificiality, but even the little decency it could have attained through demonstrating the character's growth was completely disregarded.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast were all forgettable nobodies you could find in other series. There was the pussy sidekick, the friendemy rival, the tsundere, and Douchbag teacher-sama, and the list goes on and on. Possibly the only character that had a decent personality was Shinoa Hiiragi, one of our protagonist's comrades. Her snarky, playful attitude made her interaction with the others fun to watch, but like the others, she remained underdeveloped and lacked any proper characterization outside of the already playful nature that she possessed. Another key character brought up was Yuu's childhood friend, Mikaela, but his involvement comes with spoilers so I'll leave it at that. The vampire antagonists were all one-dimensional baddies and none of them really mattered in the end. The only one that really got focus was Ferid Bathory, due to his involvement with our protagonist's life-altering incident. He's cartoonishly sinister and takes lives in a carefree manner, and that's about the extent of him as a character. \\n\\n\r\nAnd after running through everything that Owari no Seraph had to offer, the final verdict can't surmount to anything other than generic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis title is a knock-off brand shounen in every way possible. While I wasn't really bothered watching it, I certainly wasn't impressed either. The setup was predictable and the cliched moments just came in by the truckload. It was a time-passer, but not a good one at that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a newcomer to anime then Owari could, at best, serve as a gateway title to help you get a little insight into the medium's common practices. But if you've been a part of the anime community for a decent amount of time and have grown tired of these formulaic setups, then I suggest skipping this one as it does nothing but follow a set checklist like its life depended on it.",

            "content": "So the first cour of Owari no Seraph has ended, and I can say with clear confidence that this show, is without a doubt, an utter piece of generic troupes amalgamated and fused together into one entity. Was it amazing? No, not even close. And was it horrible? No, it hasn't reached that low of a tier yet, fortunately.\r\nThe story in a nutshell involves kids, and adults stuck in a post-apocalyptic setting with two sides, the vampires and the humans. So what happened? Honestly, nothing much. The story itself progresses at the speed of a snail for the majority of the series and drags outtoo much, in which I personally hope the second cour will be faster paced and utilise suspense more intelligently for the benefit of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode was without a doubt, somewhat suspenseful and does a semi-good job. However, the opening song does a great job to counter this semi-well done job and reveal that Mika is indeed alive by showing his grown up self which would have been much better if it were to be revealed unexpectedly later on in order to create some sense of suspense. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, in this \"post-apocalyptic\" setting, the second episode starts off with the orthodox and conventional, overused school setting which already makes it hard to take the \"post-apocalyptic world\" seriously, and minimising any genuine sense of danger and threat that left off with the premiere episode. Fortunately, it then derives off this school setting but the ambiance still does not skyrocket in terms of suspence, tension or intensity as the main cast is composed by a group of children, not adults, but children.\\n\\n\r\nThe male central protagonist is Yuichiro Hyakuya and his friends from the Moon Demon Company, a group of freedom fighters formed to extinguish vampires in the harsh and dejected reality. Here on, it sets up two sides, the humans fighting against the vampires in this war-like battlefield. Although the main cast is a bunch of children, surprisingly they can pull off wicked stunts with their cursed gear, weapons specialised to exterminate the vampires, and are portrayed centuries stronger than the other adult looking soldiers from the army. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick the best character, it would be Shinoa Hiiragi, also, she is one of the reasons I was able to enjoy the show to some degree. Her comical expressions and satirical manner of speech is what makes her as a character stand out more than the rest. Her design also stands out more than the others with her purple hair and ribbon attached. I applaud Hayami Saori for her splendid voice acting in portraying Shinoa's cheerful voice and sarcastic approaches and mannerisms, which pulled the show to a better level. \\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, it was definitely one of its stronger aspects, but also may be considered pretty incompetent by some because from a Hiroyuki Sawano standpoint, it was \"just more of the same\". The ost could have also been utilised better throughout the series and was not extremely memorable besides the orchestral version of the ending song. Both the opening song and ending song are pretty compelling though and definitely stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a hit and miss, some can say it is a manifestation of the show's lack in budget, and some can say it is for artistic and creative purposes, but I think, it's both. The animation was nothing ground-breaking or topnotch and was particularly below average for a shounen action series which is definitely disappointing.  \\n\\n\r\nThe action is in particular, extremely weak and incompetent in terms of an action anime and there are many better shows that execute action and its choreography in a much better fashion with more fluid animation and well-directed choreography. Hopefully, as the climax is in the second cour of this series, one can only hope for improvements in these areas. Even if the second cour depicts improvements for the animation or action sequences, the show as a whole still will not have consistent good quality, but rather, fluctuations in its inconsistent quality.  \\n\\n\r\nLuckily, this is only the first cour, and certainly, if this was how the show ended, it would have a much lower score, but since it is merely the first part, that's somewhat forgivable and may perhaps be redeemed later on with improvements. \\n\\n\r\nI can't say I did not enjoy the show, because I definitely did to an extent. But was it amazing? No, not even close. And was it horrible? No, not to that tier yet - but from here onward, I expect better from the second cour. The premise in itself has been done countless of times before and does not bring anything new or groundbreaking, but it does allow room for improvement, in both its presentation and execution in which the second cour will be pivotal to in order to judge the series as an entirety. \\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the second cour should expand on the story more, reveal more of the implied secrets, and hopefully develop the characters in a profound manner because right now, this show has not entirely finished and has ended in an open fashion for the second cour and until then, nothing in this first cour of Owari no Seraph will be complete.",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph is pretty simple to describe. It\u2019s a vampire shounen with action combining elements of horror, suspense, and odd humor. When, I mention odd, I don\u2019t mean it as unconventional. Hardly. Owari no Seraph (Seraph of the End) attempts to stylishly craft a show with vampires at war with humans. It wasn\u2019t always like this though because apparently, a virus many years ago wiped out a mass majority of humanity. The rulers of the world are now vampires as humanity desperately struggles for survival. At the center of it is an orphan named Yuichiro Hyakuya who hopes to reach freedom someday alongside hisfriend Mika. Sound a bit familiar? It may not be another Attack on Titan but Owari no Seraph surely follows a story of dark fantasy. Only the problem is, it\u2019s only as half as dark as it seems.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the creator of Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu, Owari no Seraph adapts a story based on the manga of the same name. It\u2019s important to note that the series follows the manga rather than the light novel. And just like the way the premise implies, freedom in the world of Owari no Seraph comes at a price.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode doesn\u2019t drop you in the middle of the story. Instead, it establishes a background tale, a way of telling events from the past. We learn quickly that vampires treat human like trash and apparently, some of them are allowed to live only because they have blood. It\u2019s a classic gimmick as vampires depends on it as a source of food. Nonetheless, the first episode shows how bloody (literally) it can be when humans tries to escape from their fate. Or rather, I can\u2019t really call it fate because Yuichiro manage to escape. The only problem is that the rest of the orphans perish as the price. Luckily, the series also has a group of vampire hunters (Moon Demon Company) and Yuchiro becomes acquainted with the group. Their goal? To exterminate the vampires and make their freedom a reality. \\n\\n\r\nSo essentially, this show pretty much sets up a standard war-like atmosphere between the two sides \u2013 humans and vampires. Yuichiro is the central protagonist although the show also introduces others that he meets while he trains to become stronger. The problem with Yuichiro is that he is a rather narrow minded individual when it comes to his goals. Apparently, his goal is to annihilate the vampires because like many other humans, they annihilated his family. His black-and-white view of the supernatural world brings him at odds with his superiors because he tends to even ignore orders at times so that he can get a bit of retribution. In essence, Yuichiro isn\u2019t exactly a good role model. However, I do have to emphasize that he is quite brave and often not to speak his mind. His kindness can also be seen at times when he is helping out others. Joining with him are Shinoa Hiragi, a girl with a rather sarcastic personality. Her relationship with Yuichiro and the others are usual casual although it can be seen that she greatly cares about them too. She also has a family member that she used to share a connection with although the show doesn\u2019t fully emphasize on this. On the contrary, there is Mitsuba who has a more serious attitude and often wants to do things herself. This puts an odd at times with her comrades like Yuichiro as they have conflicting ideologies. Luckily, Yuchiro does get along better with other characters such as Yoichi and has a rather peculiar friendship with Shiho. (The two are more like rivals most of the time). With such a diverse group of characters, the show tries to do its best to bring out Yuichiro\u2019s character. Sometimes it works, other times it doesn\u2019t. I say this because the show\u2019s weakness is the way the dialogues are delivered. It lightens the mood to a point where it\u2019s hard to take the show seriously at times. In a way, it\u2019s more like unconventional humor coming from the interactions of the characters. Yuichiro\u2019s also too brash at times to really see him as a reliable person. However, I do have to say that one of the show\u2019s stronger aspect is the relationship he has with Mika.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being separated in the present storyline, there\u2019s still a lot of reflection going back between Yuichiro and Mika. The story essentially shows that the two childhood friends are inseparable. With the way the first episode was presented, it also gives Yuichiro a stronger motivation to kill the vampires. What he doesn\u2019t know is that certain circumstances happened back in the past. But regardless, there\u2019s a strong form of brotherhood that can be seen indirectly throughout the season even though the two are not together on-scene most of the time. In retrospect, the show focuses on relationships with family and friends. This is sort of ironic as Yuichiro is an orphan so that means he has no true family (related by blood anyways). However, his new family comes from the people he works with such as the Moon Demon Company and the kids he encountered in the past. His friendship with Mika is one strongest bonds he has formed. At times, he even works well with his superior Guren despite him being a bit rebellious because of his nature. The show establishes these relationships as they are one of the core reasons for the characters to fight and survive.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the fighting in the show between the two sides seems to be one sided at times. The vampires are the dominant force. Powerful vampires such as Krul Tepes and Ferid Bathory really shows a difference in gap of power between the two races. They also despise humans and looks down on them like livestock. As evidenced in both the past and present, a key idea of this show is to show if and how humans can overcome these vampires. Unfortunately, the show holds back on characterization on these vampires. They are too stereotypical and really too straightforward with their goals. In fact, the goal they have is too narrow as well and despite having a compelling post-apocalyptic setting, there\u2019s little world building to go with the story. Luckily, the series does have its mechanics when it comes to the weapons and military. Basically, the show does two things: to show and tell. This comes from the weapons that the Japanese Imperial Demon Army uses known as the Cursed Gear. While it\u2019s still generic, I do have to give some praise to the creativity of these objects. All of them are categorized by a different type with unique prestige, shape, and powers. The way the show explains it is just enough for a viewer to understand while also showing (not just telling) the consequences of their usage. In general, creativity with its weapon arsenal is clever in the case of mechanics. Even the military of the Japanese Imperial Demon Army has a good set of mechanics behind it with different rankings, squads, and roles. \\n\\n\r\nAs one of several anime projects that Wit Studio undertakes in the year 2015, it\u2019s expected that they may maintain a strong degree of visual quality. Honestly though, it\u2019s rather mixed. Although some of the first few episodes of the series makes an impression with its artwork, others really seems it ran on low budget. I think what I refer to most are the character expressions as they look far too one dimensional. Despite showing a good portray of emotions, it\u2019s often hard to get viewers to think more about them. Also, there are static movements occasionally in the show and in one particular episode really suffered from body movements. On the plus side, background visual can be a spellbound sensation. The fantasy elements of the series especially with post-apocalyptic scenery is fantastically done. It makes it feel real that is also accompanied with dynamic camera work. The action scenes are also solid on most parts with intense movements, clever angle features, and a display of explosiveness. It\u2019s a blockbuster for any action fan who should feel satisfied. Character designs also has a style to them such as the Japanese Army\u2019s uniforms, the Cursed Gears, and even vampires. In particular, the cursed gears all have unique designs ranging from swords, scythes, bows, or even enhanced sniper rifles. Fan service is minimal although not entirely absent either such as the case of shower scenes. Then, there\u2019s the iconic blood scene throughout the show that seems to be a key emphasis. There is a seemingly longer screen time when blood and violence is shown. To put it simply, it tries to create an element of dark fantasy envisioned by what the creators want the audience to experience.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is one of the more standard parts of the show. Names such as Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, Nanatsu no Taizai, Aldnoah Zero) will instantly ring a bell and is easily recognized by their style. However, the show does suffer a bit as most of the soundtrack sounds similar. Unlike some the other popular works he is involved in, Owari no Seraph\u2019s OST doesn\u2019t create an excitement. It is on the right track most of the time but doesn\u2019t leave behind lasting impressions. In fact, I can\u2019t name one single OST in the show that I\u2019d want to search for again. On the other hand, the OP and ED theme song has a creative melody to it with a lot of foreshadowing. It puts creativity to the vampire themes with decent amount of symbolism and can be memorable. Finally, character voice mannerisms is more or less average. The only praise that I can give are perhaps for the vampires because of their personalities. You can easily see how the two traces contrast with their tone of speech. \\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph is a bit paltry when it comes to its dark atmosphere. The story obviously has a grim tone to it but can never really capture that objective. The improper timing of the humor holds this show back on many occasions. Fortunately, the series does establish its meaning well so understanding its intentions isn\u2019t so hard. The characters obviously has their goals that we see firsthand. One of the better executions of the series relies on relationships, something that it has done from the very beginning. With a tragic tone and premise, you can expect this series to be appeal for fans of drama as well. It\u2019s noticeable that this is the first cour season for the adaptation. Another cour of 12 episodes is scheduled to air in Fall 2015 so expect more vampires, cursed gears, and spills of blood.",

While it is true that both anime are about revenge-driven boys who want to kill vampires/Titans, have wickedly awesome weapons and gears, and test the boundaries of losing one's humanity, but other than that, there's nothing more.\r\nWhile SnK focuses on discovering the truth, OnS focuses on the importance of family and friendship. Tl;dr, both anime are unique in their own ways and they're both fun, badass, and interesting.  \r\nThe story (8/10):\r\nThe story isn't TOO original, but it does have its unique moments. In fact, I think that thestory's very entertaining and worth watching. Also, the anime's rather fast-paced. It's not one of those anime that linger on one story or place for, like, 3 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nRomance DOES brew as the story develops, so anyone who is interested in romance, fantasy, and action would be interested in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art (8/10): \\n\r\nThe art for both the manga and anime are beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters (8/10):\\n\r\n1) There is a wide variety of characters. There's that revenge-driven protagonist, the kind and innocent one, the playful but sadistic(?) vampire, the mysterious and funny female character, and so on. \\n\r\n2) The anime takes time to develop each and every character, instead of focusing on just the protagonists. \\n\r\n3) I just wish that the girls were a bit stronger.

            "content": "What do we have? Vampires, an army and a stubborn boy out for revenge. Nothing too special - you have a lot of those anime which are focused on revenge or have an idiot as their protagonist\r\nHowever, it is hard to combine these elements and make something enjoyable out of it since they're so common. If you're not careful, it becomes boring and you'll give the watcher the feeling of deja vu\r\nThis anime does a pretty good job at combining the aforementioned elements and making it enjoyable to watch (even with the idiotic protagonist)\r\nPlease note, however, this season was more of a prologue - wewill get a 2nd one - and for a prologue anime this is quite a good job. In this way it is similar to the 1st season of Tokyo Ghoul; important stuff happens during the show, but the real trigger is pulled at the end of the anime. Be prepared that this ends in a cliffhanger! \\n\r\nIt got me curious about what will happen next\\n\\n\r\n~ STORY ~\\n\\n\r\nOn what seems a normal day, a mysterious virus occurs and kills every infected human over the age of 13. At the same time vampires appear and take the remaining children, including the children of the Hyakuya orphanage under 'their wing'. To the great dislike of our protagonist Yuuichiro Hyakuya, the children are used as livestock for the vampires.\\n\r\nOne day, one of his siblings, Mikaela Hyakuya, convinces the orphans to escape from the vampires. Mikaela stole a map from a noble, which he's convinced will lead them to freedom. Unfortunately, this noble vampire, Ferid Bathory, was just fooling around with the children by letting Mikaela steal his map. Just before the children can make it to the outside world, Ferid kills the majority of the orphans, letting only Yuuichiro escape. \\n\\n\r\nThis event is basically what feeds Yuuichiro's hate for the vampires and his desire for revenge\\n\r\nAfter Yuuichiro's escape, he joins the army to pursue his goal.   \\n\\n\r\nI love the vampire genre, but it's really hard to find a good vampire anime/movie/book. There is a lot about these creatures, but the majority is just not worth watching (e.g. Fortune Arterial - seriously guys, that anime is boring)This one, however, I truly enjoyed watching. \\n\\n\r\nMy only problem with it was that it focused too much on the army. We see how Yuuichiro learns about both the vampire and human worlds, makes friends, gets a weapon, etc. \\n\r\nI myself am human, so I kinda have a pretty good idea about their feelings and struggles. I wish more time would've been dedicated to the vampires. Like what kind of classes are there besides the nobles, something about their lifestyle, etc. Unfortunately, those fascinating creatures don't get that much screen time if you compare it to that of the army.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~ ART ~    \\n\\n\r\nSimply beautiful; nice character design, nice action scenes, love the contrast between the vampire world and the human world\\n\\n\r\n~ SOUND ~\\n\\n\r\nThe ost fitted in the scenes, however, I cannot say that there's a song I'll listen on its own\\n\r\nNothing really stayed in my mind\\n\r\nBut the music did spice up the scenes, so that's enough for me to give it a 7\\n\\n\r\n~ CHARACTERS ~\\n\\n\r\nWell, there certainly are a few character that spice up the show and are worth mentioning  \\n\\n\r\nYuuichiro Hyakuya\\n\r\nAs I said before, Yuu is kinda an idiot. He doesn't really think before acting; if it helps him to achieve his goal, he'll do it without thinking about the problems that'll occur afterwards. He gets punished (e.g. suspended from the army) and punched a lot by his superior for acting without thinking, which makes Yuu want to prove himself even more. Yuu is short tempered and not really good at getting along with people (especially after the incident with Ferid)\\n\r\nTo be honest, Yuuichiro is nothing special - just your usual type of main character\\n\\n\r\nMikaela Hyakuya\\n\r\nMikaela on the other hand, is more interesting. As a boy, Mika was kind - hearted and always smiling. He always saw the bright side of everything, even living in the vampire world. Mika wanted for his dear family to be happy and took all the burdens upon himself. However, after his escape - plan failed Mika changed drastically. He became 'dead inside'. His only purpose for living is now saving Yuuichiro from the hands of 'those filthy humans'.\\n\\n\r\nShinoa Hiiragi\\n\r\nShinoa is appointed to supervise Yuu during his suspension from the army. Later on, she becomes his squad leader. \\n\r\nThis character is quite amusing, though she isn't my favourite. Shinoa doesn't really show emotion at the beginning of the anime. She's always there with a smile. Shinoa's manner of talking is a bit 'fake'; she says things that she doesn't mean and she says them in an exaggerated way that people hear she's being sarcastic. This is what I liked about her.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is quite the stereotype. Even though a lot of them spice up the show (like Ferid Bathory), they're not really worth mentioning here\\n\\n\r\n~ OVERALL ~\\n\\n\r\nthis is an enjoyable show and a good example of a great vampire anime. If you like dark anime, you should watch it",

            "content": "Some spoilers may exist.\r\nStory 6:\r\nIt seems to be one of the few typical shounen plots. World is destroyed, and, for some reason, children are the only ones that live (under 13). Protagonist conveniently manages to escape from his prison-like place. He's conveniently found by a strong organisation which then he manages to easily join because of innate protagonist buffs (he never actually does any training).\r\nArt 8:\r\nIt's actually pretty decent. The backdrops are nice and the character design is pretty decent. But for w/e reason, Hiiragi Shinoa just seems inconsistent with her quality despite being a main character. (ep5 10:03 - 10:06) She looks like she'slagging away.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7: \\n\r\nThe voice acting sounds really FKN forced. I'm a die-hard subber, but even so, the voice acting for pretty much everyone (except Guren and some side-characters) sound very forced and amateurish. There are occassion delays between characters talking and reacting to each other's speech which makes it seem forced and disingenuous. Yu sometimes yells with a suppressed kind of tone while Shinoa's speech sometimes does not match her expression.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the BGM and music. The OP is quite nice, I enjoyed both the sequence and the song. The ED is exceptional, it was very well done with the contrast between light and shadows and the song was very memorable. If I would rate the music alone, I'd give it an 8, the OP and ED were very good, but the BGM was unmemorable, unlike AoT, which was also composed by the same composer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3:\\n\r\nWhat I hate the most about this series. Yu is the typical brat that's yelling/rebelling while also failing in his studies yet amazingly has all the skills necessary to further the plot without any actual development (training). He thinks he's all amazing and actually manages to pull impossible/unlikely things off (defeating a demon bare knowledge of even what they are by basically saying 'no'). Essentially it's like watching a slapstick comedy without the comedy, and with the plot advancing just because it can.\\n\\n\r\nYoichi's existence is questionable. At one point he gets taken over by a demon and was considered a target to be executed. However, because Yuu decides to save him, he mentions the nonsense about being friends and stands still as Yoichi aims an arrow at him because 'faith'. But because plot armor > logic, Yoichi misses and is saved because of the magical power of 'friendship'. \\n\\n\r\nKimizuki's existence is questionable as well, since he doesn't really contribute to the character development of anyone nor does he contribute to the story (for now). But at the very least, his survival is at least acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing the first arc, Guren's character has become a bit more interesting, since he's not longer just the 'mentor' kind of guy. Now we see a darker side and possibly a desperate side. He's probably the strongest character out of all of them, so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are kind of there just to yell/harass Yuu.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7:\\n\r\nThe music was great, the art was decent (most of the time), but what really put this whole series down were the characters. Hell, this series probably would've been a lot more interesting if we were watching it from Guren's point of view.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6:\\n\r\nIt's not unwatchable thanks to the more interesting main characters (Guren, Mikaela). The OP/ED is so good that I never end up skipping them.\\n",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph is a perfect example of a misrepresentation of your survival-type and an abandoned scenario with a post-apocalyptic setting anime TV show. It has several inclusives from its similar brethren of the same genre. And quite sadly, the actual story it offers isn't a fascinating one either.\r\nAdding the fictional Vampire attribute to something fictional itself is something that is very common these days. Now add that as the characteristic that plays the role of an antagonist who is trying to take over the world from humans in an era where a mysterious virus is threatening to wipe out the human population ages abovethirteen, and what you get is Owari no Seraph in a nutshell. Yep, that is pretty much what this show has to offer as we follow the along the footsteps of Hyakuya Yuuichiro, the protagonist of the show who is an underage kid trying to escape from the Vampires but to no avail as he is soon captured and confined into a realm which is ruled completely by the Vampires themselves and treated as a mere live-stock among several other human kids. The starting of the show focuses on how Yu(What he's called as in most of the show) along with a few of his friends and his equivalent and best friend, Mikaela. \\n\\n\r\nYu is the focus point of this show and plays out as the main character as he successfully frees himself from Vampires and joins up the \"Moon Demon Company\" - a human organization trying to regain control of the world as it is and fight against the Vampires. Yu is depicted as a boy with quite a short temper and is easily enraged. This is quite evident as he repeatedly shows his hatred and aggression against the Vampires and tells how he'll annihilate them all and get revenge for what they have done for his family and friends. Despite this, Yu also shows compassion towards his family and seems to care a lot for them in order to never lose them again. This also helps him make new friends from the academy where aspiring students study and train hard to become a part of the Moon Demon Company and fight against the enemy. Shinoa Hiragi is one such character who's the sergeant and a squad leader of the Moon Demon Company and is sent to watch over his progresses and always follows him around.\\n\\n\r\nShinoa is a short pink-haired girl who is portrayed as quite a self-possessed character. She also likes making sarcastic remarks over Yu and is one of the better, enjoyable characters of the show. Yoichi is the first friend Yu gets in the academy and he is quite a frail and fragile boy. He also joins Shinoa and Yu as one of the Vampire Extermination Unit members under the Moon Demon Company, along with Kimizuki, quite a strong-willed and an eccentric character quite the polar opposite of Yu and Mitsuba, a yellow-haired girl who is a little more experienced than the others in the group and the one who is revealed later as the show progresses. Ichinose Guren is the head and the Lieutenant Colonel of the Moon Demon Company and the one who offers the five students a membership to join the Vampire Extermination Unit. He's also the one who rescues Yu after he escapes from the Vampires, and the one who sends Shinoa to watch over Yu. Next is Mikaela Hyakuya, who is probably one of the important characters in the show but at the same time very little's known about him compared to Yu. He's the childhood friend of Yu as they spend their time together even after getting captured by the enemy. Mikaela is quite a cool-headed boy and opposite to that of Yu. He also shows a lot of compassion towards Yu and his friends, and is shown to offer his blood to the Vampire leader in secret, in order to get him and his friends better meal to eat. \\n\\n\r\nNow this may be on the spoiler side but it's inevitable as I can provide very little information about Mikaela without it. \\n\r\nAnyway, he gets killed towards the end of the first episode by Ferid, the leader of the Vampires while he tries with his friends to escape the place into the world outside. Yu is the only survivor who escapes after that but in the coming episodes it is revealed that Mika is still alive thanks to the blood of the Queen, Krul Tepes. He then later confronts Yu in the battlefield and still shows his compassion towards him despite being transformed into a vampire. He even refused to drink the blood from the humans, however he learns that the humans are manipulating Yu to release the demon inside him and to save him is the sole reason Mikaela continues living. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the characters are anything too special but at the same time they aren't generic or boring either. Each of the person has its own characteristics and its depicted pretty well in this show which is a plus point for this show. Another plus point is without a doubt the sound aspect of Owari no Seraph. Both the opening and ending theme performed by the renowned Sawano Hiroyuki himself is a peculiarity of this show. Amalgamated with good voice acting which perfectly synchronizes and depicts the certain character, Owari no Seraph somehow manages to be a fun show. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Owari no Seraph still is nothing extraordinary. Even if it's still just the first cour of the show though and the mysteries of the Seraph of the End is yet to be revealed, Owari no Seraph falls flat with what it displays in twelve episodes which is too little. There are also quite a lot of inconsistencies in the pacing leading up to the battle which makes me wonder if the twelve episode slot fot the second season is maybe a little too less. Nevertheless, Owari no Seraph is a fun watch with some cool characters and great soundtracks. And even if that fails to please you, I'll just say simply watch it for Shinoa. \\n",

            "content": "Before I go into the review, I would like to say something. Despite all the bad reviews claiming that this anime is a cliche, IT IS NOT! This show is great.\r\nThe Story: 8\r\nLikely followed by age-old horrors thought only to be myth, vampires emerged from the dark and took control, after the world had met it's end in 2012 by a man-made virus, exterminating mankind leaving only children under the age of thirteen untouched. This is the story of a 12-years old Y\u016bichir\u014d and his family from Hyakuya Orphanage who live under the protection of the vampires in exchange for donating their blood. Living likea livestock Y\u016bichir\u014d and his fellow friend Mikaela plotted to escape the vampire's rule, which ends in a terrible tragedy. Four years later, Y\u016bichir\u014d dedicates his life to destroy vampires and seek revenge against them for murdering his \"family\".\\n\r\nThis is a story about revenge, friendship and sacrifice which you don't cross everyday.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: 7\\n\r\nThe character design was great and the colors were perfect, there's not much to say about the art except the animation was a bit lacking, specially the movement parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: 7\\n\r\nThey were somewhat typical, the protagonist is a stubborn guy yet a person with a very good heart, who loves and cares about his friends.\\n\r\nTwo small girls using big weapons and very strong, one of them is the typical blond two tailed tsundere. And other two male characters who make the Moon Demon battalion.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment: 9\\n\r\nPersonally I enjoyed it so much, a story about revenge preceded  by heart breaking tragedy, and the plot was perfect in so many ways, but mostly it gave me a true sense of intensity and peril. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, even though the animation isn't the best and the characters personalities are somewhat typical, still this anime has so many good points that I'm sure if you give it a try you will love it. \\n\\n",

Amazing animation, AMAZING SOUNDTRACK (so much so that right from episode 1 I HAD to find the soundtrack music), And the story is very well done. I was captured from the first episode. By the end of episode 1 I was crying like a baby, and I never really get that emotionally drawn into an anime. Even with the tragedies and deaths of Attack on Titan I wasn't really feeling the emotion of the events. This anime builds up suspense well. The characters are verylikable and easy to get attached to. There are NO annoying characters! There's usually always a very annoying female character in animes who you hate are want to disappear but not in this. Every episode is action packed and suspenseful. No filler episodes. My only complaint is that I wish it were longer. Al though there are similarities between this animes plot and Attack on Titan, I find this anime to be much better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 10/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph was definitely one of the most hyped up anime this season, but it does have a reason to be like that. This is my own opinion, but I found this series very fun and exciting.\r\n[Story - 7]\r\nNow I admit the idea isn't... Creative. Boy seeking revenge for his family against vampires, sounds similar to Shingeki no Kyojin, no?(except it's titans) Hey, what can you do. As long as it's still enjoyable it's not that horrible. The thing that made this anime enjoyable was the anticipation of how things will unfold in the end. Will it go horribly or smoothly? That's the reasonmany enjoyed this series.\\n\\n\r\n[Art - 8]\\n\r\nThe art wasn't extravagant, but I believe it didn't need to be anything special. It was smooth and pleasing to the eye. Not much to say there.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound - 9]\\n\r\nNow the opening was something I enjoyed A LOT. The opening itself gave the anime a huge hype, the song just makes you all pumped up and want to sing along!(Also can we just talk about the freaking Universal logo thing at the beginning of each episode?) Now for the rest of the anime, I believe, that the sound played quite a large role. It got you pumped up when something was about to happen and also made you tear up at times because of something horrible happening. This is what music in anime is supposed to do, pull on your heart strings. And so, I myself think that the sound in Owari no Seraph did indeed have that. Of course it wasn't so good as to give a 10, that's reserved for Clannad.\\n\\n\r\n[Character - 9]\\n\r\nI loved the characters in this. They were all unique in their own way and I can't say I hated any of them (Except maybe Shinoa because gurl, know when to stop). They all had their views and I'm glad we got decent backstory on at least Yuu's friends. I'll expect to find out more from Guren next season because he's the one I'm interested in the most, and maybe we'll even get some backstory from the other generals as well. \\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment - 10]\\n\r\nNow I, for one, found this anime extremely enjoyable. Sure it's not perfect, it has it's flaws but those flaws didn't affect the enjoyment, which is good. Every week I was pumped up to watch the new episode and see what happens next, it made me cry and also happy and too excited than I should have been lol. Anticipation for the next episode is already a sign that the anime is going to be good.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall - 9]\\n\r\nNow I would definitely suggest someone to watch this anime. If you like shounen/vampire anime then this definitely is for you. For me the first episode already got me, but if the first episode isn't convincing then watch the first three. The first three should be enough for you to decide whether to continue watching it or not.",

            "content": "Okay. I'll just say it. My favorite thing in Owari no Seraph was Shinoa. She was what kept me watching this show.\r\nFor the sake of easy reading, I'll try to make things simple:\r\nStory - Post-apocalyptic setting, vampires vs. humans, a story of human resistance against more powerful vampires.\r\nArt - Okay, watchable. The animation was generally fine, but still not top-notch.\r\nSound  - Sound? What sound? Nothing too outstanding here. Just normal sounds and music. It neither bothered nor impressed me.\r\nCharacter - We have the MC+kids using some demonic weapons to fight vampires. There are some character bonding and developing moments, but not enough. One canstill feel difficult trying to concentrate getting into the relationships of the MC+others.\\n\r\nWe still have another cour coming in the future, so the developments are not finished, but I still feel there are too many secrets in the show that prevent viewers to fully sympathize with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne good point here is Shinoa, my favorite character in the show. She's cute, cheeky, she's got nice purple hair, half-shut eyes, quirky personality. With the MC being quite a generic character, I feel that Shinoa is the the main personality that drives the show. She is cheeky and clever, and is real fun to watch her interact with others, usually outwitting them. Shinoa is also serious when needed (she's the leader of her unit after all), and funny just when the audience is thirsty for something refreshing when watching a drawn-out episode.\\n\r\nMoreover, Hayami Saori's acting here was something new for me when compared to her previous voices. It wasn't her usual dead-pan, serious character, but something more subtly and condescendingly bouncy and cheerful. Anyways, it was quite refreshing to the ear, and was a treat to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Okay. I don't know whether I completely enjoyed watching this. However, I enjoyed it to an extent - to the extent where I felt that this was a show I could watch without being too tense about the general story and flow of things.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Yep. Quite average so far. I think you can watch this in a rather relaxed manner. This show was nothing too creative to begin with, and everything is straight forward so far. Therefore, if you have some spare time, I think you should go watch this before the second cour comes out --- or just watch for Shinoa's sake.....\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I don't think it is fair to mark the show with a permanent grade, because it is technically not finished yet. However, for me, a good show. whether or not it has a second cour coming soon, always has good character+story developments and closure. On these aspects, I believe Owari no Seraph's first cour ended without having fulfilling them.",

It has an appeal to both male and female audiences: male-shounen and action, female- vampires, a hint of yaoi. It is most like 07 Ghost in that the two main malecharacters would easily, without hesitation, give up their lives for each other, and have a bond that is deeper than just a superficial friendship, and perhaps that is why I liked it so much. If you want dynamic characters that grow throughout the series, plot twists, and a whole bunch of action, then I would definitely recommend this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason that it only earns a  9 is that its soundtrack is not dynamic. Of course, it got me to cry and ache during the sad portions, which is superb, but sometimes, the soundtrack was a little bit off, especially in scenes where it wasn't exactly an intense scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were perfect and well selected. I applaud them for all of the screaming scenes. Especially for Yu-san.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the pacing was fantastic, and it more than satisfied my cravings.\\n\\n\r\nPlease release the next series before it's too late and I'm tempted to just freaking read the manga!",

The issue with this show is however that it has a terrible setting filled with bad cliches and this somehow is then scrambled into a pile of vomit that is then tossed together and presented as a story.\\n\r\nAn appropriate comparison would be a stuck toilet that is then filled up with faeces, topped up with an umbrella and a huge slice of genetically modified lemon that would be large enough to decorate this sort of presentation.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is alright and sound ok too, however the plot is deserving of a negative rating and when that important feature doesn't come to hand then something has to give, the rest of the ratings will have to suffer in order to adjust the score to show it more accurately.\\n\\n\r\nI am not exaggerating when i am saying this is so bad that it should be banned.

None the less, I finished it and I am so gladthat I did.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot suddenly bloomed and there were more questions arising inside me now. This was just the kind of feeling I needed: curiosity. Suddenly the anime itself seemed unique with the vampire, demons vibe more prominent and less of the humanity on brink of extinction.\\n\\n\r\nTry it, I dare you. If you are a girl you might just fall in love with all the characters but that doesn't stop the vampire loving fanboys too! It breaks from conventional topics after a while and complete itself in a unique identifiable way.\\n",

            "content": "If you have seen Attack on Titan, there is no reason to watch this.  Within 10 seconds of the start of the show the apocalypse happens and vampires come to gather the survivors who are only children.  Our main character begins as an almost copy paste of Eren Jaeger, who is an orphan who is being held captive in a vampire camp.  The only thing he wants to do is get his orphan family out of there and kill all of the vampires.  The story is a pretty generic and lacking in any sort of originality, it is like a Frankenstein'sMonster of Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online and some other stupidly popular show that is pretty generic.  The art is the hardest part to rate because the only thing that really ever looks nice are the backgrounds because they are painted and just sit there as a jpeg.  The animation isn't noteworthy, just average.  The music is nothing to write home about, has your classic \"hardly noticeable background music\", your \"we are fighting now\", and \"attempted philosophical score for our 10 minutes of exposition\".  The characters are all bland and generic other than one.  Your main character is a brooding teenager who lost something dear to him, your cowardly and timid barely even classified as a boy, your stuck up generic rival to the MC who will end up his friend, your tsundere who thinks she knows everything when she actually knows nothing, then the one good character who is the playful, joking person that actually has some power.  If you were hoping for character development, you will not find any here.  There is very little enjoyment that can be found in this show.",

            "content": "The definition of average, Owari no Serpah tosses together shounen tropes in a rather predictable but still worth watching anime. \r\nNote: I have not read the manga but have heard various complaints about the anime from those who have. I\u2019d love to hear any thoughts from manga fans! \r\nThis review is (relatively) spoiler free! :D \r\nCharacters: 5/10\r\nWith the exception of Mikaela and (somewhat) Shinoa, the characters scream standard. The cast is not fantastic or horrible, just typical. Many shounen start with stock characters that slowly grow into something more, but Owari no Seraph\u2019s first season ended before that happened. Twelve episodes did not give therather large cast time to develop unique personalities.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you love shounen characters, you\u2019ll love these guys. I, personally, found them difficult to connect with, slightly irritating, and predictable. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I loved one character enough to give the show 6/10 instead of 5/10 and enjoyed two other characters.\\n\\n\r\n(here comes the slight spoiler territory, though nothing specific) \\n\\n\r\nI watched the anime because of Mikaela Hyakuya or \u201cMika\u201d. To me, Mika is a \u201csquare peg in a round hole\u201d. Mika might have become a Orihime Inoue, Allen Walker, or Oz Vessallius, a character who loathes to kill, determinedly cares for everyone, will defend their loved ones (and sometimes strangers or even enemies) till death, and desires to see the best in everyone. Sadly for Mika but interestingly for viewers, he is never afforded the luxury of such high ideals, though I'm he wishes he did (on a side note, I adore Oz, Orihime, and Allen). Instead, Mika finds himself in a role typically given to females\u2014essentially, he \u201cwhores\u201d his blood out to help feed his family\u2014and later to anti-heroes\u2014he fights on the wrong side but with a good reason and a damaged past. Thus, Mika is put in situations I haven\u2019t seen too often for his base personality type, which makes him the most unique aspect of the show. \\n\\n\r\nShinoa and Guren also interest me. Shinoa falls into some of the stereotypical tropes of a shounen\u2019s female lead, but I found her to be the anime\u2019s second most interesting character. Guren has potential as well. At first, he comes across as nothing more than a lazy bully, but, as the story keeps going, his character does some interesting things that make me curious to see more.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain\u2014very shounen. The story is so incredibly typical I predicted everything that happened between episodes 2-9 without a hitch, and nothing in the others surprised me. While I am fairly savvy at \u201cseeing things coming\u201d, it was easy to see where this formulaic anime would go.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime spends at least half its episodes on \u201ctraining\u201d, which are always highly predictable. The rest are spent on backstory (one episode), wrap up (yes, this twelve episode anime dedicated an entire episode to wrap up), and about four-ish episodes follow a battle, which happens without much build up. Both sides just decide, \u201cYes, we shall battle here because!\u201d. The \u201creason\u201d felt more like a plot-forced excuse to me. \\n\\n\r\nI feel the story starts to gain momentum at the tail end of this battle. The plot finally seems to find a direction besides \u201ctraining to get revenge\u201d. Personally, I would\u2019ve started the story at episode eleven. Because of this (also because of Mika), I will watch season two. I may end up recommending that people watch episode one and eleven (maybe two and ten too) and then jump to season two. The rest is so typical you don\u2019t really need it. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the plot has a whole is not well explained. I have no real idea about the parameters of the world, why the vampire decided to take over it, why Mika and Yuu are special, and so on. I hope season two will answer some of these questions. \\n\\n\r\nThe show falls into the potholes of many shounen. For instance, our vengeful protagonist consistently makes poor choices that the plot ends up bending over backwards and defying logic to reward him for. Charging into the battle and throwing plans into the wind somehow ends up being the right choice. He also has random powers, and all the girls fall in love with him. \\n\\n\r\nLast problem: I do not find the vampires scary. Characters keep mentioning how powerful their bloodsucking opponents are, and yet newbies fresh on the field have no problem killing them with each swing of their various weapons. I understand it has something to do with the class of weaponry, but it\u2019s poorly explained. I don\u2019t really care that the vampires are easy to kill, but every time a character mentions how dangerous they are, I just laughed.  \\n\\n\r\nArt (and cinematography in general): 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFairly well done, the weaponry animation is especially interesting and visually appealing.The fighting is fast and exciting too. \\n\\n\r\n(angles)\\n\\n\r\nCould have been better. Really, the choice of when to cut from a scene and jump to another character\u2019s point of view often jarred me. The transitions seemed abrupt and threw me out of the story for a moment. \\n\\n\r\n(intro/outro)\\n\\n\r\nThe intro doesn\u2019t really tell much of a story, but it fits the tone well and does capture the anime\u2019s tone. The outro is a series of well-drawn pictures, a wise choice considering how many characters there are. \\n\\n\r\nFemale Representation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe females are everything you expect in a standard shounen. The girls have a slightly moe appeal and run around battling in short skirts and falling for the male lead. I will never understand why fighting in a skirt is a good decision, but I do understand that some males enjoy watching that and that this show is, in fact, targeted towards males. I, however, just find it amusing and illogical. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, both of the females are touted as amazing warriors and are in charge of three males, but, per usual, the males prove to be \u201cnaturals\u201d and surpass the girls' combat level during the first battle and often rescue their supposed superiors. \\n\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t really offended or impressed. Like many things about this anime, it was average (hence the five). \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWithout Mika, I would give this anime a 5/10. It\u2019s a highly normal anime that will bore people sick of shounen but entertain those who love shounen or just want to kickback and watch a typical anime. Only 12 episodes long, it\u2019s not much of an investment. I plan to watch the next season and believe it can easily surpass the first. \\n\\n\r\nNow, to address the Attack on Titan accusations . . .\\n\\n\r\nI have read/heard several times that Owari no Seraph is \u201cripping off\u201d AoT. I disagree. AoT likes to use shounen tropes to set up the audiences\u2019 expectations so it can smash them. And calling Owari no Seraph similar to AoT simply because both feature vengeful protagonists who live in a dystopian world where humanity is at the bottom of the food chain sounds as silly to me as calling every story that has a magic school a rip off of Harry Potter. Of course, I haven\u2019t read the manga. So it is possible Owari no Seraph pulls more from AoT than I currently know from just watching season one of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI personally feel like Owari no Seraph\u2019s mangaka was a big fan of Ao No Exorcist. The art styles are highly similar (especially the clothing styles, just look at Mephisto\u2019s outfit). Both feature a close brother relationship (Rin and Yukio and Mika and Yuu). Shiemi and Yuuichirou share similar personalities. Shihou acts like Bon but looks like Shima. And then Mito looks like Shura. Both worlds feature many types of supernatural forces as well. But I won\u2019t hold that against Owari no Seraph, as I enjoy Ao no Exorcist and don\u2019t mind things borrowing ideas from it. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, if I failed to cover something you're curious or worried about, let me know! I'd be happy to answer them for you! \\n",

I thoroughly enjoyed it and was excited to see the next episode weekly. Yes the story line has been done before, but it was done RIGHT. I have seen plenty of anime, and this one is the first vampire anime I actually enjoyed.\r\nThere is a character for each persons taste (Mine is Shinoa) and it's easy to fall in love with certain characters.\r\nThe animation was fantastic! I enjoyed watching the fight scenes asit was fluid and easy to watch. I loved the art style as well, very grim and dark just like a real apocalypse would be.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I noticed that bugged me was the sound, sometimes it had moments where it could have had sound effects such as the odd footstep or shirt ruffle. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had the chance to see it again with new eyes (and it had finished airing) I would have watched it in one night.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading... I know it wasn't long but hey! I am sure most people want to find something to watch quickly rather then read a massive review just to decide yes or no >.",

            "content": "Alright, this is one of the most popular shows last season so I found it reasonable for it to serve as my first review for the season.\r\nStory 2/10:\r\nThe story is surprisingly bad. Episode one was almost perfectly copied from popular WIT series Attack on Titan. The premise is pretty generic. Main character is trapped and enslaved in a city by vampires along with many other kids. He ends up the sole survivor as he and friends attempt to escape from the city of Vampires. He then vows to get his revenge. Oh boy. He joins the military force to combat the vampires and for someodd reason the MC goes through school while receiving his training. His school life was irrelevant other than for making friends so the school setting was unnecessary as he could've made friends anywhere else. The setting is extremely unnatural considering the situation\\n\\n\r\nThe story continues to progress predictably while MC meets a typical cast of characters which I'll get into. But the absolute worst thing about the series is the dialogue. It's beyond generic and incredibly predictable. From \"I'll kill all the vampires\" to \"I'll make sure no one dies lol\". Just as no one seems to think before they spout whatever trash they want to say, they author doesn't seem give much thought to what dialogue can convey. It's as if he tried to take every cool sounding line from previously anime and manga and apply them where possible only to receive the opposite effect of what he hoped.\\n\\n\r\nThe weapons systems is retarded. They are controlled by demons and you must make a contract with a demon using some arbitrary and nonsensical show of \"willpower\", Which will lead to yet again some more predictable scenes. The fights are strangely favorable to MC and his party even though the power level between humans and Vampires is revealed to be huge. The upper level Vampires never go all out for whatever reason and constantly miss chances to kill, in contrast to episode one where the kids are cut apart in seconds. The thing I realized about this series is there is nothing unique about it. There is nothing that make it stand out and be recognized as \"that anime\". This isn't simply in comparison to AOT, but many good or at least decent anime. This goes back to the blandness of the dialogue, and the blandness of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2/10:\\n\r\nNot much to say here. The character are all dull as I said. The MC is a typical angry little kid who wish to exterminate the vampires. He spouts the expected edgy lines all throughout the first few episode thinking he doesn't need friends to kill, he wants to hurry up and kill, etc. He meets a typical shy kid who seems completely useless but can actually be somewhat helpful, and a typical rival character who is an ass but is actually nice on the inside. Shinoa was actually decent and entertaining as well. Maybe that's why I remember her name along with just a few others. Her smug playfulness drew an interesting contrast with her serious attitude on the field. But that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nStrangely enough with all the emphasis on teamwork you'd think there'd be more tactics in fights but I guess not. The vampires didn't appear enough to do anything other than say the usual antagonistic lines and how things seemed interesting. MCs friend survives and turns into a Vamp, no surprise here. The show does a terrible job drawing sympathy for the viewer for either side, though it clearly aims to do so with MC's friend being turned while MC fights the vampires and a few other reasons.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10:\\n\r\nThe character designs are good but the animation can be inconsistent with one hilarious episode standing out in terms of poor quality. The water color-esque background are unique and works well for indoor scenes, but outdoors draws an huge contrast with the 2D character figures which can be annoying. Fight scenes were done decently at best, as seems WIT is saving the shekels for AOT.\\n\\n\r\nMusic 6/10:\\n\r\nMany people take the opportunity to shamelessly cream themselves when Hiroyuki Sawano is revealed to be handling the music composition for an anime. This is certainly not on the level of AOT or Kill la Kill and it's not anything special. It's has some good moments but nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment 5/10\\n\r\nEven with all I mentioned the series managed to remain entertaining enough for me to at least complete it. I may or may not be watching season 2, but I don't feel like I've completely wasted my time somehow. Maybe I still retain hope for the show to get better and haven't been completely let down (considering my expectations were pretty low in the first place)\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10:\\n\r\nIf you like something generic yet can kill time without causing you to die of boredom, this may be the show for you.",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph, or Seraph of the End, is the quintessential example of a \"generic\" anime title. It's a show you've undoubtedly seen many times before and one you'll continue to encounter way after its time in the limelight is up. It's a throw-away title that'll be replaced by the next factory-assembled one to take its place. It's the store brand cereal at anime's supermarket; bland, cheap, packaged in a box with little creative effort, always at the bottom shelf, and does very little to distinguish itself from its competitors. At worse, it's a forgettable hodge-podge of clich\u00e9s and overused tropes, and at best, it'sa cheap knock-off of a much superior product. It's an entry level show in every regard and depending on how accustomed you've grown to these formulaic setups will determine how much you like/tolerate it. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Owari no Seraph is so standard-fare that if someone were to tweak it with a few name and setting changes, they will be able to use the same synopsis to describe any other show with a familiar setup. Use the template below and see how many bottom-of-the-barrel shows you an insert:\\n\r\n.......................................................................................................................... \\n\r\nOne day humanity is suddenly attacked by a group of [insert name of threat here] and was brought to the brink of annihilation. [insert amount of years] later, leftovers of this time in mankind's history attempts to scrape together what's left to form a new society out of the event that felt like an act of divine punishment. And with the discovery of [insert name of weapons or power here], they were able to fight back. We follow our protagonist [insert name here] as he and his comrades use [insert name of weapon or power] to fight the [insert name of threat here] and reclaim humanity in this post-apocalyptic world. And in the process of doing so, they slowly discover the mystery of their sudden appearance that might be closer to home than what was intially thought. \\n\r\n..........................................................................................................................\\n\\n\r\nTo say that there's little to talk about when discussing Owari's story would be an understatement. Everything I can say here can apply to any other cheaply patched-together narrative. Instead, I'll discuss if the execution of this setup was done right nor not. Despite harping on its overused premise, it can still be done well if executed and presented with some tact... and to the surprise of no one, Owari didn't even manage to do that. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is supposed to document the power struggle between humanity and vampires, with our protagonist and his friends being in the centerfold of all the events taking place. You'd think with such a setup that we'd at least get an action-filled romp to keep us entertained but sadly, all we got were less than 2-episodes worth of skirmishes. That's right, a show that boasts \"action\" as its primary genre couldn't even fulfill that simple quota. That's like ordering a Porterhouse steak and receiving a White Castle slider instead. To add insult to injury, the pacing for Owari was painfully slow, despite what the erratic time-skip-filled 1st episode would have you believe. Plot points that would normally be wrapped up in 10-15 minutes with proper pacing are now extended to 2-3 episodes. This made some events that barely held any plot relevance to adopt the type of pacing akin to long-running battle shounens. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as if that wasn't enough to seal its fate, the story of Owari is also plagued with plot conveniences happening in rapid succession:\\n\\n\r\nA virus wipes out humanity but \"conveniently\" doesn't kill anyone 13 and below. Enslaved kids attempt a big escape from their vampire capturers and our protagonist is \"conveniently\" the only one to get away, where he \"conveniently\" meets a resistance force that was \"conveniently\" waiting right outside the escapee's exit. Humanity has \"conveniently\" discovered a way to infuse demon's energy into weapons to fight against the vampires with the scriptwriters' explanation being \"just because.\" And since shounen protagonists are always special snowflakes, he \"conveniently\" mastered this infusion where many others have been known to fail. And no, he never practiced, because God knows he's the special snowflake. And the rest of the story adheres to this painfully forced path from beginning to end. There isn't an episode that goes by where you're not thinking \"well that sure was convenient.\" The screenplay is plagued with the artifice of fatalistic storytelling while pretending that aspect to its writing doesn't exist. \"You can't have your cake and eat it too\" perfectly encapsulates the issue on display.\\n\r\nHaven't done a lick of training but need a power boost? Well, how about this \"conveniently\" placed power-boost pill that was never foreshadowed or properly introduced beforehand. Stuck in a dire situation where all your friends are in trouble? Well, how about a \"conveniently\" timed supernatural powerup using the trite \"dark side\" shounen cliche.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again, a formulaic setup isn't inherently a bad thing if done with finesse but this show just doesn't demonstrate any concern for decent storytelling whatsoever. It's a show that would rather abuse every literary device in the book if it'll get it the results it wants rather than achieving the same end-result through careful consideration. Owari is sloppy writing 101.\\n\\n\r\nAn area that demonstrated some effort, however, was the art and animation. By itself, the art and animation were fine but when brought together, they mixed as seamlessly as oil and water. The 2D character designs in contrast to the watercolor/oil-pastel inspired backgrounds felt very out of place. This was made apparent in open environments where the individual scenes showed no proper separation between its foreground and background. There's no dimension or depth in the background, which result in the characters moving awkwardly across the landscape. It's like watching them play things out on a green screen, which is made all the more amusing given that it's animated and not live-action. \\n\\n\r\nWhile they didn't mesh well together, the creators still deserve credit for at least attempting to make it different, as the backgrounds did look quite nice at times, with a nice range of color choices and purposeful brush stroke-like textures. The character designs were all fine as well, being distinct enough to tell apart from other series. However, I am disappointed that they never had any well-choreographed fights, especially considering the limited amount of physical encounters they chose to have, to begin with. As a whole, the art and animation were passable, it wasn't the best but it did demonstrate some creative decisions in its visual output. At worst, a bit off model and at best, a serviceable piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nIf Owari had any saving graces it'll be the opening theme that came with it. It was a toe-tappingly infectious tune with well-timed visuals that I found myself playing on repeat. A catchy pop ballad that hit just the right notes and visual presentation that kept it in tempo. Surprisingly enough, the soundtrack had some restraint to it, which is uncommon for Hiroyuki Sawano, especially when taking into consideration his previous work on Attack on Giant Naked People and Kill La Wincest. While it still had his signature use of orchestric soundbites and digital glitch-pop buildup, it was often intertwined with shyer melodic tunes. It was refreshing if only unexpected for what Sawano is known for. \\n\r\nThe voice acting was all fine, with the standout being Takahiro Sakurai's performance for the vampire antagonist, Ferid Bathory. He did a good job giving him a playful yet sinister tone, which really helps to sell how much of a baddie he was. But enough appraisal, time to address the biggest crux of Owari, and that were the characters. \\n\\n\r\nLike the underbaked story, the characters suffered from an equal amount of problems. On top of being indistinguishable from your garden variety shounen lineup, they were also all grossly underdeveloped. Our protagonist, Yuu Hyakuya, is yet another hot-blooded teen who's on a quest for revenge. His one-track mindset is only topped by his regurgitated \"I will defeat them all!\", \"I don't need friends!\" mantras that he seems to want to yell out every 10-minutes. What's disheartening about the protagonist is that if given the proper time, he could have actually received decent characterization. There were several opportunities that could have allowed for this to occur but they were never taken advantage of. If you want the audience to get invested in a conflict, there needs to be proper time given to let the events unfold. If something life-altering happens to our protagonist that would cause a metamorphosis upon conquering that mental dilemma, it would benefit the story to let the audience see that play out. But instead of giving the proper time to allow this to happen, they simply time skipped pass this rough stage altogether. So not only was the story written with a sense of artificiality, but even the little decency it could have attained through demonstrating the character's growth was completely disregarded.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast were all forgettable nobodies you could find in other series. There was the pussy sidekick, the friendemy rival, the tsundere, and Douchbag teacher-sama, and the list goes on and on. Possibly the only character that had a decent personality was Shinoa Hiiragi, one of our protagonist's comrades. Her snarky, playful attitude made her interaction with the others fun to watch, but like the others, she remained underdeveloped and lacked any proper characterization outside of the already playful nature that she possessed. Another key character brought up was Yuu's childhood friend, Mikaela, but his involvement comes with spoilers so I'll leave it at that. The vampire antagonists were all one-dimensional baddies and none of them really mattered in the end. The only one that really got focus was Ferid Bathory, due to his involvement with our protagonist's life-altering incident. He's cartoonishly sinister and takes lives in a carefree manner, and that's about the extent of him as a character. \\n\\n\r\nAnd after running through everything that Owari no Seraph had to offer, the final verdict can't surmount to anything other than generic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis title is a knock-off brand shounen in every way possible. While I wasn't really bothered watching it, I certainly wasn't impressed either. The setup was predictable and the cliched moments just came in by the truckload. It was a time-passer, but not a good one at that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a newcomer to anime then Owari could, at best, serve as a gateway title to help you get a little insight into the medium's common practices. But if you've been a part of the anime community for a decent amount of time and have grown tired of these formulaic setups, then I suggest skipping this one as it does nothing but follow a set checklist like its life depended on it.",

            "content": "So the first cour of Owari no Seraph has ended, and I can say with clear confidence that this show, is without a doubt, an utter piece of generic troupes amalgamated and fused together into one entity. Was it amazing? No, not even close. And was it horrible? No, it hasn't reached that low of a tier yet, fortunately.\r\nThe story in a nutshell involves kids, and adults stuck in a post-apocalyptic setting with two sides, the vampires and the humans. So what happened? Honestly, nothing much. The story itself progresses at the speed of a snail for the majority of the series and drags outtoo much, in which I personally hope the second cour will be faster paced and utilise suspense more intelligently for the benefit of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode was without a doubt, somewhat suspenseful and does a semi-good job. However, the opening song does a great job to counter this semi-well done job and reveal that Mika is indeed alive by showing his grown up self which would have been much better if it were to be revealed unexpectedly later on in order to create some sense of suspense. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, in this \"post-apocalyptic\" setting, the second episode starts off with the orthodox and conventional, overused school setting which already makes it hard to take the \"post-apocalyptic world\" seriously, and minimising any genuine sense of danger and threat that left off with the premiere episode. Fortunately, it then derives off this school setting but the ambiance still does not skyrocket in terms of suspence, tension or intensity as the main cast is composed by a group of children, not adults, but children.\\n\\n\r\nThe male central protagonist is Yuichiro Hyakuya and his friends from the Moon Demon Company, a group of freedom fighters formed to extinguish vampires in the harsh and dejected reality. Here on, it sets up two sides, the humans fighting against the vampires in this war-like battlefield. Although the main cast is a bunch of children, surprisingly they can pull off wicked stunts with their cursed gear, weapons specialised to exterminate the vampires, and are portrayed centuries stronger than the other adult looking soldiers from the army. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick the best character, it would be Shinoa Hiiragi, also, she is one of the reasons I was able to enjoy the show to some degree. Her comical expressions and satirical manner of speech is what makes her as a character stand out more than the rest. Her design also stands out more than the others with her purple hair and ribbon attached. I applaud Hayami Saori for her splendid voice acting in portraying Shinoa's cheerful voice and sarcastic approaches and mannerisms, which pulled the show to a better level. \\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, it was definitely one of its stronger aspects, but also may be considered pretty incompetent by some because from a Hiroyuki Sawano standpoint, it was \"just more of the same\". The ost could have also been utilised better throughout the series and was not extremely memorable besides the orchestral version of the ending song. Both the opening song and ending song are pretty compelling though and definitely stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a hit and miss, some can say it is a manifestation of the show's lack in budget, and some can say it is for artistic and creative purposes, but I think, it's both. The animation was nothing ground-breaking or topnotch and was particularly below average for a shounen action series which is definitely disappointing.  \\n\\n\r\nThe action is in particular, extremely weak and incompetent in terms of an action anime and there are many better shows that execute action and its choreography in a much better fashion with more fluid animation and well-directed choreography. Hopefully, as the climax is in the second cour of this series, one can only hope for improvements in these areas. Even if the second cour depicts improvements for the animation or action sequences, the show as a whole still will not have consistent good quality, but rather, fluctuations in its inconsistent quality.  \\n\\n\r\nLuckily, this is only the first cour, and certainly, if this was how the show ended, it would have a much lower score, but since it is merely the first part, that's somewhat forgivable and may perhaps be redeemed later on with improvements. \\n\\n\r\nI can't say I did not enjoy the show, because I definitely did to an extent. But was it amazing? No, not even close. And was it horrible? No, not to that tier yet - but from here onward, I expect better from the second cour. The premise in itself has been done countless of times before and does not bring anything new or groundbreaking, but it does allow room for improvement, in both its presentation and execution in which the second cour will be pivotal to in order to judge the series as an entirety. \\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the second cour should expand on the story more, reveal more of the implied secrets, and hopefully develop the characters in a profound manner because right now, this show has not entirely finished and has ended in an open fashion for the second cour and until then, nothing in this first cour of Owari no Seraph will be complete.",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph is pretty simple to describe. It\u2019s a vampire shounen with action combining elements of horror, suspense, and odd humor. When, I mention odd, I don\u2019t mean it as unconventional. Hardly. Owari no Seraph (Seraph of the End) attempts to stylishly craft a show with vampires at war with humans. It wasn\u2019t always like this though because apparently, a virus many years ago wiped out a mass majority of humanity. The rulers of the world are now vampires as humanity desperately struggles for survival. At the center of it is an orphan named Yuichiro Hyakuya who hopes to reach freedom someday alongside hisfriend Mika. Sound a bit familiar? It may not be another Attack on Titan but Owari no Seraph surely follows a story of dark fantasy. Only the problem is, it\u2019s only as half as dark as it seems.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the creator of Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu, Owari no Seraph adapts a story based on the manga of the same name. It\u2019s important to note that the series follows the manga rather than the light novel. And just like the way the premise implies, freedom in the world of Owari no Seraph comes at a price.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode doesn\u2019t drop you in the middle of the story. Instead, it establishes a background tale, a way of telling events from the past. We learn quickly that vampires treat human like trash and apparently, some of them are allowed to live only because they have blood. It\u2019s a classic gimmick as vampires depends on it as a source of food. Nonetheless, the first episode shows how bloody (literally) it can be when humans tries to escape from their fate. Or rather, I can\u2019t really call it fate because Yuichiro manage to escape. The only problem is that the rest of the orphans perish as the price. Luckily, the series also has a group of vampire hunters (Moon Demon Company) and Yuchiro becomes acquainted with the group. Their goal? To exterminate the vampires and make their freedom a reality. \\n\\n\r\nSo essentially, this show pretty much sets up a standard war-like atmosphere between the two sides \u2013 humans and vampires. Yuichiro is the central protagonist although the show also introduces others that he meets while he trains to become stronger. The problem with Yuichiro is that he is a rather narrow minded individual when it comes to his goals. Apparently, his goal is to annihilate the vampires because like many other humans, they annihilated his family. His black-and-white view of the supernatural world brings him at odds with his superiors because he tends to even ignore orders at times so that he can get a bit of retribution. In essence, Yuichiro isn\u2019t exactly a good role model. However, I do have to emphasize that he is quite brave and often not to speak his mind. His kindness can also be seen at times when he is helping out others. Joining with him are Shinoa Hiragi, a girl with a rather sarcastic personality. Her relationship with Yuichiro and the others are usual casual although it can be seen that she greatly cares about them too. She also has a family member that she used to share a connection with although the show doesn\u2019t fully emphasize on this. On the contrary, there is Mitsuba who has a more serious attitude and often wants to do things herself. This puts an odd at times with her comrades like Yuichiro as they have conflicting ideologies. Luckily, Yuchiro does get along better with other characters such as Yoichi and has a rather peculiar friendship with Shiho. (The two are more like rivals most of the time). With such a diverse group of characters, the show tries to do its best to bring out Yuichiro\u2019s character. Sometimes it works, other times it doesn\u2019t. I say this because the show\u2019s weakness is the way the dialogues are delivered. It lightens the mood to a point where it\u2019s hard to take the show seriously at times. In a way, it\u2019s more like unconventional humor coming from the interactions of the characters. Yuichiro\u2019s also too brash at times to really see him as a reliable person. However, I do have to say that one of the show\u2019s stronger aspect is the relationship he has with Mika.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being separated in the present storyline, there\u2019s still a lot of reflection going back between Yuichiro and Mika. The story essentially shows that the two childhood friends are inseparable. With the way the first episode was presented, it also gives Yuichiro a stronger motivation to kill the vampires. What he doesn\u2019t know is that certain circumstances happened back in the past. But regardless, there\u2019s a strong form of brotherhood that can be seen indirectly throughout the season even though the two are not together on-scene most of the time. In retrospect, the show focuses on relationships with family and friends. This is sort of ironic as Yuichiro is an orphan so that means he has no true family (related by blood anyways). However, his new family comes from the people he works with such as the Moon Demon Company and the kids he encountered in the past. His friendship with Mika is one strongest bonds he has formed. At times, he even works well with his superior Guren despite him being a bit rebellious because of his nature. The show establishes these relationships as they are one of the core reasons for the characters to fight and survive.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the fighting in the show between the two sides seems to be one sided at times. The vampires are the dominant force. Powerful vampires such as Krul Tepes and Ferid Bathory really shows a difference in gap of power between the two races. They also despise humans and looks down on them like livestock. As evidenced in both the past and present, a key idea of this show is to show if and how humans can overcome these vampires. Unfortunately, the show holds back on characterization on these vampires. They are too stereotypical and really too straightforward with their goals. In fact, the goal they have is too narrow as well and despite having a compelling post-apocalyptic setting, there\u2019s little world building to go with the story. Luckily, the series does have its mechanics when it comes to the weapons and military. Basically, the show does two things: to show and tell. This comes from the weapons that the Japanese Imperial Demon Army uses known as the Cursed Gear. While it\u2019s still generic, I do have to give some praise to the creativity of these objects. All of them are categorized by a different type with unique prestige, shape, and powers. The way the show explains it is just enough for a viewer to understand while also showing (not just telling) the consequences of their usage. In general, creativity with its weapon arsenal is clever in the case of mechanics. Even the military of the Japanese Imperial Demon Army has a good set of mechanics behind it with different rankings, squads, and roles. \\n\\n\r\nAs one of several anime projects that Wit Studio undertakes in the year 2015, it\u2019s expected that they may maintain a strong degree of visual quality. Honestly though, it\u2019s rather mixed. Although some of the first few episodes of the series makes an impression with its artwork, others really seems it ran on low budget. I think what I refer to most are the character expressions as they look far too one dimensional. Despite showing a good portray of emotions, it\u2019s often hard to get viewers to think more about them. Also, there are static movements occasionally in the show and in one particular episode really suffered from body movements. On the plus side, background visual can be a spellbound sensation. The fantasy elements of the series especially with post-apocalyptic scenery is fantastically done. It makes it feel real that is also accompanied with dynamic camera work. The action scenes are also solid on most parts with intense movements, clever angle features, and a display of explosiveness. It\u2019s a blockbuster for any action fan who should feel satisfied. Character designs also has a style to them such as the Japanese Army\u2019s uniforms, the Cursed Gears, and even vampires. In particular, the cursed gears all have unique designs ranging from swords, scythes, bows, or even enhanced sniper rifles. Fan service is minimal although not entirely absent either such as the case of shower scenes. Then, there\u2019s the iconic blood scene throughout the show that seems to be a key emphasis. There is a seemingly longer screen time when blood and violence is shown. To put it simply, it tries to create an element of dark fantasy envisioned by what the creators want the audience to experience.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is one of the more standard parts of the show. Names such as Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, Nanatsu no Taizai, Aldnoah Zero) will instantly ring a bell and is easily recognized by their style. However, the show does suffer a bit as most of the soundtrack sounds similar. Unlike some the other popular works he is involved in, Owari no Seraph\u2019s OST doesn\u2019t create an excitement. It is on the right track most of the time but doesn\u2019t leave behind lasting impressions. In fact, I can\u2019t name one single OST in the show that I\u2019d want to search for again. On the other hand, the OP and ED theme song has a creative melody to it with a lot of foreshadowing. It puts creativity to the vampire themes with decent amount of symbolism and can be memorable. Finally, character voice mannerisms is more or less average. The only praise that I can give are perhaps for the vampires because of their personalities. You can easily see how the two traces contrast with their tone of speech. \\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph is a bit paltry when it comes to its dark atmosphere. The story obviously has a grim tone to it but can never really capture that objective. The improper timing of the humor holds this show back on many occasions. Fortunately, the series does establish its meaning well so understanding its intentions isn\u2019t so hard. The characters obviously has their goals that we see firsthand. One of the better executions of the series relies on relationships, something that it has done from the very beginning. With a tragic tone and premise, you can expect this series to be appeal for fans of drama as well. It\u2019s noticeable that this is the first cour season for the adaptation. Another cour of 12 episodes is scheduled to air in Fall 2015 so expect more vampires, cursed gears, and spills of blood.",

Shinoa Hiiragi and Yoiichi are likely the only characters I could save the anime for, as for Shihou Kimizuki, well, let's just not talk about it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 5/10\\n\r\nIf you want something original, I advise you to stay away from this anime, I was seriously disappointed about it. If you're a newbie to anime and liked AoT then you'll probably like it more, though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nAs I said before, I was disappointed about the show, in my opinion it's nothing to be hyped about, as I think it's one of worst anime I saw this year.",

            "content": "What do we have? Vampires, an army and a stubborn boy out for revenge. Nothing too special - you have a lot of those anime which are focused on revenge or have an idiot as their protagonist\r\nHowever, it is hard to combine these elements and make something enjoyable out of it since they're so common. If you're not careful, it becomes boring and you'll give the watcher the feeling of deja vu\r\nThis anime does a pretty good job at combining the aforementioned elements and making it enjoyable to watch (even with the idiotic protagonist)\r\nPlease note, however, this season was more of a prologue - wewill get a 2nd one - and for a prologue anime this is quite a good job. In this way it is similar to the 1st season of Tokyo Ghoul; important stuff happens during the show, but the real trigger is pulled at the end of the anime. Be prepared that this ends in a cliffhanger! \\n\r\nIt got me curious about what will happen next\\n\\n\r\n~ STORY ~\\n\\n\r\nOn what seems a normal day, a mysterious virus occurs and kills every infected human over the age of 13. At the same time vampires appear and take the remaining children, including the children of the Hyakuya orphanage under 'their wing'. To the great dislike of our protagonist Yuuichiro Hyakuya, the children are used as livestock for the vampires.\\n\r\nOne day, one of his siblings, Mikaela Hyakuya, convinces the orphans to escape from the vampires. Mikaela stole a map from a noble, which he's convinced will lead them to freedom. Unfortunately, this noble vampire, Ferid Bathory, was just fooling around with the children by letting Mikaela steal his map. Just before the children can make it to the outside world, Ferid kills the majority of the orphans, letting only Yuuichiro escape. \\n\\n\r\nThis event is basically what feeds Yuuichiro's hate for the vampires and his desire for revenge\\n\r\nAfter Yuuichiro's escape, he joins the army to pursue his goal.   \\n\\n\r\nI love the vampire genre, but it's really hard to find a good vampire anime/movie/book. There is a lot about these creatures, but the majority is just not worth watching (e.g. Fortune Arterial - seriously guys, that anime is boring)This one, however, I truly enjoyed watching. \\n\\n\r\nMy only problem with it was that it focused too much on the army. We see how Yuuichiro learns about both the vampire and human worlds, makes friends, gets a weapon, etc. \\n\r\nI myself am human, so I kinda have a pretty good idea about their feelings and struggles. I wish more time would've been dedicated to the vampires. Like what kind of classes are there besides the nobles, something about their lifestyle, etc. Unfortunately, those fascinating creatures don't get that much screen time if you compare it to that of the army.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~ ART ~    \\n\\n\r\nSimply beautiful; nice character design, nice action scenes, love the contrast between the vampire world and the human world\\n\\n\r\n~ SOUND ~\\n\\n\r\nThe ost fitted in the scenes, however, I cannot say that there's a song I'll listen on its own\\n\r\nNothing really stayed in my mind\\n\r\nBut the music did spice up the scenes, so that's enough for me to give it a 7\\n\\n\r\n~ CHARACTERS ~\\n\\n\r\nWell, there certainly are a few character that spice up the show and are worth mentioning  \\n\\n\r\nYuuichiro Hyakuya\\n\r\nAs I said before, Yuu is kinda an idiot. He doesn't really think before acting; if it helps him to achieve his goal, he'll do it without thinking about the problems that'll occur afterwards. He gets punished (e.g. suspended from the army) and punched a lot by his superior for acting without thinking, which makes Yuu want to prove himself even more. Yuu is short tempered and not really good at getting along with people (especially after the incident with Ferid)\\n\r\nTo be honest, Yuuichiro is nothing special - just your usual type of main character\\n\\n\r\nMikaela Hyakuya\\n\r\nMikaela on the other hand, is more interesting. As a boy, Mika was kind - hearted and always smiling. He always saw the bright side of everything, even living in the vampire world. Mika wanted for his dear family to be happy and took all the burdens upon himself. However, after his escape - plan failed Mika changed drastically. He became 'dead inside'. His only purpose for living is now saving Yuuichiro from the hands of 'those filthy humans'.\\n\\n\r\nShinoa Hiiragi\\n\r\nShinoa is appointed to supervise Yuu during his suspension from the army. Later on, she becomes his squad leader. \\n\r\nThis character is quite amusing, though she isn't my favourite. Shinoa doesn't really show emotion at the beginning of the anime. She's always there with a smile. Shinoa's manner of talking is a bit 'fake'; she says things that she doesn't mean and she says them in an exaggerated way that people hear she's being sarcastic. This is what I liked about her.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is quite the stereotype. Even though a lot of them spice up the show (like Ferid Bathory), they're not really worth mentioning here\\n\\n\r\n~ OVERALL ~\\n\\n\r\nthis is an enjoyable show and a good example of a great vampire anime. If you like dark anime, you should watch it",

            "content": "Some spoilers may exist.\r\nStory 6:\r\nIt seems to be one of the few typical shounen plots. World is destroyed, and, for some reason, children are the only ones that live (under 13). Protagonist conveniently manages to escape from his prison-like place. He's conveniently found by a strong organisation which then he manages to easily join because of innate protagonist buffs (he never actually does any training).\r\nArt 8:\r\nIt's actually pretty decent. The backdrops are nice and the character design is pretty decent. But for w/e reason, Hiiragi Shinoa just seems inconsistent with her quality despite being a main character. (ep5 10:03 - 10:06) She looks like she'slagging away.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7: \\n\r\nThe voice acting sounds really FKN forced. I'm a die-hard subber, but even so, the voice acting for pretty much everyone (except Guren and some side-characters) sound very forced and amateurish. There are occassion delays between characters talking and reacting to each other's speech which makes it seem forced and disingenuous. Yu sometimes yells with a suppressed kind of tone while Shinoa's speech sometimes does not match her expression.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the BGM and music. The OP is quite nice, I enjoyed both the sequence and the song. The ED is exceptional, it was very well done with the contrast between light and shadows and the song was very memorable. If I would rate the music alone, I'd give it an 8, the OP and ED were very good, but the BGM was unmemorable, unlike AoT, which was also composed by the same composer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3:\\n\r\nWhat I hate the most about this series. Yu is the typical brat that's yelling/rebelling while also failing in his studies yet amazingly has all the skills necessary to further the plot without any actual development (training). He thinks he's all amazing and actually manages to pull impossible/unlikely things off (defeating a demon bare knowledge of even what they are by basically saying 'no'). Essentially it's like watching a slapstick comedy without the comedy, and with the plot advancing just because it can.\\n\\n\r\nYoichi's existence is questionable. At one point he gets taken over by a demon and was considered a target to be executed. However, because Yuu decides to save him, he mentions the nonsense about being friends and stands still as Yoichi aims an arrow at him because 'faith'. But because plot armor > logic, Yoichi misses and is saved because of the magical power of 'friendship'. \\n\\n\r\nKimizuki's existence is questionable as well, since he doesn't really contribute to the character development of anyone nor does he contribute to the story (for now). But at the very least, his survival is at least acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing the first arc, Guren's character has become a bit more interesting, since he's not longer just the 'mentor' kind of guy. Now we see a darker side and possibly a desperate side. He's probably the strongest character out of all of them, so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are kind of there just to yell/harass Yuu.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7:\\n\r\nThe music was great, the art was decent (most of the time), but what really put this whole series down were the characters. Hell, this series probably would've been a lot more interesting if we were watching it from Guren's point of view.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6:\\n\r\nIt's not unwatchable thanks to the more interesting main characters (Guren, Mikaela). The OP/ED is so good that I never end up skipping them.\\n",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph is a perfect example of a misrepresentation of your survival-type and an abandoned scenario with a post-apocalyptic setting anime TV show. It has several inclusives from its similar brethren of the same genre. And quite sadly, the actual story it offers isn't a fascinating one either.\r\nAdding the fictional Vampire attribute to something fictional itself is something that is very common these days. Now add that as the characteristic that plays the role of an antagonist who is trying to take over the world from humans in an era where a mysterious virus is threatening to wipe out the human population ages abovethirteen, and what you get is Owari no Seraph in a nutshell. Yep, that is pretty much what this show has to offer as we follow the along the footsteps of Hyakuya Yuuichiro, the protagonist of the show who is an underage kid trying to escape from the Vampires but to no avail as he is soon captured and confined into a realm which is ruled completely by the Vampires themselves and treated as a mere live-stock among several other human kids. The starting of the show focuses on how Yu(What he's called as in most of the show) along with a few of his friends and his equivalent and best friend, Mikaela. \\n\\n\r\nYu is the focus point of this show and plays out as the main character as he successfully frees himself from Vampires and joins up the \"Moon Demon Company\" - a human organization trying to regain control of the world as it is and fight against the Vampires. Yu is depicted as a boy with quite a short temper and is easily enraged. This is quite evident as he repeatedly shows his hatred and aggression against the Vampires and tells how he'll annihilate them all and get revenge for what they have done for his family and friends. Despite this, Yu also shows compassion towards his family and seems to care a lot for them in order to never lose them again. This also helps him make new friends from the academy where aspiring students study and train hard to become a part of the Moon Demon Company and fight against the enemy. Shinoa Hiragi is one such character who's the sergeant and a squad leader of the Moon Demon Company and is sent to watch over his progresses and always follows him around.\\n\\n\r\nShinoa is a short pink-haired girl who is portrayed as quite a self-possessed character. She also likes making sarcastic remarks over Yu and is one of the better, enjoyable characters of the show. Yoichi is the first friend Yu gets in the academy and he is quite a frail and fragile boy. He also joins Shinoa and Yu as one of the Vampire Extermination Unit members under the Moon Demon Company, along with Kimizuki, quite a strong-willed and an eccentric character quite the polar opposite of Yu and Mitsuba, a yellow-haired girl who is a little more experienced than the others in the group and the one who is revealed later as the show progresses. Ichinose Guren is the head and the Lieutenant Colonel of the Moon Demon Company and the one who offers the five students a membership to join the Vampire Extermination Unit. He's also the one who rescues Yu after he escapes from the Vampires, and the one who sends Shinoa to watch over Yu. Next is Mikaela Hyakuya, who is probably one of the important characters in the show but at the same time very little's known about him compared to Yu. He's the childhood friend of Yu as they spend their time together even after getting captured by the enemy. Mikaela is quite a cool-headed boy and opposite to that of Yu. He also shows a lot of compassion towards Yu and his friends, and is shown to offer his blood to the Vampire leader in secret, in order to get him and his friends better meal to eat. \\n\\n\r\nNow this may be on the spoiler side but it's inevitable as I can provide very little information about Mikaela without it. \\n\r\nAnyway, he gets killed towards the end of the first episode by Ferid, the leader of the Vampires while he tries with his friends to escape the place into the world outside. Yu is the only survivor who escapes after that but in the coming episodes it is revealed that Mika is still alive thanks to the blood of the Queen, Krul Tepes. He then later confronts Yu in the battlefield and still shows his compassion towards him despite being transformed into a vampire. He even refused to drink the blood from the humans, however he learns that the humans are manipulating Yu to release the demon inside him and to save him is the sole reason Mikaela continues living. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the characters are anything too special but at the same time they aren't generic or boring either. Each of the person has its own characteristics and its depicted pretty well in this show which is a plus point for this show. Another plus point is without a doubt the sound aspect of Owari no Seraph. Both the opening and ending theme performed by the renowned Sawano Hiroyuki himself is a peculiarity of this show. Amalgamated with good voice acting which perfectly synchronizes and depicts the certain character, Owari no Seraph somehow manages to be a fun show. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Owari no Seraph still is nothing extraordinary. Even if it's still just the first cour of the show though and the mysteries of the Seraph of the End is yet to be revealed, Owari no Seraph falls flat with what it displays in twelve episodes which is too little. There are also quite a lot of inconsistencies in the pacing leading up to the battle which makes me wonder if the twelve episode slot fot the second season is maybe a little too less. Nevertheless, Owari no Seraph is a fun watch with some cool characters and great soundtracks. And even if that fails to please you, I'll just say simply watch it for Shinoa. \\n",

            "content": "Before I go into the review, I would like to say something. Despite all the bad reviews claiming that this anime is a cliche, IT IS NOT! This show is great.\r\nThe Story: 8\r\nLikely followed by age-old horrors thought only to be myth, vampires emerged from the dark and took control, after the world had met it's end in 2012 by a man-made virus, exterminating mankind leaving only children under the age of thirteen untouched. This is the story of a 12-years old Y\u016bichir\u014d and his family from Hyakuya Orphanage who live under the protection of the vampires in exchange for donating their blood. Living likea livestock Y\u016bichir\u014d and his fellow friend Mikaela plotted to escape the vampire's rule, which ends in a terrible tragedy. Four years later, Y\u016bichir\u014d dedicates his life to destroy vampires and seek revenge against them for murdering his \"family\".\\n\r\nThis is a story about revenge, friendship and sacrifice which you don't cross everyday.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: 7\\n\r\nThe character design was great and the colors were perfect, there's not much to say about the art except the animation was a bit lacking, specially the movement parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: 7\\n\r\nThey were somewhat typical, the protagonist is a stubborn guy yet a person with a very good heart, who loves and cares about his friends.\\n\r\nTwo small girls using big weapons and very strong, one of them is the typical blond two tailed tsundere. And other two male characters who make the Moon Demon battalion.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment: 9\\n\r\nPersonally I enjoyed it so much, a story about revenge preceded  by heart breaking tragedy, and the plot was perfect in so many ways, but mostly it gave me a true sense of intensity and peril. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, even though the animation isn't the best and the characters personalities are somewhat typical, still this anime has so many good points that I'm sure if you give it a try you will love it. \\n\\n",

By the end of episode 1 I was crying like a baby, and I never really get that emotionally drawn into an anime. Even with the tragedies and deaths of Attack on Titan I wasn't really feeling the emotion of the events. This anime builds up suspense well. The characters are verylikable and easy to get attached to. There are NO annoying characters! There's usually always a very annoying female character in animes who you hate are want to disappear but not in this. Every episode is action packed and suspenseful. No filler episodes. My only complaint is that I wish it were longer. Al though there are similarities between this animes plot and Attack on Titan, I find this anime to be much better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 10/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph was definitely one of the most hyped up anime this season, but it does have a reason to be like that. This is my own opinion, but I found this series very fun and exciting.\r\n[Story - 7]\r\nNow I admit the idea isn't... Creative. Boy seeking revenge for his family against vampires, sounds similar to Shingeki no Kyojin, no?(except it's titans) Hey, what can you do. As long as it's still enjoyable it's not that horrible. The thing that made this anime enjoyable was the anticipation of how things will unfold in the end. Will it go horribly or smoothly? That's the reasonmany enjoyed this series.\\n\\n\r\n[Art - 8]\\n\r\nThe art wasn't extravagant, but I believe it didn't need to be anything special. It was smooth and pleasing to the eye. Not much to say there.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound - 9]\\n\r\nNow the opening was something I enjoyed A LOT. The opening itself gave the anime a huge hype, the song just makes you all pumped up and want to sing along!(Also can we just talk about the freaking Universal logo thing at the beginning of each episode?) Now for the rest of the anime, I believe, that the sound played quite a large role. It got you pumped up when something was about to happen and also made you tear up at times because of something horrible happening. This is what music in anime is supposed to do, pull on your heart strings. And so, I myself think that the sound in Owari no Seraph did indeed have that. Of course it wasn't so good as to give a 10, that's reserved for Clannad.\\n\\n\r\n[Character - 9]\\n\r\nI loved the characters in this. They were all unique in their own way and I can't say I hated any of them (Except maybe Shinoa because gurl, know when to stop). They all had their views and I'm glad we got decent backstory on at least Yuu's friends. I'll expect to find out more from Guren next season because he's the one I'm interested in the most, and maybe we'll even get some backstory from the other generals as well. \\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment - 10]\\n\r\nNow I, for one, found this anime extremely enjoyable. Sure it's not perfect, it has it's flaws but those flaws didn't affect the enjoyment, which is good. Every week I was pumped up to watch the new episode and see what happens next, it made me cry and also happy and too excited than I should have been lol. Anticipation for the next episode is already a sign that the anime is going to be good.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall - 9]\\n\r\nNow I would definitely suggest someone to watch this anime. If you like shounen/vampire anime then this definitely is for you. For me the first episode already got me, but if the first episode isn't convincing then watch the first three. The first three should be enough for you to decide whether to continue watching it or not.",

            "content": "Okay. I'll just say it. My favorite thing in Owari no Seraph was Shinoa. She was what kept me watching this show.\r\nFor the sake of easy reading, I'll try to make things simple:\r\nStory - Post-apocalyptic setting, vampires vs. humans, a story of human resistance against more powerful vampires.\r\nArt - Okay, watchable. The animation was generally fine, but still not top-notch.\r\nSound  - Sound? What sound? Nothing too outstanding here. Just normal sounds and music. It neither bothered nor impressed me.\r\nCharacter - We have the MC+kids using some demonic weapons to fight vampires. There are some character bonding and developing moments, but not enough. One canstill feel difficult trying to concentrate getting into the relationships of the MC+others.\\n\r\nWe still have another cour coming in the future, so the developments are not finished, but I still feel there are too many secrets in the show that prevent viewers to fully sympathize with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne good point here is Shinoa, my favorite character in the show. She's cute, cheeky, she's got nice purple hair, half-shut eyes, quirky personality. With the MC being quite a generic character, I feel that Shinoa is the the main personality that drives the show. She is cheeky and clever, and is real fun to watch her interact with others, usually outwitting them. Shinoa is also serious when needed (she's the leader of her unit after all), and funny just when the audience is thirsty for something refreshing when watching a drawn-out episode.\\n\r\nMoreover, Hayami Saori's acting here was something new for me when compared to her previous voices. It wasn't her usual dead-pan, serious character, but something more subtly and condescendingly bouncy and cheerful. Anyways, it was quite refreshing to the ear, and was a treat to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Okay. I don't know whether I completely enjoyed watching this. However, I enjoyed it to an extent - to the extent where I felt that this was a show I could watch without being too tense about the general story and flow of things.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Yep. Quite average so far. I think you can watch this in a rather relaxed manner. This show was nothing too creative to begin with, and everything is straight forward so far. Therefore, if you have some spare time, I think you should go watch this before the second cour comes out --- or just watch for Shinoa's sake.....\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I don't think it is fair to mark the show with a permanent grade, because it is technically not finished yet. However, for me, a good show. whether or not it has a second cour coming soon, always has good character+story developments and closure. On these aspects, I believe Owari no Seraph's first cour ended without having fulfilling them.",

It has an appeal to both male and female audiences: male-shounen and action, female- vampires, a hint of yaoi. It is most like 07 Ghost in that the two main malecharacters would easily, without hesitation, give up their lives for each other, and have a bond that is deeper than just a superficial friendship, and perhaps that is why I liked it so much. If you want dynamic characters that grow throughout the series, plot twists, and a whole bunch of action, then I would definitely recommend this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason that it only earns a  9 is that its soundtrack is not dynamic. Of course, it got me to cry and ache during the sad portions, which is superb, but sometimes, the soundtrack was a little bit off, especially in scenes where it wasn't exactly an intense scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were perfect and well selected. I applaud them for all of the screaming scenes. Especially for Yu-san.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the pacing was fantastic, and it more than satisfied my cravings.\\n\\n\r\nPlease release the next series before it's too late and I'm tempted to just freaking read the manga!",

The issue lies with the fact that it's rated for mature audiences and yet it is made very clear that it is about 12 year olds and for 12 year olds and the show itself stresses this very fact out an awful lot.\r\nIt's an absolutely gross abomination right from the very first episode and it only gets worse and worse from there.\r\nSure it's littered with cliches, but clicheson their own aren't that bad, they can be useful plot devices to improve and progress the story as weird as it might sound. The issue with this show is however that it has a terrible setting filled with bad cliches and this somehow is then scrambled into a pile of vomit that is then tossed together and presented as a story.\\n\r\nAn appropriate comparison would be a stuck toilet that is then filled up with faeces, topped up with an umbrella and a huge slice of genetically modified lemon that would be large enough to decorate this sort of presentation.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is alright and sound ok too, however the plot is deserving of a negative rating and when that important feature doesn't come to hand then something has to give, the rest of the ratings will have to suffer in order to adjust the score to show it more accurately.\\n\\n\r\nI am not exaggerating when i am saying this is so bad that it should be banned.

None the less, I finished it and I am so gladthat I did.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot suddenly bloomed and there were more questions arising inside me now. This was just the kind of feeling I needed: curiosity. Suddenly the anime itself seemed unique with the vampire, demons vibe more prominent and less of the humanity on brink of extinction.\\n\\n\r\nTry it, I dare you. If you are a girl you might just fall in love with all the characters but that doesn't stop the vampire loving fanboys too! It breaks from conventional topics after a while and complete itself in a unique identifiable way.\\n",

Within 10 seconds of the start of the show the apocalypse happens and vampires come to gather the survivors who are only children.  Our main character begins as an almost copy paste of Eren Jaeger, who is an orphan who is being held captive in a vampire camp.  The only thing he wants to do is get his orphan family out of there and kill all of the vampires.  The story is a pretty generic and lacking in any sort of originality, it is like a Frankenstein'sMonster of Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online and some other stupidly popular show that is pretty generic.  The art is the hardest part to rate because the only thing that really ever looks nice are the backgrounds because they are painted and just sit there as a jpeg.  The animation isn't noteworthy, just average.  The music is nothing to write home about, has your classic \"hardly noticeable background music\", your \"we are fighting now\", and \"attempted philosophical score for our 10 minutes of exposition\".  The characters are all bland and generic other than one.  Your main character is a brooding teenager who lost something dear to him, your cowardly and timid barely even classified as a boy, your stuck up generic rival to the MC who will end up his friend, your tsundere who thinks she knows everything when she actually knows nothing, then the one good character who is the playful, joking person that actually has some power.  If you were hoping for character development, you will not find any here.  There is very little enjoyment that can be found in this show.",

            "content": "The definition of average, Owari no Serpah tosses together shounen tropes in a rather predictable but still worth watching anime. \r\nNote: I have not read the manga but have heard various complaints about the anime from those who have. I\u2019d love to hear any thoughts from manga fans! \r\nThis review is (relatively) spoiler free! :D \r\nCharacters: 5/10\r\nWith the exception of Mikaela and (somewhat) Shinoa, the characters scream standard. The cast is not fantastic or horrible, just typical. Many shounen start with stock characters that slowly grow into something more, but Owari no Seraph\u2019s first season ended before that happened. Twelve episodes did not give therather large cast time to develop unique personalities.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you love shounen characters, you\u2019ll love these guys. I, personally, found them difficult to connect with, slightly irritating, and predictable. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I loved one character enough to give the show 6/10 instead of 5/10 and enjoyed two other characters.\\n\\n\r\n(here comes the slight spoiler territory, though nothing specific) \\n\\n\r\nI watched the anime because of Mikaela Hyakuya or \u201cMika\u201d. To me, Mika is a \u201csquare peg in a round hole\u201d. Mika might have become a Orihime Inoue, Allen Walker, or Oz Vessallius, a character who loathes to kill, determinedly cares for everyone, will defend their loved ones (and sometimes strangers or even enemies) till death, and desires to see the best in everyone. Sadly for Mika but interestingly for viewers, he is never afforded the luxury of such high ideals, though I'm he wishes he did (on a side note, I adore Oz, Orihime, and Allen). Instead, Mika finds himself in a role typically given to females\u2014essentially, he \u201cwhores\u201d his blood out to help feed his family\u2014and later to anti-heroes\u2014he fights on the wrong side but with a good reason and a damaged past. Thus, Mika is put in situations I haven\u2019t seen too often for his base personality type, which makes him the most unique aspect of the show. \\n\\n\r\nShinoa and Guren also interest me. Shinoa falls into some of the stereotypical tropes of a shounen\u2019s female lead, but I found her to be the anime\u2019s second most interesting character. Guren has potential as well. At first, he comes across as nothing more than a lazy bully, but, as the story keeps going, his character does some interesting things that make me curious to see more.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain\u2014very shounen. The story is so incredibly typical I predicted everything that happened between episodes 2-9 without a hitch, and nothing in the others surprised me. While I am fairly savvy at \u201cseeing things coming\u201d, it was easy to see where this formulaic anime would go.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime spends at least half its episodes on \u201ctraining\u201d, which are always highly predictable. The rest are spent on backstory (one episode), wrap up (yes, this twelve episode anime dedicated an entire episode to wrap up), and about four-ish episodes follow a battle, which happens without much build up. Both sides just decide, \u201cYes, we shall battle here because!\u201d. The \u201creason\u201d felt more like a plot-forced excuse to me. \\n\\n\r\nI feel the story starts to gain momentum at the tail end of this battle. The plot finally seems to find a direction besides \u201ctraining to get revenge\u201d. Personally, I would\u2019ve started the story at episode eleven. Because of this (also because of Mika), I will watch season two. I may end up recommending that people watch episode one and eleven (maybe two and ten too) and then jump to season two. The rest is so typical you don\u2019t really need it. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the plot has a whole is not well explained. I have no real idea about the parameters of the world, why the vampire decided to take over it, why Mika and Yuu are special, and so on. I hope season two will answer some of these questions. \\n\\n\r\nThe show falls into the potholes of many shounen. For instance, our vengeful protagonist consistently makes poor choices that the plot ends up bending over backwards and defying logic to reward him for. Charging into the battle and throwing plans into the wind somehow ends up being the right choice. He also has random powers, and all the girls fall in love with him. \\n\\n\r\nLast problem: I do not find the vampires scary. Characters keep mentioning how powerful their bloodsucking opponents are, and yet newbies fresh on the field have no problem killing them with each swing of their various weapons. I understand it has something to do with the class of weaponry, but it\u2019s poorly explained. I don\u2019t really care that the vampires are easy to kill, but every time a character mentions how dangerous they are, I just laughed.  \\n\\n\r\nArt (and cinematography in general): 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFairly well done, the weaponry animation is especially interesting and visually appealing.The fighting is fast and exciting too. \\n\\n\r\n(angles)\\n\\n\r\nCould have been better. Really, the choice of when to cut from a scene and jump to another character\u2019s point of view often jarred me. The transitions seemed abrupt and threw me out of the story for a moment. \\n\\n\r\n(intro/outro)\\n\\n\r\nThe intro doesn\u2019t really tell much of a story, but it fits the tone well and does capture the anime\u2019s tone. The outro is a series of well-drawn pictures, a wise choice considering how many characters there are. \\n\\n\r\nFemale Representation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe females are everything you expect in a standard shounen. The girls have a slightly moe appeal and run around battling in short skirts and falling for the male lead. I will never understand why fighting in a skirt is a good decision, but I do understand that some males enjoy watching that and that this show is, in fact, targeted towards males. I, however, just find it amusing and illogical. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, both of the females are touted as amazing warriors and are in charge of three males, but, per usual, the males prove to be \u201cnaturals\u201d and surpass the girls' combat level during the first battle and often rescue their supposed superiors. \\n\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t really offended or impressed. Like many things about this anime, it was average (hence the five). \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWithout Mika, I would give this anime a 5/10. It\u2019s a highly normal anime that will bore people sick of shounen but entertain those who love shounen or just want to kickback and watch a typical anime. Only 12 episodes long, it\u2019s not much of an investment. I plan to watch the next season and believe it can easily surpass the first. \\n\\n\r\nNow, to address the Attack on Titan accusations . . .\\n\\n\r\nI have read/heard several times that Owari no Seraph is \u201cripping off\u201d AoT. I disagree. AoT likes to use shounen tropes to set up the audiences\u2019 expectations so it can smash them. And calling Owari no Seraph similar to AoT simply because both feature vengeful protagonists who live in a dystopian world where humanity is at the bottom of the food chain sounds as silly to me as calling every story that has a magic school a rip off of Harry Potter. Of course, I haven\u2019t read the manga. So it is possible Owari no Seraph pulls more from AoT than I currently know from just watching season one of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI personally feel like Owari no Seraph\u2019s mangaka was a big fan of Ao No Exorcist. The art styles are highly similar (especially the clothing styles, just look at Mephisto\u2019s outfit). Both feature a close brother relationship (Rin and Yukio and Mika and Yuu). Shiemi and Yuuichirou share similar personalities. Shihou acts like Bon but looks like Shima. And then Mito looks like Shura. Both worlds feature many types of supernatural forces as well. But I won\u2019t hold that against Owari no Seraph, as I enjoy Ao no Exorcist and don\u2019t mind things borrowing ideas from it. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, if I failed to cover something you're curious or worried about, let me know! I'd be happy to answer them for you! \\n",

I thoroughly enjoyed it and was excited to see the next episode weekly. Yes the story line has been done before, but it was done RIGHT. I have seen plenty of anime, and this one is the first vampire anime I actually enjoyed.\r\nThere is a character for each persons taste (Mine is Shinoa) and it's easy to fall in love with certain characters.\r\nThe animation was fantastic! I enjoyed watching the fight scenes asit was fluid and easy to watch. I loved the art style as well, very grim and dark just like a real apocalypse would be.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I noticed that bugged me was the sound, sometimes it had moments where it could have had sound effects such as the odd footstep or shirt ruffle. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had the chance to see it again with new eyes (and it had finished airing) I would have watched it in one night.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading... I know it wasn't long but hey! I am sure most people want to find something to watch quickly rather then read a massive review just to decide yes or no >.",

Motivation coming only from loss and desire of revenge is becoming the trendof anime these days, it causes you to feel sorry for the character and I don't like that at all. Yu says ''I don't want any of my friends to die anymore'' he isn't afraid of losing his friends , what he really fears is feeling guilty like the time he ran away in the beginning. There isn't much you can learn from it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 6\\n\r\nit is the perfect thing to kill time with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a decent 4, I believe it doesen't deserve no more nor less than that.",

            "content": "Shonuen is a very defined genre of anime.  With the most popular/long running anime, Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach, aka the big 3 being some of the most well known examples of shonuen, here, we have Owari no Seraph, an anime made by Wit Studio, the same people who made the ever so popular Shingeki no Kyojin.  So with that current track record, can we expect greatness?  Well, no.\r\nStory (5.99/10): In Owari no Seraph, the world is devastated by an apocalypse.  A deadly virus spread by vampires has killed virtually all of the human beings, killing off all of the adultsand leaving behind only kids that are 13 and younger in age, thus creating a ruined world where giant mutant monsters called \"four horsemen of John\" roam the landscape and kill any human they find.  It is here where we have our protagonist Yu, who vies to kill all of the vampires so that he and his family of other orphan children try to escape the vampire city.\\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph is a show that falls into a category of false advertising above all else.  While the show is branded to be one that talks about the struggle of a human vs. vampire conflict that it brands itself to be, for this show, that simply isn't the case.  One of the biggest reasons for a person to even watch a show like this is because of the action, the great fighting scenes that make a general Shounen show fantastic to watch and overall, brand it as shounen.  Here, you don't really get much of that at all.  For the most part, the show focuses mainly on our main protagonist Yu, as he...goes around making friends.  I kid you not, for the first 6 episodes of the series, you will get little to no vampire fighting action, but instead a plotline about a pouty MC who is told to make friends.  What irks me more is that the show also attempts to do a dual perspective storytelling from one POV to another which not only makes less sense because they spend about 20 seconds on one perspective before switching to the other, but also makes the other perspective about the show's deuteragonist way more interesting than than the protagonist making me personally, want to know the other story rather than the one we spend the most time with.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you get down to the nitty gritty of the show though, a lot of it is actually fairly predictable.  Nothing really came as a surprise plot-wise, so it really didn't make it interesting.  All the characters obviously had plot armor, and the lack of vampire attacks/apocalyptic feel made me even forget for a few minutes that I was watching a show about a world where vampires are threatening humanity.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue I have about the show is about the way it's presented.  A lot of the show feels very slow in its progression, to the point that it even goes an entire episode without really doing much of anything.  It doesn't really pick up the pace until more than halfway through, and by then, it's already damaged beyond repair because a lot of things don't really make sense with the story.  Owari no Seraph bears a lot of plot holes regarding things and concepts like the cursed gear, how humanity was able to create a half decent civilization under the threat of giant monsters and vampires who treat them as livestock, etc.  \\n\\n\r\nAbove all, Owari no Seraoh was a show that hardly delivered on any aspect of itself.  With a lot of plot points that were left open ended, the show finished up with an ending that was as eventful as watching paint dry.  An ending that only served to add to how much of a disappointment this show was, didn't really give it a proper sail-off.  Plus, the entire show shoves this whole \"family\" ideal down our throats as we're watching it, which personally, I feel clashes with the show and contributes to its downfall.\\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n- for an action show, there really is no action\\n\r\n- numerous amounts of plot holes\\n\r\n- predictable/underwhelming story\\n\r\n- awful ending (seriously though, that finale was so boring)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6.11/10): The cast for Owari no Seraph is a cast of a mixed bag, being an uneven mix of some interesting characters, and a whole lot more of some generic people.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Yu, our main protagonist, aka an Eren Jaeger copycat who switches the word Titan for Vampire.  To be honest, that's really all you're going to get with this MC.  As a boy who had his entire family killed by vampires after being taken by vampires, Yu is a very vengeful character, swearing revenge upon vampires by vowing to kill every single one of them by himself.  (Now doesn't that kinda sound familiar...). Apart from accepting some new people as his \"new family\" to replace his old one, Yu himself doesn't really get much of anything else.  \\n\\n\r\nThen we have the vampire equivalent to Yu in terms of importance, Mika.  Mika is a boy turned vampire after an incident involving Yu and the rest of their family back in episode 1.  Mika is a character that is overwhelmingly underused in the show, as his situation as a human turned vampire makes for an interesting storyline and he's shown to be very conflicted on his identity, as he has been able to walk in the shoes of both species for a good length of time.  The only issue is, because the show focuses more on Yu rather than Mika, the amount of screen time, and therefore development that we get for Mika is rather limited.  He shows a lot of potential that can add to the show, but his lack of use showed a lot of wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, for the last character mention, we have Shinoa.  Shinoa as a character is mainly used as the \"main girl\" of the series, and one of the few characters that I saw to be interesting and s one of the better characters in the series.  She's sly, loves to tease, and manages to make any scene she's in just a little bit more entertaining.  In terms of development, she gets just about as much as allow the other side characters in this show get, so that hampers her character a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters for this series are very one note.  All of the characters from both the human and the vampire side are characters that don't really have much development or even character traits beyond the fundamental reason as to why they are the way they are.  The side characters are quite static in their roles, so as a result, the show wasn't really able to grow character-wise either.  Hell, Yoichi and Armin might as well be the same character like Yu and Eren.  (Same with Kimizuki and Jean). \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Some interesting characters\\n\r\n- a lot of one-note characters\\n\r\n-  Almost no character development for anyone\\n\r\n-  Character potential lost due to unused\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.66/10 and 7.00/10): The art for Owari no Seraph was created by Wit Studio, as mentioned before, the people who produced the AoT anime.  The art for the series is admittedly,  very nice looking.  The show itself uses a lot of very nicely made backgrounds which resemble heavily like a painting, a painting that really gives off that apocalyptic look to it, as well as adding a nice design flourish that makes the show very aesthetically pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the character designs and fluidity of the action are also very nice to look at.  The characters themselves look very high quality and for the amount of action that we do get in this show, it may not be worth it, but it does look very well made.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Owari no Seraph solely uses one OP and one ED for the entire runtime of the show, which are tracks that are...interspersing to say the least.  Both songs are sung in English which is a little fact about the tracks that made them more intriguing since not a lot of anime songs are sung mostly or entirely in English.  As for the memorability, the OP is decent enough for one that I would listen to several more times by itself, but the ED on the other hand is a track that I never really bothered to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great backgrounds\\n\r\n+ Nice character designs\\n\r\n+ Decent soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (5.88/10): I first looked at Owari no Seraph and thought of it to be an interesting watch.  An apocalyptic show featuring humans against vampires in a world overrun by virus and man eating mutant monsters?  Damn...that is one awesome sounding mashup.  But as I got into the show, I never really saw any of that.  The show instead focused more on a plot that went the opposite direction to what I had originally expected, which really hampered on my experience with the show and with the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nAt times, I admit that it was decent.  The action scenes that we did get looked pretty nice, and the art for the series was stellar to say the least.  Also, Shinoa.  Shinoa is the best character in this show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?  \\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph had its flaws centered around its poor story.  Because it spent more than half on its runtime on \"the power of family and friends\" the show was more of a bore than anything else and really made me question often whether this really was a show about humans fighting vampires.  There were also a lot of unexplored and unexplained plot points that raised more questions than answers, as well as an ending that really tied an unsatisfactory bow on the whole thing, which ultimately made things a lot less exciting and more and more confusing.  (Like seriously, explain how you guys get these cursed sword things, or how you are able to make a proper high school in a ruined world.  None of that actually made much sense from what I've watched). Plus nearly the whole cast was one note, so it was a bit of a bland experience.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend watching this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a hardcore Shounen fan, or just a Shounen fan in general, I would say that Owari no Seraph is a good watch then.  Personally, the show didn't really make much sense because in the long run, they don't really explain anything, but if you don't really think all that hard when watching it, this show might prove to provide a better experience.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.24/10\\n\\n\r\nAuthor's note:  if the second season was not announced, this rating would be far lower.",

            "content": "Seraph of the End is pretty much one of the most popular anime that came out this Spring season of 2015, so I'm gonna be reviewing it. \r\nSeraph of the End is about a virus of vampires that, for no fucking reason, only affects people over the age of 13. We're introduced to our MC named Yu, who now wants to kill all vampires!! Let's jump right into it.\r\n#jumpyreviews\r\nAfter watching this show, all I can say is that it's a steaming pile of shit. \r\nThe story is actually really bad. After copy pasting the first Attack on Titan episode to this series, we get theschool setting for Yu, the main character, make friends and somehow learn to be better at killing vampires. First of all, that's retarded. Second, why does he need friends to defeat the vampires? The only reason he is set in school is to make friends, they could've easily done this without shoehorning school into the mix. The problem with this is that they don't even work together, the fights are not only directed horribly at times, but the team barely works together. But this is a shounen, and everything has to be unoriginal and clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is basically him trying to kill every vampire because he wants revenge. That's it, there's not much else to it. It's boring, predictable and just plain bland. You can't say that this series is in any way original. It's just a copy and paste series that no one will mention in the next 5 years.\\n\r\nUnless it gets as popular as Attack on Titan, which I hope it doesn't. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the worst part of this anime. They're all bland and dull. \\n\\n\r\nYuichiro Hyakuya -\\n\\n\r\nYu is that typical clich\u00e9 shounen main character that wants to kill all vampires. He's a hot-headed idiot that needs no friends and wants to do everything by himself. His character never develops, he never does what he's supposed to do and is frustrating to watch. Not to mention that he's a fucking idiot. I could never care for the character, I actually wanted him to die. The show want you to care for him, but he's just too bland and annoying for me to like. \\n\\n\r\nMikaela Hyakuya - \\n\\n\r\nThey kinda try to make him work, but he's boring, stale and bland. He's probably the biggest Yandere of this year. \\n\\n\r\nShinoa -\\n\\n\r\nShe's my favorite character, not because she's a great character or has development, but because she's not generic nor boring. Her personality is what makes her stand out the most, if the show focused more on her, I think this could've been better.\\n\\n\r\nShihou Kimizuki - \\n\\n\r\nHoly shit, this guy is just horrible. The typical and clich\u00e9 character that hates and screams at everyone, but actually cares for everyone, he just can't show it for the sakes of being an asshole. Extremely unlikable and boring. \\n\\n\r\nMitsuba Sangu - \\n\\n\r\nI swear, one of the most annoying characters in the series. It's honestly hard to pick which was more annoying, they're all just so bad and bland. This one is literally the typical tsundere with a stupid backstory that never made me want to connect with the character. Mostly because she was just very unlikable. \\n\\n\r\nYoichi -\\n\\n\r\nI swear, it gets even more bland guys. This was probably a character that they could've completely erased in the series and nothing would've changed. He's a nerdy shy prick that doesn't do much at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was a pretty solid at first, but after awhile, the backgrounds were completely terrible. I'm not sure what happened, but it never blended in with the character models. The character design isn't really all that good, most of them look pretty generic, except for Shinoa and a loli vampire with pink hair. \\n\\n\r\nThe music carries the show, it's actually pretty good. The opening song is pretty good and the ending song is also pretty good. The score has its good moments and plays when it is needed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Seraph of the End is a piece of shit. I would say that you skip this or drop it if you were already a few episodes in. If I had to give it a score I would give it a 3/10. Definitely not worth your time. \\n",

I also watched Attack on titan and yes it does have similar characteristics in the characters. BUT! believe me when I tell you it is different.In this anime the story line is different then attack on titans. This anime is relative in some ways. Seraph of the End tells a story about two boys that start off in the same worlds, they even consider each other family. When they plan to escape from the vampires only one makes it out. The other was ALMOST killed. But, he was turned because the vamps favored him. Now the story goes on to tell you about the one that does survive. They grow up deeply regretting their mistakes on leaving each other. I'm not going to say anymore because I want you to watch it, now there are some shockers that I don't want to give away... So I probably spoiled a lot but, someone had to right a good review to convince others to watch it. This is truly a great anime and even with how much i have spoiled it you will still love it as much as I did. Now the fact is this anime is going to rock your world. I have never written a review before but, when i saw this and all the bad reviews I had to write one to convince you that it's nothing like Attack on Titans. I also recommend watching  Attack on Titans because it is also amazing and you will get to see the difference between them if you already haven't. Thank you for reading this review and I hope you enjoy!",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhen my brother and I were growing up at home, we always did everything together. We hung out with our neighbor friends, rode bikes, played video games; the normal, sibling stuff. But I\u2019m the older brother, and as the older brother, I was \u201cin charge.\u201d There\u2019s a distinct memory my brother always likes to bring up to sort of torment me for my immaturity. Basically, whenever my little brother wouldn\u2019t listen to me, I\u2019d warn him, \u201cIf you don\u2019t do as I say, I won\u2019t be your friend anymore.\u201d And he would always listen. Eventually, herealized that my words were moot, but today I still feel bad about treating my brother meanly. He\u2019s my family first and foremost, and I would do everything I could to protect him. Owari no Seraph is about brothers, family, and protecting the ones you love, but it turns out, it\u2019s the one that needs the saving.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nOwari seems to take place in modern times, revolving around vampires and their uprising following a virus that kills off many adult humans. Yu Hyakuya, a normal human boy, sees his family killed right before his eyes, with his purpose becoming the eradication of the species he has grown to hate so much.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at Owari a bit more closely, it\u2019s actually pretty thematically interesting. It works with two separate ideas at the same time: the definition of morality and the importance placed on family. Sometimes, it even combines the two, forming a nice set of insights that allow the viewer to question what is right, what is wrong, and what he or she would do in that same situation. But there\u2019s something holding it all back, something that the anime doesn\u2019t shake off except for in one specific area. This is the show\u2019s events not matching the tone of the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nBefore getting into the stumbling narrative, it\u2019s important to understand the previous ideas first. Morality is a concept we\u2019re all familiar with. Picking up someone\u2019s book off the ground for them is good, but taking it and throwing it in the garbage is bad. Helping someone cross the street is good, but kicking them over is bad. Often times, there is a clear-cut distinction between the correct and incorrect thing to do. The hardship comes when it isn\u2019t black or white, but instead some shade of grey. For instance, is it okay to shoot a person in self-defense? What about spending money you earned on yourself over donating it to charity? The answers aren\u2019t as easy because the situations are a bit more argumentative.\\n\\n\r\nOwari plays with this notion a bit, with both the human and vampire sides. Humanity wants to survive; they\u2019re on the brink of extinction and used essentially as cattle for the vampires. That means doing whatever it takes to defeat their adversary, to the point of going the \u201cethically concerning\u201d route of human experimentation. Is it wrong to mess with the genetics of a few people in order to save millions, especially without their consent? The same goes for the vampires. While their background isn\u2019t as out in the open, they\u2019re simply doing the same: surviving. That means sucking human blood and containing them in a manner that doesn\u2019t spread disease and famine. Are they wrong for looking out for themselves? The humans are to vampires as cows are to humans, \u201cmeat\u201d to be used for sustenance. The vampires\u2019 actions might look bad to the humans, but to them, they\u2019re merely living their lives.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout all of this, there is also the show\u2019s focus on family and how it important is. Many of the happenings during the show highlight how much family means to people. The opening sequence and Yu\u2019s inability to help, the Moon Demon squad and their relationships with each other, and even the covert operation that put the crew in danger because a little girl\u2019s info was designed to protect her family are each instances of this theme of \u201cfamily comes first.\u201d Again, the vampires don\u2019t show this as much, but instead the opposite. They don\u2019t seem to have families, and instead work for themselves rather than the betterment of those around them. This is what paints them in such a bad light; their motivations are entirely selfish and are not aimed at aiding those close to them.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why aren\u2019t these two themes \u2013 morality and family \u2013 executed as well as they can be over the course of the season? The reason was brought up in the beginning: tone. This isn\u2019t so much tonal dissonance, meaning that the tone is constantly changing. It\u2019s that what happens doesn\u2019t coincide with the tone it went for. The first episode had genocide, the murdering of children, poverty, rampant disease, and slavery. It\u2019s a grim, despondent tone, with everything being as bad as one can possibly imagine. But the remainder of the season never reaches this same level. There are no more killings, no more deplorable conditions, and nothing overtly terrible happening to anyone. In fact, many of the issues they faced are gone: demons give them power, drugs let them fight, and pockets of humanity can be found all over.\\n\\n\r\nSince the rest of the season\u2019s tone remains (nearly) consistently lower in terms of depravity, the aforementioned themes never have the chance to be explored to the extent that they should be by the anime\u2019s standards. The moral conundrums are removed since the vampires\u2019 goal is reduced down to killing humans only. Family becomes an afterthought when the cast never has anything remotely harrowing to overcome. Everything becomes rather complacent instead of the apocalyptic tension that had been initially conceived.\\n\\n\r\nEarlier, \u201cone specific area\u201d was brought up because there is a situation that does manage to have that same tone: episode eleven, right before Yu\u2019s transformation. There, Yu\u2019s dilemma mirrors his initial one; he struggles with the protection of his \u201cfamily\u201d while simultaneously dealing with the moral implications of the decision he has to make. There the tone is the same as before and subsequently the themes are as prominent as they had been. That is, when the events taking place manage to capture the same feeling as the anime is attempting to portray, the motifs it utilizes take on that same strength. The majority of Owari no Seraph does not do this, reducing its overall impact.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOwari\u2019s art manages to keep itself from blending too much together due to the pastoral direction that it takes. The background locations seem painted, varying in their severity of dilapidation to make the world feel as decrepit as it is. Abandoned cars, disheveled buildings, and concrete structures are the norm, as are wooden shacks, abandoned subway stations, and classical d\u00e9cor. It makes everything feel lonely and barren, fitting the mood while contrasting with the themes nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are fine for what they are but aren\u2019t particularly striking. This is mostly due to both the vampires and the humans each having their own outfits that every single person wears. Krul, the vampire queen, manages to look like the position she holds if only because she doesn\u2019t \u201cfollow suit,\u201d if you will. Even Yu\u2019s transformed version is lackluster; the one red-eye and jagged black wing aren\u2019t scary or foreboding. They\u2019re not comical either, instead just \u201cthere.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is severely hit or miss. When the show wants to go all-out, it can, and the fight scenes and detailed movements are nice to see. Then there is the opposite spectrum, where still frames and weird battle choreography take precedent. It\u2019s mostly somewhere down the middle, but the really good and the really bad are usually noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nMany of the characters within Owari aren\u2019t particularly engaging, mostly because the show has yet to fully develop them adequately. This is due to a common anime move where the series is (purposefully) split in two. In other words, this season gave the audience a lot of characterization and backstory for those involved. Shinoa has a deceased sister who was integral to the development of the \u201cCursed Gear,\u201d but we don\u2019t know anything else. Mitsuba has a hard time getting buddy-buddy with her comrades due to her own previous failures, but nothing more. Shihou has a sickly sister whereas Yoichi\u2019s was killed, but there isn\u2019t much more to them than that.\\n\\n\r\nIt sounds like a dilution of their characters \u2013 and to an extent, it is somewhat of a hyperbole \u2013 but this is because the show strangely keeps the focus away from them after they\u2019ve been learned about. Shihou and Yoichi, after the viewer discovers their pasts, are oddly absent from many of the dealings afterwards, saying only a few words here and there. The same goes for Mitsuba; after her initial telling and rescue, she doesn\u2019t do much besides get flustered and angry. Shinoa and Yu manage to avoid this pitfall because the anime handles their cases in the correct fashion. Rather than a \u201cget and forget\u201d approach, the show takes its time with their individual persons, both in terms of personality and importance. This should obviously be the case with Yu, so watching Shinoa put on a mask to hide her true feelings \u2013 the fear she has when fighting, the care that manifests towards Yu, and the ambivalence she probably has towards her older sister \u2013 gave her character more dimensionality compared to the others.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, even if Shinoa and Yu manage to remain prevalent, there exists another character that is so frustratingly illogical that it becomes impossible to take him and his actions seriously. This is none other than Mikaela. Now a vampire, he harbors a hate for his kind and humans\u2026which is weird, considering who he was and what he saw. Supposedly he hates all humans (except for, conveniently, Yu) because of the human experimentation they have done to him. But his reasoning makes no sense; he knows that Yu is not only a good person but so was his entire family, so extending the thinking that all humans are evil doesn\u2019t make sense. It makes even less sense when one takes the themes into context. Mikaela was always the guy who was all about family and togetherness. So him being unable to see that Yu is alive because of these humans doesn\u2019t follow his own characterization. The argument is that his turning and his time spent among the vampires has brainwashed him. This also doesn\u2019t work for two reasons: he still hates vampires and their society and he is still able to recognize Yu for whom he is despite being human. He\u2019s a poor character whose actions and thinking are asinine, which is a shame, considering how interesting his position in the anime is.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme starts off with a distinct techno vibe that doesn\u2019t fit the show\u2019s overall mood. The middle of the piece is also strangely calm despite what the show tries to work with. The latter half eventually picks up the beat, but by that point the OP has already lost its power. As for the ending theme, it definitely fits better, being gloomier in instruments and vocals. Here, the second part of the ED is favorable, replacing the apparent loss with a nice sense of hope due in part to the singer\u2019s impassioned words.\\n\\n\r\nListening to the remaining tracks of the original soundtrack isn\u2019t annoying but it also isn\u2019t too much fun, either. There are tracks befitting nearly all circumstances, such as piano medleys for those sad moments and ominous tracks for the foreboding ones. A lot of them utilize instruments and tempos that sound off-kilter to make the situations feel that much more dramatic, but aren\u2019t impressive in their own right. Unfortunately, the musical pieces all kind of mesh together after a while, becoming nothing more than background noise.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the show is somewhere around average, with no notable performances to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll admit that I was quite bored with the way this one went in the middle. I think part of it is not really knowing or understanding the vampires\u2019 side of things. I know that they have factions and their own area, but I don\u2019t know who they really are. Many of the vampires are, more or less, the same, just with different weapons and hair color. Some did bad things to others, but without knowing what makes them \u201cthem,\u201d I had no investment into their characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime provided nothing on the vampires, meaning Yu and his friends were the ones who needed to bring the entertainment. Mikaela is insufferable; that goes without saying. Yu was passable as the lead, but Shihou\u2019s constant head-butting with his similar friend was usually fun. Yoichi was a bit too wimpy, at least for now, and I wish that Mitsuba was given more time on-screen since her character seems to be one of the more interesting of the bunch. Shinoa, though, takes the cake; her smugness, sarcastic cuteness, and romantic feelings were always welcomed. Finally, if anything, the show managed to stick in my head for a few days after episode eleven; it was quite jarring and should have been like that the entire ride, not just right near the end.\\n\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph has a slew of interesting facets that each have a good amount of potential. But the execution is presently missing. The narrative needs to follow the tone, the cast needs more individual focus, and the animation needs more consistency, to name just a few problems. Considering the title of the anime, this one might need a bit of prayer to get it on the right track to conclude in a concise manner.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, interesting themes of morality and family that aren\u2019t as strong due to tonal irregularities\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, nice art style, okay character designs, about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Shinoa and Yu are characterized nicely, Shihou, Yoichi, and Mitsuba are forgotten, but worst of all is how frustratingly illogical Mikaela is\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, the middle stretch is boring, Shihou and especially Shinoa are fun, but the rest of the cast is either subpar or insufferable\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

I couldn't look away.\r\nI love how they make the cursed gears. I really like them especially when theh fight. All the character are good-looking. Mika and Yu are so cute! Shinoa and the others, they are one of my favourites too! They made the story about familyand teamwork is the important thing. I think this the best anime series I've ever seen.",

            "content": "Have you ever been compared with someone? How does it feel when you\u2019re being compared with your sibling and your sibling turns out to be praised yet you\u2019ve been degraded? You feel sad, don\u2019t you? Personally, it makes me sad too. I\u2019m always being compared to Brad Pitt when in reality, I should be compared to Hugh Jackman (my repertoire of actors is old so please forgive me). But what does it do? Do you strive harder to be more different so that comparing you to others would be avoided?How about Owari no Seraph? A show that is obviously comparable to 2013\u2019s hit series, Attackon Titan? Will it stay the same throughout or will it break from the chain? Let\u2019s find out on my first review in 4 months!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nHumans cower in fear because their natural predator, Vampires, are wrecking shit and is killing humans on the drop of a hat. Our heroes join the Moon Demon extermabullshit to hunt and kill them all to save humanities and settle their personal grudges\u2026 Wait\u2026 Seid ihr das Essen? Nein, wir sind der Jeager! \u201cSHINGEKI NO KYUKETSUKI!!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\tTalking about the story without mentioning Attack on Titan is blasphemous because the story is almost a page per page copy of the story of Attack on Titan. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same author coz I\u2019ve tried checking a couple of chapters of manga and the art is nothing like Attack on Titan. Well, I\u2019m not ruling out the possibility that maybe Hajime wrote the story and another guy drew it. You know, kinda like Ashirogi Muto in Bakuman. I don\u2019t know and I\u2019m too lazy to look so fuck me. But apart from the obvious Attack on Titan format, a lot of things do not make sense in the story. \\n\\n\r\n1.\tWhere do they get their cursed weapons? I know this is a \u201cfantasy\u201d world and shit can happen and the excuse that \u201cits fantasy\u201d can be used every time. We do know for a fact that Hiragi Mahiru (or whatever the fuck her name was), Shinoa\u2019s (or Lil\u2019 Senjougahara as I\u2019d like to call her) older sister made them but we do not know how. If that isn\u2019t explained in season 2, I\u2019ll rage quit.\\n\\n\r\n2.\tWhere did those \u201cFour Horsemen of John\u201d came from? And let me just say that that name is probably the worst name of a monster in all of anime. If they name it Horseman of John, then it would have been fine. But why the fuck FOUR WHORE-SEMEN OF JOHN? It\u2019s just one \u201cthing\u201d where the fuck does FOUR come from? Seriously? Where did they come from? Did the Vampires bring them with them when they annihilated \u201call of humanity\u201d? If so, why can\u2019t they control them, and hell, they even kill them to offer protection for their \u201clivestock\u201d. And\\n\\n\r\n3.  Who is the real enemy? Maybe I\u2019ve been watching too much Gundam but when I was watching this series I did not have a solid team which I wanted to win. I remained neutral throughout the entire series. Yes, Vampires are mostly evil but can we really say that they are the antagonists? They offer protection to humans in return for food. They fight back because if they don\u2019t they\u2019ll be killed. And can we really say that what they did in episode 1 is an extermination and not a salvation? And look at the human side of the spectrum. Politics, power struggles, human experimentation, and most high ranking officers are as arrogant as the noble-class vampires. Can we really say they are the heroes and the real enemies? \\n\\n\r\nWell, in a nutshell, the story, at least in season 1, have ton of inconsistencies and plot holes that made me question every little thing. And if you really want my honest opinion, I did not like this show and I should now call it Attack on Vampire.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n\tUnlike Attack on Titan characters, the characters in this series seem to have a thicker layer of plot armor. As of 12 episodes, no significant death has taken place\u2026 yet. But like Attack on Titan, almost all of the main character follows a straight formula. We have the typical shounen protagonist (Yu, Eren), the strong childhood friend (Mikaela and Mikasa. Both are Mika\u2026 weird), and a pussy (Yoichi, Armin). I wish you could see my face right now. Did Hajime really have something to do with this? HAH! So, yeah, let\u2019s talk about a couple of characters just to open up discussion.\\n\\n\r\n\tHyakuya Yuichiro\u2026 Eren Jeager\u2026 fuck it\u2026 I don\u2019t even\u2026 I don\u2019t even need to talk about this. Wait\u2026 Does anybody here not know who Eren Jeager is? No? Okay then\u2026 No need to talk about him then. Moving on\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\tHyakuya Mikaela\u2026 what to say about Mikaela? First, her name sounds gay. I'm sorry but no parent would name his son Mikaela\u2026 or Kamille\u2026 \\n\\n\r\n\tKamille: Kamille is a perfect name for a boy!! *punches my face*\\n\\n\r\n\tAwww\u2026 Anyways, moving on. How did Mikaela became such an arrogant piece of shit? When he was a kid, he was a cute, kid Nadeshiko. But once he became a vampire he became an ice-cold dandere? How does this work? Is it a requirement in being a vampire? And also, some weird, random, question. Do vampires age? No, seriously, think about it, in all the vampires of literature, no one seems to age once they\u2019ve been bitten. Vlad (well, he wasn't bitten but once he became a vampire, his aging stopped), Seras, Araragi, and even that motherfucker from Twilight. Years and years yet they still stay the same but Mikaela breaks the status quo and became a hot looking young men. How the fuck does that happen? \\n\\n\r\n\tAnd Hiragi (Hitagi) Shinoa. During the first few episodes, I liked her. She made me remember how much I used to like Senjougahara. Her sharp tongue was really cute for her size and I loved it. But as more events happened, she becomes too dependent on Yu and loses the light that I once adored. Though she still talks shit, she does not do so frequently which just makes me sad. I also like her \u201cahahaha\u201d laugh. Shout-out to Hayami Saori for that. Can you imagine Yukino laughing like that? Ahahaha\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\n\tHAHAHAHAHA\u2026 Did you know that WIT Studio was the one responsible for animating this show? If you didn\u2019t know WIT, the subsidiary of Production IG, also made Attack on Titan? It is now complete\u2026 Story, characters, studio, composer, director (the director is not Tetsuro Araki but he, I forgot his name, was an episode director on Titan), and even its licensor, Funimation\u2026 Everything is the fucking same! Ahh\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\tAnimation-wise, the show looks good but there are parts of it I wish they could have done better. I\u2019ve been comparing it to Attack on Titan this entire review but if I there\u2019s one thing I can  differentiate Attack on Vampire from Attack on Titan, it\u2019s the animation. The animation in Attack on Titan is its proudest joy. WIT seems to have at least spent a fortune when they made it. In Attack on Vampire, the animation did not looks as fluid as Titan. To wrap it off, I\u2019ll sum up the animation of Vampire  and Titan in just 1 word\u2026 Titan \u2013 Awesomejawdroppingamazingfabulousactionpackedthicklines. Vampire \u2013 Sad.\\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\\n\r\n\tAs a solid Hiroyuki Sawano fan, I\u2019m a bit disappointed with the musical lineup of the show. Apart from the OP, X.U., I did not like anything in the entire soundtrack. Hell, even in the series, some scenes were so eerily quiet and I was going like: \u201cPlease insert a song\u2026 any song.\u201d. You know those moments in Attack on Titan, Kill la Kill, Aldnoah.Zero, or even Guilty Crown where you go: \u201cHah! He used don\u2019t lose your way (Before My Body is Dry) again! Typical Sawano!\u201d Attack on Vampire did not have any of that. It was just silence. Clashing blades, characters talking, and some generic background noises\u2026 that\u2019s all you can hear. The closest comparison I can name on the top of my head right now is God of War: Ascension. If you played that game, you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about. Bombastic orchestral music for boss fights that was used in GoW 3 was removed and nothing can be heard apart from Kratos\u2019 grunts, metal meeting flesh, and splattering blood. That\u2019s how sad Attack on Vampire and GoW:A is when it comes to the music.\\n\\n\r\n\tMicah Solusod, Ian Sinclair, and Chris Burnett\u2026  Soul Eater Evans, Space Dandy, and\u2026 Romeo?! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! That\u2019s hilarious. No wait\u2026 I don\u2019t \u201cdon\u2019t like\u201d the dub. It\u2019s just funny that these 3 people are gathered in one show. But in all seriousness, the dub is really fucking good. Monica Rial as Krul Tepes is a nice choice. I actually don\u2019t have any problem with her playing as Krul which is surprising. I really hate all her roles apart from Kuroki and Stocking but as Krul, she was perfect. I could not ask for a better voice actress for Krul apart from Monica Rial. Now\u2026 Sub vs Dub\u2026 Hmmm\u2026. Let me think about this carefully. The subs sound cool (and I\u2019ve finished it in sub) but I kinda wish I waited and watched it dubbed. Maybe I\u2019m biased because I like dubs but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. It\u2019s probably because the Funimation lineup is better than the japo lineup. And even that guy (forgot his name) who played as Mikaela, it was his debut (according to MAL) in voicing anime. His debut\u2026 What\u2026 the\u2026 fuck?! I\u2019m out! *smashes door*\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\n\tAll in all, I actually enjoyed watching this series. It was a car crash, but it was an entertaining car crash. It was fun and mind-numbing which opened up discussions among friends. Overall, the show didn\u2019t even try to break away from the mold. It did not do anything to escape the shadow of Attack on Titan which is sad because when I watched the first episode, I thought it had potential to be Anime of The Year. And of course, like always, I was wrong. I actually have high hopes for season 2. What do I know? I haven\u2019t read the manga past what was shown on TV. Maybe it will turn out to be just like Aldnoah.Zero whereas S1 was good but S2 was shit. Maybe it\u2019ll do the opposite and season 2 will be the best season in all of anime. Who knows? Only time (and those who have read the manga(without hype)) can tell.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnd with all that said, after pulling random numbers out of my ass, molding it into a tablet to be consumed to become a black, Sepiroth-like creature (shout-out to FF VII Remake! Fuck yes!), I\u2019d give Attack on Vampire an overall score of 6.46 out of 10. Just watch Attack on Titan. Though it\u2019s incomplete, it\u2019s a much more enjoyable experience and I think S2 comes out on 2016 so\u2026 yeah\u2026 You do that.\\n\\n\r\nAlternate Anime Recommendation:\\n\\n\r\n\tFor alternate anime recommendation, why don\u2019t you try Shiki? Though not in the more shounen-like formula, Shiki also revolves around the concept of \u201ckilling vampires to save humans\u201d. Ending is a bit out there but it\u2019s still a fun series.\\n\\n\r\n\tThere\u2019s also\u2026 hmm\u2026 Ah! The ever-popular, Hellsing Ultimate. Hellsing Ultimate is not that good but the gore, the dub, and the Alucard will be worth the 10 hour experience.\\n\\n\r\n\tThat\u2019s it for me as always. Thanks again for reading. And see you, next time!\\n",

            "content": "First of all, English is not my first language, and this is also my first review, so I apologize for any mistakes. I would also like to state that I haven\u2019t read the manga, so I will judge Owari no Seraph just as a standalone anime, and not like an adaptation.\r\nOwari no Seraph is a series that had an interesting (although a little overused) setting and had a lot of potential, but it couldn\u2019t meet my expectations after the first couple of episodes. Some people compare this to Attack on Titan and, although there are indeed some similarities, there are a bunch of differences too.\r\nStory6/10:\\n\r\nThe story doesn\u2019t need too much explaining. After a terrible virus spread, vampires appeared and took over the world (or at least Japan, there\u2019s no mention to the rest of the world during the series). The protagonist, Yuuichirou, alongside all of his friends from his orphanage, is taken by the vampires and they use him and his companions as livestock. \\n\\n\r\nAfter some difficulties (he had to see how the rest of his \u201cfamily\u201d was murdered by a vampire) he escapes from the vampire\u2019s city and joins a human resistance. Yu joins the human army to kill all vampires, to avenge his family, etc. But before been able to join the army, he has to enroll in a school and make at least one friend. This school setting doesn\u2019t really works at all in a series like this, but it could have been worse\u2026 I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also follows Mikaela, a child from Yu\u2019s orphanage, who was like a brother to Yu. After being killed by a vampire, he is resurrected by another vampire, Krul Tepes, and thus, Mika becomes a vampire too. During the series, we see a little of how Mika evolves from being a vampire that feels like a human, to being a vampire who hates both vampires and humans and who only cares for Yu.\\n\\n\r\nApart from vampires and humans, there are some monsters called the Four Horseman of John, which only attack humans. I personally think they don\u2019t really add too much to the story, and they feel somehow out of place.\\n\r\nHumans fight vampires using weapons known as \u201cCursed Gears\u201d, which have \u201cdemons\u201d inside. There are different cursed gears, with different shapes and powers (Yu\u2019s cursed gear is a katana, Yoichi\u2019s is a bow with special arrows, etc.). The idea is not bad, but I would have liked more interaction between the demons and the users (only Yu interacts with his demon from time to time).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\r\nThis is the aspect of the series that I dislike the most. The characters are too stereotypical and the series don\u2019t tries to use all their potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Yu, is basically Eren 2.0. He is obsessed with killing all vampires. He\u2019s kindhearted, but also very impulsive and usually ends up disobeying his superiors\u2019 orders. There\u2019s not really much to say about him, I found Yu to be quite a boring character, and could never care too much about him \\n\\n\r\nYu makes some friends during the series. They are also quite stereotypical, but I ended up liking them more than Yu.\\n\\n\r\nYoichi is the typical shy kid that is usually scared but is able to face his fears for his friends\u2019 sake. He\u2019s the first friend Yu makes after getting away from the vampires. In one of the first episodes, he is shown to have great potential (he is the only one, apart from Shinoa, who isn\u2019t affected by Guren\u2019s demon), sadly this potential is never exploited nor even mentioned in the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nShinoa is probably the character I liked the most, apart from Mika. She\u2019s a sarcastic girl who belongs to the most powerful family of the Japanese Army, but she contents herself with being a simple sergeant. Her sister died in mysterious circumstances, but that hasn\u2019t been explained too much yet.\\n\\n\r\nYu\u2019s other friends are Shihou Kimizuki, a pink-haired boy who acts like a though guy, but deeply cares about his friends, and Mitsuba Sanguu, a blonde tsundere who tries to act like the leader of the group.\\n\\n\r\nThe last important human of the cast is Guren Ichinose, the Lieutenant Colonel of the Japanese Imperial Demon Army. He usually discusses with Yu, but he believes he has a great potential in him (we later in the series see why).\\n\\n\r\nMika was a more interesting character than Yu. I think I would have enjoyed the show more if the story had centered more in Mika\u2019s life with vampires and how he becomes less and less human. This doesn\u2019t mean that Mika doesn\u2019t get his fair amount of screen-time; he does, especially during the last part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the vampires weren\u2019t really interesting, partly because the normal vampires have none relevance at all and the nobles have all the same personality. Ferid is the most important of the vampire nobles, since he was who murdered Yu\u2019s family and the one that interacts with Mika the most (therefore, the one with most screen-time), but apart from that, his personality is exactly the same as the other nobles, like Crowley.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nThe art style was kind of weird. I\u2019m still not sure if I like it or not. It really fitted in some scenes, but sometimes it ended up distracting me a little bit. The animation was fine, although there were some moments that were really poorly animated. The animation in the battles was great, though.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe music fitted the scenes really were, but this soundtrack hasn\u2019t caught my attention too much (in fact, I cannot think of any background music that left any impression on me). I disliked the opening at first, but it end up growing on me. The ending is also pretty neat.\\n\\n\r\nOne problem I had with both the opening and the ending, although it isn\u2019t really related to the music, is that they spoil you that Mikaela doesn\u2019t die and in fact becomes a vampire, I didn\u2019t like that. I mean, Mika is an important character, and of course he had to be in the opening, but they could have at least waited to his introduction to put the OP/ED or simply introduce Mikaela as a vampire earlier in the series.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have any complaints about the voice acting. I really liked Shinoa\u2019s voice, even though it annoyed me in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nDespite not liking the characters too much, and even when the story is not extremely original, I found this anime to be quite entertaining. The action scenes were great, although I would have liked the fights more if the nobles hadn\u2019t been so overpowered. \\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum it up, Owari no Seraph is definitely not a masterpiece, and has some important flaws, but overall is an anime that you could watch just for have a little fun and if you not have anything better to watch. It\u2019s not the best anime of the year (not even the best of this season), but I\u2019ll almost surely watch the second season nevertheless.\\n",

            "content": "So Owari no Seraph has ended, with the second season starting in the October of 2015. Was it good? Probably, but it wasn't great. Owari no Seraph is something that happens when you try to mix almost all the stereotypes and then create an anime with it. Although it was predictable, it has some great elements of it's own.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe premise sounds awesome. Vampires vs Humans? This could be a really good show! Unfortunately, the story is okay, but so typical that you can 100% predict what happens next. It has some funny moments, but not too much so it will ruin the mood ofthe story. The pacing is okay, nothing to complain about.\\n\r\nThe main theme of Owari no Seraph is \"family\". It tries to show you how important it is to have a family, and is pretty good at it.\\n\r\nThere are some unexplained plot points though, like where the Four Horsemen of John came from, I thought the anime was about Vampires vs Humans? What does it have anything to do with the humans and the vampires?\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 7\\n\r\nWhen you watch an Owari no Seraph, the first thing you're gonna notice is how different the background is compared to most animes. The background is nice and beautiful, with a very nice pencil effect (also used in Fullmetal Alchemist), which really adds to the mood of the anime. Character designs are very good but the way the characters are drawn isn't anything special (pretty standard). \\n\r\nWit Studio has the tendency to spend a lot of budget to captivate the audience in the first few episodes of the animes it makes, and then running out of budget for the last episodes (see The Rolling Girls for reference) . This unfortunately is the situation for Owari no Seraph. Also with the drop in quality, Wit Studio may have spended too much on backgrounds, because the animation in characters is horrible. They uses a lot of still frame, even when in fight scenes, which ultimately makes the fight scenes extremely boring to watch\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\nSawano Hiroyuki is one of my favorite composers, because of the exciting, upbeat themes he creates, and the epic feeling that he adds to the anime which he composes (see Kill la Kill, Guilty Crown OSTs for reference). His tracks in Owari no Seraph is indeed upbeat and epic as usual, but it is nothing special (a little bit of a downgrade compared to his other works).\\n\\n\r\nHe also composes the opening the and ending theme for the anime. The opening theme, X.U, is good (but maybe a little unfitting for the anime), but the ending theme, scaPEGoat, is truly one of my favoirites. The ending theme really convey the emotion of the two main chracters, Yuu and Mika. Sawano Hiroyuki did a good job here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThe characters in Owari no Seraph hit all the stereotypes checkboxes: Yuu is basically typically your revenge MC, Kimizuki (the purple hair dude) is your hate-but-still-befriend-with-the-MC kind of guy, Yoichi is the coward guy, Shinoa the sarcastic girl. Their designs are good, but their personality is stereotypical, not much depth to it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI won't say that I had little enjoyment watching it. It was entertaining even though it was predictable. My main complaints would still be why the fight scenes were so damn short and why there were so many still frames.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nOwari no Seraph isn't anything striking or over the top. It is a solid anime for the general audience. If you're looking for an anime that has deep plot and character depth, Owari no Seraph is not the anime for you. If you just want to watch a normal anime with not much frustration, I'd recommend you this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI hope they improve on the second season though, as this anime has a lot of potential to be great.\\n\\n",

The story is decent though it doesn't give away too many detail's about question's you're gonna have about halfway into it. Literally won't tell you anything about certain things that come up in the story.\r\nOther than that thought i'll say the animation is flawless it's more of a realistic view on the world rather than cartoonish or childish. It's not that in any way the art is really good. The sound I must admit is not all that great none of the songs really stuck out to me.Did enjoy the intro though.\\n\r\nThe first episode will probably turn you off because of the pacing and the direction it takes but if you can bare through that you'll most likely enjoy the rest of the show. By the way the main character is one of those can fight really good and has a lot of potential but is a hot head and doesn't thinks things through. Yeah you've seen that type of character before personally not a fan of that.\\n\r\nBut I give it an 8/10 if you're looking for an anime definitely check it out, the dub came out recently even though the subbed version is great. Your choice, enjoy!",

Stick with this show for a few episodes and you might be surprised at how good it is.  The only thing I really don't like about this is the visual style...it really sucks at times.  The characters look fine, but sometimes the backgrounds honestly look awful.Loses major points in my book for that, but if you can ignore some of the issues with animation, this is a solid show.  Anyway, season one really builds up the suspense and leaves a lot of questions, so I can't wait for season two!",

            "content": "I must admit that I was disappointed when I finally got around to finishing Owari no Seraph. What had looked like a promising dystopian action/horror anime turned into a much tamer, somewhat lacklustre affair. It presented a few issues in particular which didn't make it so that I couldn't enjoy it, but surely tarnished my view of the anime. I will watch the second season most likely to see what they plan to do with what we learnt.\r\nStory - 6\r\nOf course it's very rare now that we find something with a completely unique plot. Most series are rehashes of common plot make up, at leastto some extent, but the difference lies in how it is executed - if the same idea is done well 3 times, and each time there's some major differences (enemy, pacing, characters, setting...) it can seem pretty unique and enjoyable each time. But I digress.\\n\r\nThe story in Seraph was not bad by any stretch, it was just a bit bland. I enjoyed the first 2/3 episodes immensely because it looked like we were getting some interesting view into a dystopian, vampire-filled future from Yu's point of view, but instead we get weird giant monsters that aren't explained (well, I don't think they were ever explained?), a boring protagonist and some very s...l...o..o..o..w pacing. 1-3 episodes were promising, quite fast paced and interesting and then up until about episode 9 we basically watched the characters meandering through their life and the events happening around or to them didn't seem to up the ante at all. There was no sense of urgency at all which didn't seem to make sense considering how deadly the vampires were described.\\n\r\nThe series was saved from a lower rating by the last two episodes, which gave a decent enough pace and enough story to create some interest in knowing what happens next season. I hope they decide to explore the concept of who are REALLY the bad guys a bit more (what was revealed in episode 11-12 could create a nice segue into exploring that).\\n\r\nIt's probably a moot point but I don't really think the Horror tag is relevant for Seraph, there was very little/no psychological aspects or anything that could be considered horror (torture, lots of blood and gore, etc). There was a little blood but I never felt particularly worried or scared about anything because unless they had the balls to do the mother of all plot twists main characters who are liked are NOT going to be killed off in an anime such as this. Anyway. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nThe art itself was nice. I noticed some really pretty backgrounds which looked like they had been done in watercolours and some of the scenery when they entered the dystopian landscape also looked painted, and it gave the art an interesting feel. The character designs were okay, nothing too startlingly original, we have the blonde tsundere one, the red haired firey guy, and the black haired, green eyed protagonist. The vampires probably had a better design overall, they looked elegant and powerful, with the exception of their queen, who was basically a Gothic Lolita. I did quite like the uniform designs that the two \"factions\" had, though. Again, the vampires' was quite elegant whilst the humans' was more practical and dark.\\n\r\nThe issue here lies within the animation. A lot of still frames with mouths moving for speech were used. There was rarely more than one character animated at once (at least to any noticeable degree). If anyone had a one-to-one battle we would see them sort of run at each other, clash weapons and just stand there talking. The fights were paced slowly because, instead of having characters go head to head in an action-filled battle, they stood and talked at each other for a while. For example when they are in the subway, the vamps just sort of stand there and watch them discussing how they should be able to take them all because they are all family or something along those lines.\\n\r\nI really wanted some high-octane battles with pretty visuals but honestly I could count the number of actual fights on one hand. They seemed to cut corners in terms of actually AVOIDING fights - again, I reference the scene in the subway. We see Yu run at one vampire and stab it. Then they all start talking again as more vamps arrive and then we see a black screen and everyone is outside. Clearly they have won the battle but why didn't they even try and include some action there?! It could have been awesome to see the group's synergy and fighting styles develop through such battles but we get no such luxury here.\\n\r\nBah.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nVoice actors did a good job, Saori Hayami is one of my favourite seiyuu though so I may be biased. This wasn't her best role in my opinion but it wasn't bad.\\n\r\nI wasn't really a fan of the OP. It fit the series fine, but I skipped it every time. It also revealed pretty big spoilers so I wouldn't recommend watching it for the first few episodes.\\n\r\nI didn't really notice the background music which is usually a sign that it is distinctly average. If there's a really terrible low-quality sound I tend to notice, conversely if there's a blood-pumping tune that's really well placed I will notice it in as much as it raises the excitement/tension of a scene. I think what music I did notice (which was usually during action scenes) was decent, though, and didn't detract from the experience overall.\\n\r\nHonestly there wasn't much to say in terms of sound effects. They were good, sounded like what they were supposed to and all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\r\nI was expecting to give character a high mark on starting this anime but honestly this was one of the most disappointing aspects of this anime for me. I'll go through the main problem areas first.\\n\\n\r\n- Yu's character could have been interesting, but ended up being kind of bland and nonsensical.\\n\r\nOkay, so. Generic revenge-driven protagonist? Check. I MUST PROTECT MY FRIENDS complex? Check. All good so far - nothing out of the ordinary for a Shounen-type anime. But where it gets weird is that's literally all that defines Yu. He didn't want friends or family but was forced into his first 'family' and forced to make friends at the school later on. And yet he strives to protect them. Huh? His other noticeable trait is that he is easy to anger and usually acts without thinking. But three traits don't make an interesting character because there's no flesh there, just bare bones. What does he like to eat/drink? What is he actually interested in? Maybe he has a secret thing that he loves or enjoys doing? But all we know is he hates vampires, wants to kill vampires, and apparently loves Mika and his friends. And often gets angry without thinking.\\n\\n\r\n- There was little/no development throughout the series.\\n\r\n//SPOILERS! I would have had a little more sympathy for Yu's character if we had actually seen his skills/personality develop, but all we get is revenge revenge and family. Yu is somehow able to defeat the first demon without even knowing what it could really do, what's at stake, HOW to defeat it, he just runs in and is somehow able to overcome the mental obstacle all on his own. Then when he gets his weapon, he doesn't need to practice or anything, he's just suddenly a master of swordsmanship. I know this is rather common in Shounen (the main character being overpowered or gaining some new ability out of nowhere) but honestly I just sighed inwardly when they all gained their respective weapons and were able to use them without practicing. Yoichi can shoot a bow? Check. Red-hair glasses guy can use twin swords perfectly? Check.\\n\r\nI know the anime only had a short span of 12 episodes for the first season, but if the way they \"develop\" characters makes me roll my eyes something is up. //END SPOILERS.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the other characters weren't particularly memorable. The ones that stuck in my mind most are the vampire queen and Ferid. I was interested in Ferid's relationship to Mika and what went on before the first episode and I was interested to know why the queen was so interested in Mika. But we barely see them throughout the series, which is a shame. Maybe they will give them some screen time next season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nHonestly, I can enjoy almost any anime if I set my mind to 'standby' and just watch without being critical. I enjoyed Seraph to a degree, the first few episodes piqued my interest but I was disappointed until episode 11-12.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think people would enjoy this anime a) if they really like dystopia/vampires (though be warned, we don't see that much vampire activity) and b) if they don't mind the lack of action. I think those who are able to watch anime without a critical/analytical mindset would enjoy it more than those who watch anime and look at it critically/analytically. The premise is similar to Attack on Titan, Black Bullet, the currently airing Kuuden Madoushi...so if you enjoy that kind of anime, give it a bash, you might enjoy it, particularly as something to watch between powerhouse series. However I wouldn't recommend it to those who watch anime with an analytical eye, as the cons outweigh the pros in the most important areas.",

            "content": "I'm only writing the review since most of the reviews here seem to be pretty low scored, so maybe someone wants the opinion of a person who enjoyed the anime?\r\nFacts you should know that largely influence my opinion: I am a girl and I like shounen ai (boys love). \r\nWhile this anime isn't strictly geared towards a female audience particularly, I felt like maybe there were certain elements girls might appreciate more than the male audience. The abundance of bishonen is a great example. \r\nIn any case, if you're still with me onwards towards the breakdown!\r\nStory: 6-7\r\nI think the story is fair. The other reviewersare right in saying that the story is very trope-ish with a lot going on, but I didn't particularly mind. It wasn't hard to follow, and sometimes I want to indulge in a little guilty pleasure of special MCs, hierarchy climbing systems, bishounen fights and quirky female characters. \\n\\n\r\nBut I wouldn't brush most of the story with the same stroke - after all, I've only watched the 12 episodes provided. I don't know if they're going to delve deeper, but from the last episodes subtle clues I can definitely guess we've only scratched the superficial surface of what the story really is. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI really liked the art. The fight scenes were really good, better than a lot of shounen animes these days for sure. I really enjoyed the abundance of colours from the characters appearances, the landscapes, their weapons and so on.  \\n\\n\r\nThe designs for the weapons in particular really caught my eyes, they almost seemed to be good enough to be used in video games in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7-8\\n\r\nI really like the OP and ED, and the music in between was well suited to each scene (e.g.  the angsty flash backs, the fights, hints of romance scenes). No memorable OST if you're into that, though. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nYu and Mika are officially the mains characters, but outside of their obsession with each other, there isn't much to be said outstandingly for them. Yu is the typical caring MC that looks out for his friends, hates injustice and draws people to him without really consciously doing it - so a typical shounen main character. Not bad, but nothing really amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime did a good job with the female characters in my opinion, and I really liked Shinoa and Mitsu towards the end. Kimizaki also grew on me because I'm a sucker for tsundere boys (even though he's technically frost bitten through most of the show). \\n\\n\r\nI think the show did a good job in getting you to feel for the characters. I got caught up in Yu's emotions just as easily as I was played into hating the Guren. These aren't flat characters whom you watch impassively. I was drawn in enough that I'm interested in reading the manga to see what happens to them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall 8\\n\r\nLike I said, I'm willing to go to the manga to continue on the plot which is a rarity for me since I'm willing to leave animes well enough alone at the ending they choose to cut off at. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights scenes and tension were good enough that I think this definitely fits into the shounen genre, and the small bits of comedy kept me happy enough to balance out the angst. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I particularly enjoyed that others might not is the chemistry between Mika and Yu. Not all people enjoy shounen-ai and while this isn't listed as such, it definitely carries an undercurrent of it and it would be amiss of me not to mention such. In that way it kind of appeals to shougo readers as well because there is a distinct element of wanting to 'fix' the other character, something that could only be done through friendship and love. While I definitely don't think this show is going to choose that route (the clear nihilistic line between vampires and humans this show plays to doesn't seem to call for an end other than the extinction of the other if you know what I mean) if you choose to come along for the ride, you're going to have to be prepared for how much Yu and Mika's relationship/brothership/friendship is vital to the plot. \\n\\n\r\nHope this helps anyone that was looking for the opinion of someone who enjoyed it. It may not be what you expected, but this is my honest take on the show. I'll be looking forward to their season 2 coming in October. \\n",

            "content": "You know, I've never been a huge fan of vampires. It became such a mainstream story and I hate mainstream. Yet, I made my self to watch this vampire anime. I did it because it is not that usual 'stab the vampire with a dagger in the heart to kill it' story, but more...anime like. In the end, I really liked it. Give it up for the review on Owari no Seraph.\r\n Plot and Story Line \r\nOwari no Seraph is an action, supernatural and drama anime that aired in 2015. It has two seasons: Owari no Seraph and Owari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen. The MALcommunity rated it as a 7,66 which is in my opinion just the right rating for this anime. When it comes to the plot of Owari no Seraph, it is set in a post-apocalyptic  world in which a virus kills all those above 13. In such a world, Yuuichirou and Mikaela, two boys from the Hyakuya orphanage, became livestock for the vampires that suddenly emerged. In order to survive and be protected the boys along with all the other children that survived give their blood to the vampires. Having enough of the vampires' cruel reign, Mikaela comes up with an escape plan that was doomed to fail. Only Yuuichirou manages to escape while the others were killed. He is later rescued by the Moon Demon Company, a military unit that exterminates the vampires in Japan. A couple of years later, Yiiichirou becomes a member of the Japanese Imperial Demon Army eager to take revenge on the creatures that murdered his family. \\n\r\nThe story of Owari no Seraph is, as I mentioned in the beginning, different. The vampires in this story are cool, they have amazing powers and weapons and they are not that Twilight -type vampires. More importantly, the way the vampires are being fought are not conventional and medieval. Instead of using garlic, silver, holy water etc. the Imperial Demon Army uses demon possessed weapons to kill them. You have all kinds of weapons and demons and that's the thing I liked most about Owari no Seraph. And of course with great powers and weapons comes great action. The fights and action in Owari no Seraph is amazing. Made me even watch a couple of fights again. \\n\r\nStill, the action is not in the center of the story. The axis of Owari no Seraph is Yuu's fight between the will to revenge his family and the inner demon. Hist steady talk about how important family and friends are and how he disobeys orders just to save his comrades becomes a bit boring over the time, but that's what drives him forward. He fights, he wants to become stronger and so he does. \\n\r\nOne thing that disappointed me in Owari no Seraph is when Guren (General of the Moon Demon Company) finds Yuu after his escape, he says :\"Good, he's here. Just like the prophecy said. One of the test subjects from the Hyakuya Laboratories appeared\". What prophecy? I was so excited about that legend-prophecy stuff that I thought would come, but it didn't. They never mentioned that again. I don't know if the third season will tell us something about it more but for now, it leaves us in the dark.\\n\r\nBy the way, Owari no Seraph has that \"I knew it\" plot-twist right in the beginning. It makes the whole story really dramatic from the beginning to the end. Surprisingly you have one more plot-twist in the end, but it's more a \"What on Earth\" kind of plot-twist. That one reveals the secret about the Seraph of the end. Just so you know a Seraph is a type of celestial or heavenly being in Christianity and Judaism. I know what you think, what does such a being have to do with vampires but you shall see...Angels would know *wink*\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThis is one of those anime in which my favorite character becomes the evil queen. The queen of the vampires, Krul Tepes, is such an awesome character. She is that cool and thug girl or young woman, I can't really tell. She is a vampire that is more than 200 years old. And even though she is so strong and amazing, she still has a pinch of good inside of her. I loved her.Our main character Yuuichirou reminds me of Naruto in a lot of ways. The \"I will become strong to save my friends and I can do everything\" attitude is what makes him stand out. He does complicate things a lot because of that but okay...Every anime needs one. Also very awesome characters are Guren and Shinoa. I loved them both. The thing about the characters in Owari no Seraph is that they all kinda fight that inner battle with their self. They all have a sad background story they need to overcome and in that way we get to know every character one by one. Guren's story is one of my favorites even tough it's basically a love story. Also, it is maybe one of the most important stories because it affects the end of the anime a lot.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Style\\n\r\nI'll make this one very, very short. The animation is amazing. Awesome. The style has something other anime don't. It took me some time to think about it, but I got it now. In some scenes you can see that the black outline is a bit sloppy. I really look into details too much, don't I?\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nGo watch Owari no Seraph now. It doesn't matter if you like vampires or not, you'll like it because this story is on a completely new level. It is interesting, intriguing, dramatic and full of action. So enjoy!",

            "content": "Alright, I've already seen both seasons, but I'm just going to write a review for this season. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It's hard to find a good vampire anime out there.\r\nStory 8/10: The story itself was pretty good. I will admit though, later on the story was very well written and had an original feel to it. There were so many enjoyable plot twists and almost every episode left you on some sort of cliffhanger. Although tense, it wasn't too the point where it gets boring, which I liked.\r\nArt 10/10: I REALLY liked the art style, definitely one of thehighest points. Many animes make the background look like a 2D animation, which is okay, but I prefer animes with real art. I believe that the reason I liked the art so much was because of the more \"realistic\" feel it added. It worked amazingly well with the animation style, and was just overall outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: I will admit, I enjoyed the background music throughout most of the season. Although, at some scenes, I thought that they could have changed the music to make it fit better. However, most of the music used works well with what it was paired with. The voice acting, on the other hand, wasn't as great. I know that it's hard to pair up voices with movements, but I believe that they could have done a better job. Overall, the sound was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10: I honestly LOVED the characters. This was a good anime in terms of getting you attached to everyone. I loved all of the different personalities, the different ways everyone handled a situation, and many other reasons. I'm not a big softie, yet this season had me in TEARS because of the characters at some points. The character development was okay, although I think that they could have added in a little bit more changes. Overall, pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Even though I didn't rate everything else as high, the enjoyment is WAY up there. It's so action packed and full of mysteries, there's practically one around every corner! The plot twists are the main reason why I found this so enjoyable. You expect something to happen and then, BAM, something you NEVER would have expected pops up instead. Overall, EPIC.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: I would TOTALLY have rated it 10/10, except I'm looking at what COULD and SHOULD have happened. I loved it though, and this is my FAVORITE ANIME OF ALL TIME! I recommend this to many people, and everyone I've recommended it to loved it as well.\\n\\n\r\nExtra Advice: I absolutely CANNOT STAND when people compare this anime and another, especially Attack on Titan. this goes for all animes. I'm not pointing anyone out, but it's so rude. Attack on Titan is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANIME, and although they may have a similar story line, you shouldn't judge them like that. I just think that comparing two different animes and looking at it like that it a horrible way of writing a review. (I mean no offense to anyone who did, that's your own opinion, and this is my own opinion)",

            "content": "Owari no Still Frames isn't even close to being the end of still frames, it's got more still frames than you can shake a Fairy Tail guild tattoo at.\r\nCommonly referred to as a gayer version of Twilight, Owari no Seraph is a popcorn show where by the end of it all, the popcorn is the only thing you remember. Generic in every sense of the word, it's impressive how non-hype this series can be at times. Wasn't this supposed to be about slaying vampires? Humanity is in danger, war is everywhere, people are dying left and right! Even if the story sucks, something like thisshould at least be mildly entertaining, yet you know something is wrong when the most entertaining aspect of the show is the sarcastic wit of a midget. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWithout even diving into the actual story, Owari no Seraph's setting itself is just... I don't know. Why is there a virus? Why does it not affect kids? Why does a vampire noble who is later shown to be completely overpowered get taken by surprise by a kid? How does a kid who got pierced right through the chest not get instantly killed when other kids instantly die from seemingly less extreme injuries? How is a kid able to trot his way towards the exit of the vampire camp when vampires are clearly shown to be much faster? The inconsistency of this story's own setting is mindnumbingly hilarious, yet the inconsistency of said world somehow didn't make the story any less predictable. Now that's an oxymoron to end them all.\\n\\n\r\nI went into Owari no Seraph 100% spoiler free, yet I predicted the events of episode 1 with no problem at all. I mean come on. A bunch of kids overly preachy about the whole family aspect, the main kid, normally angsty and anti social, finally accepts the idea that he has a family, smartass yet dumbass blonde friend plans an escape as a family, they are all happy and excited to escape as a family until OH BOY they are finally about to reach the exit! If you can't imagine what happens next, well I don't know what to tell you. After that whole fiasco, main character is the only one to escape, and low and behold, humans are right outside to greet him and, get this, the main officer Guren says that the PROPHECY came true. Yeah, you read that right. The PROPHECY of a kid escaping the vampire camp, this kid is the chosen one! Of course once you get to know Guren's character, you realize that it is very possible that he was just being a sarcastic git like usual, yet this would also mean that he had absolutely no reason to just randomly be there with minimal amount of soldiers in front of a massive vampire camp. So either way, it's a lose-lose dumb-dumb situation.\\n\\n\r\nQueue the time skip, and we see our dumb protagonist being dumb and then being put into a goddamn high school situation. Even this part is predictable. Main character ends up sitting near the window, shenanigans ensue, it becomes a high school romcom for a few episodes. Then, we get to the demon contracting part, which is determined by... willpower. Wow, I am really feeling the hype!\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to give any sort of credit where it is due, it's that Owari no Seraph doesn't drag itself out as much as other shows of its nature do. I'm looking at you, Attack on Titan. The whole reunion of Yuu and Mika was something that everyone was looking forward to, and while yes the story did delay this reunion with some sort of side mission that had basically no impact on the story or character progression, when the main event did happen, it happened. There was no flashback to the past or any bullshit like that, something that AoT was quite fond of, hell, there wasn't even a minor episode recap on that episode. It cut right to the action. Shows of this nature have the tendency to drag out the pacing with unnecessary flashbacks, character monologues, or other filler, or straight up delay the entire event to another arc in order to \"leave the viewers on the edge of their seats.\" Thankfully, Owari no Seraph did minimal time wasting, and the event itself was definitely one of the better ones in the story as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nOh man, a huge battle is about to happen. Vampires and humans draw their weapons, they glare at each other, the command to attack is given, and then BOOM! Right into a still frame! The sounds of swords clashing in the background continue as BOOM! Another still frame! Oh, but they added the \"intense anime lines\" special effects to let you know that they are indeed battling. Owari no Still Frames denies its viewers the hype they crave with some of the most inconsistent animation and art in the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation had moments of goodness. The first spar between Shinoa and Yuu had impact, choreography, and cool special effects. Well, that's all and good right? WRONG, because Shinoa's character design becomes a scrunched up piece of shit as a result! Please Owari no Still Frames, why you gotta give us one over the other? Not to mention, this fight probably has the best animation quality and choreography in the entirety of the first season, yet it's a spar on top of a fucking high school. Meanwhile, the massive battles between the army and the vampires are essentially just manga panels with sound effects. It's a shame that the hype never fully delivers, and the animation and art had something to do with that.\\n\\n\r\nAt their best, the art and character designs are pretty good though, however they don't really seem to fit the backgrounds. The backgrounds look like paintings, and the characters clearly stand out and not in a good way. It makes it feel like an unprofessional work. However, they aren't grating to the eyes in any way, but of course, that is only when the artwork and character designs are at their best.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nFor such a hype machine that Hiroyuki Sawano is, his compositions for Owari no Seraph are very mellow in comparison. While many associate his Owari no Seraph soundtrack as one of his weakest as a result, I think it actually kind of fits the hypeless plot of Owari no Seraph in an ironic way. Owari no Seraph is more somber than it is epic, and the more mellow orchestration of its soundtrack kind of supports that feeling. Of course, that means that when it is supposed to get hypey, the soundtrack leaves more to be desired. However, it is still a fairly good listening experience, and the OP is hella catchy as well.\\n\\n\r\nOn the side of seiyuu things, they are all very good. Their performances all give the viewers a general sense of their character's personality without it being directly stated. For example, you can easily tell that Ferid is the playful yet sinister type and that Crowley is the calm one with a sense of curiosity just by their voice, even before their actions make it obvious. Also hats off to Shinoa's seiyuu for a sassy voice so teasing that it even makes me mad at the character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I want to give a shout out to our obnoxious midget Hiiragi Shinoa, the proud winner of my \"Favorite Character from my Least Favorite Anime\" award! Her sass, her reasoning behind why she is so sassy, not to mention her overall aesthetic of being a badass scythe wielder are all things I can get behind. She's basically one massive middle finger to the usual generic-ness of Owari no Seraph, and I appreciate that more than anything. Congrats Owari no Seraph, you've been saved from an even lower score in the character department and enjoyment department by your lovely yet piece of shit loli.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the characters, they are tropes and nothing else. I'm pretty sure everyone knows this, but Yuu is just Eren Jaeger 2.0, and it's not like Eren Jaeger was all that special as a character either. He starts off being the most unlikeable edgy loser who hates people and wants to kill vampires, and nothing else. His friends are Yoichi, a shy guy. What else is he besides a shy guy? Who knows, and who cares? There's also Kimizuki, a male tsundere. What else is he besides a male tsundere? Who knows, and who cares?\\n\\n\r\nThere are 2 other characters besides Shinoa who hold a shred of interesting qualities. Mika is the deteuragonist, and he is definitely at least way more interesting than Yuu. (Hell, even the Owari no Seraph specials blatantly point out how Mika is way more interesting, as well as how marketable Shinoa is. This is why the Owari no Seraph specials are a masterpiece.) Anyways, he still suffers from inconsistency, especially in his IQ in the first episode. He's a smartass for even planning such a complex strategy to escape, but he's also a dumbass for doing so. There is a scene where he shows extreme compassion for humans when he is a vampire, yet he is still depicted as untrusting and disgusted by humans. Yeah, he's probably just psychologically conflicted due to his circumstances, yet the unfathomability of his circumstances make me just not care.\\n\\n\r\nThe other interesting one is Guren, for he is one of the only characters that has more about him hidden than what meets the eye. I can tell that there is some juicy back story behind his morals and overall personality, something which I hope gets expanded on in the second season. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nBecause Shinoa existed, I can't call Owari no Seraph boring by any means. It's dumb and brainless, and nowhere near the most enjoyable anime in the world, but it's also not the most boring thing either. However, while it has moments of mild entertainment once in a while, it lacks any sort of satisfaction, which means I can't recommend this show to anyone without feeling like a time wasting monster afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, it's a time waster, but it has Shinoa, so go for it I guess. I can also see it being enjoyable for someone who is brand new to anime, as they aren't as cynical about tropes as the rest of us. \\n",

            "content": "When I went into watching this show, was I looking for deep, powerful, and moving character relationships and development? No. I was expecting some badass sexy vampires fighting ridiculously young teenage soldiers in swanky uniforms. And I was not disappointed.\r\nStory:5/10\r\nThe best way to describe the story is to say it's Attack on Titan with vampires. Basically, vampires are enormous assholes that are ridiculously stronger than humans and treat them like livestock. But just because it's an unoriginal story doesn't mean it's not fun to watch.\r\nArt:6/10\r\nThe character designs are good. The backgrounds are good. Do they look good together? Eh, not really. \r\nSound: 8/10\r\nI personallyliked the OP and the soundtrack itself was pretty good. Not a big fan of the ED, but overall, the sound fit the rest of the show pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:5/10\\n\r\nOkay. So here the cliches start to kick in, especially when it comes to the protagonist, who is basically drooling with the desire to get revenge and murder every last vampire (twice, if possible.)  The only character I thought was pretty unique was Kimizuki, whose laid-back attitude was pretty interesting as opposed to all the other girls, who did nothing but yell at the protaganist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThis show is by no means a masterpiece, but it was fun to watch! I wouldn't necessarily call it a guilty pleasure, but it does seem like it's getting a lot of hate from other viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a mind blowing, life changing anime, go somewhere else. But if you wanna lay back and watch some teenagers and vampires blow shit up and try and kill each other, you're gonna have a great ride. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "As someone who read the manga first and then watched the anime, I have quite mixed feelings over it. Some bits are amazingly good and some bits are amazingly bad. \r\nIn this first season the story is good. The first episode is thrilling, then episodes 2-7 feel rather slow and fillery but it gets exciting again from episodes 8 onwards. The plot in itself is quite interesting and although a lot of it is cliche, it's still enjoyable enough to get into. The anime team did a superb job in their attention to details in the way the opening/ending is full of plot details andcharacter portrayal (especially when you read the lyrics).\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest downfall of this anime is its art and sound. It's understandable that it's impossible for every frame of an anime to be high quality animation, but it gets worrying when whole episodes were badly animated (cough episode 5 cough). You'd get jerky, low quality, quite frankly weird scenes and then a detailed close up of scenery/background which made you wonder who on earth was in charge of this budget. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the soundtrack was weird. I mean a lot of it was quite good by itself, but it often felt like the music didn't quite match the scenes it was used for (but this was more of a problem in the first half and the final 10 mins of the show, not in the second half).\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all of that Owari no Seraph was hugely enjoyable once you get into it. The first half of the season felt cliche but the second half got much more interesting. The character development of the main character is also quite touching, so if you're put off by his angry shounen personality at the start then don't drop it! Trust me he mellows out. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day the key major scenes were pulled off perfectly and I'm interested in how season 2 will turn out. Would recommend this anime not as a perfect amazing masterpiece, but still fun enough to watch if you're interested",

            "content": "Seraph of the End Thoughts/Review \r\nStory: Story wise, the anime had a lot of potential and premise, but it also shows similarities to other clich\u00e9s and tropes from other modern anime (Attack on Titan and Black Bullet). Humanity is mostly wiped out by an unknown virus leaving a tenth of its population in surviving. Our main character survives the outbreak and it shows his struggles in the new world. What I liked about the story was the introduction to the setting, I mean everyone died in the first 20 secs. NOW that escalated quickly. The separation of our main characters Yu and Mikaela was alsoan interesting plot device when we realized in the opening, that he was still alive. It reminded me a lot of Aldnoah Zero where we see two perspectives from the respective sides of the story. The only flaw I saw in the story was the slow pacing. The first 2 episodes set the story, but on wards it felt dragged to the point where I felt 3 of the episodes could be combined into a single one. It wasn\u2019t until episode 11 that finally shit went down! As for the conclusion, it was very anti-climactic and lack luster with only more questions. It didn\u2019t hype me up for the 2nd season, but nonetheless I\u2019ll be watching it for answers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I liked the characters, but the emphasis on bonds and friendships often suffocated me in taking it seriously enough. Yu is a hard headed individual with social issues in the beginning because of his past and is dead set on vengeance since his childhood incident. We see him develop more into a friendly character and is confirmed in being a tsundere waifu. Shinoa, our female lead character, is my favorite in that her personality is different from all the characters in the series. She\u2019s playful and quite the jokester towards everyone and mostly Yu. In other wards she\u2019s a real life troll to me. Now I know what you\u2019re thinking, is there romance? Strictly speaking minimal. The relationships between the characters are all about friendship and being comrades with similar circumstances. What I don\u2019t get is the relationship between Shinoa and Yu, there was no signs or rather visible signs Shinoa was interested in Yu until the ending. But hey, I like that pairing more than Yu x Mikaela. We will have to see for more. Next character I\u2019ll be talking about is Mikaela, there\u2019s not much to say here since he DOESN\u2019T GET SCREEN TIME FOR 10 EPISODES. He\u2019s basically the only person who is recognized by Yu as true family or like a brother. He\u2019s willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of others while Yu will not let anyone near him be taken away from him. His true motives aren\u2019t revealed until the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: As for the animation, I honestly think the animation is rather poor. I expected amazingness from the Wit Studio, the animators for Attack on Titan, but it obviously didn\u2019t transfer over. The main issue I have is the backgrounds, which though are beautiful by themselves, only make the animated characters look bad. The water painting like look makes the cell shaded characters stand out more which lets us see some poor looking animation from a distance. It\u2019s like in the old days where in Dragon ball Z, you saw and knew what rock was going to blow up before the attack. Also with more than 90% of the characters wielding swords, I expected at least a decent number of sword fighting sequences, not quick time single slash attacks. I\u2019m sorry to admit, but the preview and opening have the best animation sequences compared to the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Probably the highest score I\u2019m giving it. The OST is created by my favorite composer, the godly Hiroyuki Sawano. Same composer who created music for Attack on Titan, Kill la kill, Aldnoah Zero, and my favorite Guitly Crown. The music fit really well throughout the series and the opening sounds amazing. I didn\u2019t realize it was all English until I found the lyrics for it online. It stuck to me when I first saw the preview for the anime and the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: Binge Watch it. Or skip over until 2nd season comes then binge watch all of it.\\n\\n\r\nSeraph of The End has an adrenaline pumping start, but the slow pacing makes the anime stale until the very end where we crave answers.\\n",

            "content": "*this is a review for both seasons of OnS. \r\nI had heard a lot about Seraph of the End before I actually decided to watch it. It wasn't immensely popular, but I had heard some talk of it in the anime community and I even had a few friends that really liked it. I didn't have any interest for a while because it is a vampire anime and those typically aren't my thing. But I decided to give it a shot and I found that I really enjoyed it. \r\nThe series is still ongoing, so some of these opinions are probably going to change. HoweverWIT Studio has yet to confirm a season 3, so it's unknown if the anime series is truly complete or not.\\n\\n\r\nSo, let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nFirst up is art/animation\\n\\n\r\nFor those who don't know, Seraph of the End was animated by WIT Studio. They are responsible for the animation masterpiece known as Attack on Titan. And while I don't think the visuals for SOTE can quite compare to AOT, they are quite stunning. The hand-painted backgrounds were all beautiful and really helped to set the mood of the scene. The characters and objects were all animated exceptionally well and I found that there were very few errors or inconsistencies. I wouldn't call it perfect, but it was fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI highly enjoyed the soundtrack for SOTE. The first opening, X.U, has incredible English vocals and is a really catchy song, along with the second opening. Both of the endings were also spectacular, but I was particularly fond of \"ScaePEGoat\". There are several noteworthy pieces on the OST, but all of them really helped to set the mood of the scene and it really made the viewer feel something as they were watching. It was almost like I could feel the emotions of the characters as I watched.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all exceptional despite some of them being very blatant archetypes. The only characters that I can see as the exception to this are Shinoa and Mikaela. \\n\\n\r\nShinoa has a very unique personality. She's got a mixture of traits that make her a very likeable character with a lot of complexity. She\u2019s humorous, sarcastic, and witty, and occasionally her sense of humor can become morbid or vulgar. However, she knows when to be serious and she\u2019s incredibly good at talking her way out of things. I don't think there's a lot of characters in anime like her.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s Mikaela, my personal favorite character and the most interesting to me. To me, Mika goes through the most development as the series progresses, however this development is obviously very negative, and as a result of this his morals are hard to figure out. But that\u2019s what makes him interesting. Mika started out as a bubbly and happy-go-lucky kid, all smiles and touches. But he was smart too, very smart, and he could manipulate people to get what he wanted at a very young age. Mika also undergoes a lot of psychological torment as the series goes on, and his story is interesting because of it. The audience gets to witness him struggle between his bloodlust and his desire to see Yuu again, as he didn\u2019t want Yuu to see him as a monster. He refrained from drinking human blood for that exact reason. He also struggles with his own self worth, as not only himself but everyone around him make(s) him feel pretty terrible about himself. The only people that care about Mikaela are of course Yuu and possibly Krul. This knowledge is what drives him forward. Yuu is his only reason for going on.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, I\u2019ve rambled on long enough about Mika. Now on to our other characters.\\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019ll save Yuu for last, because I have a lot to say about him. Let\u2019s start with the first squad member that we met (except for Shinoa, who I already discussed), Yoichi.\\n\\n\r\nYoichi is your stereotypical \u201cweak\u201d character. He\u2019s depicted as fragile and even has the appearance of a weakling, with a round face, wide eyes, and a meek voice. Characters like these are often portrayed this way in anime. He starts out as just someone that needs protection, like these characters often do. But he quickly becomes Yuu\u2019s friend, and the audience discovers that despite his weak appearance, he is a lot like Yuu. I do think that Yoichi probably received the most development out of everyone in the squad besides Yuu. He goes from weak and in need of protection to strong and independent. His strength grows tremendously as the desire to protect his new family outweighs his old desire for revenge, similarly to Yuu. Yoichi may have different ways of showing it, but he and Yuu are very alike. \\n\\n\r\nOn to Kimizuki. Kimizuki adds a realistic balance to the group that I like. He\u2019s a realist, and he\u2019s quite blunt about it. He\u2019s also very cynical and down to earth. However, he didn\u2019t have much time to really \u201cbe a kid\u201d, none of the squad members really did. But Kimizuki is a special case because he had to abandon all of what he was to take care of Mirai. His demon, Kiseki-ou, points out that Kimizuki thought that Mirai was a bother, and that he shouldn\u2019t have to be the one to take care of her. Kimizuki was never allowed the chance to grow up, and as a result he has a very grim view of the world. However, with Yuu and his squad he is able to see other things, new things, and the possibility of a future with them. This drives him to protect them ad care for them as if they were his own family. \\n\\n\r\nAnd last but certainly not least, Mitsuba. Mitsuba is definitely the stereotypical tsundere of the group, but with good reason. She relies strongly on planning and formation, and prefers logic over emotion when making decisions, since emotion was what got her comrades killed. She\u2019s also a realist like Kimizuki, but in a different way. She does see the world as a dark and grim place. But she is able to find beauty in it in a way that Kimizuki doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s Yuu and the others that help her to see it, which spawns her desire to stay with them and form a family with them. \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, last but not least, Yuu. \\n\\n\r\nYuu has often been criticized in the past for being a carbon copy of Eren Jaeger. And yes, to some extent that\u2019s true. Yuu does share a lot of similarities to Eren. However, I find Yuu to be a much more bubbly character than Eren. This may just be because Attack on Titan is more serious than Seraph of the End. But Yuu seems to be able to see more of the good in life, especially after reuniting with Mika. He\u2019s kind to everyone he meets, and he has this way about him that just makes everyone around him become drawn to him. Eren doesn\u2019t have this kind of charisma, and seems to respond to new people with distrust, which is understandable. Yuu is also na\u00efve, which Mika notes, and people take advantage of him because of it. \\n\\n\r\nThe creator himself said that Yuu has an ability to make everyone around him love him. And I do think that this is true to some extent. Because everyone that Yuu has formed a relationship with loves him in some way. He has a sort of charm that is unique to him and only him. I feel that Yuu has formed a bond with his companions that you don't see very often. He does have some qualities that are typical to shounen manga characters, but I do think he\u2019s not your typical shounen hero. He contrasts greatly with characters like Naruto Uzumaki or Natsu Dragneel. He reminds me more of Son Goku or Luffy D. Monkey, just minus all of the excessive overconfidence. Yes, Yuu is quite cocky in the beginning, but he quickly learns to get better with that. It becomes less about confidence and more about selflessness for him. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, Yuu is actually a brat in the first half of the first season. He's completely anti-social and doesn't care for people much at all. He has no desire to make friends and is only interested in power. However, the development he undergoes as the series progresses is phenomenal. His personality almost does a complete 180. He goes from anti-social, rude, arrogant, and selfish, to sweet, kind, caring, protective, and friendly. It's right around the time that he discovers that Mikaela is alive that I think his personality change really becomes noticeable. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationships between the characters are all very interesting. Yuu develops a very intense friendship with his squad. He values them all equally, and considers their lives to be much more valuable than his own. And, as a result of this, he probably doesn\u2019t realize just how much his squad loves him. \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, story.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot structure is also pretty typical to shounen series. It moves agonizingly slow, unfortunately. But it is interesting, as it kept me invested for the entire series. While watching it, I never really got bored, except for maybe during the first few episodes. There were quite a few twists that really did shock me, especially during the second season. And it\u2019s difficult to do that, as I can usually tell a predictable series from a mile away. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole \"teenagers living in an apocalyptic world\" thing has been done so many times, but I think SOTE did it well. I like the originality of the vampires; I didn't get a Twilight feeling while watching SOTE, which is good. The vampires truly do scare me to an extent, but they are also likeable, especially characters like Ferid Bathory, Krul Tepes, Crowley Eusford, and of course, Mikaela. \\n\\n\r\nI've seen a lot of people accuse this anime of being a carbon copy of Attack on Titan and... it's not?? Yes, there are several elements of the anime that are similar to Attack on Titan. But, it's not like there aren't tons of other anime that are the same way. It's not like AOT was the first series to ever introduce the \"angst-driven teen living in an apocalyptic world\" concept. In my opinion, I think the way that SOTE handled this trope was very interesting. \\n\\n\r\nSo, overall, is SOTE worth the watch? Yes. The characters are deep and well-developed, and the story eventually does pick up. Although I would have to recommend reading the manga first, because it is handled much better than the anime is.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a high-quality vampire anime, I would highly recommend checking this one out.\\n",

            "content": "Alright, I've seen a lot of reviews for this show, and most of them seem fair. However, a lot of people are just hating because it's popular, which I find pretty unfair. So here's my spin, I guess.\r\n Seraph of the end is Attack on Titan with vampires. Really. The plot is cliche, the characters are tropes picked out of a hat, and the pacing is 'unique' in the sense that it accelerates and slows at the speed of sound. Despite all this criticism, I liked this show. A lot. Quite a lot. I'll explain why.\r\nStory: 6. The story is generic as hell, but itkeeps you into it. I won't give spoilers, but... wow. Really.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7. The art is really quite good. The character designs are unique, especially the army uniforms which would be great to cosplay, and the vampires design which are just plain nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9. The OP is simply brilliant. I love it, and listening to the lyrics adds dimension to the story. The background music and soundtrack are great as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter; 6. The characters are generic, as aforesaid, but you end up liking them somehow. Especially Shinoa. I initially didn't like her, but by the end she was my favorite character, despite not doing anything to really deserve it. Maybe its the badass scythe. Or the lack of caring. Or the purple hair. Probably.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10. Even through all the bad stuff about this show, I love it. It entertained me. The funny parts were mostly funny, the action was awesome, and the vampires were actually interesting. This show wasn't really meant to be analysed or made a thesis of. It's just action and enjoyment. Thinking about it too hard will just ruin it.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: A mildy above average show, but way-above average entertainment. I would definitely recommend this show to those of us who take anime a little less seriously, and those who just want a fun show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

            "content": "Hey there, this is my first ever review. It's spoiler-free, so please sit back and enjoy the show. \r\nThere isn't much to say about Owari no Seraph. I knew it'd be generic-action, but I didn't expect it to be as generic as it was. It was, as most action anime is, over-hyped (in my opinion) and wasn't nearly as good as I expected. Hopefully the 2nd season will be better. That being said, the anime was in fact quite enjoyable; let's look at all the positive and negative qualities of Owari no Seraph.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story itself was average, nothing special at all. Like I said,I'm keeping this spoiler-free, so I'll be as vague as possible. MC is in a bad position, MC loses something, MC gets mad and plots revenge, MC has internal struggle whilst face-to-face mid-revenge. I guessed every single next scene in the anime. It was extremely predictable. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nNow, I'm not the best at judging art or animation (due to my lack of experience in watching anime in general), but I'll try my best. I personally found the art quite enjoyable, with well-made fight scenes and very detailed characters. Although there was detail in some parts, I felt as if the background was extremely lacking in some scenes and it was very distasteful. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe OP, ED, and soundtrack itself were the standard pumped-shounen tracks you'd hear in any action anime, and I honestly didn't find any of the music quite memorable at all. If anything, the OP might barely make it onto my Osu! playlist, and I may or may not hum it in the shower once in a while, but that is all. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nThis is what killed the anime for me. I expected something great, but seeing such highly-defined character archetypes brought shamelessly into this anime really hurt it overall. The MC thinks he's all that, there's another tough guy, there's a man with a \"cool guy\" attitude, there's a wimpy boy, there's a tsundere, etc. Honestly, the only character names I can remember are Yu and Mika, just because they're the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nYou see, where Owari no Seraph lacked in character uniqueness, it made up in enjoyment. As a young male myself, the shounen action was very enjoyable and I liked the anime in general. The story keeps you on your toes, and you really want to know what's going to happen next. I binged this in a night. It was fun. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nTaking all the factors into account, Owari no Seraph equates to a fair 7/10. I personally DO NOT base my ratings on multiple factors but simply on enjoyment, but it just happened that what I felt right happened to be the number I would end up giving Owari no Seraph as a review rating. Owari no Seraph was nothing special, but it was fun and surely not a waste of my time. This may not be the gem you are looking for, but it sure as hell will be a great experience while you search for that particular gem.",

            "content": "~~~~~~Spoiler free~~~~~~~\r\nI'm tired with this trend where more and more of anime/movies/TV shows antagonize humanity in a distasteful way, pushing us to think about our \"humanity\" and to sympathize with the human's enemies within said world. Very, VERY, few shows manage to do that, and it's as clear as day that OnS is nowhere near to being one of them. It bothers me, really, because making humans to be true monsters is so easy it's despicable just how many shows tend to fail at it. OnS falls straight into that category. \r\nTL;DR - pros/cons\r\n+ Decent animation during fight sequences \r\n+ Relatively easy watch\r\n+ A fewinteresting characters\\n\r\n+ Decent room to grow\\n\r\n- Too much pointless drama\\n\r\n- Dialogue\\n\r\n- Lackluster story\\n\r\n- Generic characters \\n\r\n- Inconsistent both in animation, story and characters\\n\r\n- Ending's just a bait for 2nd season, so no satisfying conclusion on its own\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly enough, there's a lot of story here - yet, nearly all of it is wish-washy bullshit you've seen in about 50 shows even if you've only watched 55. Nearly all plotlines are generic, boring, dull and uninspiring, and follow all the tropes you can think of. Anger, revenge, calmness, disobedience, willpower, you name it - OnS has it. By the time episode 12 rolls about you can fill up a checklist of generic shounen traps every mediocre writer falls into. Inconsistencies within the story are abundant, overshadowed only by the terrible cast of characters. There's never a clear-cut line of who's stronger than whom, and most battles you'll see depict Vampires to be the strong ones in the beginning, yet always wind up with humans coming out on top. Fallacies in through storytelling are plenty, but I'll only mention a few, since I don't feel like analyzing this generic trash. \\n\\n\r\nApparently, there's a huge difference between \"normal\" and \"noble\" Vampires, so much so that our main cast can easily fend off 15+ normal Vampires yet struggle to defeat even 1 noble. Yet, when the story calls for it, they'll struggle against the \"normal\" Vampires and dash around the \"noble\" ones like it's nothing. No reason, no logic, merely a convince on the writer's part.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, there's the subplot of childhood friends torn apart by different spices and goals, that we get yet another generic \"I'll save you\" plotline which, with my whole heart, I recommend you skip completely. Not only is it generic, boring and cringe worthy, it also begs the question of just how stupid and inconsistent our characters are. On the other hand, if you loved Naruto/Sasuke bullshit, you'll probably love this one too. \\n\\n\r\nAnother low point of this show is the dialogue - since it's the embodiment of generic shounen. You'll find yourself (at least I did) skipping a bucketload of \"character development\" moments because they're the exact replica of things you've seen in every shounen ever. Things they say roll through their lips but don't make any sense, and each time the \"character development\" moment rolls around, you'll be rolling your eyes in disbelief as to how can characters say those lines with a straight face. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, story is a generic mess, and while it does expand upon itself in the 2nd season, you shouldn't get your hopes up. It's not the worst thing in the world though, so kudos for that. \\n\\n\r\nProduction values are hit or miss; at times, animation borders amazing, while at others it looks so amateurish you need to look away. Character design and world design don't fit with one another because characters look like those you'd find in high school SoL rather than in the post-apocalyptic survival story. In addition, even designs clash, since characters are drawn with clear-cut lines and detailed to hell, while the world around is too edgy, so with each sequence it feels like they just don't belong on the screen; it has the \"green screen\" effect of sorts like in the movies, whereas you simply have a hard time believing in what's happening in front of you. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is on par with today's standards - at least for the most part. Majority of battles are animated well, and are pleasing to the eyes, yet it's clear that nearly whole budget went into them, because the moment you step away from the battlefield, the quality of animation plummets. I didn't mind it too much though, since there's a high chance you'll be watching this for fights alone. \\n\\n\r\nOn the sound department, it's decent enough not to care too much about it. The high point are probably special effects, while the low point is the score, as it's really forgettable and, again, quite generic. Voice actors did their job fine, with a few notable performances, but, again, you can't really be at your best with dialogue like the one of OnS. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, they're not the worst - mainly because of 2-3 side characters. Most of our main cast is generic throw-up and a spitting image of things you've seen in Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, One Piece, AoT etc. etc. \\n\\n\r\nMain character, Yu, is your everyday shounen lead and he stays as such. He's boring, at times even annoying, and, most of all, uninteresting and unable to hold the show on his own as a character. I'm really surprised sometimes that writers expect characters like him to hold the shows as a MC, yet it appears I'm in minority. \\n\\n\r\nAside from him, you have your generic cast of tsundere, rival, childhood friend/Sasuke, pussified weakling, and the only interesting, yet at times bordering \"just go away, you're annoying\" character with the name of Shinoa. Her playfulness was at times the only reason I didn't skip a scene, and, in truth, she should have been the main character (as in, the MAIN character). Aside from her, there are a few other interesting characters but nothing to spark your interest too much. \\n\\n\r\nFor what it was, OnS was relatively enjoyable. I never thought to myself \"fuck this, I'm stopping\", and that's always a plus in my book. Although it has its fair share of stupid, cringe worthy and plain insulting moments, OnS holds its enjoyment factor at a relatively steady pace. Mind you, you'll still be quite bored at times, but at least you'll never feel like skipping an episode. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, OnS is a completely average shounen. It has decent production values, but its core is, at best, sub-par. Production is what really holds it from being generic trash, but if you're into generic shounen, you'll love this show. Recommended only if you're bored/love shounen/love vampires.",

            "content": "If you asked me to rate the first 6 episodes separately from the latter half of the show, I would easily give it 8/10 for the art, animation, and plot set-up. \r\nBut the last 6 episodes barely deserve 2/10 and here's why:\r\nArt 7/10\r\nI personally liked the art style and even the weird colour schemes grew on me. The fight sequences are excellent in the beginning but the animation gets sloppier and sloppier as the show goes on. What should have been a climactic battle deteriorates into what looks like a turn based rpg. \r\nStory 5/10 \r\nThe premise of the show is able to seamlessly blendtogether elements from the most popular shonen out there, including Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Bleach, and Blue Exorcist. Contrary to what other people may think, I don't think it's bad storytelling to reuse tropes especially when they've already proven to be effective. \\n\\n\r\nWITH THAT SAID, the plot progression beyond is initial set-up is abysmal. Plot device after plot device is introduced without actually showing their relevance to the overall plot. There is absolutely no tension because Yuu is ridiculously overpowered, not to mention abnormally lucky since nothing seems to go seriously wrong despite everyone's warnings against his dumbass decisions. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10\\n\r\nForget two dimensional, some of these characters struggle to be one dimensional. No one learns anything in their \"character arcs\" (and I'm using that term loosely). Yuu is reckless and overpowered, then becomes unapologetically reckless and overpowered. Mikaela's life revolves around Yuu, then it revolves around Yuu some more while he angsts. Guren starts out with \"lazy but cool older brother figure\" then becomes a heartless bastard for no apparent reason. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nI feel that this is a generous rating considering how much I hate the second half of this cour. By a certain point, the only thing that kept me coming back was the OP and ED.",

            "content": "Hoo boy. I finally got along to reviewing this one.  Contrary to what MAL says, I finished this anime a while ago, and I thought I needed a little bit of time to think about it before writing this review. Turns out I needed a LOT of time. \r\nI actually started this anime because I'm sort of an ironic fan of vampires, unless they sparkle. EVEN appreciating it ironically, if you look at this anime objectively, its not very good, though it could have been quite awesome.\r\n(Note: Spoilers will be preceded by (SPOILER ALERT) and ended with (END SPOILER). Though I don't think therewill be many spoilers, you have been warned.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory //3//\\n\r\nGiving this anime's story a quick look  shows its mediocrity quite effectively. This anime features a main character who wants to rid the world of vampires (who oppress the humans) by killing every single one of them.  Now, lets replace the word \"vampires\" with the word \"titans\" and you get a different anime altogether- ok I'll stop now. \\n\r\nGiving a bit of depth to the story spices it up a bit, but it still can't cover for it's frankly plain premise. The MC's best bud, who sacrificed himself to free the MC, is (SPOILER ALERT) a vampire. This creates emotional angst and complicated emotions- or it would if the MC even knew about this fact before the last episode! (END SPOILER) The resistance group the MC is a part of uses demons as weapons to destroy the vampires, which I thought was an interesting concept and perhaps the best part of the series. \\n\\n\r\nArt //6// \\n\r\nI came for the art, and stayed for the art. Honestly, if the only thing you have going for you is your art style, there's something wrong. Even then, there were a surprisingly high amount of still images  during fight scenes and pretty unoriginal character designs (as far as body shape and eyes are concerned). Some things I did like were the army uniforms and the demon weapons. \\n\r\nwow such small likes\\n\\n\r\nSound //5//\\n\r\nI thought the opening was interesting, but nothing super memorable. The ending song was meh and the score itself was not something I noticed. \\n\r\nSo, not bad, but not good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters //2//\\n\r\n.......\\n\r\n....\\n\r\n...\\n\r\nhhhhhhh\\n\r\nThis is what really drove me away from liking this anime. The characters are basically all repeated tropes with surprisingly low amounts of character development! Even the \"interesting\" character, Shinoa, I found boring and shallow! Aghhh the characters could have been cool! I don't mind things like the anime genre's rampant infestation of tsunderes infecting this anime but seriously..... I totally forgot about the pink-haired guy, (googling noises) Shiho. \\n\r\nAlso, this may seem like a minor complaint, but it bugged me to the end. The MC, Yuichiro, was referred to as Yuu through the whole dub. (I didn't watch the sub) So every time they were talking to him it sounded like they were saying: \"You can't do that You!\" \"You feels like that's the right thing to do!\" etc. This is how I felt through the whole anime. \"You are so stupid!\"\\n\r\nCause that's how Yuu is.\\n\r\n*facepalm*\\n\\n\r\nHey, I said it was a minor complaint!~\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment //6//\\n\r\nFor this anime, I watched it in \"enjoyment/guilty pleasure\" mode. So, I was willing to watch whatever the anime threw at me, barring the aforementioned sparkling vampires. That's a deal breaker. \\n\r\nSeriously though, I enjoyed it until I thought about it the next day. \\n\\n\r\nOverall //3.5/4//\\n\r\nLet me just say this. If you're good enough at separating yourself from any sort of critical thought about anime, you might enjoy this anime. \\n\r\nStill, the poor character designs/development and the only decent presentation, combined with a really lacking story create an anime that only truly generous people will remember for a long time. At least some people will remember it for it's nose-breaking mediocrity.",

Speaking of the beginning, I love how within the first minute of the show everything turns into chaos. It cuts to the chase and I feel like it keeps a steady pace throughout the series.\r\nWhat struck me first when I saw the show, was the art. All of the backgrounds were beautifully painted and I feel like that was a nice, unique touch to the show. I think the story is very engaging and the characters are decent. There isn'ta lot of time to get to know them because there was so much focus on setting up the plot. Luckily there will be a season two, so there is a lot to look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show, I felt this anxiousness to see the two main characters reunite after so long! I adore Mika and Yuu. I'm sure you will feel this way too. The only downside that I can see is that it will take the entire 12 episodes for it to happen. Again though, there is a second season that I'm sure will make the entire series worth watching, especially because there are so many answers that I'm dying to know: Who can you really trust? Vampires? Friends? Family?",

Seraph of the End is an anime that perhaps not all people could enjoy, but from the number of the times Alex cried to me about the Episode 1 feels and \"how hot Shinoa is\", I find I quite agree with her.\r\nSeraph of the End, to put it simply, revolves around a world decimated by vampires. When they are very young, Yui, Mika and their orphaned \"family\" are takenby the vampires to their city, where they are treated like livestock. One day, Mika retrieves a map from one of the vampire nobles, Ferid,  which supposedly leads them back to their world.\\n\\n\r\nJust from Episode 1 alone, the feels hit you. I will probably end up rewatching this anime several times just to get hit with feels again. Very good :)",

The characters are quite bland as well and to be honest, I couldn't sympathise with a single one of them despite the creator's desperate attempts to make you feel sorry for them.

            "content": "After seeing some of the ridiculous reviews for this show I thought I'd write my own.\r\nFirst let me say to all the haters that said it's like every other anime, or compare it to AoT, quit being an AoT fanboy and trying to say that anything that has humanity at risk in some future time is an AoT rip-off.  You're an idiot if you think AoT is the first to come up with that theme, and also if you think that's not general enough that a 1000 shows couldn't be created on such a basic premise and each and every one offer highly uniqueand totally separate stories, then you're apparently just a shallow individual and frankly I don't see how you enjoy shit, because literally everything has something that's slightly similar to something else.  That LITERALLY could  be said of everything if we are nitpicking...like you obviously are.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so now that we are past that.... \\n\\n\r\nThis anime occurs at a time when humanity was at risk of extinction. They are slowly trying to make a come-back, but things are not as they were and vampires are at the top of the food chain currently, as they seized the opportunity to step out of the shadows when humanity was at it's weakest.\\n\\n\r\nThe situation humanity finds themselves in, is also self-inflicted...our curiosity and greed often lead us down paths we should not tread.  The majority of humans that survived where children, which were seized by the vampires and used for food basically (a renewable food source however).\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the story begins....  The anime is about bonds of friends/family and how important those are and how they mold our decisions and make us into who we are.  I won't go into too much detail, as you should watch it...so I don't want to ruin anything.  I will tell you however, the story is touching.  This season is a bit lighthearted for most of the season, but near the end, once the stage has been set, it really heats up.  Remember this is two seasons, so there is a lot of build up to establish the story...\\n\\n\r\nI see folks complaining about S1, but many of the ravings sound like uneducated comments someone makes based on a half-ass assessment.  As in, they have not watched the entire season and/or definitely didn't watch S2.  I understand if some may be confused after only S1, but ....I say again...FRET NOT THERE IS A SEASON 2.  if they revealed all there was to know and told you all the secrets of the universe in S1, WTF would there be a need for more seasons for?  So stating the story got crazy and didn't make sense at the end, is idiotic if you're not going to invest the time in watching S2 before making that assessment.  The story is VERY good and VERY interesting actually, but you may not get it all or understand enough unless you watch both seasons.  S1 only hints at some of the real meat in this story, again...it's setting the stage for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters....well I love the characters.  I really don't understand when people say the characters in this show are flat or whatever, as I couldn't disagree more.  Guren is so complex I could write a whole book just about that guy all on his own.  I ADORE Mikeala and Yuu....they are endearing and feel genuine.  Shinoa is a blast and adds the perfect mix into these characters.  I literally love all these characters, even the ones I hate (here's looking at you Ferid).\\n\\n\r\nSound is great, so won't spend a lot of time there.  I will touch on animation / art though.  I love this show's art style. The animation of the characters is clean, nothing tooo amazing, but it's very nicely done, with crisp colors and it is surprisingly pleasing to the eye.  The backdrops throughout however, are beautiful.  Many times they feel painted or like it's a canvas, and right at first it was a bit odd to me, but once I got used to seeing it, I fell in love. It really is quite beautiful and I found myself missing parts of the show because I was admiring the scenery in old subway, etc... To me that says...you did it. You got something nice and unique...hats off.  So for me it was all good there.  I'll also note that a lot of anime is REALLY lazy when it comes to fight scenes.  This anime however, does it beautifully...I love seeing them throw their blades around, because it's so fluid and the lighting and sparks and such are very beautiful actually. I am actually a huge fan of how the action is handled in this anime, it's just very nicely done if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I am a big fan of this show.  I feel it's HIGHLY underrated and that most of the haters are just fanboys of some of the other popular show and haven't even given it a fair assessment before posting their BS.  This show truly offers something unique, and is something I WISHED more shows offered, so it really fills a gap for me.  It annoys me to see all the ridiculous reviews too, so here's what I have to say to you.  Do you like vampire stuff and are you willing to watch both seasons?  If yes, watch this....don't take my word for it or the other naysayers ...go watch it for yourself, because I'm confident you won't regret it.  \\n\\n\r\nI really hope they eventually make another season of this, as you could make entire anime's just on a few of these characters, so I definitely need more of this show in my life!!!",

The every so popular Sword Art Online spawned Log Horizon, No Game No Life and even this season's Overlord. So with the huge success of Attack on Titan comes many clones. Alongside God Eater, Aldnoah Zero and Knights of Sidonia comes Owari no Seraph also known as in English as Seraph of the End and also known as Attack on Titan: Vampire Edition. We follow our protagonist Yuichiro as he fights the Vampires in a post-apocalyptic world inorder to get revenge for what the Vampires had done to his family and he does this by... by going to high school to make friend.\\n\\n\r\nSeraph of the End was adapted from an ongoing manga of the same name because adaptations of ongoing manga are the best. The show has been adapted by Wit Studio the same studio that had its hands in Attack on Titan\u2026 aah that make more sense now. And also got a broadcast dub from Funimation which I watched. The first half came out this Spring with 12 episodes and the sequel is going to be released this fall with another 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSeraph of the End is the definition of generic. This reflects on every part of the anime. The story takes place when a virus kills everyone over the age  of 13 [what?] and then Vampires come and enslave the children as a food source and treat them like livestock. So our group of kids try to escape, all die except our protagonist\u2026 well thats unless you\u2019ve seen the opening which spoils one of the only redeeming qualities of the show. And this give him his reason [tiny face meme] for revenge. Not so  bad right? Well thats the best this show has to offer. From then on to achieve vengeance he goes to high school.This is because he is \\n\r\ntold that he needs to learn teamwork to join the Moon Demon Company aka the Survey Corps , and the  best way for him to learn teamwork is by forcing a stupid highschool arc. The story is pretty slow and boring and the best twist, is still a cliche, is ruined in the opening. \\n\\n\r\nNow onto the characters. Our protagonist,Yuichiro , who clearly a cool kid because unlike any other character, he always keeps his hands in his pockets and he is just generic trash. His character as a whole is kinda flawed. When he sees his family killed in front of him, he only helps Mikela despite all of the other characters killed even though they call themselves family. And  even afterwards he only remembers Mikela not even regarding the rest of the family. In episode 6, when our protagonist has to kill his friend he just says this: [Episode 06 15:00]. What!? For all he knew he was actually going to kill his friend and all he says is \u201cSorry but you\u2019re going down\u201d. What??? \\n\\n\r\nMikela, the kid who is supposed to be dead but even though he was in the opening, he didn\u2019t appear much in this anime but he really is the most interesting character in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nShinoa, while writing this review I was thinking of things to say about her but then came to a realisation that she is one of the most forgettable and boring characters that anime has produced in recent time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd other than that the rest of the main cast is made up of tropes including the blonde one, the old one, the shy one and the rival.\\n\\n\r\nThough not a main character, I do want to talk about Ferid, the vampire that kills Yuichiro\u2019s family and the person that Mikela works with. He along  with Mikela are the most interesting part of the show due to their mystery.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Finally I want to talk about the vampires, they for some reason really want to hurt little kids and do the Michael Jackson in more ways that one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just generic and with more negatives than actual positives. The main plot twist of the show is literally ruined in the opening. The animation is average. The soundtrack is shit. The characters are shit and in a nutshell it\u2019s Attack on Titan done wrong. And the worst thing about it is, it could\u2019ve actually been a good show because I\u2019ve heard that the manga is actually good but instead it is a cliched mess. But with all that being said, will I watch the  second season coming this fall...Yes. Even though it the story is poorly executed, I\u2019m still interested in it to see what will happen and that has to count for something right. So i give Seraph of the End a 4/10. Literally, just go watch any other show than this. Go watch Kaiji. Do that. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I probably rated this higher than most and I can definitely see the case for a lower score but for me it's a 7.\r\nOwari no Seraph or Seraph of the End has two sides to it at almost every way you look at it. In some ways they clash, in some ways they compliment each other. I'll go through each a bit in this review.\r\nArt:\r\nThe two styles here are the character art which is mediocre at best and the background and fighting powers art which is spectacular. Some scenes I just pause and take in the scenery (like the vampire city shots). They really makethis show worth the watch, and for one of the first times when watching an anime I am inclined to look up to see if there is an art book to go along with it. The general theme is occult and post-apocalyptic art which looks amazing and really sets up the world.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe start of the story is two kids in a friendship at the end of the world enslaved by vampires underground and used as cattle for their blood. It's gruesome, it's dark, it's sad, it's beautiful. But then the show takes a turn and jumps into the second style and becomes a typical high school show and it starts to drag. But I kept watching and it goes back to the kind of stuff that made me start the show in the first place, vampire fights, awesome occult and post-apocalypse themes, the demon weapons, etc. At times the story is great and at others it leaves me questioning why the author(s) kept going back to the tired and overused high school trope but as soon as I question it, they're back into the good story portion. This is the most controversial opinion I've had on this show but I'd give this a 7. I feel that it's a bit generous, but the good parts really bring this show up. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, the character art can be not good, but for the most part it is ok. When we get to the high school portion of the show some of the characters are rather annoying and imho are not written, acted, nor drawn very interesting or unique. You'll see when you watch it. For many, I would guess, it will will be the biggest deal breaker. 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nVoice/Sound:\\n\r\nThe voice acting can be either spot on or wildly out of left field. I felt a few characters are not very interesting and/or trying too hard to be unique. It's something this show struggles with, but only because of the high school trope they fall back on. So the supporting cast falls into a typical array of high school character personalities that others will be able to explain better than me, like the subservient/reserved male, the over confident glasses guy, the over-talking weird girl, the i like you but only show dislike girl, etc. It's pretty laughable at times, like watching a kid version of some Bleach characters. The fight and music sounds of this show are good and pull this score up to a 6.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI think this show had a few bad moments and ideas, but they are quickly overshadowed by the parts that are done very well and make it worth a 7/10 for me. If they had kept with the first story line they would have been much better off, but i'm not displeased with where they took the show (looking past the high school parts). The scenic art is really a show stopper here and I will watch the 2nd season because I enjoy it so much. \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr It's like there are two different authors/artists here. One great, and one tired and mediocre. But there is a good blend and it becomes a show that most will view as either so-so or good. I thought it turned out a mix, but more good than meh.",

            "content": "This is one of the worst Anime I've seen yet and boyz, this anime is so plain bad and generic, I don'T get it why so many ppl loved it and gave it a high rating.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story was so bad, it hurted tbh.\r\nEpisode 1 was really generic and lazy writing everywhere, like literally telling the viewer, that there's a virus, that instantly (for some reason) kills ppl under 14 (or 13, I forgot) . It's so lazily done, as if we couldn't get it by ourself that something is killing everything but kids, since it's basically everything the virus is. It's never described further whatthe virus is. Also it's really weird that they all died instantly and for some reason they can't kill anyone under 13 becuz anime logic, I guess. \\n\r\nAlso the tone is all over the place from happy go lucky to \"I must kill all the vampires\" and the pacing is bad as well. \\n\r\nEverything is generic and have been done elsewhere better. A lot better. \\n\r\nThe storytelling is, like I mentioned, poor written and had everything spelled out to the viewer. It was just like the anime insulted my intelligent, since it had to say things like \"it's a memory\" out loud, as if the viewer would in no way get it himself. \\n\r\nIt's mainly about the humans vs vampire with Yuu and his harem in focus. The pacing is akwardly slow and the intense scenes were utterly boring, I lost my attention in mere seconds. It's not like we all don't know what'll happens, since it's really, really predictable. \\n\r\nSomehow does everything the story just \"happens\", becuz of \"convenient reasons\". The world is shallow and why the heck is there a school in the middle of a warfield. Everything feels so forced, due of it's lazy writing, which includes exposition and dialog. And also many things didn't make sense, yeah. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nA story can be shitty as hell, but when the characters are good, an anime can still be enjoyable\\n\r\nGuess what\\n\r\nI hated almost everyone.\\n\r\nEspecially Yuu, the protaganist aka the generic shounen hothead MC. \\n\r\nWas he made to be so annoying, since I hated the hell out of him. Everytime he opened his mouth to say \"i need to kill the vampires\" or \"I need to protect my harem/friends\" I want to punch him into his face. \\n\r\nbtw, his mood is really weird, since it switched constantly from revenge to protecting his friends. The mood change feels so forced, it's like he's a robot with only these two options given. \\n\r\nAlso, why is he constantly disobeying almost everytime? \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are mainly built of walking clich\u00e9, so I don't bother with them.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was ok, \\n\r\nthe background looked pretty, but boy, the animation quality dropped so hard, in the end there were almost no movement in the \"action\" scenes, yeah... \"action\". \\n\r\nOtherwise it was ok or more like watchable. My only problem with the artstyle the series goes is that it looks so out of place, meaning that the art and the animation don't synch with each other. Doesn't look like they belong to each other. \\n\r\nInside a building it was barely noticeable, but in the outside the difference could be spotted easily.\\n\r\nAnyway it's still decent enough. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening was quite enjoyable, even tho I didn't like it a lot. Reasons would maybe be the intro, since it's a bit weird. But the refrain is quite good and I like hearing to over and over. \\n\r\nThe rest of the OST did their job, but nothing really stand out, so that when I'm hearing it, I'd think of OnS\\n\r\nBut not bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nLike someone might have guessed, I really can't stand the anime. \\n\r\nSo many thigns were cringeworthy and I don't have anything I like there. \\n\r\nI didn't even wanted to watch the anime, but since a good friend of mine, who shares smiliar interest, I even bother watching.\\n\r\nIn the end, when I lost my hope of the anime eventually becoming good and started laughing at the bad scenes. \\n\r\nIt was still a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you like to watch generic ppl in a generic plot with generic villains, fine go watch it. \\n\r\nSecond season is incoming and I don't see any sign of it becoming better. \\n",

So it was very rushed and we don't get to see enough background and context to see each character grow and develop.  \r\nI'm going to wait and see how part 2 turns out and then i can deliver a more thorough review.",

            "content": "\"What would I remember of this anime ?\r\n-Everything ! \"\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nTo sum up the following, the story is about a virus which will kill 9/10 of the earth population, with the exception of children under thirteen years old. Vampires invaded the planet. They capture all the children and have thanks to that a regular supply of blood. The story goes on with a two sided fight, on one hand the humans controlling some demonic weapons and on the other hand vampires with supra-natural powers.\r\nI loved the fact that the anime did not focus on one side, but on both  (humans and vampires). The twogroups seemed to have some kind of evil side or shadow that they want to hide. I saw plenty of vampires-humans anime and this one is on the story the best one, on his originality, its conception and its surprise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nOn the art what I LOVED, was the uniform that the human army had, especially the hat. It reminded me a bit of the soldiers of Napol\u00e9on with their prestigious plumed helmets. \\n\r\nOtherwise, the constant change of landscapes of the characters is rather impressive and gives a good turning point story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music did not especially caught my attention, but it has been in general very correct. In my opinion, what was bringing a default to the show was the voice of the singers which did not particularly please me. \\n\r\nMoreover, the last song at the end of the anime really inspired me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, a few anime stereotypes showed up, such as Hyakuya being a  high-school student in a normal class. Making some friends. Nevertheless, there is one original character in his friends, who is Shinoa Hiiragi. She strongly intrigued me. She becomes his supervisor and gets a surprising and comic character that I will let you discover. \\n\r\nThrough the story, you discover the evolution of the spirit of Hyakuya. How he becomes from a young teenager, a mature adult-fighter; unfortunately what disappointed me or what could have been improved, was his lack of will on extreme situations. But it comes without saying that my favorite character was Hyakuya. I just expected so much from him, that I wanted him to go on a supreme rage against his enemies (for instance if they touched his friends). Maybe even more as he has shown in the story. His behavior, his strength or his look: all were appealing to me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\r\nNow I would definitely suggest someone to watch this anime. If you like shounen/vampire anime then this definitely is for you. For me the first episode already got me, but if the first episode is not convincing you, then watch the first three. They should be enough for you to decide whether to continue watching it or not.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo round the score on the overall: 10/10\\n\r\nThe main reason for this great note is maybe because some details, particularly affected me, but it is only my personal opinion.",

Later on I heard lots of great things about this anime so I decided to pick it up again, and I am so glad I did!\r\nFirst let me tell you what I really liked about Owari no Seraph.\r\nThe Storyline is really good, I haven't seen any anime/manga with the same storyline to be honest.\r\nThe art is awesome and they don't have weird big eyes like some anime do. \r\nThe clothes are simply great and their design seems complicated. The music is too epic!!Hiroyuki Sawano's music is like the best and i'm so glad it's used in this anime. The voice actors were well matching with the characters they voiced, I especially liked the main character's voices, they were so fitting.\\n\\n\r\nI really dislike the female character called Shinoa, I feel like she's useless. I don't think the author was trying to make us dislike her because majority of the people love her for some reason. Don't get me wrong, i'm not a feminist lol I just don't like useless female characters. Moving on, I don't think theres too much character development for the main character, but the secondary characters have a bit of character development.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, it was fun to watch every episode. And when it was announced to have a second season, I screamed from happiness xD I recommend this anime to supernatural lovers and vampire lovers.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I dislike about this anime is the lack of character development for the MC and the annoying female characters. Otherwise it's really great.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this super boring review of mine. :p\\n\\n\\n",

What I loved about the story was that it put a new spin to old concepts and also had some interesting new ideas to show.\r\nArt-8 : The art is very easy on the eye making it easy to binge watch if that's what you want. It's true that it could have been better but looking at an anime that looks so much like the manga you just have to appreciate how similar they are. Some effects where lots of soldiersmove together do look a bit rough but aren't as bad as people make it out to be, it still moves smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nSound-5 : The use of music during some moments was lacking through the series, as they could have used possible OSTs to create more memorable moments although nothing they did was horrible they could have just improved on the usage. Looking at what the series did work with isn't disappointing at all they used the sound to fit all situations and moods to create a sensual atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-8 : The characters in the series were a bit generic but each feature unique little quirks that the viewer can grow fond off. People may say that characters in this series are too generic but to argue we could say that these are the characters we love to see and enjoy getting to know. There are some incredible characters that they had in the series particularly a character name \"Guren Ichinose\".  Each character grows in their own unique little way throughout the series and it is absolutely fantastic to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10 : I've seen a lot of anime some better some worse but even some of the better ones don't keep the viewer entertained throughout the whole series. Each episode is packed and the seasons leave you wanting more. I think this anime excels at captivating the viewer with what it has and there's no point in watching an anime just to critic otherwise you are looking for faults however if you just watch as a curious passer you will be able to fully experience the thrill of watching Owari No Seraph/ Seraph of The End.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-8 : The series is above average in my opinion when comparing it to others series like SAO, it manages to keep a plot and continue evolving when other anime's have to keep creating new story lines to an otherwise finished story so definitely worth the watch. It's true that this story isn't as mind blowing as AOT but also never gained the same publicity the series may have been a bit rushed in production to create a top quality anime but still pulled an anime I am glad to have watched.",

The story is forced rather than being allowed to flow naturally, mostly caused by the one dimensional characters who react only to fit a trope, and are far from what you'd consider \"human\". Everything is designed to make the plot move forward without thinking about how much that detracts from the plot. Precisely zero of the characters would ever reasonably respond to the situationsthey're put in like they did.\\n\\n\r\nIf they had spread it out over 25 episodes and worked on actually developing the characters rather than hamfisting them into the desired end-scenario, the anime could easily have been a 7/10 or even 8/10.

The animation is average, the music and OST is forgettable, the plot is generic, and most of the characters as well.  Notice I said \"most\" and not all. If you can stomach watching an average series, I recommend you do it for the one redeeming thing this series has brought us. And that is Shinoa Hiragi. \r\nIf you can make it to episode 5, you may be like me and decide this series is worth watching for this one character. It should speak for itself howa supporting character can make the series as a whole watchable, but Shinoa Hiragi has one of the most unique personalities I've come across during my time watching anime. Enough so to rank her in my top 10 all time favorites. Many anime tend to stick to the archetypes and stereotypical characters, so it's always refreshing to find something new.",

            "content": "The main reason I'm giving this show a 6 is because I did enjoy it, even if it's not one of the best shows I've seen. It's good if you're looking for a dramatic shounen series with comedy, fighting, and vampires, but not so good if you're looking for unique plot or character development. \r\nStory - 5\r\nPretty typical apocalyptic story. I did like how there was an effort to make the humans and the vampires morally ambiguous, and the different designs for the weapons. However, the story was by no means outstanding. There wasn't a consistent tone since part of it took place in aschool, and the tone was much more lighthearted than you would expect in a world overrun by vampires and monsters. (I think the scenes at school were my favorite, since they were better than the main plot).\\n\\n\r\nI had a hard time taking things seriously because of all the melodramatic character backstories. At first, I liked how flashbacks were incorporated, but they were quickly overused. I didn't need to be reminded every freaking episode that the main character was a tragic hero, thank you. \\n\\n\r\nThe story also moved extremely slowly - I'm pretty sure it could have been condensed to 4 or 5 episodes. And yet, there wasn't much development about the different creatures in the show. Like, what was that mysterious disease that wiped out the human race? How did vampires come to be? And there are demons and monsters too? Where did they come from?\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be honest, I know practically nothing about art and animation. Still, the art didn't strike me as being particularly good or bad. There were times where the quality was very low, but I think that was just the site I was watching on. As for character designs, there was some creativity and variation. However, some hairstyles - especially for the girls - were strange, elaborate braids and pigtails that didn't make any sense. The outfits were pretty decent and the weapons looked nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nI usually don't pay too much attention to the soundtrack while watching. Though, I liked the instrumentals for the opening sequence, and the soudtrack was good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\\n\r\nI liked the characters, I really did. Sure, many were stereotypical and underdeveloped, but that was part of their charm. \\n\\n\r\nOur main character was the usual revenge-obsessed power-hungry anime mc with a tragic backstory. I liked him at first, but his character pretty much stayed the same the entire time. Eventually, he became whiny and borderline obnoxious. Mika, his childhood friend, was more interesting but got much less development. Saotomi, the main female lead, was one of the stronger characters. I like how she was a mix of sarcastic and pleasant. And the blonde girl with pigtails was an obnoxious, whining caricature. I did like some of the side characters, especially Guren and some of the vampire nobles. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nI pretty much marathoned this show, just because I was curious to see where it went (and, since it was summer, I had time to spare). Okay, I did enjoy it, but I would categorize it more as a 'guilty pleasure' kind of show. I was just in the mood for something dramatic that had to do with vampires, not something with quality storytelling. If that's what you're looking for, go ahead! \\n\\n\r\n Unfortunately, the first season ended without any major resolutions. I'm holding out hope for the second season.",

            "content": "Note: This review is influenced by knowledge that a second season is coming. \r\nSeraph of the End is a action anime that revolves around the struggle between humans and vampires with the key characters being two friends (who are essentially brothers). \r\nWe should get the characters out of the way. For the most part they have boring personalities. Yuuichirou Hyakuya, the main main character, has an undying hatred towards vampires (and rightfully so), but his entire character for most of the show is \"Must kill vampires\". Of course, this is challenged at the very end, and hopefully will be more so in season 2. Mikais the only other character who has something interesting happen to him, and that's near the middle of the show and it's incredibly obvious what's going to happen to him. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters have interesting background, or potential to be interesting, but they just are not really utilized that much. For the most part they are just set pieces. An exception is Shinoa Hiiragi, who has shown sparks of being an important character, and probably the most complex out of the lot. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is wildly inconsistent. However, for the most part it is rather pleasing to the eye. Speaking of eyes, this show has some pretty well done ones imo. They are clearly the most standout piece in the character design. It's also clear though that there were a lot of corners cut in production near the end of this season. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty good, probably one of the stronger points of the show. The OP, which I didn't really like at first, is now one of my favorites of the season. It just has a really catchy intro and bridges into the melody part very well. The rest of the music and sound is pretty on point too, even if it's not as spectacular as KLK and AoT. \\n\\n\r\nFinally we get to the story. In a nutshell the story of S1 is a huge tease. I was completely about to give up on this being anything but some by the numbers shounen but they finally showed their promise, like in the last 2 episodes of the season (and only one of those episodes is actually good). \\n\\n\r\nDespite being predictable a lot of the show is actually pretty enjoyable though. But it does keep you perpetually annoyed because you know that it could be a lot better. This show is an okay anime that looks like it's going to have a juicy second half, too bad this season isn't really enough to sink your teeth into.",

It's not great, seeing as it can be summed up in one sentence:\r\nIt's Attack in Titan with vampires.\r\nAt the same time a mysterious virus named called the Apocalypse Virus spread, the vampires emerged from the shadows.\r\nAs a result, 90% of humanity was slaughtered, either by the vampires or the virus.\r\nAnd most of the remaining 10% was enslaved by the vampires.\r\nAgain, it's simply Attack on Titan with vampires.\r\nThe story, compared to the manga, is extremely slow-paced, so muchthat by the end of the series, I was nearly ripping my hair out.\\n\r\nArt- 6\\n\r\nThe art is painful to watch.\\n\r\nIt's not bad, it's just inconsistent. Extremely so.\\n\r\nOf course, we'll get the occasional mind-numbing action scene that made us love AoT, but otherwise it's kinda pathetic.\\n\r\nThe characters movements are often stiff, and at times the shadings look just odd.\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\r\nIt's Hiroyuki Sawano. What did you expect?\\n\r\nI could gush on and on but I won't.\\n\r\nCharacters- 6\\n\r\nThe characters are bland.\\n\r\nYuu simply wants to kill the vampires.\\n\r\nThe other two have differing reasons for fighting.\\n\r\nAnd the other two don't really have an explained reason for fighting.\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 5\\n\r\nIt was ok.\\n\r\nDefinitely not the worst, but far from the best.\\n\r\nMediocre, I guess.\\n\r\nOverall- 6\\n\r\nIt's not as good as the manga.\\n\r\nWhile the manga was far quicker paced and didn't waste time getting into the darker side of the existing world, the anime adaptation drags it's feet.\\n\r\nI fell like the butchered a good manga.\\n",

            "content": "To me, Owari no seraph didn't know what it wanted to be. Themes of school life, fantasy battles and preachy friendship themes mingle and fight for space in 12 short episodes. It wasn't a waste of time watching Owari no seraph, but it sure wasn't a groundbreaking series.\r\nStory: 5\r\nThis was the weakest point of the show for me. The adult-killing disease and vampires taking over the Earth was alright, but there were several plot points that fell flat or contradicted each other.  The four horsemen of John were only there to provide fantasy fights, and weren't properly explained. The story wasn't so bad thatI became lost and confused, but it definitely took away from my enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Owari no Seraph is quite nice most of the time. The characters have lovely designs (I especially liked how elegant the vampires looked) and they are all easily recognisable. The backgrounds were a nice soft watercolour and usually this looked nice, however it could be too much of a contrast when the characters were fighting. There was some clunky CGI.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the music in Owari no seraph felt a little off for the situation the characters were in. Energetic music would play when the characters were in a quite boring environment like a classroom. The OP and ED don't have interesting music (and contain a lot of spoilers).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nI found that most of the main characters were quite unlikeable. Yu especially I found to be exceedingly arrogant and rude - and (MINOR SPOILERS) his turn from pretentious jerk to compassionate friend felt unnatural. (SPOILERS OVER) \\n\\n\r\nI liked Yoichi and Shinoa, but I couldn't bring myself to like the rest of the main crew. Their conversations were also quite awkward, with an excessive amount of 'I will be the best!' and 'I'll defeat the vampires by myself' sort of monologues.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nDespite the shortcomings of Owari no seraph, I got through it without any trouble and even found that I quite enjoyed some parts of it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nOwari no seraph was not bad. Neither was it particularly good. It's one of those anime where it will inevitably be forgotten about amongst dozens of other similar shonen shows. I don't regret watching this anime, I just wish it had been written better. I would definitely recommend this to anybody who liked No. 6 and other anime that focus on friendship/romance between two guys in a post-apocalyptic environment.",

            "content": "I rarely give anime a 9 out of 10. Typically it's either a masterpiece and deserves a 10 (like FMAB), really good and merits an 8 (like, say, Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works), or is good but not great and gets a 7 (like The Irregular at Magic High School). I don't think I've given a 6 or lower so far.\r\n9s are rare because they're right between superb and really good. Hunter x Hunter (2011) was a 9 if I recall correctly. Normally you may think, based on my other reviews, that Owari no Seraph would get an 8 at best. However, I think ithits 9 for some particular reasons.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the art. The characters have a sharp way of standing out to you, my compliments to Wit Studio. The way the vampires' eyes and noses are drawn, or the color and hair style of the protagonists. The sound, Hiroyuki Sawano, is majestic yet again, and reminds one of Henry Jackman or a similar-styled composer of film. The openings and endings are really good, emphasizing the tense relationship between the main character and the guy with the yellow hair, his best friend from childhood. I won't explain further, gomennasai. You gotta watch this and the second season. The character. Now, why exactly this gets a 9 -- it has to do with the clandestine plan behind the scenes and why this is called Owari no Seraph -- I can't tell you, you gotta watch it for yourself. But the story, the vampires and humans and that virus that mysteriously only killed off humans above the age of 12, is awesome, simply awesome. I really wanted to know what would happen next when watching this. Too bad I'm writing this review now and not immediately after seeing the show.",

            "content": "I initially had low expectations for the latest and greatest shonen series, and my thoughts were at first confirmed after the first episode, which sets up the series as a mash-up of successful series and hilariously bad dialogue. However as the series progressed, I found that while never truly becoming great, the series managed to never truly managed to cross the line into absolute crap, and so I find it hard to fault this series which managed to stay absolutely average during its run. \r\nThis is a double edged sword as it also hard to praise the series and the fact that most of myenjoyment from the series was honestly laughing at the dialogue which is ridiculously blunt, if I had to accurately describe the exposition in this series I would say that this series is the anti Fate/Zero. Rather than explaining, this series simply shows rather than tells or cuts corners. An example would be the hilarious end to the first episode in particular, or by offering quick solutions rather than lengthy alternatives. The main story is alright, its a typical revenge filled protagonist who can't shut up about his revenge, and his counterpart who is on the other side of the conflict. (That's not a spoiler he's in the OP and all the promotion material if you didn't figure it out you're dumber than the dialogue of this series.) It starts off in the vampire world which seemed pretty interesting, but then switches to a school setting which we've seen many times before and introduces more cookie cutter characters, the nice gentle guy, the rival guy that always butts heads with he main character but then they have to work together, dat tsundere that lost her former comrades, the commander who is hot headed just like the main character, is honestly goes, it honestly goes on and on. The vampires are pretty interesting honestly and as more and more is learned about their cause the series transitions from black and white to more of a drab grey, which is a welcome development to a series that feels destined to mediocrity due to the fact that it feels more like a rehashed concept rather than the real mccoy. The dialogue needs a special note here because it is so blunt and crash it is honestly downright terrible at points, so bad is honestly hilarious which made the series more enjoyable for me, and another part I enjoyed about the series is how absolutely mean the characters are to one another with their sarcasm and teasing, such as Shinoa who was one of my favorite characters from the series during its run. The animation is also spectacular, after it takes some time to adjust to the style the backgrounds of the destroyed landscapes are honestly beautiful, and the animators help some of the inserted sight gags such as those involving the car really pop. The actions scenes in the series are also well done, and it becomes readily apparent that the humans are outgunned by their adversaries, and that their only chance is to use and develop weapons that seem to be a little questionable of use for the good guys of the series. Obviously the main character is a little OP at times, as he constantly runs into situations that he is told not to try and despite others warnings he succeeds with flying colors every time, once again showing how this series does not care at all about exposition, similar to how its character's don't seem to care that much.\\n\\n\r\n This is a series that is much more interesting to watch when it focuses much more on its supposed villians the vampires, who seemingly appear to be a bit more human than the humans themselves as time goes on, but the show is bogged down by its generic nature and its inability to to push into uncharted territory in order to become great, instead it plays it safe resulting in a series that is simply noteworthy of not being particularly bad or good. There's certainly potential there for the second cour to be much better than the first as the series does have an intriguing plot and some cool weapons and action scenes, but it is also possible that the second cour will turn out to be as bland as the first.",

            "content": "Whenever a certain product becomes popular among the masses, it is guaranteed to have imitators trying to off its success. So when Attack on Titan became mainstream, imitators started popping up. One of these shows is Owari no Seraph or Seraph of the End in English.\r\nRight off the bat, the world makes zero sense. In the first episode, a virus kills basically everyone except people 13 years of age. And why everyone 13 and under survives this super virus that wiped out most of the human in like a day? Here\u2019s the biggest problem with Seraph when it comes to its narrative, it never answerswhy things happen. When it comes to any story, there are five important questions to ask: What happened? Who was there? Why did it happen? When did it happens? Where did it happen? Now if you were to why stuff happen to Seraph, you will soon realize how many things happen just because. Why is people thirteen year and younger unaffected by the virus? Why were the vampires in hiding all this time? Where are there demons? Why some of the adults survive the super virus that killed nearly everyone in an hour? None of these questions are answered and the only reasoning behind these events are to move the plot in the direction the writer wants it to go.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you were to over the very flimsy plotting, there isn\u2019t much to the show. The plot is a hogpog mess of ideas. There\u2019s high schools, teenagers with giant weapons, a prophesy, vampires taking over the world, etcetera. Being unoriginal isn\u2019t inherently a bad thing, but the show doesn\u2019t do anything new or interesting with the ideas they had. Because of this, the show fails to have its own identity.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they are by far the worst part of this show. They all reek of \u201cshonen\u201d and are completely void of development. The main lead ( Yuuichirou Hyakuya ) is an obnoxious, hot headed git. All he ever talks about is how he wants to kill all them vampires or how he doesn\u2019t need any friends. It is impossible to get behind him since he doesn\u2019t have any relatable aspects except raw anger. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they are pretty forgettable. Most of them consists of overused archetypes. To give an example, the MC team consists of a blond, twintails tsundere, a wimp, a male rival, and Mary Sue. The only character I liked was Shinoa. Even though she is a Mary Sue, her sarcastic attitude make her more bearable, especially in comparison to Eren Jager 2.0.\\n\\n\r\nIn the animation department, the show fails to impress. The character designs are quite generic and it doesn\u2019t help that the 2D character designs poorly blend in with the water colored backgrounds. Also, the military uniforms that everyone wears look stupid. The uniforms for the Japanese Imperial Demon Army are black and lined with neon green as if they was Tron and the vampires wear black and white 18th century military uniforms. As for the action, it is quite underwhelming. All the action in this season consists of only small skirmishes that don\u2019t have the impact or choreography to make them memorable.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, someone who has a rather good track, the soundtrack for Seraph is rather lacking. Most of the anime consists of silence. And when I listened to the soundtrack separately, I was all like \u201c where the hell all this music went to?\u201d It is basically the opposite problem that Aldnoah Zero. In Aldnoah, the soundtrack was overused so that it became repetitive and to take away from any impact the series might of had. In Seraph\u2019s case, the music was used too sparingly that it makes the show feel empty. \\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t really recommend Seraph even as a stupid time waster. I won\u2019t fulfill anyone in terms of writing or aesthetics. I would say give this show a pass since it\u2019s not worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nAs for alternative shows, try out Attack on Titan or Blue Gender. Even though both shows eventually become train wrecks, they do the \u201c humanity is on the brink of extinction\u201d far better that Seraph. If you want to see some cool vampire action, try out Hellsing (preferably Ultimate) or Blood the Last Vampire since they have better action and writing. \\n",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph is a decently made anime with an enticing story that has a lot of potential. It has a good storyline and opening with all the adults dyeing and kids being enslaved into an underground city, which I found interesting. However there were many plotholes, some of which are still not answered by the end of the second season. Why did only adults die? How come some adults still appear to be alive once Yu gets out of the vampire city? How did humanity get back on its feet after the apocalypse? Details like these that normally add to the story and itsbelievability are lacking in OnS.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were okay, pretty standard anime trope characters. The most interesting character, Shinoa, loses her fun factor by the second season when she **SPOILERS*** arguably falls in love with Yu and stops being so tsun, and more consistently dere. Another side female character (introduced as a possible, maybe love interest) is focused on for an episode or two, until the writers apparently forget about her existence and ignore her so that Shinoa can continue to fawn over Yu. I definitely started watching this to see the character interactions between the Yu and Mika and in that department I was definitely satisfied, though at times second-handedly embarrassed over their dragging and mostly fan-girl-gratifying banter. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation was spotty. Sometimes there'd be detailed fight scenes, other times the animators just included stills of fighting with typical fighting noises playing in the background. Not consistent whatsoever. While the backgrounds are quite pretty and painterly, didn't really fit with the animation, making it seem like the characters were pasted on top of the backgrounds rather than be situating in the setting.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, the first season was still interesting enough for me to finish in one day, and then move on to the second season. I'd watched OnS mostly because of tumblr hype and a hope for tragedy between two arguably straight MC's. I got the tragedy, but the hype? Not so much. Overall, an enjoyable anime that I finished in one day for shits and shipping purposes. Perfect if you're looking for an anime boy couple to fawn over. I plan on reading the manga to hopefully find answers to some of the aforementioned plot holes.",

            "content": "Pre-Review Statement;\r\nOwari no Seraph has been dubbed a very predictable, standard shounen series by most of the community in terms of category, which has led to it's lowered, but average score. However, this series delivers other key elements that other shounen fail to bring to realization.\r\nNOTE: this review is based on both season one & season two.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nI give the story this \"very good\" score because of it's depth, not originality. People see the first episode of Owari no Seraph as a replica of that of Attack on Titan, but it really isn't at all. In the first episode of AoT, it is revealedthat the Earth has come into an apocalyptic environment, like OnS had, except instead of vampires who feed on human blood, it contained huge monsters that ate humans whole dubbed \"titans.\" Now, another thing that mainstream reviewers fail to comprehend was that only one member of the family in AoT was killed\u2014keep in mind by a mindless beast who barely has self control\u2014whilst the main character of OnS, Yuu, had his entire family mauled in front of him for a demonic purpose. You can see the correlation, but I'd prefer the emotional view of OnS over Attack on Titan because of the quantity of family, as well as how close they were. Yuu then was able to escape from an underground city, being saved by a close friend of his, Guren (who became a close friend after saving Yuu, they hadn't known each other before), and grew up in the Demon Army's captivity. He was then later trained to slay vampires, which, yeah, is similar to the main character of AoT, but isn't at the same time. As he was held in captivity, put under a suspension from the Army, he was put into a high school where he met his later new family. Now, the reason I kept watching this anime, honestly, was to see if Shinoa and Yuu were to ever become romantic, but sadly it didn't happen. Hopefully another season will come out to reveal that! Anyways, later, we learn that Yuu is actually a badass, having a demon inside him before ever meeting his contracted demon, Amurasura.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI gave the art this score because of it's character appeal and blending during inactive scenes. However, it becomes a bit difficult to watch during fight scenes, as the water color/pastel art in the background made the characters stand out way more than they should have, giving an unnatural feel to the scenes. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was in perfect sync with character movements, reactions, and voiceovers, which made it easy to watch. The soundtrack was also outstanding, so much that I was convinced to install every song listed in the anime, and am still listening to whilst writing this review.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor me, \"character\" correlates with how original the anime is, and how original the characters are. The three characters that legitimately stood out to me were Arusamaru, Shinoa, and Yuu, who all became very dynamic at the conclusion to the second season. It shows that the characters are able to change, and that the cold-hearted trio came to have emotional attachments to each other, more or less with Yuu and Shinoa, having feel the need to protect each other more than anyone else\u2014as family.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime because it isn't a huge clich\u00e9 anime like the ones you find every other series. I was able to be anxious to watch the next episode, and I began to love this series so much that I replaced every other waifu I had with just Shinoa, who is the best! <-- Remember that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.6/10, rounded to 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime executes it's storyline bluntly and enjoyably. I'm not a popular reviewer, and I haven't seen that much anime as other people may have, but I know that I have bendable taste. Owari no Seraph is by far my favorite anime of all time, and I highly recommend it to anyone who plans to watch it.",

This series rehashes every anime stereotype in an unimaginative way, with VAMPIRES! Because, anime\u2019s never done that before. \r\n\t\u2022 Fate ordains that the two main, slightly homo-erotic protagonists are on opposite sides. Gundam SEED is bad, but it is more interesting than this series, so if you want to watch something with a similar premise and better execution, check it out. \r\n\t\u2022 There\u2019s also a twin-tailed tsundere, a flamboyantly gay vampire, the coy girl,and the OP older guy. If you haven\u2019t seen these tropes reused to death than you\u2019re probably fairly new to anime and this series might not be a bad start, but to veterans of anime, like myself, will yawn upon every character introduction. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The visuals are very pretty, because they\u2019re done by Studio WIT, the animation studio that did Haikyuu and the like, but, like many other WIT shows. It\u2019s appealing to look at, but the plot is boring and requires no thought, whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I thought the most interesting character was probably Krul, though she\u2019s the typical loli vampire, see the Monogatari Series for more examples of this, but the first season was so droll that I could not imagine myself wanting to watch more for her. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Overall, this series is as interesting as Akame ga Kill, with less edginess and I don\u2019t recommend it, unless you\u2019re new to anime or you\u2019re particularly interested in vampires and pretty people. I give the first season of Owari no Seraph a 3/10.",

            "content": "( WARNING: Spoilers) So first I don't understand all the backlash in the review section about this anime. I personally thought this was a a very enjoyable ride. Though it took me a bit longer than usual to finish because i couldn't find the episodes I always yearned for more.\r\nPlot: 10/10 The plot was perfectly well done and intricately well planned so that the anime kept you one the edge of our seat suspenseful to what would happen next ( not to mention the reunion YAY!). The plot was also original and developed so was the amount of action and suspense.\r\nArt: The art overallwas pretty with some mishaps here and there aka gurens face in one scene. lol that was funny!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Yuu was pretty generic for a revenge seeking main character but that adds to the plot as it would be boring if a main character wasn't ambitious and brave. There was also extremely well character development like Mika all adding to the plot. Not to mention the wide array of personalities making the anime a lot more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The anime was really good overall and my personal favorite. I would definitely recommend to everyone!",

            "content": "This show gets quite of bit of hate, and it seems most of it stems from the \"genericness\" and \"clicheness\" (yes, they are words now) of the show, and I just want to clear this up a bit.\r\nThe overall plot theme is pretty generic, nothing special. It's humanity pitted against some force, in this case, vampires, in a life or death battle. The characters are pretty generic. Just for example, Yuuichirou is you classic example of shounen protagonist. He was abandoned by his parents, his family from his orphanage was killed by the bad guys, and now he seeks revenge. Yeah, it's pretty plain. Notto mention, he's with a group of other kids that are also \"started from the bottom\" type, and they seek revenge against the bad guys. Yeah, I don't think the plot is able to get any more generic than this.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, while I was watching this, I came up with a new acronym, JYAS, or \"just your average shounen\". \\n\\n\r\nNow I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but I would like to mention that Yu is probably the most cringy, most edgy, most pubescent person I have seen, met, irl or not. Parts of the show, I actually had to pause because the garbage that came out of that mouth of his was just too much for me to handle. Ranting about family, defying his commanders, you name it. \\n\\n\r\nBUT, that's not what this review is about. If you want to find out how awful the characters or  story or anything about Owari No Seraph is, just check out any other review on this website. \\n\\n\r\nDespite of all the bad things that I just listed, and countless more that are listed on this website, I actually found this show quite enjoyable.  Yeah, OK, people are throwing rotten tomatoes at me already, but let me explain:\\n\\n\r\nYes, the basis of the plot is very generic, BUT, as you keep watching, it starts getting more and more engaging. It's as if it drags you in. Certain things happen, I won't spoil what, but as the show moved forward, I found it harder and harder to put down, and I just HAD to figure out what happened next. The way the story was written, the events develop in such an intriguing way, that no matter how generic the general basis it is, it still pulls you in. Basically, the story's good or bad is not decided by how generic the basis for it is, but instead by how it develops and how it engages the audience. And Owari no Seraph does a great job at engaging the audience.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to note, many people note that this show is super cliche, and I do agree to this, somewhat. It's true every time Yuu opens his mouth, something comes about killing vampires, and every time somebody is in trouble, a comrade will jump out at the last moment to save him/her. However, just being able to know what's going to happen, doesn't mean it's not engaging or boring to watch. For example, any good vs. bad plot, we basically know that good will win. If you focus on how the comrade will be saved, instead on the fact that you know he/she will be saved at the last moment, I think you can still enjoy this show. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I quite liked was the character development throughout the story. Again, people will mention how the \"started from the bottom\" and seeking revenge themes are really generic, but I think the show still handled developing the characters very well. I won't list too much specifics since I don't want to spoil anything, but the journey that each character, especially the edgy protagonist, Yuu, is quite a wild ride. However, I do feel like some plot elements are rushed a bit, which at the same time does make the character development rush, which results in some elements being a bit shallow. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the sound and visuals. I don't really have much to say here, since I'd say both were very good, and doesn't cause any reason for complaints. The soundtrack, composed by Hiroyuki Sawano (who makes a lot of other really good soundtracks) sounds great, and the opening, X.U. is hella  catchy, not to mention it's in English so it makes it easier for Japanese illiterates like me to sing along!\\n\\n\r\nOverall/TLDR:\\n\\n\r\nYou WILL NOT like Owari No Seraph if:\\n\r\n1. You can't stand edgy teenagers (being one myself, I'm more immune than most)\\n\r\n2. You can't stand generic plot elements, or generic characters or cliche and everything must be unique\\n\r\n3. You are an anime critic and any little thing wrong is bothersome af\\n\\n\r\nYou WILL like Owari No Seraph if:\\n\r\n1. You just want an engaging story to follow that will keep you on the edge of your seat\\n\r\n2. You want to watch some nice action, and some humor\\n\r\n3. You want something that leaves an impact on you after you finish (hint: you should watch the second season:\\n\r\n4. You like following a group of characters as they grow and develop through struggles and challenges \\n\r\n5. You want to listen to a hella catchy opening 12 times\\n\\n\r\nSo why did I give Owari no Seraph such a high rating?\\n\r\nI really liked how the characters develop through the challenges they face, but most of all, how I was almost always on the edge of my seat, and wanting more. I feel this should be the ultimate goal of an anime, or any show in general\\n\\n\r\nI know most people on MAL will fall into group 1, or will read some of the reviews and fall into group 1, but I really encourage you to give this a shot.",

            "content": "This review is for both seasons)\r\nFirst off, this has a lot in common with Attack on Titan. gonna list a few:\r\n1:Humanity on the brink of extinction from a super powerful enemy. \r\n2:A black haired MC who wants revenge for his family getting killed. \r\n3:An overall military theme, with one superior officer taking a liking to the MC. \r\n4:Cool uniforms.\r\n5: (Minor spoilers, skip this one)...... Both MC have an ability activated by either near death, or server pain, and become (one of the enemies) and becomes OP. \r\n6:A large, unique cast, but with a main focus on the main squad, and the superior officer. \r\n7:A decentamount of mystery behind what's going on, and what cause humanity to nearly die off. \\n\\n\r\nOk, so comparisons over, i like this series a lot now. This is actually the only thing vampires i'll watch mostly because they always have a \"bishi\" or (pretty boy) as a vampire. Well, unfortunately, that's the case. Moving on though, the overall story is set very nicely in the first episode, and continues smoothly from there. As a shounen anime, this hits all the requirements, but one thing confuses me, is that, (bishi again) 2 of the male MC's are orphans and became brothers, but they get REALLY touchy feely in one scene. Like Creepily so. Maybe it's to throw a bone at the female audience? Idk. I just thought it was really unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's not perfect for a few other things like average music and sound, and average animation, so i gave is 9/10, which is still really up there in my book.  My recommendation, make it to about episode 7 or 8ish and decide from there.  Enjoy!",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph is one of your classic \"cool-weapons-monsters-battle-blood\" shonen anime that is  pretty in-your-face predictable which can only be sightly redeemed by it's fantastic art and music.\r\nStory: 6\r\n The setting takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where humans nearly become extinct due to a virus and now must fight for survival against vampires. In all honesty, even though it sounds corny, I wasn't questioning the story too much while watching this and kinda went along fine with it. The problem with the story lies in the plotholes that form as the it goes on. Yes, there's plenty and it kept pricking the backof my neck so much that I couldn't even enjoy the anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic, the characters and costumes and weapons and monsters all look pretty kick-ass and the fight scenes are cool as well. However, near the end of the anime, the animation goes to shit. The fighting occurs in like 2 frames and the dynamics are all wrong.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nSawano Hiroyuki. Nuff said. \\n\r\nIf you don't know who he is, he's the same dude that did AoT, Nanatsu no Taizai, Guilty Crown, and other big game anime's. His soundtracks always rock\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nNow this is what pisses me off the most. The characters in Owari no Seraph are the most textbook, flat characters you could find, and the main character is the worst. So I'll just chop on him for now. He's basically a cocky little kid that breaks the rules and does whatever he wants, but because he's the main character, he doesn't get punished. Furthermore, there is almost zero character development, so if you think they sucked in the episode one, they're probably only gonna get worse\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nBasically, if I turn off my brain and just watch the explosions and fighting and killing, this anime would be fantastic. Unfortunately, with all the annoying characters and plot wholes, I couldn't help but nittpick.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nHonestly, I would give it a 6 or 7, but this anime became very popular and it's rating is much higher than it should be. I came in expecting a lot from it because of it's rather high rating and was thoroughly disappointed. This is to even out the curve a little bit. If you're looking for a mindless, action, shonen  anime, this is for you!",

            "content": "Apocalyptic-themed anime are becoming quite common. With the right formula, it could become a phenomenal piece of work. Seraph of the End, on the other hand, welcomes the usual clich\u00e9s and is too inadequate to fulfill that formula. \r\nThe plot is pretty generic and clich\u00e9 with vampires as the villains and a hot-blooded male protagonist (Yuu) who vows to destroy them all. The world is taken over by a virus that affects people over the age of 13, but there are some survivors of course. It was also disappointing to see someone under the age of 13 affected anyway. Some scenes were unnecessary. Yuu\u2019s advancementin the militia goes by foolish tactics like how many friends he gains instead of experience like it should be. Since you have to interact with others in the military anyway, his time in school was a waste. There are scenes aimed for shounen ai lovers with intimate vampire blood-sucking moments and friends who are a little too friendly, rubbing against the other. \\n\\n\r\nThe fast pacing was ridiculous. The OP in the 2nd episode spoils the climax of the show, so it\u2019s ok to say it here. The characters did not even undergo proper training, and they were immediately put in the battlefield as a way to get Yuu and Mika to meet, not giving the characters any time to develop. There\u2019s a brief training arc with easy trials as if to justify Yuu\u2019s stubbornness with teamwork. The majority of hand-to-hand action was soft with weak punches and kicks. The ending was easy to predict, especially with demon swords as weapons. Of course, there\u2019s a hidden power for Yuu.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are ordinary with their personalities and unfortunate pasts. There\u2019s the character that the MC can\u2019t possibly get along with (Shihou), the light-hearted comedian (Shinoa), and the weakest link (Yoichi). This cast automatically makes the show predictable. Yuu reminds me a lot like Naruto, drawing attention to himself by declaring himself the best. They each have similar purposes for joining the military, particularly because of a family member. Despite being weak and making supposedly unforgivable mistakes, Yoichi bypassed the trials and joined the military so easily. The vampires and humans don\u2019t vary in ability. Both of them can fly or jump high, and the humans can sustain any amount of injury and carry on normally. Main characters\u2019 bodies are pierced with swords, and they continue maneuvering smoothly despite injuries. One could argue that their demon-possessed swords allow them to have such abilities, but I\u2019m not buying it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is average. The settings are just flat backgrounds imitating pastel paintings. There are a couple of still images. The character designs are made to distinguish the vampires from the humans with their elf ears and red eyes. I envision vampires to be more villainous without pointy ears. Otherwise, they just look goofy to me. Characters experience injuries, and the bloody injury would disappear and reappear between scenes. The animation was good and very detailed. 1D characters move in backgrounds, and objects move in sync with the person controlling it or the wind. The ruins in the show also depict the apocalyptic setting.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in both dub and sub, and the dub was hilarious. I couldn\u2019t take the dramatic scene in the first episode seriously at all. The lyrics for the English OP fit the show pretty well. The music in the show didn\u2019t always fit the situation, and I preferred some scenes with no music at all. The blaring music sounded as if it was trying to drown out the seiyuu\u2019s voices. The seiyuu didn\u2019t react to certain situations. When characters are clearly being choked, their voices show no difficulty in speech. Apart from that, I liked the sounds of action from the swords clashing and the creaks of the floors.\\n\\n\r\nAs an apocalyptic anime, Seraph of the End is mediocre. The show was really predictable with the plot, ordinary characters, and demon-possessed weapons. The quick pacing really ruined the show, especially with the characters being powerful with hardly any training. Also, just to let you know, the show does not improve in the second season.",

            "content": "Vampires, demonic weapons, blood everywhere.. Whats not to like? Take into account some light shonen ai and a rather cliche cast and you have an alright anime that starts to get better towards the end rather than amazing all throughout, good thing there is a season two! \r\nYuuichirou (or Yuu) is a man on a mission: to destroy all vampires for destroying his family and killing his best friend Mikaela (Mika) here is the cliche; he is just so... Straight minded. Just kill vamps and nothing else, no friends or happiness or anything, just fight and kill. This makes him a bit one note andi ended up liking other characters more. Sure, he grows but its very slowly. \\n\\n\r\nShinoa is another cliche. She is a lavender haired scythe bearer who teaches Yuu and the others of the demon weapons and generally kicks butt. She is quirky but can also be serious. She makes fun of Yuu and that just screams \"love interest\" its so tropy that it hurts but i still enjoyed her character. Plus, Big. Ass. Scythe. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are not as rounded as i would like and i really would have liked to learn more about them. I liked yoichi and mitsuba and wanted to know more. I new wanted to also delve more into Mikas story. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is clean and beautiful. Action scenes are wonderfully bloody as you would want with vampires and while there is no romance per say there are peeks of it and it is a nice pace (i dislike super romance fluff). The music is upbeat and the sound effects match well. Overall the anime is fair and i think if you loke vampires and action youll like this, just dont expect a whole lot of depth",

            "content": "This is a very difficult anime to review because it does so many things, 'so' well but starts getting worse and worse as the show progresses. \r\nLet's quickly get to the good parts;\r\n- Characterization is very strong. We know exactly what the motivations of each character is and how they got to their current situation, the interpersonal relationships are clear and concise. This is one of the best parts of the show; Every character is written very well.\r\n- The set-up for the show is one of the best set-ups I've ever seen, without revealing any major spoilers (This is shown literally within the first fewminutes of the show), humanity suffers a type of \"Apocalypse\" and a hidden force appears to pick up the pieces. In a lesser show, this would be the focal point of the entire show but in this one, it is simply a backdrop for what is truly important; The characters. So A+ for knowing how to write a great show.\\n\\n\r\n- The action sequences, when they want to, are quite good. Not great, but good... and unfortunately this leads me to the negative parts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nBad parts;\\n\r\n- The show starts off with great art and animation but starts to slide more and more until they are straight-up pulling a Berserk (anime) .... they start to take massive animation shortcuts and this gets worse over time. You can almost pin-point precisely where they went overbudget and how everything that follows after that is extremely subdued and flimsy. This is not because of the tone, it is because they ran out of money, it is because the director didn't know what to do.\\n\\n\r\n- The story quality takes a MASSIVE plunge towards the middle and more so towards the end. It sets up the pathos of the two central characters, establishing a contrast and a tragic scenario where both are made to suffer, feeling guilt, shame and a set of choices of which none lead to a good outcome. It is brilliant... but then they start to take the easy way out and absolve them of a lot of what they do, using DEUS EX MACHINA and cheap \"Get out of ethical dilemma\" free card over and over. Let me make this simple; if you don't care about complex/deep storytelling, you will not even notice this... if all you want is action and shounen antics, then this downside is irrelevant to you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you became invested at all in the gradually rising stakes, the character interactions and the lore built by the show, you *Will* be disappointed when they lose all restraint and straight-up jump the shark. They were doing so well ... and you WILL know what I am talking about when you get there. From a very subdued and restrained first half of the series, it suddenly takes a turn for the cheesy, incomprehensible, nonsensical shounen style BS. It is very disappointing.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- The story ends on a cliffhanger. Very little is explained too, which is fine because there is a second season... but judging this season (\"Series\" as Europeans call it) on its own, it is an incomplete story that was both too slow and too rushed. It could have been great , it started so strong but slipped up half way through, never to recover again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nConcise;\\n\r\nIf you want a deep, complex, restrained and even mature story, the first half is highly recommended. The second half destroys what the first half built.\\n\r\nIf you want action; There is a surprisingly low amount of action in this series, but for the most part the action *means* something, so the bursts of action while more rare than you'd expect, are (almost) always important rather than becoming white noise like in other shows. \\n\r\nIf you want comedy, I thought a couple of the comedic moments worked fine but the comedy relief is very sparse ... which is good for this kind of story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHigh summary;\\n\r\nIf you want constant raw action, this is NOT for you.\\n\r\nIf you want constant comedy, this is NOT for you.\\n\r\nIf you want pathos, a deep story and well developed characters, check this out. The first half is 10/10.\\n\r\nIf you want a story that starts good and remains good, this is NOT for you.\\n\r\nThat being said, it is a good show, just not 'great' .\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\ngg",

            "content": "So the reason I watched this Anime is because 2 friends of mine had a pretty heavy discussion about it. \r\nOn one side we had the offender friend 1 with his statement : \"This Anime has one of the worst storywriting ever. It's so generic.\"\r\nOn the other side we had the defender friend 2 who said : \"Yeah that might be true but it's still enjoyable so I like it.\"\r\nWell to start off with of course both opinions aren't wrong but I was still intrigued to see for myself and confirm these statements. So after 3 episodes (which in my opinion is enough to judgea show) I reached the following conclusion :\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStatement 1 - Owari No Seraph is generic :\\n\\n\r\nYes, in my opinion this holds very true. After seing 3 episodes of this Anime I just couldn't think of anything else to say about this show than : \"A mashup of some popular shounen Anime (or Anime in general) such as Code Geass, Attack on Titan and many others, mixed together into an Anime with vampires in fastforward mode.\\n\\n\r\nThe Anime tries its best to just show as many cliches as possible in the fastest way it can.\\n\\n\r\nOWARI NO SERAPH CLICHE CHECKLIST :\\n\\n\r\n(x) Humanity at the brink of extinction desperately fighting back\\n\r\n(x) Main character looking for revenge after losing something precious\\n\r\n(x) Main character being naive and just trying everything way too hard\\n\r\n(x) Whimsy side character that also lost someone dear and also tries hard to be a badass\\n\r\n(x) People falling on other people in sexual ways\\n\r\n(x) Best friend / worst enemy\\n\r\n(x) MC having some kind of superpower exclusive to him\\n\r\n(x) Forced comedy that just looks cringy\\n\\n\r\nStatement 2 - It's still enjoyable :\\n\\n\r\nWell for me this one isn't true. I had a hard time watching this as (how I stated before) I thought it was just a fast forwarded version of trying to show as many cliches as possible appearing in Anime. It was more like a parody. Hell I think watching this Anime as parody of shounen Anime I'd even rate it higher since it was so funny. Too bad though. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day it depends on the viewer to decide if this Anime is enjoyable for you or not. There's a chance you will like it anyway despite me saying bad things about it. I mean we all have our own opinion right?\\n\\n\r\nTo finish up my review I gotta say even though the story is kind of meh the artwork and OST are still somewhat above average.\\n\\n\r\nSo how would I describe OnS in one sentence?\\n\\n\r\nA typical shounen Anime with vampire elements trying way too hard to be something good but ends up looking really weak and almost comedy-like but also having a somewhat good artstyle as well as a good music.",

            "content": "I just finished watching Seraph of the End and I thought I might review it. So here we go. \r\nStory:\r\nThe show takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where a virus has killed over 90% of the world\u2019s population and vampires have ascended from underground and are taking anyone under 13 and taking their blood in exchange for food and shelter. Our main character Yuuichirou and his friend Mikaela then try to escape with their friends which takes a turn for the worse and Yuuichirou is the only one that escapes. 4 years later Yuuichirou is now a part of the Japanese Imperial Demon Army andstrives to kill every vampire. Even though the story is a typical post-apocalyptic tale I liked the world that it took place in and even though by the end of the first season the story isn't complete, it compelled me enough for me to marathon the whole show. Although not much happens during the first couple of episodes and is purely focused on introducing characters and fleshing out already existing ones. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe main character, Yuuichirou, while likable is an extremely generic character as his main goal is to kill every single vampire, which while it is quite an ambitious goal is one that I have seen in many anime before and is by no means original. The main problem I have with him is that some of his ideals are wrong. Throughout the series he is haunted by memories of leaving his dying friends during the botched escape attempt. That\u2019s all good except for the fact that he didn\u2019t leave them behind because they were all dead and that his dying friend Mikaela told him to run away and to leave him behind. Because of that Yuuichirou\u2019s ideals are completely wrong and are just really stupid and leave you wondering if Yuuichirou was even paying attention during the escape. The rest of Yuuichirou's squad in the army are quite enjoyable to watch even though they fall into the typical character tropes that most anime seem to have. There is the quiet nice guy, the hothead and the over protective captain. The character that I liked the most from the squad was Shinoa Hiiragi who is always a joy to watch thanks to her very sarcastic nature and likable presence. \\n\\n\r\nThen there are the villains: The Vampires. The Vampires in Seraph of the End play a similar role to the Titans in Attack on Titan. They make the humans live in fear of them and they are very dangerous foes. They are the main antagonists of the series and they do a very good job at it. Most of them are very flamboyant and fun to watch but they all follow the same villain tropes that most other anime have and vampires aren\u2019t exactly the most original thing in this day and age. Although in this shows case, that is not a bad thing. The other antagonists of the series are the Four Horsemen of John which are these huge monsters that really serve nothing to the plot then to add in some action sequences early on in the show. I don\u2019t know if they become important in the second season since as of me writing this review I haven\u2019t seen the second season. \\n\\n\r\n**Spoiler Warning**\\n\r\nThe next character I am going to talk about is Mikaela. Mikaela was Yuuichirou\u2019s best friends before their escape attempt failed. Then while he was dying he was turned into a vampire by the Vampire Queen, Krul Tepes who made Mikaela her servant and made him fight against the humans. Like Yuuichirou, you are left wondering why Mikaela does what he does throughout the series. He has no problem killing humans even though he was one and even thinks that the humans around Yuuichirou are manipulating him and he even believes what that Vampire Lord, Ferid Bathory says, even though he was the one that killed all of Mikaela\u2019s friends and almost killed him. And it\u2019s not like Mikaela was brainwashed since he still wants to \u2018save\u2019 Yuuichirou from the humans and he still remembers everything that happened. Because of that you are left wondering what compels Mikaela to do what he does and why he sides with the vampires despite the fact that he was forcefully turned into one when he wanted to die instead. Other than that, Mikaela is an alright character to watch in the series, although I hope my main problems with him are fixed in the second season. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIf there is one thing to praise this show on is that it has an amazing soundtrack. Composed by my favorite anime composer, Hiroyuki Sawano, the soundtrack fits the show very well and has an amazing main theme. It\u2019s a soundtrack that I find myself going back to listening all the time and is also what made me want to watch the show so much. Then there is the voice acting. Like I would with any Funimation show, I watched the dub and I am very glad I did. All of the voice actors do a very good job with their characters and give some pretty enjoyable performances throughout the show. Special mention goes to Micah Solusod\u2019s performance as Yuuichirou. His portrayal of Yuuichirou made me like the character a lot more than I initially did and Felecia Angelle as Shinoa is one of the main reasons I like her as much as I do since her voice perfectly matches the character, design and personality wise. The only thing I can fault the sound department on is that some of the sound effects sound muffled and that the transitions between the music to the midway animation can be a bit awkward at times. Other than that the sound was really good in this series. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation in this show, done by Wit Studio who you may know from Attack on Titan and the currently airing Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress do an amazing job at bringing this show to life as the fight scenes are expertly handled and the bright colors make everything look beautiful. Overall, the animation is definitely one of the shows high points. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\r\nSeraph of the End is an anime that I would recommended to people that just want to watch a fun, mindless action show or to people that are interested in the show already. Despite its many flaws I found myself enjoying every episode to a certain extent and will be a show that I will probably revisit later on down the line. \\n\\n\r\nRating: Good\\n\r\n(My rating system is explained if you check my profiles main page. I hope you liked my first review and look forward to more including a review of the second season whenever I watch it). \\n\\n\r\nPeace out, Anime fans! \\n\\n",

You have to kinda stick it out and see what will happen next. I get that they need to explore the setting of the story in order for us to understand a lot, but I saw many scenes and many conversations unnecessarily dragged out to take up more time, I suppose.\r\nI am a fan of vampire related stories, especially when they are told differently that the usual stereotypical kind. That'sthe reason I decided to give this one a try. I am not disappointed in this but I am also not amazed. Going toward the end of this anime it got interesting and I could have seen that it could take an interesting direction. One of my weaknesses is close friendships between two guys, and since this has to do with it, I stuck with it. I was going to give this anime a 6 if it was like the first half of the season, slow and nothing much happening, but for the last few episodes, I got what I was waiting for so I decided to upgrade it to a 7.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime overall is good, and I hope the second season gets better.",

The Guilty Pleasure, the Ice on the cake, the Reason that the Beautiful Butterfly of Horribleness exists. all of them are Ridiculously bad on how so not Original they are!\\n\r\nthere is Yuu, a generic Protagonist that says cliche words like: \"I Will revenge my Family\", \"I hate Vampires and i gonna kill all of them\" and all of that cliche stuff, Mikaela is the Pretty Boy with a Golden Heart who loves it's Brother (Yuu) and wanna do Justice or something, Yoichi is the Boy who hates violence but wanna revenge it's family and shit and it's also kind of a Weak, Shihou the Stereo-Typical guy who is Tough and wanna save it's sister and always get a fight with Yuu (Ironical Rivality), Guren is the unlikable idiot who is Yuu's Sensei or some sort, Krul is a Female Majesty of Vampires which is more powerful than Shinya which is a Noble vampire with the Smile and stuff, and there is Shinoa which... is just like some sort of Love interest for the Hero so... yeah nothing much to say about it, and there is more characters in the Anime but i not gonna continue because Spoilers!\\n\r\nThey are all stereo Types of other well known anime and stuff... but at the same time Glorious on how Hilarious they can be! there where moments of the Anime which wasn't suppose to be Funny and yet... they are Hilarious! if it's with the Actions or the Dialogue or anything... it's just a Hilarious mess of a cast!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNow let's go to the Sound part. the Soundtrack it's sadly pretty Standard and with not a lot of memorable songs, aside from the ED and OP theme which are pretty good and enjoyable on a Positive way at least. the Voice acting is also fine but can't make up some really corny Dialogue that makes the anime even better on the Hilarious way. i didn't saw the English Dub but i might take a look if there is any official dub in English. just like the Art, there is not much to say about the Sound\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe Second best part! i enjoyed this anime for being so Awful, it's practically wonderful! from the Clich\u00e9s, from the Ending from the Stereo types... it's just so funny seeing all of these stupid things all together from all the Things that is mixed on this hilariousness of a Anime!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nin my Opinion, Owari no Seraph is a Guilty Pleasure that is so Lazy and incredibly bad it's Good! if you like those kind of animes to be entertained like this, Go watch it! i kind of recommend it. i mean yeah is one of the Dumbest animes I've ever seen in years, but is very Entertaining.",

The story I found to be very intriguing, a few plot holes here and there and there are some pretty cardboard cutout characters.. BUT, I am so compelled by the two main characters (love) affair/struggles that I couldn't care less. The main characters get 9's but almost everyone else gets 3-7s\r\nThe music is incredible, Iwould give it a 10 if they didn't use that jangly guitar music whenever there's a (light) heartfelt moment. Jazz, Rock, Electronic it's all very nice. Visually it is a pleasing anime, nothing substantially different from the industry standard nowadays but pretty nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nI would give this series a 10 if it kept going in the direction it did judging from the first 5 episodes, but after that it gets a bit dragged out near the end of the season. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want an action packed, cute, adventurous, stereotypical anime then check this out!!! There is NOTHING wrong with following a few standards as long as there's an interesting and emotionally charging narrative. In my opinion, that is an anime worth watching.",

            "content": "Owari no Seraph is a stinking pile of poop topped with a cherry named Mikaela Hyakuya.\r\nThis review covers both seasons of the show (no spoilers) and has nothing to do with the manga. \r\nONS follows your angry, unintelligent, revenge-bent but \u201cincredibly talented\u201d shounen lead and his friends, who I call Should-Have-White-Hair, Tsundere, Megane, and Female Love Interest. (Fun Fact: I call another character Exists-To-Make-Guren-Look-Better. Any guesses as to who?)\r\nIn both seasons, the cast has the personality of toast, relying on the stereotypical lines of their respective Anime/Manga trope to the point of nauseating predictability. If you\u2019re looking for character development, give up now. \r\nTossed intothe mix are cheap one-liners about family, desperation, and the will to survive (as a race). It seems like the writers watched the most popular Anime and pulled out the \u201cbest lines\u201d from each until they vomited up the disaster that is ONS\u2019s dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nSeason one consists of training with a battle thrown in at the end. Season two is a poorly explained string of events that I\u2019m forced to call a \u201cplot\u201d. Instead of following any sort of logic, the show is filled with \u201cblack holes\u201d, where terms like \u201cOwari no seraph\u201d are tossed around and spat out later without much explanation. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not hard to follow, though. I mean, I have seen this show dozens of times before with more interesting characters and plots that at least make sense.\\n\\n\r\nPainfully predictable, I almost didn\u2019t finish this show. The reason I swallowed it down: Mikaela Hyakuya, aka \u201cMika\u201d. Unfortunately for me, I love this character and found him fascinating enough to watch all 24 episodes of this franchise. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, you might want to save your time and skip this, since Mika barely gets any screen time. His development becomes difficult to follow because of that, but I let my own crazy brain fill in the holes.   \\n",

            "content": "Sooo, this was a frustrating watch. \r\nThis series had all the elements in place to be a really fun (if derivative) shonen vampire series. Protagonist with special powers, vampires, shady military, 2 friends on opposite sides, cute girls, etc. However, at every point it made some of the stupidest choices imaginable. What could have been really entertaining was bogged down with interminable dialogue, inconsistent characters and bad action.\r\nThe bad action is a real faux pas here, partly because the weapon designs are all huge and lend themselves to one on one fights but all the action is group battles and so characters have to kindof split off in a way that doesn't make sense. Also, why do people stop and talk in the middle of a huge battle, I get that these kind of shows often have a lot of talking mid fight which kinda makes sense in a 1v1, or even 2v2 or 3v3, but makes no sense at all in a giant free for all battle. Aaaargh, and all the girls have such huge weapons that they are totally unusable in fights and so they end up just standing there.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the core themes here is friendship and family (pretty standard for this kind of show) and I have no problem with that but it is hammered home so often that it gets tedious. Also the main character starts off as a reckless loner but after like 5 eps he is the life and soul of the party, everyone loves him and he is an amazing leader. It is such a quick character turnaround that it rings totally false.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it was still kinda fun so I can't rag on it too much. 6/10 - a real missed opportunity.",

            "content": "considering how popular this anime is and how many good things I heard about it, I was disappointed by how short it fell. The show's redeeming quality is the art, but honestly it's not good enough to watch it just for the art.\r\nThe biggest problem for me? Pacing. In episode one, there's way too much that happens. There's a virus that kills everyone under the age of 13. That's oddly specific. How does the virus know one's age? Why 13? And how does it kill people? Where did the virus come from? (this is never explained.) And then, all of a sudden, there's vampires? Isthis a new problem, or have they been there all along? Are they a result of the virus? Did they cause the virus? Are they susceptible to the virus' effects? None of these things are answered. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, there are things called vampire cities, and that's where they take all the surviving children (i.e. those under age 13). How did they find them all so quickly and completely? Have the vampire cities been around for a long time? If so, why has no one noticed these massive underground cities?(Also, it doesn't seem that any of the vampires are originally Japanese, because they're all based on traditional vampires like Tepes, Bathory,etc., and the fact that it's mentioned they speak English and Latin better...? but we're focusing on ep 1 rn so more on that later).\\n\\n\r\nSo our main characters are living in this vampire city, but we don't get long to learn about their living conditions beyond the fact that they have to give their blood to the vampires to pay for their protection. I guess it's bad? We don't get the chance to find out the particulars because the kids decide they're going to run away. But it's all a trap set by one of the vampires! And allll the kids die except for the Main Character, Yuu, who manages to escape to the outside world...even though we can only assume the virus is still active. Doesn't that mean that a)everyone is dead out there and/or b) once he reaches the age of 13, he'll just die anyway? \\n\\n\r\nI digress. He makes it out because literally everyone of his friends/family is dead. But fortunately, there's a group of soldiers waiting for him outside the Vampire City. The words of the Leader of this group make it seem like it was some kind of prophecy/prediction that Yuu (the MC), would make it out of the vampire city at THAT time and THAT place. This is never mentioned again, nor is the concept of prophecies being a thing ever mentioned. So our MC joins the army to become a vampire killing solider, because \"all he has left to live for is revenge\". How original.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's all in episode one. It's just...too much. It's normal to have questions after episode 1, but Owari no Seraph tries to do too much right off the bat.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, episode 2 flash forward to 4 years later, he's wielding a sword and fighting monsters in a military uniform, so I guess he's well on his way to getting that sweet, sweet revenge. Or not. Apparently, he wasn't supposed to be out hunting monsters? His punishment is being forced to go to school. He only spends maybe 3 episodes in school though, so it's really pointless. It makes you wonder what he's been doing for the past 4 years, since apparently he wasn't in school before (it's later shown that he doesn't really know any Kanji, which supports that he hasn't been doing anything academic).\\n\\n\r\nBut I guess he does make 4 new friends, who are his new \"family\" even though we're never shown any reason why they should be such close friends. We don't get to see them build relationships, we're just expected to accept that after a couple of conversations, they \"get\" each other.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this group of friends miraculously all make it into the Elite of Elite army group, the Moon Demon Unit (or something to that end. I honestly forgot). Anyway, it's the only group who has the power to eliminate vampires, but even the weakest of their little friend group manages to get into this most ELITE of units because...plot? None of them are ever shown to have trained, but they're just expected to know how to use these crazy weapons and be good at fighting. And it seems strange to let five 16 year olds join the most elite fighting groups that exist in human society. They are not qualified, and are sent out on a mission before they even know how to use their Magic Demon Weapons very well.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on, but I won't. The show tries to do in 12 episodes what it should have done in 25. It doesn't spend the time it needs to develop characters, motives, world building, and believability. It <<tells>> rather than <<shows>> most of the time, and more often than not it skips over important details, which create plot holes and huge gaps in knowledge about What Is Going On Here. The premise is interesting, and I even think the characters could have been likeable if they weren't so generic and inconsistent. \\n\\n\r\nMy advice if you really want to get the gist of this show? Watch ep 1, then skip to ep 11 and 12. You'll probably understand just about as much as those of us who watched them all. I might watch season 2 some day, if I have some time to kill, but who knows.",

The first episode was perfect, it was amazing, it could have been a movie, just that one episode. I literally just sat there on my seat at 2am just staring at a black screen, it was breathtaking. \r\nThe main reason for me the write this is for those of you, who like me, already, felt disappointed at the start of episode 2, please do not continue, trust me, it will bethe same or will lead to further disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was quite unique, it was a simple ruling on vampires, but what made it suck was its sense of realism, but before that I would like to add that the series actually forgot about episode one and went for like the most normal path of every action school based anime. The main thing was the new characters, they were boring as hell, a bratty tsundere boy like the main, a shitty coward, only shinoa was quite different and acceptable, and then the normal tsundere pigtailed girl gladly finished me off. It went lovey dovey where no sense of danger really occurred, it seems predictable at every point onwards.  \\n\\n\r\nNow onto the realism, this was supposed to the new hit of the season, with a bunch or half assed characters, someone needs to die and no one real no matter how shittty they are, this is the main cast erh, even the main character's hatred wasn't hot headed enough and was only fueled by he's gay bromance, he even forgot the potential childhood friend lover. it was like watching attack on titan, where no one died other than hes mum, and he became friends with literally everyone in the military, it literally just sucked character wise. it was the most common bunch that led to its mainsteamness. \\n\\n\r\nlike the only promising thing was the music, you can't resist some sawano. gee,",

However, I will give my personal opinion while trying my best to not be affected by others criticle.\r\nStory: 6\r\nAt the same time I like the setting and idea of the story, but also in hindsight see many previously used elements as well. There was also no real explaination of the virus, as while it supposedly killed everyone 13 and over, there were numerous people who werent affected, like the leader. Another is whatactually caused the virus, it is implemented that the humans were experimenting and ending up causing the virus, but that doesnt exactly explain how everyone supposedly died at the relatively same time, as last time I checked in biology, viruses cant just chose when to activate in everyone at the same time.\\n\r\nThere are also, as...blantly stated by others, a few similarities to AOT, however some of the comparisons can be said to be far fetched, like the apocalypse setting, and the only one to get out alive, while others I cant really deny all that well, like the revenge against them all, and to protect everything, like a certain E.Y. we all know...and kinda like.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art wasn't fantastic, but it certainly wasn't lazy either. There could definitely been improvement, but it wasn't anything to scoff at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sound was well...kinda average. The intros and outros did have some decent music, enough so that I always watched the intro instead of skipping it like I usually do for most animes. However, everyones music tastes are different and you may not like it as much as I did, so take that with a grain of salt.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nI won't sugarcoat it, most of the characters have been seen before throughout anime, like the hotheaded protaganist whos an ass (loved that though), the guy whos in it for his sick sister, the tsundere girl who acts important, and the pansy guy who acts like a pacifist. Then there was Mika, who somehow got it twisted into his head that the humans are the enemies, despite being human once himself (still not sure how that happened). Finally the 2 characters I loved the most, the short quiet sarcastic girl who likes to get under peoples skins and the general/leader who just doesnt give 2 shits for his fellow lackeys.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nDespite its cliches and similarities, it was the anime that I would always watch first or second on the saturday morning, so that goes to show that this anime has some watch value, with all of its action, drama, funny moments, and etc. While it may be called a AOT ripoff, it has promise and its own charms if you look past it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review so please don't judge me critically. I see many negative reviews so I thought maybe I should give a review in a brighter light. Many people are saying this anime is cliche and generic but why chose to watch it? It says in the caption what the anime is about and I'm pretty sure they mention something about him wanting vengeance. \r\nOverall, I would have to say that this anime had me clinged by episode one. You first expect it to be calm through the rest of the episode but it hits off during the last five minutes or so.Yeah, I get it's a guy vowing for vengeance but that's not the real focal of the story. It mostly focuses on the action and mystery. We have in our hands corruption within the human side and the actual question is (that the anime comes across from time to time) Who actually is the side you can trust? From watching seraph of the end through the end of the first season and a bit of the second, you get that they're trying to focus on that (as well as the I have to avenge my family thing). I get more of a Claymore anime feel than Attack on Titan. Attack on Titan left a lot of plot holes, and I would have to admit that. You get quick flashbacks of him getting a shot from his father and you're just like, \"What?\" Why did they pick Erin and what exactly was so special about him, I don't know. But just watching Seraph of The End, you know their focusing on that a bit more. You will get why they were experimented.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10  There was a virus that wipes out all humans, except children under the age of thirteen. I assume the vampires were only targeting children under 13 because they're easier to manipulate. Like imagine trying to control a bunch of adults who can easily come up with a plan to escape, that would be a lot harder, right? Okay let's not try to focus on the virus thing too much it really isn't that important, it's just provides further understanding to the setting, fr ex. Why there is barely any people in the outer world. --This might be a minor spoiler, (but you would come to understand on your own this after the first episode) the virus thing is not true, Obviously. It actually wiped out most of the population. I just felt it was necessary to this because I'm sure people do not like being misinformed.-- Anyway, we have a kid who has a tragic past and because of that past he wants to kill all vampires. That's basically what every summary gives you on an anime website. You'll get the idea of the whole story once you watch it. The story is quite more interesting than you expect, that gives this anime a certain uniqueness. \\n\\n\r\nI guess you guys are wondering why I rated the story a 10/10. Well at first you think the story is going to only be about a kid who wants to avenge his family, but it's not. The author finds a way to give us plenty of other things to pay attention to which I find really interesting and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is probably the only area where I think the author didn't spend much time with. You get the past of the characters but you don't get much of what they are thinking which can somewhat be a problem because you wouldn't be able to fully connect with a character if you don't know what they're thinking or where they stand in a certain position. \\n\\n\r\nYuu- Yuu is your typical stubborn character who wouldn't listen to anyone. This is not a major problem because he knows what he's capable of. I kind of like his character though because he may sometimes be like Naruto and have this \"I can do this\" type of attitude but doesn't fail. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 8/10 The art style is nice, it's just the way the fire looks. I personally think the fire is animated bad, it looks like it was done with a coloring pencil. \\n\\n\r\nMusic- 9/10 The music matches well with the mood. Soundtrack is nice. There might be a certain song that may spark your attention, P.S The beat that plays close to the end of ep.1. \\n\\n\r\nEntertainment- 10/10 Now come on, the author has done a good job to keep us entertained and I have to give him credit for that. If I didn't have some level of enjoyment for this anime my rating wouldn't be this high and I probably wouldn't have continued watching it\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Great anime the end of the episodes makes you want to continue. Give it a try, you won't know how good it actually is unless you watch it. I honestly can't understand why this anime is getting so much hate.",

            "content": "problems I had with this series for instance doesn't explain where the vampires came from what is the seraph of the end the characters often blame themselves for the death of somebody or when something goes wrong I felt the story was a bit rushed not to mention the battles are not that long why did the vampires experiment on children  where did the cursed gears come from how were they created  the endings were not satisfying to see especially in season 1 and 2 to much drama no backstories on other characters besides our main five in season 2 guren never relayexplained why he is using yu  the music sucks wait here is the best part no kiss shinoa  and mitsuba don't even compete to win the protagonist heart why doesn't mika try and get to know the protagonist friends the fight scenes suck  I liked the animation it sucked but it was alright to see doesn't advanced to the plot and is more focused on the concept of family more then anything it forces yu to choose mika or his squad as his family  some characters have similarity ambition's  like getting revenge for somebody dying this anime stinks but enjoyable to watch somehow.  \\n",

            "content": "Well, I am disappointed with this anime. I had hope that this would be a great anime after i finished watching episode 1 which I think was great The premise was typical but good and the way the story unfolded at the first episode made me wanting for more. Unfortunately as I kept watching I realized the most weak part of the anime, its characters. Shallow,boring and banal. The way they behave is predictable and annoying. The sense of terror and mystery surrounding the characters disappearred as the anime fell to shcool genre. Honestly the training session is unbearable to watch andthats why I dropped the anime at episode 6. \\n\r\n   The sound was good. I liked the OP and END and the soundtrack was okay I guess.\\n\r\nNo problems with the art too.\\n\r\n    So in general,\\n\r\nStory:6\\n\r\nCharacters:2\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\r\nEnjoyment:3\\n\r\nOverall:25/5=5",
