            "content": "I don\u2019t make it a point to write reviews, but I particularly enjoyed Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, and, upon seeing its subpar ratings, felt somewhat obligated to defend it, so, here goes:\r\nArt:\r\nWonderful, wonderful artwork. I\u2019m a stickler for art, having dropped numerous series simply because I couldn\u2019t stand the way they were drawn, and Denpa Onna definitely wins in this category. Shaft has outdone itself \u2013 colorful, lively scenery, vibrant, multi-toned characters, and, in general, great color schemes, compositions, and dynamism in each frame. It\u2019s not quite 5 cm/s, but I daresay it\u2019s approaching that level.\r\nSoundtrack:\r\nI usually neglect this category, as I find itto be a relatively minor component to my viewing experience. However, Denpa Onna does provide some melancholic piano keys and nice ambience music that complement the pacing well. Can\u2019t say I\u2019m a fan of the OP or ED, but, then again, I was never into the high-pitched squeals that permeate much of anime JPop.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAs many reviewers iterated before me, eccentricities abound in this motley crew of a cast. Honestly, it\u2019s refreshing to see a show invent new personalities instead of rehashing the standard anime prototypes. (I especially enjoyed how Erio Touwa [E.T.] sat in Makoto\u2019s bicycle basket as he pedaled her into the sky). Development is admittedly slow, but it\u2019s definitely there. This is something I feel many reviewers don\u2019t emphasize enough. Denpa Onna is a show about the gentle adolescence of our halcyon days, and, to that end, I think it\u2019s nice that events and developments aren\u2019t explosive or convoluted. The subtleties and gradual changes are meant to mirror the normalcy of our teenage years and, thus, offer a stark but welcome contrast to the eccentric personalities \u2013 that is, while the characters are themselves bizarre, their growth is relatable and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nDenpa Onna opened with an explosive start. Bracketing the rest of the show, I think the first 3 episodes could operate as a short, standalone OVA series. Really, I was hooked after watching a prologue so rife with meaning and mystery. Erio\u2019s personality is fully emphasized here, and here, too, is where the show probes most philosophically at the deeper themes of life. Makoto\u2019s rejection of Erio\u2019s delusions is a deeper rejection of ontological relativism as a legitimate means to happiness \u2013 his actions nuance his convictions well, and we really get a sense of Makoto\u2019s take on what it means to be human. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, I feel many casual viewers gloss over this last point and take Denpa Onna to be yet another mindless harem. Let me emphasize that it is not. Its insight is subtle, but present, and acutely profound.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what about the rest of the show, you ask? Well I can say that the first three episodes are somewhat anomalous when compared to the slow pace and slice-of-life themed events of the last 9 episodes. Critics charge that Denpa Onna lacks plot or hooks to keep viewers interested, and I\u2019m not unsympathetic to this criticism. However, as mentioned above, I think the slow pacing works well with what this show takes itself to be: a chronicle of a boy\u2019s adolescence. I find it far more realistic that schoolgirl crushes don\u2019t blow up into soap operas and baseball games don\u2019t become matters of life and death. Don\u2019t get me wrong; it\u2019s not like the series never scratches below the surface \u2013 it really does, but, often, it does so almost imperceptibly. Take episode 8 (Tsiolkovsky\u2019s Prayer), for example. It centers around Meme\u2019s daily routine over a week, but the conclusion of the episode is nothing short of powerful, poignant, and profound, letting us really glimpse the depth beneath her skin. People are unique, change slowly, and offer interesting and poignant stories.  This, I think Denpa Onna emphasizes very profoundly.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, among these events of every day life are the rare gemstones that move boys closer to manhood, and Denpa Onna doesn\u2019t forget this. Conversations with characters often revolve around mundane occurrences like deep sea fish or basketball games, but are artfully and subtly infused with lessons on the importance of curiosity or the rate of human progress. It\u2019s important, when watching, to pay attention to these moments \u2013 as they offer enlightening insight into the human experience.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what\u2019s the final verdict on Denpa Onna?\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for something explosive, convoluted, and plot-driven, then I advise you to turn away. If, however, you\u2019re looking for something light-hearted yet penetrating, then I urge you to pick this up. By the end of it, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, with its subtle but philosophical messages, really offers you a novel and reflective outlook on that awkward phase between puberty and responsibility. And,  after all, that\u2019s how life is: subtle but profound.\\n",

            "content": "This review exists within the internet, authored by a SHAFT fanboi.\r\nIt functions only as a test ground for me. It is also a spoiler zone in this page.\r\nUnder the current assessment of the series, it is a \"9/10\".\r\nThis was determined by my reaction to audio-visual investigation of the SHAFT seishun anime.\r\nPatience is the closest thing viewers have to salvation.\r\nHowever, accelerated exposure could amplify the viewing experience of a class-2 audience.\r\nA collective of readers that has forgotten it is a collective of voters... That is you.\r\nMembers of the self-unaware, clueless MAL users under aliases are not permitted to vote \"Not Helpful\" on this review.\r\nInjection of correctiveprogram to opinionated haters with inflated pessimism and distaste!\\n\\n\r\nI would write the entire review in Denpanese, but I used up my esper mana for speaking an alien language.\\n\\n\r\nThe word \"denpa\" (lit. \"electromagnetic waves\") is used to refer to people with overly-active imaginations who appear to live in their own world. In other words, delusional psychopaths.\\n\r\nThe word \"seishun\" (lit. \"blue spring\") means \"adolescent\" or \"puberty\". However, the term often implies the joys and challenges of overcoming immaturity, and youthful romance, as per usage in \"seishun points\".\\n\\n\r\n'Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko'(loosely translated to \"Psychopathic Girl and Adolescent Boy\") begins with the the protagonist Niwa Makoto moving into a new city, known as the \"the City Watched Over by Aliens\". He's in his aunt Meme's care, whose daughter Erio is a denpa hikikomori wrapped in futon.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with Makoto getting to know Erio. She's got a serious case of denpa, believing herself to be an alien who came to Earth to investigate the mankind. Being a nice guy that he is, Makoto takes her out to prove she's a human being and can't fly like E.T. After that, the focus is transferred to the remaining cast, Mifune \"Ryuushi-san\" Ryuuko, Maekawa-san, and Hoshimiya Yashiro.\\n\r\nMany viewers must have felt betrayed when Erio turned from a jargon-spitting enigmatic girl in a futon to an ordinary shy girl, but ironically, Makoto and Erio are surrounded by denpa and therefore has plenty of material for comedy and accumulation of Seishun Points.\\n\\n\r\nNiwa Makoto is your average protagonist in a harem setup. He even describes his own situation as a typical protagonist in school drama in the first episode. However, he does have his own unique Seishun Point system to keep track of the quality of his school life, and does actively pursue opportunities to accumulate points. He is one of the more likable protagonist around in that he has a skeptic, realistic personality, but man up when it really counts. He has a pretty good sense of humor, and we as viewers follow his narration as a guide, seeing things through his perspective almost the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nTouwa Erio started out as a hopeless loner whose own mother had given up on her for becoming denpa after a traumatizing event in her childhood. She does eventually get \"fixed\" by Makoto, and makes a slow return into the society. Her character provided early selling point for the series, and we see her gradual change after Makoto showed up. This season ended at volume 3 of the novel series, out of 8 volumes in total. Her change in character was limited to finding a part-time job and participating group events, but there is surely more to come if a sequel is ever made.\\n\\n\r\nTouwa Meme is a 40-year old aunt of Makoto, who acts like a child all the time and sputters nonsense all the time. Her role in this series is mainly MILF moe and acting as a puppet-master who influences the other main characters to get the story going. She's quite mysterious, and it's hard to know what she's thinking, but as audiences, we know she's hiding something about Elliott, who may or may not be an alien.\\n\\n\r\nRyuushi-san is probably the most interesting character in this series. She is a moeblob, but has an unique and consistent quirkiness that worked really well with Makoto. Their chemistry is excellent, and she's just one of those adorably cute hard working character that you can't help but cheer for. She is the de facto Heroine in this season, spending most time with Makoto and the only one to actively try to win him over like a character in a true seishun series. Yashiro's line in ep11 makes me wonder if they would eventually become an item. The way she blushes around Makoto was really cute, and I'll certainly be cheering for her.\\n\\n\r\nMaekawa-san's personality is almost the opposite of Ryuushi-san. She's always composed and has a dark sense of humor, also seems to have analyzed every situtation and knows what's going on. However, she also seems to have a screw loose on her head, with all the strange cosplays shown in every episode. Her role in the show is mainly to tease Makoto and Ryuushi-san, but getting them together conflicts with her apparent feelings for Makoto. There could be some major character development for her if the sequel is ever made. And of course, her costumes are also there for moe to niche viewers.\\n\\n\r\nHoshimiya Yashiro made a very late appearance this season, but left a huge impact into the story. She claims to be an alien esper, which no one believes, but she has shown evidence of her super powers throughout the final few episodes. Interestingly, she says Makoto and Ryuushi both have \"the potential\", which was precisely what Erio said to Makoto early in the show when she was still a major denpa. Yashiro also brings a new theme to the show, that one should not limit their potential, and develop the strength to believe. This message is extremely similar to 'Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin', but it is executed far better here, with many great inspirational scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEvery major characters have their roles in the show, and the character headcount is very low to ensure every character gets their own spotlight. There were some pacing problems in the middle as one non-linear episode mixed in and extremely slow story development, but there are incredibly inspiring and touching moments of youth in every episode as a treat. There are also plenty of references to other manga and anime, sometimes even real life events to keep us entertained.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation is this series is generally very good. The character designs are attractive, with great cuts and camera angles (although it's almost completely devoid of the signature SHAFT animation style). There are few scenes where characters seemed deformed for budget saving purposes, possibly using Korean animators, but every single inspiring scene (and fan service scene) that actually matters is drawn to perfection. SHAFT knows how to inspire and how to best use visual support to tell a story, and it shows once again in this series.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, with exception of Erio, is spectacular. Ryuushi-san's voice acting is what I would call \u300c\u30cf\u30de\u30ea\u5f79\u300d, epic casting. Her voice is so unique, yet fits the character perfectly. All the seiyuu staff in this series are extremely motivated, and their lines are filled with emotion, especially in the most critical lines.\\n\r\nBGM is also incredibly touching and flows extremely well. It kind of just plays in the background, but becomes really noticeable in critical scenes to improve the viewing experience... it's in total harmony with the story.\\n\r\nOP is a \"denpa song\" in a whole different way. The term is usually used to describe songs with incomprehensible lyrics. In this case, the lyrics do make sense, but BGM composition and the vocal sound absolutely retarded. This works extremely well for a series about denpa, and it's somehow addicting. Absolutely brilliant.\\n\r\nED is rather dull, but cute song with fun lyrics and unique whisper vocals.\\n\\n\\n\r\n'Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko' has many classic, almost clich\u00e9 seishun elements, such as screaming out corny lines in public, running towards the sun (its variation biking towards the moon was used), awkward silences between the opposite sex, working hard on sports... However, it's the execution that makes all the difference, and it really shows in this series. The main message of keeping our minds open and appreciate every moment of our lives, it really reached my heart.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has also given me a new level of appreciation for NisiOisiN's works. Although the series does attempt to use witty dialogs to advance the story and succeeded to some degree, it lacks the pacing and sophistication seen in similar NisiOisiN adaptations by SHAFT, 'Bakemonogatari' and 'Katanagatari'. If I had to pick, this is closest to 'Soredemo Machi wa Mawatte Iru' for being a rare authentic 'slice-of-life' anime, and also the extreme quirkiness that's hit-or-miss for its viewers. It was a definite hit for me, and I'll definitely look forward to the sequel.\\n\\n\r\n'Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko' is a story full of dreams and depicts an ordinary guy in a crazy city, trying living his life to the fullest. It's brilliant, and exactly what a true seishun series is all about. If you disagree, I guess I'll just say it out loud in a clear and concise phrase... \\n\\n\r\n\"If you say so.\"",

Instead of admitting that you have a problem, you blame your drinking because your wife nags at you, or because the devil told you to do it, or some other excuse I could not think of because I do not have drinking problem. (No, I'm not in denial here, I seriously don't have a drinking problem)\r\nReality distortion\r\nDenpa Onna to Seishun Otoko deals with characters who distorts reality to their own convenience to escape facing the inconceivable truth. As normal human beings, we usually believe our perception of the worlds within and around us is \"true.\"\r\nThe story revolves aroundNiwa Makoto (who is playing as the youthful man) and his cousin, Touwa Erio (who is playing as the electromagnetic wave woman) living with his aunt  Touwa Meme (horny old woman with a 20 year old body. Yes in Japan it is possible without cosmetic surgery) in a small city famous for alien encounters.\\n\r\nNow if you all know me (which I doubt you do) you probably think I picked up this title because it has youthful scent all over it which means a harem is soon to follow. \\n\\n\r\nYES. I wont deny that. Other reasons would be due to Erio hot legs. (No I do not have a leg fetish)\\n\\n\r\nSo we follow the journey of Makoto collecting youthful points for god knows what reason (as if you can measure youth) and along the way he meets (as expected) more girls to add to his circle of harem... I mean circle of friends.\\n\\n\r\nArt wise, it's very obvious that you can tell that this is one of SHAFT's handiwork. The dramatic zoom into background objects, character faces, (especially the eyes) I've read a couple of chapters from the light novel and it is clear that the portrayal of the story using the artwork is nicely executed.\\n\r\nThe voice cast chosen are befitting for their characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow I can't go into detail about all the characters as I want to avoid spoilers as much as possible. But I would like to stress something on Niwa Makoto.\\n\r\n[REASONS WHY MAKOTO SHOULD HAVE A HAREM]\\n\r\n1) He is a nice guy (Main characteristic a harem male lead)\\n\r\n2) He is a transfer student (Research shows that 4/5 of anime transfer students gets a harem)\\n\r\n3) He doesn't live with his parents (He is independent which means less cockblock)\\n\r\n4) He is not ugly (Have you ever seen an Ugly harem male lead?)\\n\r\n5 His name is Makoto (Reference To the Makoto from SchoolDays. I just hope his balls is still intact when everything is over)\\n\\n\r\nBasically, Makoto here is a personification of everything that is adolescent in anime terms.\\n\\n\r\nHis cousin on the other hand (Touwa Erio) plays the fumbling yet lovable character (well I find her lovable because I love girls with blue hair. No I do not have a blue hair fetish) She plays the electromagnetic wave woman in this series (electromagnetic wave woman here means weird, crazy or someone who has an obsessive behavior on an perception) She provides the story for the first arc in the series, Makoto helping her cope from her transition from an 'extraterrestrial being' back to a 'normal' human being. \\n\r\nShe is also the main example of a person who is clearly distorting her own reality. \\n\r\nBut she may not be in denial? Perhaps it was misinformation?\\n\r\nFor example have you ever experience sleep paralysis? People who don't know the term sleep paralysis may think that when this occurred to them, aliens are actually probing them. This is just the way it is when you do not have information on your current circumstance.\\n\\n\r\nDo I find this amusing in any way? \\n\r\n- I find adolescence amusing\\n\r\n-I find eccentric characters amusing\\n\r\n-I find futon wrapped Erio amusing\\n\r\n-I find getting a million youth points for seeing a girl naked wrapped with a bath towel amusing\\n\\n\r\nWhat I do not find amusing?\\n\r\n- I find incest not amusing\\n\r\n-I find cradle robbers not amusing\\n\r\n-I find cattle mutilation not amusing\\n\r\n-I find no harem in a supposedly capable harem producing anime not amusing\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you're a fan of SHAFT like works (and no I'm not referring to Madoka, damn Madoka fanboys...) then I see no reason why you should not watch this.\\n\r\nI have learn from this anime that sometimes blaming aliens is all what it takes to escape reality. (For those of you who had sleep paralysis, blaming alien is very common)\\n\r\nExamples:\\n\r\n\"The crime rate had risen over the past few years\"\\n\r\n-I blame Aliens\\n\r\n\"Baby dumping has increased from a decade ago\"\\n\r\n-I blame Aliens\\n\r\n\"Our job opportunity has been falling recently\"\\n\r\n-I blame Aliens\\n\r\nCase in point.\\n\\n\r\nOh by the way, \"Aliens\" here DO NOT mean Mexicans.

            "content": "A really casual one, it was a totally random choice, but I don't regret it though. So what's it about? It may not have an incredible climax and everything... Instead, this anime focuses more upon reflection. It's simple:  just take a teenager who wants to enjoy his high school years to the max and add an odd girl to whom he begins devoting his time, in order to get her back to real life.\r\nMakoto's first time in a big city made him create big expectations about how his life would be from now on. He wanted to meet girls, spend time with them andeven maybe fall in love, afterall, that's what being an young boy is all about. Meeting Erio was the first step from this new journey. Having met his \"energetic\" aunt, Meme, and after her, Maekawa and Ryuko, most episodes are dedicated into showing his relationship growing with all of them.\\n\\n\r\nStill, that's not all... Believing he would be able to change Erio's attitude and put an end to her self-isolation from society, Makoto becomes her only true friend... Making her forget all this \"alien stuff\" and the past she couldn't remember, trying to get her to be more sociable and stop hiding from everyone... This also affects Makoto, as he gets more self-confident.\\n\\n\r\nArt impressed me... Glowing style, slow-mo scenes and fluid animation, despite not having much action, overally amazing! I think OP theme could've been better and the ED song is so sweet and calm... Characters have nothing really special in particular. Most of them are ordinary people with different personalities. Both Ryuko's and Erio's shyness attracted me... Besides that, they're so cute and lovely! Also, voices chosen for both of them match perfectly!\\n\\n\r\nNever give up and believing in yourself, just two of the many lessons we can learn from this anime... Nobody comes to this world for no reason and, since we don't understand the real purpose of life, all we can do is live, make it worthy... Taking the best we can from our youth years and making every moment count, Denpa Onna was really made to change the way some people think about their own lives, to encourage those on enjoying it the best they can... That's so deep...",

            "content": "A problem that a show with interesting premise or quirks can run into is getting far too wrapped up in itself. A show can become contrived, focusing on playing around with its quirkiness; forgetting that there is a story to be told. Such is the case with Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, a charmingly eccentric show that ultimately gets deflated by the eccentricities that made it appealing to begin with.\r\nDenpa Onna is a bizarre show, to say the very least. It centers around Makoto Niwa, a somewhat sarcastic young man who goes to live with his aunt Meme; having certain expectations of his new life.Expectations that are shattered after meeting his impishly flirtatious aunt and beyond bizarre cousin Erio,who claims to be an alien and wraps herself in a futon. He later meets a cheerful and clumsy girl named Ryuko (or better known as Ryushi, to her irritation), and the resident cosplay character, Maekawa. While this sounds like your standard cast for a slice-of-life anime, rest assured, the cast is eccentric enough to stand out from the crowd. Every character has their weird quirks and talk in a way no normal person would. Erio in particular is a winsome odd-ball, a hikikomori who uses the guise of being an alien as a shield from her insecurities; and Maekawa existence seems to be poking fun at use of pun humor in anime. The off-beat way these characters behave and interact with one another is what gives the show its unique flavor.\\n\\n\r\nThe show puts its eccentric characters and rambling dialogue to good use. Pretty much every conversation between characters has an entirely different meaning than its face value. A conversation about aliens can actually be an exchange of worldviews; one about ESP can actually be about peoples' hidden potential. This makes the exceedingly strange exchanges between characters meaningful, rather than just nonsensical ramblings. Just as interesting is seeing our dysfunctional recluse of a female lead, Erio, slowly warm up to her cousin. We see her change from being insanely introverted to a slightly more stable, though still fairly unsociable, weirdo. She even has a part-time job and joins an amateur baseball team by the shows finale, all the while retaining the charming weirdness that grabbed our attention in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nSo why does this show fall short, well... it doesn't really go anywhere. Sure, Erio progressively becomes more active in the world around her, but as for everyone else progress is near non-existent. Even as Makoto gets to know Maekawa and his aunt Meme better, their relationships remain static through the entire series.This is even true for Ryuko, who has a big crush on Makoto. You think with all the talking in the show these relationships would develop nicely, but instead the characters spend most of the time talking around each other and dodging pressing matters. When they aren't in convoluted conversation or monologue, the characters are usually engaged with some trivial activity that is entertaining enough to watch but pointless in the grand scheme of things. Not to say these aspects of the show are not enjoyable, but they do get tedious to watch as the show continues on its merry way to nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's visuals are pretty solid, though nothing to write home about, really. The scenery is pretty much what you would expect from a slice-of-life, nothing breathtaking, but it gets the job done. As for the character designs, most attention goes to the female cast (of course), which is the visual highlight of the show. Erio is gorgeous, likely the best looking leading lady of 2011, and mother Meme; rival for Makoto's attention, Ryuko; cosplaying Maekawa; and late arrival Yashiro are just as pretty. The rest of the cast is more average looking, but pleasant on the eyes nonetheless.  The music is also pretty typical of slice-of-life (except for the bizarre opening and oddly cute ending themes). It pleasantly floats around supporting the shows atmosphere, though can also build up excitement when called to do so, like in the \"I can't fly\" scene, which is the the shows most striking moment.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko is a generally pleasant experience. Its strange, off-kilter tone and characters definitely sets it apart from regular slice-of-life anime. Plus, Erio is the cutest basket-case you are likely to find. It is a shame the story doesn't really progress, getting caught up in a web of convoluted dialogue and all too quaint events. This is actually not a bad show, just a disappointing one.",

            "content": "I hate Shaft, I really hate this studio. For every good show they make, there must be some 5 mediocre ones in between. However, I still love their artsy touch and the way they handle most dialogues that is much present in Denpa Onna. Yet, there\u2019s something lacking in Denpa Onna to make it good and that is a focus. It\u2019s a shame really, because this anime had such a great start. I find it sad that they had to ruin it in the second half.\r\nBased on a light novel, the story shares some similiraties with the Haruhi Suzumiya. Most notably, the two main characters,which both have the same personality, are emerged in a world of bizarre situations. The difference is that Denpa Onna is completely voided of any supernatural element, even though it brings aliens and espers in the foreplay. Though the story could be considered as some sort of coming of age, it is never clear what it is really about. The big problem with Denpa Onna is how well it handles the many elements that it is given, for I must say, not well at all. While it does begin as a simple story of \u201csaving the broken girl\u201d, it doesn\u2019t take time before the series loses its initial charm. For the second half, the anime turns around in a midst of pointless moments that can range from enjoyable to plain boring. Though, these pointless moments, are for the best, emotional. The results here shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Denpa Onna concludes in a unsatisfying and completely out of place way that leaves you a bitter taste in the end. In other word, what it needs is a satisfying sequel with a much, much better direction.\\n\\n\r\nKnowing Shaft, it is not surprising that Denpa Onna shares a good amount of mentally ill characters. For new comers, this might be a refreshing outcome since they act mostly in an extravagant way. For the Shaft followers or other anime connoisseurs, it is nothing that you haven\u2019t seen before and might even annoy you. Though, while the characters\u2019 traits aren\u2019t problematic, there is a big lack of character development that would have helped this anime greatly. If Denpa Onna would truly have been a coming of age, some actual development for the characters would have been great. However, everything stays static in this series. There is also an issue of not enough screen time for the female characters in this series. The series is mostly in the point of view Makoto and we mostly see him jump from a girl to another many times in the anime and this only ends up in some sort of unassuming harem between two friends and his cousin.\\n\\n\r\nShaft, as always, delivers in the production value. Erio might have been an uninteresting character after all, but her character design is probably the most interesting of the season. Sadly, the same could not be said about the other characters. For the visual, Denpa Onna has its fair share of eye candies and sparkles moments that will please any fans of the sort. I have to admit that some of these scenes were actually beautiful. Shaft is also more lay back in this one, and Denpa Onna doesn\u2019t have too much quick and weird angle shots. The music is also top notch in Denpa Onna. The anime opens with a tad annoying, but very catchy song. The score in the actual series doesn\u2019t have anything impressive, but it does the job well done. As for the voice actors, well they were great, no doubt about that.\\n\\n\r\nTo kill the mockingbird, Denpa Onna is actually a very forgettable show. The anime did have an interesting and original premise, but it soon falls into something that has been done million times before. Still, if someone is looking for moe characters, this anime is definitely for them. There are some rumours about a possible second season. If this happens, let\u2019s just hope Shaft does it right this time.\\n",

            "content": "The central problem with 'Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko' is the way it treats the supernatural. It attributes normal, everyday occurrences to aliens, espers, clairvoyance etc. Had a bad day at school? Must be god's fault. Achieved something you've never even dreamed of achieving? Must be your esp abilities. Amnesia? Aliens. Cute girl smiles at you? Fate.\r\nYou can pretty much see that this kind of storytelling is going to get ridiculous after a few episodes and sure enough that's exactly what happens in this anime. Despite the \"Sci-fi\" tag, there's no attempt at any scientific explanation either. Things that have no basis in reality andhaven't been proven scientifically are depicted in here as if they were the bread and butter of the natural world. And despite the main protagonists doubts as to such supernatural events, the anime pretty much ends on the same note - \"Yeah, it's real. Deal with it.\" \\n\\n\r\nNow on to the individual components :\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this is the weakest point of this anime. Guy comes to the city (Niwa Makoto), meets his horny aunt (Meme), his mentally unstable cousin suffering from amnesia (Erio), goes to school and assembles a generic, albeit miniature harem. Obligatory introductions over, 'Denpa' shifts focus to supernatural events. Some of the most common occurrences in every day life will be passed here as being caused by some kind of supreme power that lives within all of us. Yeah sure, that's about as Sci-fi or slice-of-life as Norse mythology. I would have been glad to at least see some sort of an attempt at science here but no such luck. \\n\\n\r\nIn between bouts of acts of god the story also tries its hand at drama and fails because most of said drama is either caused or attributed to... you guessed it - more paranormal acts. 6 episodes in and I already had to force myself to keep watching this anime because I knew that nothing intriguing would come from it. Moreover after the first 3 episodes, the story just starts repeating its own premise with minimal plot and character progression. Why did Erio lose her memory? Aliens. Episode 6 - Why did Erio lose her memory? Aliens. Episode 9 - Why did Erio lose her memory? Aliens. Episode 12 - Why did Er... Hey we don't know but here, chew on more alien and esper theory.\\n\\n\r\nI think what this anime relies on is the fact that you can't disprove the supernatural. You may not believe it but you can't steadily disprove it. At the same time this anime offers no insight or explanation of the supernatural. Most sci-fi works rely on some mixture of quantum physics, time traveling, parallel universes etc to explain their seemingly ESP-esque characters. 'Denpa' is more of a case of \"believe it or don't\". Unfortunately that also means that most watchers will either love it or hate it, depending on their beliefs. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters in this show possess a decent degree of originality, as I haven't noticed any known popular arc-types in this anime, they also receive very little development throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nA prime example of that would be Erio. Initially a social recluse, she opens up a little after her cousin's arrival and... stays that way throughout the whole show. She engages in very little dialogue and even though the name of the show and the synopsis would imply that the story will heavily revolve around her - that's not actually true. I was disappointed to see that she is pushed away and focus shifts primarily towards the protagonist and his micro-harem. \\n\\n\r\nThe male lead himself seems to be among the only three rational and realistic characters in this show, refusing to believe in the supernatural without proper evidence. The other two would be Makoto's classmates Maekawa and Ryuuko who seem to provide even more realism to the series. Again, the problem with this section is that there is practically no character development present. The relationships between Makoto and his classmates go nowhere, the show doesn't expand upon their personalities from what we originally see and from the beginning to the end the show maintains a near-perfect status quo. \\n\\n\r\nMakoto's aunt, Meme, serves no real purpose apart from comic relief, with her over the top perverted antics. While initially being quite surprising and slightly amusing it quickly gets old, luckily the show reduces her role in comic relief just before it starts to get annoying. \\n\\n\r\nYashiro's late introduction to the series made little sense and I think that it would be fair to hail her as the most underdeveloped character in this series. Personality-wise, she's an annoying shallow tsun character who runs around screaming about esper supremacy. Everyone else that I haven't mentioned is so far down on the totem pole that they are plot insignificant and only there to serve as background characters.\\n\\n\r\nART (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is the strong point of 'Denpa' as the art here is flawless. The characters are certainly appealing and attention has been paid to every single little detail. Static background is crisp and well drawn. I haven't noticed any mistakes in the coloring, the art is consistent all throughout and true to its style and as such this section deserves a full mark of 10 points. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND ( 7/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhile the opening is rather irritating with that high-pitched squealing for 2 minutes straight, not to mention that the rhythm just completely doesn't fit to the drum solo in the background - watchers will find respite in this anime's OST. It does contain some decent pieces, especially the ones that play during the more dramatic sequences of 'Denpa'. The ending song, while a little bit bland, at least wasn't annoying. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting itself was authentic and matched the characters quite well. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I didn't enjoy this series. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. Something to watch if you're really bored or you're really into the whole ESP stuff but a casual anime watcher will be confused, bored and then agitated while watching this - in that order. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned in the story section you will either love or hate this anime. Holding a middle ground here is extremely difficult because this anime does not attempt to reference its content in any way. If anything, watch it for Meme's wackiness, or watch it for the lighthearted high school dramedy. Either way, not taking this anime seriously is paramount if any enjoyment is to be had.\\n\\n\r\n5 points out of 10.",

            "content": "In one of the opening scenes of this anime, a certain character welcomes the main character (along with the viewers) by saying \"Welcome to the city watched over by aliens.\" After watching this I have come to realize one thing: how horribly distasteful these aliens are.\r\nSeasoned anime fans will take notice of the fact that this show is directed by Shinbou Akiyuki. You might recognize him for directing great shows such as Bakemonomgatari, Arakawa Under the Bridge, and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, which all have a similar formula going on: a male character surrounded by a harem of weird quirky females. Considering how much of thistype of show he has done, and the valuable attribute of the human mind to gain experience, one might expect him to have garnered enough knowledge to create enjoyable shows with absolutely no effort at all. Well, apparently, no. Either his brain has become too dense with all the success and praise from his previous works, or he just suffered a nervous breakdown to which he responded by making the most incoherent, dumb, and most boring anime he could possibly conjure. And that is Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko (Electromagnetic Wave Woman and Adolescent Man).\\n\\n\r\nThe story is the same old \"Guy moves into a city\" \"New home has cute girls in it\" \"New school has cute girls in it\" and so on. Oh, and the girls garner an inexplicable affection towards the main character. In the case of Denpa, a regular country bumpkin Niwa Makoto moves into the city to live at his aunt's house. Upon entering the house he notices a girl wrapped in a mattress lying near the doorway. This is how we are introduced to the show's main attraction, Touwa Erio, an amnesiac girl who believes she is an alien put on earth for observational purposes. The story then resolves around Makoto as he tries to help Erio overcome the barrier she has put up between herself and society. Of course, this is not a story-driven anime. You get the vibe that the makers didn't have any idea what they were doing and the story goes down the drain pretty quickly, as this is apparent half way into the show when all the characters are just loitering around trying awkwardly hard to get a giggle out of you. I'd gladly pay you if you find anything groundbreaking about this anime's plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this show really throws everything at you, which at the base level boils down to a 'hit or miss' game where the chance of a hit is that of winning in a million dollar lottery. The so-called witty conversations between characters that SHAFT does so well literally falls apart here. There are tons of dialogue but they just go into one ear and come out of the other, rarely triggering anything along the way. How could anyone rely on a cast of such uninteresting characters to deliver good jokes is beyond me.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is generally quite colorful and neat, but there's just something about the character designs that make them look overly childish, to the point that it's hard to call them \"high schoolers\". From an objective point, it felt to me like most of the work done in this department went into Erio's appearance and elaborate schemes to make her more cute, as she glaringly stands out among all the other bland characters that occupy this show. One of the few redeeming features of Denpa Onna is it's OP and ED. The OP sung by Erio's voice actor in an epic karaoke voice is quite fun and almost makes the rest of the show worthwhile. Maybe the unimpressive dialogue mentioned earlier might have been the cause of poor chemistry among voice actors because the voice acting here is decent at best. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have to say that Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko fails in soaring through the sky, not to mention space. The first few episodes might keep you occupied with a false sense of more to come but what's to come is mind-numbing stupidity and a whole load of wasted of time.",

            "content": "An anime with a normal, ordinary boy couldn\u2019t be anything but an ordinary slice-of-life comedy right? Well, hate to break it to you, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s much more complex, intricate, and amazing than a run-of-the-mill standard anime. Even though the plot may seem a bit bewildering at first, the series proves itself worthy of an amazingly high score.\r\nThe basics? A high school boy named Niws Makoto recently moves to his Aunt\u2019s house and becomes a Transfer Student. There he meets his mysterious cousin, Touwa Erio. She walks around every day wrapped around a futon and believes that there are aliens and tries to stop\u201calien invasions.\u201d Touwa Erio lost her memories one day after being missing for half a year and then being found floating out in the sea. Makoto thinks her idea and beliefs are absurd and believes that she is using aliens as a cover up for her missing memories. Touwa Erio then dropped out of school and everyone thinks of her with harsh memories and treats her as \u201cextremely weird.\u201d At school, Makoto makes good friends with two girls, Mifune Ryuuko (or Ryuushi, which is kind of a teasing nickname for her) and Maekawa, a tall girl who gets dizzy easily and works at a lot of different part-time jobs. Makoto is into \u201cadolescence points\u201d which are points that he gains when something good and memorable happens, like when a girl is invited to his house.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's get scoring!\\n\\n\r\nPRESENTATION: Beautiful from the first episode. The animation and art were both wonderful, and so were the background designs. Not really any complaints, as this is for first impressions. [10]\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Done well, for the most part. Most people are all shown to be moving, the sky to be animated, and the beautiful colors of the scenery and the characters themselves. I loved the whole art aspect, I could daresay it\u2019s approaching the level of art of 5cm/s. Though, some parts are lacking, as they fail to animate most people during the summer festival, and some explosions as well. Overall, the main portions (characters, setting) are all animated and drawn beautifully. [9]\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: As you can see from the basics, it\u2019s a great sci-fi story. The first three episodes are Erio\u2019s main story, but after that, critics state that Denpa Onna lacks interest to continue hooking the viewer. I believe in the opposite. Each of the episodes after reveal much more insight to the characters, as one episode revealed Meme\u2019s true feelings towards things than just what she acts like on the outside, and adds in character personality for Ryuuko and Maekawa as well. This is certainly not a harem (even though it could be considered one) nor a normal slice-of-life.  I guess it\u2019s to say that there are an infinite number of mysteries out there, and no one theory of belief relating to a mystery is false. It takes belief and consideration and respect, not ignorance. That\u2019s almost like my moral in life, which is one of the reasons I ended up loving this series. Of course, I wish the ending was still more resolving, but what can I say. The way it doesn\u2019t resolve everything but manages to leave us in awe and in mystery is good enough to net it a [10].\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Obviously the strong point of this anime. With a happy, energetic, and flustered fruitist Ryuuko to a tall dizzy Maekawa and an ignorant but considerate Makoto and a childish but caring Meme and a serious but silly Yoshira really brings the story to light. Of course, don\u2019t forget Erio. She used to be without personality, almost unhuman, but now she\u2019s become a shy, reserved girl. With these characters and episode insight, we can see deeply into their character and feelings even. Great development, and great characters. [10]\\n\\n\r\nMOOD: What can I say for mood? Generally, if it doesn\u2019t play a big role in any anime I end up scoring it with a 10 unless major faults were here. I can\u2019t really think of any. There were a few stand-out exciting mood areas, especially where he biked off a cliff (when he was planning not to but his brakes failed) and when he made that long speech cheering Ryuuko on, and that final meteor hit. It strays a bit far away from slice-of-life, but after all, this is sci-fi, is it not? [10]\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\n              (OP) The OP isn\u2019t exactly to my tastes. In my opinion, it\u2019s sung a bit off-key and a bit too screamy and high-pitched. That was my first impression, but now, I like the OP. It takes a while to get used to it, like Hana no Iro (which has now become one of my favorites as it has become the first full song I can play on my guitar), but once you get used to it, I like it. Still, I wish it wasn\u2019t as\u2026screamy\u2026but still, a lot of jRock is like this. So, what can I say? High pitched voices isn\u2019t really my concern, and the song\u2019s melody is really something that is kinda memorable. Also, this song doesn\u2019t seem to fit with the overall story of Denpa Onna, being fairly relaxed with a few jolts and anxiety mood changes, but this song is pretty drastic and surprising and emotional and\u2026loud. The only place where it could describe could be that meteor hit\u2026[9]\\n\r\n              (ED) The ED was a song I love. It began a bit too slowly, which almost turned me off, but then it suddenly becomes much more upbeat in the middle. It\u2019s cheery and all-around happy, which kind of fits Erio\u2019s new personality. The OP was a bit\u2026too drastic to really represent anything in the anime except for the meteor hit. It\u2019s quite memorable, and I have no complaints. [10]\\n\r\n              (InAnime) If it\u2019s not noticeable, it\u2019s good. That\u2019s my motto for OST music in-anime. Nothing was really spectacular, but nothing was really noticeable and bad either. There were a few songs that played that were really good, such as the track that played when the cast launched all the bottle rockets and the final ending ost before the credits in episode 13. With this, really no complaints. [10]\\n\\n\r\nMusic Average = I don\u2019t really give 10s for music averages unless there are multiple OPs and EDs and spectacular OST songs and insert songs. I don\u2019t count character songs in this also, so I\u2019ll give it a [9].\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Loved it all the way. The first episode was a bit dull as it was a bit\u2026surprising and not to my tastes, and I ended up temporarily dropping it after the 5th episode because of schedule conflict. When I picked it back up, it got extremely interesting. I ended up loving it. I watched it at a fair pace, finishing the rest of the anime in 2 days. I loved the whole story, and enjoyed all the characters and all the conflicts and resolution. I definitely enjoyed all of Ryuuko\u2019s parts, her energetic personality and her silliness always brings light into the story. I loved the series and enjoyed the ride to the max. Definitely worth a rewatch, if I had the time. Ugh. It just shows to watch it through, you'll definitely enjoy it, especially if your a fan of slice of life. [10]\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: It\u2019s amazingly wonderful. Easily strikes into my top 5% of all anime. The presentation and animation is just wonderful, and the characters are spectacular. I\u2019m hoping for a season 2 because I really enjoyed watching this, even though I did temporarily drop this anime. But it turns out, like Nichijou, animes that I drop for a while and go back on easily become one of my favorites. If you're a fan of slice of life, this is definitely for you. If not, I still recommend that you give this a chance. It is true that the first episode may be weird and turn most people off, but endure it and keep watching, since the first episode gives you the main idea to the brilliant series. So, give it more than just one episode, give it 3, or maybe 4, or 5. Maybe you'll love it like me?\\n\\n\r\nRating:\\n\r\n\u00b7       Presentation = 10.00\\n\r\n\u00b7       Animation = 9.00\\n\r\n\u00b7       Story = 10.00 x2\\n\r\n\u00b7       Characters = 10.00 x2\\n\r\n\u00b7       Mood = 10.00\\n\r\n\u00b7       Music = 9.00\\n\r\n\u00b7       Enjoyment = 10.00 x2\\n\\n\r\nTotal: 9.80; Excellent\\n\r\nOpinionated Total (My biased opinion): 9.80, Excellent\\n\r\nFINAL (Whole number rating): 10/10 [10]",

            "content": "Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko (English: Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl) is an excellent series that can be counted as a unique and hidden gem among more popular titles. The story follows the daily life of high schooler Niwa Makoto who has recently transferred to a new school and a new neighbourhood. Makoto is a fairly normal guy, but the characters that soon surround him are an eccentric bunch to say the least. He quickly finds out he is one of the few people in this new town who does not belive in aliens, is a fan of dressing up as an eggplant (among otherridiculous things) or openly declares themself as an otherwordly being. Its hard not to empathise with Makoto\u2019s confusion, and its an extremely fun ride to watch as he discovers more about his new friends and family. In particular \u2013 the most intriguing cast member has to be his cousin Erio \u2013 a young girl almost as gorgeous as she is mysterious who has a penchant for wrapping herself in a futon and not coming out.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto\u2019s new home belongs to his Aunt (Meme), who lives alone with the enigmatic and bizarre Erio. The dynamic of the 3 works to great success. Meme loves nothing less than to tease Makoto in particularly hilarious, manipulative and inventive ways which makes for a number of great moments. Throw Erio into the mix and the show presents a highly entertaining and unpredictable household as we watch Makoto struggle to live a normal life amidst all the weirdness. We soon discover that Erio has a fascination with aliens and the supernatural \u2013 she\u2019s incredibly shy so it\u2019s very  rewarding to find out more about her personality as the story unfolds. But the strangness does not end at home. At school Makoto befriends the bright and bubbly Ryuuko, along with the very tall, mysterious Maekawa. This pair also have distinctly odd characteristics and stand up as interesting and well fleshed-out characters by the conclusion of the series. To summarize, the underlying plot comes as a secondary device to the character comedy but toward the last few episodes the sci-fi theme kicks in a little more and the many mysteries of the show get a closer look. The balance of narrative and comedy is well paced and works to great effect.\\n\\n\r\nDenpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\u2019s clever writing and character design are matched with equally brilliant visuals and a charming OST. The background tracks are dreamy yet catchy. Both the OP + ED are top quality and the latter comes with some great lyrics in reference to Erio -\u201dI\u2019ll catch a cold, I\u2019ll catch a cold, It\u2019s cold without my futon\u201d. Art and sound combine to make Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko a unique viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nI can guarantee that you will not once get bored watching this show, and that you will miss Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko by the time it wraps up. You will miss the hilarity, the atmosphere, and most of all the bizarre characters that call it\u2019s equally bizarre universe home. Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko is fresh, inventive, smart and often hilarious. I strongly urge you to pick it up and find out for yourself.",

            "content": "A few weeks ago, as I\u2019ve watch the last episode of this anime, I kinda felt a bit disgusted with the genre of this anime, but the weird slice of life and mystery does made up for it, so my rating for this anime are the following:\r\nStory \u2013 good 7.\r\nSo, this anime is not exactly sci-fi even thought there mentioned of extraterrestrial aliens and espers in it, but the story is not focus on Erio, rather it is Makoto who is the story here, co\u2019z every episode is on him and his struggle to cope up within the weird world of the people around him.Also, the very thing make him the story here, is the way he keeps his sanity when everyone else is going cuckoo  by simple have a positive attitude and going with the flow. There isn\u2019t much any comedy here and the sci-fi aren\u2019t that much around it either, in fact those mentioned genres are just tidbits which makes up this anime, you might say the Yashiro is the only esper in here. There is of course the mystery genre like where did Erio went and what has happen to her during her disappearances only to reappear again and walks around with a mattress covering her upper body and why does her mother Meme is not even bothered by it, also why does Maekawa have to wear her mascot outfit even when she\u2019s hardly even near her place of work and does Ryuuko have any idea what she talking about, those are the stuff that makes the mystery genre of this anime more profound than the sci-fi and comedy and what make me give this portion a \u201cGOOD\u201d rating.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t much for me to say about it. But I really like the way Meme the MILF is drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nSame here, except I like the opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I guess even if the muchacho (male lead) is the story of this the anime and everyone else are just additives it still deserves such rating. I don\u2019t have much to say about each character since their roles are pretty simple. In fact their role can be compare to that of other characters from other anime such as Haruri Suzumiya , but with some twist (read between the lines \u201cwith some twist\u201d).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nAs in fair enough to be watch by everyone, even though the skirts that the female characters were wearing are short  no panty shot were seen and it is also fair enough that it can be watched everybody that is if you focus on the muchacho and not on the Chiquita.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nI think that it\u2019s enough that this anime would just remain as a season 1, that is unless some fan service would be included if the author decides to make a season 2. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Denpa Onna is a slow paced, light hearted anime. Quite the contrast from Shaft's Madoka Magica which aired the previous season. The show benefits from strong and likable characters, good art, and a feel good type atmosphere.\r\nThere is less of a plot and more of a tale personal growth and change for each character, especially our protagonists, Niwa and Erio. Not only how they grow, but how their actions, beliefs, and personalities effect those around them.\r\nAs stated above, Denpa does not have a super deep plot, or a really anything out of the ordinary as far as the genre goes, but the charm the showdelivers is stellar. The closest show I can think of with the same charm level is Aria. However, while denpa might not have a complex plot, it does have a small one that connects the characters together.\\n\\n\r\nA person's enjoyment of Denpa Onna will most likely depend on how much they like the characters in the show and their gimmicks. Some have found them annoying, while others have loved them. Each character does have a distinct personality and a unique way to put a smile on your face. \\n\\n\r\nThe show gives you a sort of X Files complex. As in, you really want to believe aliens exist in the show somehow. It does a good job messing with your head making you think one thing, and then all of a sudden you're not sure anymore. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend you check this out. You might struggle a little early on because of the pacing, but once you get to know the characters you'll be a believer. \\n\\n\r\nThe Truth is Out There.",

            "content": "I just had to write a review for this because I really enjoyed this anime.\r\nAnd for a change of pace, I'll break down this review to its components: Story, Art and animation, Sound and Overall enjoyment. (I don't do this normally and wanted to try it out)\r\nStory= 8\r\nDenpa Onna to Seishun Otoko deals on the mysterious and the unexplained. We have Touwa, Erio who has been missing for half a year and claims to have been abducted by aliens. But really, what actually happened while she was missing? What caused her to have amnesia? And then there's Niwa, Makoto, whose line of thinking depends onwhat can be seen and is proven, has to face these events. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this serious-sounding background, this anime is quite far from being serious at all. Dealing with Erio's condition and helping her return to  society as a normal Earthling is what Makoto is aiming for, while having to deal with some other things. I don't really think I've seen any anime with this plot, but I think it's actually pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation= 10\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the art for this anime. Its art is actually quite similar to the more recent Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (Which is another good anime I recommend) It's bright and very well-done. The animation (especially of that on the opening song) flows rather smoothly and deserves a perfect score on my review.\\n\\n\r\nSound= 10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects were unexpectedly good. The opening song didn't quite get to me at first, high and weird squeaky voice and all. But eventually, I came to like it and it's actually pretty catchy. The ending song, however, I didn't like as much. Voice acting is also good. No complaints there. The background music is what I'd like to point out, especially. \\n\\n\r\nThe music  that plays sometimes in the background is outstanding and very well-done. It doesn't distract you from whatever is happening, and actually helps improve the setting of the scenes. Another perfect score there. \\n\\n\r\nOverall= 9\\n\\n\r\nDenpa Onna to Seishun Otoko would've been nice if it had more romance in it. Relationships between cousins are legal in Japan, right? Either way. despite not having an romantic elements in it, it's still a very enjoyable anime and I recommend watching it. No regrets guaranteed.",

            "content": "First, before I jump right into the review of Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, there are some things to be said. Let me level with you for a sec:\r\nCharacters in the anime:\r\nNiwa Makoto: A dumbass going through puberty, but is probably the most normal person around.\r\nTouwa Erio: As intelligent as a puppy.\r\nMifune Ryuuko: As smart as a six year old.\r\nMaekawa: Wear cosplay to work and evening walks.\r\nTouwa Meme: Mentality of a sixth-grader despite being 40 years old.\r\nHoshimiya Yashiro: Dresses up as an astronaut to play baseball.\r\nTamura (the old coot): Pretty senile. Obsessed with cattle mutilation.\r\nAnd they are involved in a comedy.\r\n  Whenyou have loony characters in a comedy, you can expect the intellect of the show to be pretty much in the drains. Despite that, there\u2019s actually morals to be learnt which I will go through later in the review. There\u2019s a lot of similarity between Denpa Onna and Arakawa Under the Bridge (also directed by Shinbou Akiyuki), and I will be constantly mentioning them in the review because it is just ridiculous how much Denpa Onna borrows from Arakawa.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n  The plot is extremely vague. Check out the synopsis. Everything written up there are the original bits of the anime that makes it interesting. So like Arakawa, there is a pretty girl who claims to be an alien. The interesting and most original part is that she wraps herself in a futon mattress as a way to avoid the society. She\u2019s a typical hikikomori(social withdrawal). Then her cousin Makoto moves in and helps her get back into society. This is the proposed plot. Up to this point, there\u2019s nothing wrong with this main plot. However, the plot constantly wavers to the side-lines as Makoto flirts with all the girls. There\u2019s this one episode where he goes out with Ryuuko, and then the next episode, he hangs out with Maekawa. There are only 12 episodes to find out the mystery behind the disappearance of Erio for six months, where Elliot (Erio\u2019s irresponsible dad) is, who Hoshimiya really is and which pipe hole she crawled out of and 2 goddamned episodes are wasted on building up the relationship with the two girls. Not that this is wrong or anything, but there\u2019s just too much unexplained mysteries in Denpa Onna. How the hell can Meme (Makoto\u2019s 40 years old aunt) look 18 years old? \\n\r\n  The worst of all is the way Denpa Onna ended. Okay, here\u2019s how it works: the city is divided up into two, the City and the Shopping District. They have a baseball match involving the main characters and the winning side would have the upcoming festival taken place in their area. This is cool and all. It is a good scenario to allow the characters to interact with each other. But this is the last episode. The LAST goddamned episode! Why the hell are they playing baseball when they should be solving one or all of the above mysteries? Then things took a turn for total shitstorm when they decided to end it off with Makoto talking to some old guy about life lessons rather than using that time to show us footage of the festival. It ended very disappointingly, just like Arakawa did.\\n\\n\r\n  The story isn\u2019t nearly as linear as the plot suggests. An event happens and even though it could have been summed up in a single episode, three episodes were aired instead to show the same event from three different character\u2019s point of view. This is without a doubt, derived from the creative mind of the director. Now let\u2019s talk about the morals that can be taught in Denpa Onna. It teaches the viewers, behind the slap-stick Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei-like humor that if you try your best, you will succeed. Also, there\u2019s the part about finding courage to return back to society, among various other things to be learnt from Denpa Onna. I expect Denpa Onna to come up with a second season to explain everything.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n  The art is really beautiful. It can be compared to Bakemonogatari or 5 centimeters per Second. All the girls are incredibly pretty and well designed. That\u2019s pretty much all to be said. You won\u2019t be disappointed with the art in Denpa Onna. That is a given. The main reason why this anime got a score of 8 from me depends heavily on the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n  I am not a big fan of the opening and ending song. Initially, the opening song sounded like a squeamish toddler singing into my ear, but I have come to liked it because the song suits Denpa Onna very well. The ending song was really emo but I guess it was calming. The background music in Denpa Onna is pretty good. There\u2019s the light piano music when Makoto hangs out with one of the girls, which builds up the mood. There\u2019s good music to be found here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n  Now I\u2019m about to rant about how original/unoriginal some of the characters are, so forgive me if I write out of topic. I can\u2019t help but notice how Makoto is a mirror image of Ryuugamine Mikado in Durarara!! I mean, the hair is just uncanny! I found myself typing Mikado rather than Makoto many times in this review. Ryuuko might as well be the twin sister of Minori Kushieda from Toradora! I mean, aside from the hair color, she\u2019s basically a more childish version of Minori. They have the same \u2018overly-energetic-attitude-that-makes-me-shout-out-everything-in-my mind\u2019 personality. Then, obviously Meme can be found in the thousands of anime which have \u2018Moe\u2019 in it. All this characters kind of make the cast unoriginal, but then, there\u2019s Maekawa. God, she is the best character in Denpa Onna. She likes to cosplay a lot, which isn\u2019t an uncommon anime character trait. But in a certain episode, she dresses up as a Xenomorph from the Aliens series. A freaking Xenomorph from Aliens. I could not even begin to comprehend how awesome that was. I must have replayed that scene more than ten times. The way she nonchalantly walks into the baseball field with that costume. That was pure genius.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n  Well I must admit that I have cracked up a couple of times when Makoto tries to be the straight man against his aunt Meme and fails miserably. So that makes Denpa Onna pretty enjoyable. I don\u2019t particularly hate being drowned in Moe when Erio, Meme or any of the female characters come into the scene either. The weird score board that determines Makoto\u2019s adolescence points is pretty entertaining as well. I was intrigued by the unexplained mysteries but soon gave up on the hope of ever achieving the answers to them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n  Denpa Onna is like the Arakawa it never was\u2014Arakawa with Moe. I guess the director realised that having half the cast being whacked out wierdos wearing freaky masks wasn\u2019t going to win the hearts of the viewers. Denpa Onna is then created to make up for those mistakes, replacing crude old-men\u2019s humor with cute Moe comedy and toning down the level of weirdness of the cast. Still, it is unique in its style and comes about to be a pleasant anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\n  Ps. Oh by the way, it probably wasn\u2019t the best idea to have the hottest character of the anime be a 40 year-old aunt. Seriously, Meme is hotter than her 16 year-old  daughter and the majority of the school girls Makoto ever had the pleasure to meet.\\n",

            "content": "Note: This is one of my works from Sekijitsu\r\nArt\r\nWhat pulled me into this series was the art. There was something about it that appealed to me and I don\u2019t regret being pulled in because Denpa Onna has some great art. Sure Erio might sparkle a bit too often but those sparkles add effect and I really don\u2019t mind it. There were times when Shaft decided to degrade the art during those not-so-special scenes which was fine by me. Although, during a certain episode, the art was so deformed it looked half-assed. Overall Shaft sure does some good close up shots and we\u2019re talking about theguys who did Bakemonogatari here!\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nTalk about the most dreaded OP I\u2019ve EVER heard! Maybe I\u2019m exaggerating a little but I really didn\u2019t like that opening at all. The notes in the singer were going everywhere and being a music student, I couldn\u2019t really take it. I will admit it was catchy but it\u2019s just not my type of music. The ED was nice to listen to, but it doesn\u2019t fall under the \u2018like\u2019 category. This also goes for the BGM in the series which also didn\u2019t fall under the \u2018like\u2019 category. With the use of BGM\u2019s, you want to try and add more emphasis to the certain scene. At times Denpa did execute it well but most of the times it wasn\u2019t anything special.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t think Denpa was originally supposed to have a strong story line to its slice-of-life feeling and because of that I was lead to disappointment. With all the alien references, I had hoped for the series to take a deeper dive into the sci-fi but considering I haven\u2019t seen Arakawa Under the Bridge, I didn\u2019t really know what to expect from Shaft. I still enjoyed the series for what it was.\\n\\n\r\nBouncing off each character and giving each character individual episodes did help in character development but at times it felt as though some characters should of appeared in certain scenes but just didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nThe flow of the series seemed on par with the story. There were plot holes and some characters just disappeared after a nice build-up of events leaving a very blended flow going up and down. There were times I liked some episodes and there were times I didn\u2019t. An example of this was Shaft leaving the proclaimed esper near the end made me wish she was introduced earlier.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example included the cow tag man being spoken of but was left till an episode or two later for him to actually get introduced and Elliot was never heard of after we saw a child version of him. Of course, it\u2019s not all so bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nOther than being filled with heaps of moe moments and maybe some fan-service, it wasn\u2019t as interesting and enjoyable to watch as I thought it would\u2019ve been. Erio deciding to take on star gazing and a part-time job wasn\u2019t what I expected for her social comeback towards society and the other characters had some lack of importance too in certain scenes. As I\u2019ve said, the music wasn\u2019t that great, the art was nice to see but there wasn\u2019t an actual solid story to this series.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it?\\n\\n\r\nYou might be hesitant to watch it after a score of 6 out of 10 but this is to appeal towards a wider audience. If you enjoy moe, sparkles, slice-of-life or nice occasional art then I\u2019d recommend this show to you.",

            "content": "Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko manages to slowly drag you into the story only to give up on you by the end. Providing a constant stream of comedy each episode is enjoyable, but after soaring to great heights the plot falls into a river. No, literally. I never questioned dropping it, but I felt like the focus switched from a comedy of a young girl who thinks she is an alien and the events conspiring around that to a slice of life.\r\nNiwa Makoto, our male lead, moves into his aunt's house who was apparently living alone. To his surprise he finds a girl his agewrapped tight in a futon to be living with her. Thus, his sanity is put to the test as he takes it upon himself to convince Erio she is not an alien but a normal girl. On the side we have the classmates who disapprove of Erio, and warn him to try and stay away from her. \\n\\n\r\nThat encompasses everything that transpires in a nutshell. At first the story is rather captivating and the comedy works well with it. However, after the first arc ends the focus drastically changes. The story switches to a baseball tournament. Wait, I thought this was about adjusting Erio back to a normal person? Now, it is still funny and it is nice to see him interacting with his classmates and neighbors. It just betrays your expectations a little that the story just turned into something average.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Erio there isn't much backstory, but instead the strength of the characters is in their personality. Let us take the aunt Meme for example; she may be 40 but acts like she is a little kid teasing Niwa, and is just awesome fun. We have Ryuushi who is energetic and who makes a very cute couple with Niwa. We also have Maekawa the more collected one in the show who almost subconsciously cosplays everywhere she goes. If we add Erio that makes up the entire cast of the show, including a few supporting characters. It may be that because the cast is so small it is able to make the few characters it has look even better.\\n\\n\r\nDenpa Onna was always fun to watch. After a good introductory story I was very disappointed in how it transpired after that. Yet, as a comedy it never failed to make me laugh once or twice. While ending up a different show than expected I would still recommend it to others.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review and I hope it was helpful. Comments and questions are welcome!",

            "content": "I'll be the first to admit that the only reason I watched this anime is Buriki, the original character designer. Ever since watching Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai and the sequel, I've been a huge fan of his.\r\nDenpa Onna to Seishun Otoko unfortunately has quite a few ingredients that I hate. First, the protagonist is the 'hobby psychologist' type, who thinks his viewpoint on others is absolutely correct, and won't back down from his arrogance unless punted in the head with absolute proof. Granted, we are talking about a girl who thinks she's an alien here, but the whole 'I am going to fix you'mentality of this guy is too cringeworthy to bear. Luckily, he gets past that stage fairly early and the rest of the season can be enjoyed in peace. Additionally, it does tie into the conclusion, so I am forced not to deduct any points for it.\\n\\n\r\nAs much of a fan I am of Buriki's character designs, I think this is his weakest hour. Apart from Erio Touwa herself, he didn't bring a magic touch to much of the rest of the cast, though his style does pop out in every character. I just feel they weren't characterized much, not only in art but also in writing.\\n\\n\r\nAll that aside, the anime does feel like a low budget job. From the opening theme, Erio Touwa's voice acting, to the fast-forwarding of minor events and the decapitated \"adolescence points\" sub-plot/ time-filler that has no relation to the anime at all - there are a lot of incongruities that makes this anime at times look like it was given away as an amateur prize in a chocolate bar; \"create your dream anime storyboard\".\\n\\n\r\nThe season does get a lot better in the final quarter - maybe someone on the staff floor realized that the potential of this anime was greater than the effort they had put in it up to that point. Whatever the reason, it is a bit sad that it got a bit neglected early on, and that it didn't get a second season.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully, Buriki will stay away from SHAFT from now on. His work on Haganai and Nagi no Asukara were way less of a waste of his mountainous talent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSummary of my ratings:\\n\\n\r\nStory : 6\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

Something happened to Erio something so bad she lost half a year of her life and can only find solace in hiding wrapped in a futon. She is shown in flash backs lashing out at herclass mates. Really thinking deep into this it makes you wonder what happened and what if her fathers disappearance is linked? \\n\\n\r\nThe point i think this anime tries to get across using metaphors is that when some one is depressed and hurt that just sitting with them and listening can better than any therapy. the opening song even mentions its lyrics. The people around Erio where so involved in there own issues they immediately vilified Erio, her mother even deciding it was easier to ignore her instead of trying to help. I think in a culture that is being so rocked by suicides there is an important message here. \\n\\n\r\nAll it took was her cousin spending  a small amount of his time and caring to take a girl hiding from the world to getting a job and joining a baseball team.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several other great sub plots about growing up and even in the end the ESPer story i think was more a metaphor for learning to question convention than it really was about a girl from outer space. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all very few animes has left me days later thinking about all the different deeper meanings and hidden ideas. I could be wrong it could just be a cute show with another quiet reserved female lead for the male lead to fawn over but i don't think i am.",

Characters\r\nThere's the eccentric 40 year old mum who is seemingly happy and carefree. In reality though, she has no idea how to approach her daughter who seems to have some loose screws in her head and is unable to tie her shoe or cut a paperstraight. How on earth is this girl so beautiful when even the basics of hygiene are unknown to her?  \\n\r\n In comes the young boy from the title to take care of his eccentric cousin. I don't know if teenage boys would wipe my face from food stains and find it cute but maybe if I wore a see through dress, why the hell not. In any case, transfer student is somewhat of a typical harem protagonist. The story is mostly from his perspective, so somewhere halfway through you'll be thinking \"why doesn't this have a harem tag?\"\\n\\n\r\nDon't let yourself get distracted by sparkling cute girls or nurse cosplay because then the show suddenly switches perspectives. \\n\r\nThere's a little heartwarming, family friendly part. There's the cool, youth-like, DO YOUR BEST!!! part. There's baseball and summer festival and school lunches and cicadas. It becomes less of a harem and more of a feel good slice of life where even the side characters get their time to shine. \\n\\n\r\n2. Story is... where you find it.\\n\r\nIn the second half, a sudden body of water appears and it's up to your interpretation whether you make it the depth of a puddle or the Mariana Trench. \\n\\n\r\n3. Art \\n\r\nWell, it's Shaft. Enjoy sparkling water in a swimming pool, meteor shower, lips, nails, hair and various body curves of 2D babes to your hearts content. \\n\\n\r\n4. Sound\\n\r\nMy guess that the OP is denpa which is a genre of music. It's like pop-rock on drugs. \\n\r\nED is sung by Yakushimaru Etusko and it's a slow, lullaby type of a song that I really liked. \\n\r\nBGM is fitting. Aliens/space play a big role in the series and so whenever we're watching stars there's this soft music in the background that's a little mysterious and nicely completes the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment\\n\r\nEvery Shaft creation is like cake with sweet topping with strawberries and chocolate and cream but because of that I don't know how the pastry actually tasted. Though I know for sure it wasn't bad at all. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR \\n\r\npros: gorgeous art, quirky characters\\n\r\ncons: stuck somewhere between harem and slice of life. nothing much happens. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Some of you, after watching series like Madoka or Bakemonogatari may have wondered what would romance series made by SHAFT be. Well, this is the answer.\r\nAt first, art. SHAFT's trademark, all those unrealistic sceneries and situations that together somehow make sense. I rate the art in this series as outstanding. Just watch one episode and you'll understand.\r\nSecondly, story. This is the only flaw of this series - there was no real plot, basically every episode was a bunch of more or less connected scenes, so we can enjoy the characters.\r\nSince we're at it, characters. Aside from the only significant male character being protagonist himself, thisseries still deserves 10 in this section. I really liked them all, and when it comes to Erio and Ryushi (hehe) the combination of the way they acted and awesome art usually made me just stare at monitor and smile like a retard. They were insanely cute. At the same time cute like a puppy and feminine. Up to now, I never thought it is really possible.\\n\r\nI'm not saying that Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko was the best romance anime. In my opinion it hardly qualifies to 9/10 because of the lack of plot. But I'm not saying it was bad at all! I really enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing is that some of you not used to SHAFT style may not enjoy it. All those unrealistic situations, talks, and just the way everybody acts may spoil the fun for you at first. My tip is, don't fight it, just deal with it that this anime looks like this. Treat it like an ongoing joke, and I promise, you will enjoy the series.\\n\\n\r\nAaaand, that's basically it. I hope I helped you decide to try out this anime, or to look at it a little differently with my kinda messy review. Also, please keep in mind that I'm not native English, and some grammar, vocabular or construction mistakes may occur. If you detect one, write to me, and I'll fix it.",

            "content": "I don\u2019t make it a point to write reviews, but I particularly enjoyed Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, and, upon seeing its subpar ratings, felt somewhat obligated to defend it, so, here goes:\r\nArt:\r\nWonderful, wonderful artwork. I\u2019m a stickler for art, having dropped numerous series simply because I couldn\u2019t stand the way they were drawn, and Denpa Onna definitely wins in this category. Shaft has outdone itself \u2013 colorful, lively scenery, vibrant, multi-toned characters, and, in general, great color schemes, compositions, and dynamism in each frame. It\u2019s not quite 5 cm/s, but I daresay it\u2019s approaching that level.\r\nSoundtrack:\r\nI usually neglect this category, as I find itto be a relatively minor component to my viewing experience. However, Denpa Onna does provide some melancholic piano keys and nice ambience music that complement the pacing well. Can\u2019t say I\u2019m a fan of the OP or ED, but, then again, I was never into the high-pitched squeals that permeate much of anime JPop.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAs many reviewers iterated before me, eccentricities abound in this motley crew of a cast. Honestly, it\u2019s refreshing to see a show invent new personalities instead of rehashing the standard anime prototypes. (I especially enjoyed how Erio Touwa [E.T.] sat in Makoto\u2019s bicycle basket as he pedaled her into the sky). Development is admittedly slow, but it\u2019s definitely there. This is something I feel many reviewers don\u2019t emphasize enough. Denpa Onna is a show about the gentle adolescence of our halcyon days, and, to that end, I think it\u2019s nice that events and developments aren\u2019t explosive or convoluted. The subtleties and gradual changes are meant to mirror the normalcy of our teenage years and, thus, offer a stark but welcome contrast to the eccentric personalities \u2013 that is, while the characters are themselves bizarre, their growth is relatable and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nDenpa Onna opened with an explosive start. Bracketing the rest of the show, I think the first 3 episodes could operate as a short, standalone OVA series. Really, I was hooked after watching a prologue so rife with meaning and mystery. Erio\u2019s personality is fully emphasized here, and here, too, is where the show probes most philosophically at the deeper themes of life. Makoto\u2019s rejection of Erio\u2019s delusions is a deeper rejection of ontological relativism as a legitimate means to happiness \u2013 his actions nuance his convictions well, and we really get a sense of Makoto\u2019s take on what it means to be human. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, I feel many casual viewers gloss over this last point and take Denpa Onna to be yet another mindless harem. Let me emphasize that it is not. Its insight is subtle, but present, and acutely profound.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what about the rest of the show, you ask? Well I can say that the first three episodes are somewhat anomalous when compared to the slow pace and slice-of-life themed events of the last 9 episodes. Critics charge that Denpa Onna lacks plot or hooks to keep viewers interested, and I\u2019m not unsympathetic to this criticism. However, as mentioned above, I think the slow pacing works well with what this show takes itself to be: a chronicle of a boy\u2019s adolescence. I find it far more realistic that schoolgirl crushes don\u2019t blow up into soap operas and baseball games don\u2019t become matters of life and death. Don\u2019t get me wrong; it\u2019s not like the series never scratches below the surface \u2013 it really does, but, often, it does so almost imperceptibly. Take episode 8 (Tsiolkovsky\u2019s Prayer), for example. It centers around Meme\u2019s daily routine over a week, but the conclusion of the episode is nothing short of powerful, poignant, and profound, letting us really glimpse the depth beneath her skin. People are unique, change slowly, and offer interesting and poignant stories.  This, I think Denpa Onna emphasizes very profoundly.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, among these events of every day life are the rare gemstones that move boys closer to manhood, and Denpa Onna doesn\u2019t forget this. Conversations with characters often revolve around mundane occurrences like deep sea fish or basketball games, but are artfully and subtly infused with lessons on the importance of curiosity or the rate of human progress. It\u2019s important, when watching, to pay attention to these moments \u2013 as they offer enlightening insight into the human experience.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what\u2019s the final verdict on Denpa Onna?\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for something explosive, convoluted, and plot-driven, then I advise you to turn away. If, however, you\u2019re looking for something light-hearted yet penetrating, then I urge you to pick this up. By the end of it, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, with its subtle but philosophical messages, really offers you a novel and reflective outlook on that awkward phase between puberty and responsibility. And,  after all, that\u2019s how life is: subtle but profound.\\n",

            "content": "This review exists within the internet, authored by a SHAFT fanboi.\r\nIt functions only as a test ground for me. It is also a spoiler zone in this page.\r\nUnder the current assessment of the series, it is a \"9/10\".\r\nThis was determined by my reaction to audio-visual investigation of the SHAFT seishun anime.\r\nPatience is the closest thing viewers have to salvation.\r\nHowever, accelerated exposure could amplify the viewing experience of a class-2 audience.\r\nA collective of readers that has forgotten it is a collective of voters... That is you.\r\nMembers of the self-unaware, clueless MAL users under aliases are not permitted to vote \"Not Helpful\" on this review.\r\nInjection of correctiveprogram to opinionated haters with inflated pessimism and distaste!\\n\\n\r\nI would write the entire review in Denpanese, but I used up my esper mana for speaking an alien language.\\n\\n\r\nThe word \"denpa\" (lit. \"electromagnetic waves\") is used to refer to people with overly-active imaginations who appear to live in their own world. In other words, delusional psychopaths.\\n\r\nThe word \"seishun\" (lit. \"blue spring\") means \"adolescent\" or \"puberty\". However, the term often implies the joys and challenges of overcoming immaturity, and youthful romance, as per usage in \"seishun points\".\\n\\n\r\n'Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko'(loosely translated to \"Psychopathic Girl and Adolescent Boy\") begins with the the protagonist Niwa Makoto moving into a new city, known as the \"the City Watched Over by Aliens\". He's in his aunt Meme's care, whose daughter Erio is a denpa hikikomori wrapped in futon.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with Makoto getting to know Erio. She's got a serious case of denpa, believing herself to be an alien who came to Earth to investigate the mankind. Being a nice guy that he is, Makoto takes her out to prove she's a human being and can't fly like E.T. After that, the focus is transferred to the remaining cast, Mifune \"Ryuushi-san\" Ryuuko, Maekawa-san, and Hoshimiya Yashiro.\\n\r\nMany viewers must have felt betrayed when Erio turned from a jargon-spitting enigmatic girl in a futon to an ordinary shy girl, but ironically, Makoto and Erio are surrounded by denpa and therefore has plenty of material for comedy and accumulation of Seishun Points.\\n\\n\r\nNiwa Makoto is your average protagonist in a harem setup. He even describes his own situation as a typical protagonist in school drama in the first episode. However, he does have his own unique Seishun Point system to keep track of the quality of his school life, and does actively pursue opportunities to accumulate points. He is one of the more likable protagonist around in that he has a skeptic, realistic personality, but man up when it really counts. He has a pretty good sense of humor, and we as viewers follow his narration as a guide, seeing things through his perspective almost the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nTouwa Erio started out as a hopeless loner whose own mother had given up on her for becoming denpa after a traumatizing event in her childhood. She does eventually get \"fixed\" by Makoto, and makes a slow return into the society. Her character provided early selling point for the series, and we see her gradual change after Makoto showed up. This season ended at volume 3 of the novel series, out of 8 volumes in total. Her change in character was limited to finding a part-time job and participating group events, but there is surely more to come if a sequel is ever made.\\n\\n\r\nTouwa Meme is a 40-year old aunt of Makoto, who acts like a child all the time and sputters nonsense all the time. Her role in this series is mainly MILF moe and acting as a puppet-master who influences the other main characters to get the story going. She's quite mysterious, and it's hard to know what she's thinking, but as audiences, we know she's hiding something about Elliott, who may or may not be an alien.\\n\\n\r\nRyuushi-san is probably the most interesting character in this series. She is a moeblob, but has an unique and consistent quirkiness that worked really well with Makoto. Their chemistry is excellent, and she's just one of those adorably cute hard working character that you can't help but cheer for. She is the de facto Heroine in this season, spending most time with Makoto and the only one to actively try to win him over like a character in a true seishun series. Yashiro's line in ep11 makes me wonder if they would eventually become an item. The way she blushes around Makoto was really cute, and I'll certainly be cheering for her.\\n\\n\r\nMaekawa-san's personality is almost the opposite of Ryuushi-san. She's always composed and has a dark sense of humor, also seems to have analyzed every situtation and knows what's going on. However, she also seems to have a screw loose on her head, with all the strange cosplays shown in every episode. Her role in the show is mainly to tease Makoto and Ryuushi-san, but getting them together conflicts with her apparent feelings for Makoto. There could be some major character development for her if the sequel is ever made. And of course, her costumes are also there for moe to niche viewers.\\n\\n\r\nHoshimiya Yashiro made a very late appearance this season, but left a huge impact into the story. She claims to be an alien esper, which no one believes, but she has shown evidence of her super powers throughout the final few episodes. Interestingly, she says Makoto and Ryuushi both have \"the potential\", which was precisely what Erio said to Makoto early in the show when she was still a major denpa. Yashiro also brings a new theme to the show, that one should not limit their potential, and develop the strength to believe. This message is extremely similar to 'Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin', but it is executed far better here, with many great inspirational scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEvery major characters have their roles in the show, and the character headcount is very low to ensure every character gets their own spotlight. There were some pacing problems in the middle as one non-linear episode mixed in and extremely slow story development, but there are incredibly inspiring and touching moments of youth in every episode as a treat. There are also plenty of references to other manga and anime, sometimes even real life events to keep us entertained.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation is this series is generally very good. The character designs are attractive, with great cuts and camera angles (although it's almost completely devoid of the signature SHAFT animation style). There are few scenes where characters seemed deformed for budget saving purposes, possibly using Korean animators, but every single inspiring scene (and fan service scene) that actually matters is drawn to perfection. SHAFT knows how to inspire and how to best use visual support to tell a story, and it shows once again in this series.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, with exception of Erio, is spectacular. Ryuushi-san's voice acting is what I would call \u300c\u30cf\u30de\u30ea\u5f79\u300d, epic casting. Her voice is so unique, yet fits the character perfectly. All the seiyuu staff in this series are extremely motivated, and their lines are filled with emotion, especially in the most critical lines.\\n\r\nBGM is also incredibly touching and flows extremely well. It kind of just plays in the background, but becomes really noticeable in critical scenes to improve the viewing experience... it's in total harmony with the story.\\n\r\nOP is a \"denpa song\" in a whole different way. The term is usually used to describe songs with incomprehensible lyrics. In this case, the lyrics do make sense, but BGM composition and the vocal sound absolutely retarded. This works extremely well for a series about denpa, and it's somehow addicting. Absolutely brilliant.\\n\r\nED is rather dull, but cute song with fun lyrics and unique whisper vocals.\\n\\n\\n\r\n'Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko' has many classic, almost clich\u00e9 seishun elements, such as screaming out corny lines in public, running towards the sun (its variation biking towards the moon was used), awkward silences between the opposite sex, working hard on sports... However, it's the execution that makes all the difference, and it really shows in this series. The main message of keeping our minds open and appreciate every moment of our lives, it really reached my heart.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has also given me a new level of appreciation for NisiOisiN's works. Although the series does attempt to use witty dialogs to advance the story and succeeded to some degree, it lacks the pacing and sophistication seen in similar NisiOisiN adaptations by SHAFT, 'Bakemonogatari' and 'Katanagatari'. If I had to pick, this is closest to 'Soredemo Machi wa Mawatte Iru' for being a rare authentic 'slice-of-life' anime, and also the extreme quirkiness that's hit-or-miss for its viewers. It was a definite hit for me, and I'll definitely look forward to the sequel.\\n\\n\r\n'Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko' is a story full of dreams and depicts an ordinary guy in a crazy city, trying living his life to the fullest. It's brilliant, and exactly what a true seishun series is all about. If you disagree, I guess I'll just say it out loud in a clear and concise phrase... \\n\\n\r\n\"If you say so.\"",

Instead of admitting that you have a problem, you blame your drinking because your wife nags at you, or because the devil told you to do it, or some other excuse I could not think of because I do not have drinking problem. (No, I'm not in denial here, I seriously don't have a drinking problem)\r\nReality distortion\r\nDenpa Onna to Seishun Otoko deals with characters who distorts reality to their own convenience to escape facing the inconceivable truth. As normal human beings, we usually believe our perception of the worlds within and around us is \"true.\"\r\nThe story revolves aroundNiwa Makoto (who is playing as the youthful man) and his cousin, Touwa Erio (who is playing as the electromagnetic wave woman) living with his aunt  Touwa Meme (horny old woman with a 20 year old body. Yes in Japan it is possible without cosmetic surgery) in a small city famous for alien encounters.\\n\r\nNow if you all know me (which I doubt you do) you probably think I picked up this title because it has youthful scent all over it which means a harem is soon to follow. \\n\\n\r\nYES. I wont deny that. Other reasons would be due to Erio hot legs. (No I do not have a leg fetish)\\n\\n\r\nSo we follow the journey of Makoto collecting youthful points for god knows what reason (as if you can measure youth) and along the way he meets (as expected) more girls to add to his circle of harem... I mean circle of friends.\\n\\n\r\nArt wise, it's very obvious that you can tell that this is one of SHAFT's handiwork. The dramatic zoom into background objects, character faces, (especially the eyes) I've read a couple of chapters from the light novel and it is clear that the portrayal of the story using the artwork is nicely executed.\\n\r\nThe voice cast chosen are befitting for their characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow I can't go into detail about all the characters as I want to avoid spoilers as much as possible. But I would like to stress something on Niwa Makoto.\\n\r\n[REASONS WHY MAKOTO SHOULD HAVE A HAREM]\\n\r\n1) He is a nice guy (Main characteristic a harem male lead)\\n\r\n2) He is a transfer student (Research shows that 4/5 of anime transfer students gets a harem)\\n\r\n3) He doesn't live with his parents (He is independent which means less cockblock)\\n\r\n4) He is not ugly (Have you ever seen an Ugly harem male lead?)\\n\r\n5 His name is Makoto (Reference To the Makoto from SchoolDays. I just hope his balls is still intact when everything is over)\\n\\n\r\nBasically, Makoto here is a personification of everything that is adolescent in anime terms.\\n\\n\r\nHis cousin on the other hand (Touwa Erio) plays the fumbling yet lovable character (well I find her lovable because I love girls with blue hair. No I do not have a blue hair fetish) She plays the electromagnetic wave woman in this series (electromagnetic wave woman here means weird, crazy or someone who has an obsessive behavior on an perception) She provides the story for the first arc in the series, Makoto helping her cope from her transition from an 'extraterrestrial being' back to a 'normal' human being. \\n\r\nShe is also the main example of a person who is clearly distorting her own reality. \\n\r\nBut she may not be in denial? Perhaps it was misinformation?\\n\r\nFor example have you ever experience sleep paralysis? People who don't know the term sleep paralysis may think that when this occurred to them, aliens are actually probing them. This is just the way it is when you do not have information on your current circumstance.\\n\\n\r\nDo I find this amusing in any way? \\n\r\n- I find adolescence amusing\\n\r\n-I find eccentric characters amusing\\n\r\n-I find futon wrapped Erio amusing\\n\r\n-I find getting a million youth points for seeing a girl naked wrapped with a bath towel amusing\\n\\n\r\nWhat I do not find amusing?\\n\r\n- I find incest not amusing\\n\r\n-I find cradle robbers not amusing\\n\r\n-I find cattle mutilation not amusing\\n\r\n-I find no harem in a supposedly capable harem producing anime not amusing\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you're a fan of SHAFT like works (and no I'm not referring to Madoka, damn Madoka fanboys...) then I see no reason why you should not watch this.\\n\r\nI have learn from this anime that sometimes blaming aliens is all what it takes to escape reality. (For those of you who had sleep paralysis, blaming alien is very common)\\n\r\nExamples:\\n\r\n\"The crime rate had risen over the past few years\"\\n\r\n-I blame Aliens\\n\r\n\"Baby dumping has increased from a decade ago\"\\n\r\n-I blame Aliens\\n\r\n\"Our job opportunity has been falling recently\"\\n\r\n-I blame Aliens\\n\r\nCase in point.\\n\\n\r\nOh by the way, \"Aliens\" here DO NOT mean Mexicans.

            "content": "A really casual one, it was a totally random choice, but I don't regret it though. So what's it about? It may not have an incredible climax and everything... Instead, this anime focuses more upon reflection. It's simple:  just take a teenager who wants to enjoy his high school years to the max and add an odd girl to whom he begins devoting his time, in order to get her back to real life.\r\nMakoto's first time in a big city made him create big expectations about how his life would be from now on. He wanted to meet girls, spend time with them andeven maybe fall in love, afterall, that's what being an young boy is all about. Meeting Erio was the first step from this new journey. Having met his \"energetic\" aunt, Meme, and after her, Maekawa and Ryuko, most episodes are dedicated into showing his relationship growing with all of them.\\n\\n\r\nStill, that's not all... Believing he would be able to change Erio's attitude and put an end to her self-isolation from society, Makoto becomes her only true friend... Making her forget all this \"alien stuff\" and the past she couldn't remember, trying to get her to be more sociable and stop hiding from everyone... This also affects Makoto, as he gets more self-confident.\\n\\n\r\nArt impressed me... Glowing style, slow-mo scenes and fluid animation, despite not having much action, overally amazing! I think OP theme could've been better and the ED song is so sweet and calm... Characters have nothing really special in particular. Most of them are ordinary people with different personalities. Both Ryuko's and Erio's shyness attracted me... Besides that, they're so cute and lovely! Also, voices chosen for both of them match perfectly!\\n\\n\r\nNever give up and believing in yourself, just two of the many lessons we can learn from this anime... Nobody comes to this world for no reason and, since we don't understand the real purpose of life, all we can do is live, make it worthy... Taking the best we can from our youth years and making every moment count, Denpa Onna was really made to change the way some people think about their own lives, to encourage those on enjoying it the best they can... That's so deep...",

            "content": "A problem that a show with interesting premise or quirks can run into is getting far too wrapped up in itself. A show can become contrived, focusing on playing around with its quirkiness; forgetting that there is a story to be told. Such is the case with Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, a charmingly eccentric show that ultimately gets deflated by the eccentricities that made it appealing to begin with.\r\nDenpa Onna is a bizarre show, to say the very least. It centers around Makoto Niwa, a somewhat sarcastic young man who goes to live with his aunt Meme; having certain expectations of his new life.Expectations that are shattered after meeting his impishly flirtatious aunt and beyond bizarre cousin Erio,who claims to be an alien and wraps herself in a futon. He later meets a cheerful and clumsy girl named Ryuko (or better known as Ryushi, to her irritation), and the resident cosplay character, Maekawa. While this sounds like your standard cast for a slice-of-life anime, rest assured, the cast is eccentric enough to stand out from the crowd. Every character has their weird quirks and talk in a way no normal person would. Erio in particular is a winsome odd-ball, a hikikomori who uses the guise of being an alien as a shield from her insecurities; and Maekawa existence seems to be poking fun at use of pun humor in anime. The off-beat way these characters behave and interact with one another is what gives the show its unique flavor.\\n\\n\r\nThe show puts its eccentric characters and rambling dialogue to good use. Pretty much every conversation between characters has an entirely different meaning than its face value. A conversation about aliens can actually be an exchange of worldviews; one about ESP can actually be about peoples' hidden potential. This makes the exceedingly strange exchanges between characters meaningful, rather than just nonsensical ramblings. Just as interesting is seeing our dysfunctional recluse of a female lead, Erio, slowly warm up to her cousin. We see her change from being insanely introverted to a slightly more stable, though still fairly unsociable, weirdo. She even has a part-time job and joins an amateur baseball team by the shows finale, all the while retaining the charming weirdness that grabbed our attention in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nSo why does this show fall short, well... it doesn't really go anywhere. Sure, Erio progressively becomes more active in the world around her, but as for everyone else progress is near non-existent. Even as Makoto gets to know Maekawa and his aunt Meme better, their relationships remain static through the entire series.This is even true for Ryuko, who has a big crush on Makoto. You think with all the talking in the show these relationships would develop nicely, but instead the characters spend most of the time talking around each other and dodging pressing matters. When they aren't in convoluted conversation or monologue, the characters are usually engaged with some trivial activity that is entertaining enough to watch but pointless in the grand scheme of things. Not to say these aspects of the show are not enjoyable, but they do get tedious to watch as the show continues on its merry way to nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's visuals are pretty solid, though nothing to write home about, really. The scenery is pretty much what you would expect from a slice-of-life, nothing breathtaking, but it gets the job done. As for the character designs, most attention goes to the female cast (of course), which is the visual highlight of the show. Erio is gorgeous, likely the best looking leading lady of 2011, and mother Meme; rival for Makoto's attention, Ryuko; cosplaying Maekawa; and late arrival Yashiro are just as pretty. The rest of the cast is more average looking, but pleasant on the eyes nonetheless.  The music is also pretty typical of slice-of-life (except for the bizarre opening and oddly cute ending themes). It pleasantly floats around supporting the shows atmosphere, though can also build up excitement when called to do so, like in the \"I can't fly\" scene, which is the the shows most striking moment.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko is a generally pleasant experience. Its strange, off-kilter tone and characters definitely sets it apart from regular slice-of-life anime. Plus, Erio is the cutest basket-case you are likely to find. It is a shame the story doesn't really progress, getting caught up in a web of convoluted dialogue and all too quaint events. This is actually not a bad show, just a disappointing one.",

            "content": "I hate Shaft, I really hate this studio. For every good show they make, there must be some 5 mediocre ones in between. However, I still love their artsy touch and the way they handle most dialogues that is much present in Denpa Onna. Yet, there\u2019s something lacking in Denpa Onna to make it good and that is a focus. It\u2019s a shame really, because this anime had such a great start. I find it sad that they had to ruin it in the second half.\r\nBased on a light novel, the story shares some similiraties with the Haruhi Suzumiya. Most notably, the two main characters,which both have the same personality, are emerged in a world of bizarre situations. The difference is that Denpa Onna is completely voided of any supernatural element, even though it brings aliens and espers in the foreplay. Though the story could be considered as some sort of coming of age, it is never clear what it is really about. The big problem with Denpa Onna is how well it handles the many elements that it is given, for I must say, not well at all. While it does begin as a simple story of \u201csaving the broken girl\u201d, it doesn\u2019t take time before the series loses its initial charm. For the second half, the anime turns around in a midst of pointless moments that can range from enjoyable to plain boring. Though, these pointless moments, are for the best, emotional. The results here shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Denpa Onna concludes in a unsatisfying and completely out of place way that leaves you a bitter taste in the end. In other word, what it needs is a satisfying sequel with a much, much better direction.\\n\\n\r\nKnowing Shaft, it is not surprising that Denpa Onna shares a good amount of mentally ill characters. For new comers, this might be a refreshing outcome since they act mostly in an extravagant way. For the Shaft followers or other anime connoisseurs, it is nothing that you haven\u2019t seen before and might even annoy you. Though, while the characters\u2019 traits aren\u2019t problematic, there is a big lack of character development that would have helped this anime greatly. If Denpa Onna would truly have been a coming of age, some actual development for the characters would have been great. However, everything stays static in this series. There is also an issue of not enough screen time for the female characters in this series. The series is mostly in the point of view Makoto and we mostly see him jump from a girl to another many times in the anime and this only ends up in some sort of unassuming harem between two friends and his cousin.\\n\\n\r\nShaft, as always, delivers in the production value. Erio might have been an uninteresting character after all, but her character design is probably the most interesting of the season. Sadly, the same could not be said about the other characters. For the visual, Denpa Onna has its fair share of eye candies and sparkles moments that will please any fans of the sort. I have to admit that some of these scenes were actually beautiful. Shaft is also more lay back in this one, and Denpa Onna doesn\u2019t have too much quick and weird angle shots. The music is also top notch in Denpa Onna. The anime opens with a tad annoying, but very catchy song. The score in the actual series doesn\u2019t have anything impressive, but it does the job well done. As for the voice actors, well they were great, no doubt about that.\\n\\n\r\nTo kill the mockingbird, Denpa Onna is actually a very forgettable show. The anime did have an interesting and original premise, but it soon falls into something that has been done million times before. Still, if someone is looking for moe characters, this anime is definitely for them. There are some rumours about a possible second season. If this happens, let\u2019s just hope Shaft does it right this time.\\n",

            "content": "The central problem with 'Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko' is the way it treats the supernatural. It attributes normal, everyday occurrences to aliens, espers, clairvoyance etc. Had a bad day at school? Must be god's fault. Achieved something you've never even dreamed of achieving? Must be your esp abilities. Amnesia? Aliens. Cute girl smiles at you? Fate.\r\nYou can pretty much see that this kind of storytelling is going to get ridiculous after a few episodes and sure enough that's exactly what happens in this anime. Despite the \"Sci-fi\" tag, there's no attempt at any scientific explanation either. Things that have no basis in reality andhaven't been proven scientifically are depicted in here as if they were the bread and butter of the natural world. And despite the main protagonists doubts as to such supernatural events, the anime pretty much ends on the same note - \"Yeah, it's real. Deal with it.\" \\n\\n\r\nNow on to the individual components :\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this is the weakest point of this anime. Guy comes to the city (Niwa Makoto), meets his horny aunt (Meme), his mentally unstable cousin suffering from amnesia (Erio), goes to school and assembles a generic, albeit miniature harem. Obligatory introductions over, 'Denpa' shifts focus to supernatural events. Some of the most common occurrences in every day life will be passed here as being caused by some kind of supreme power that lives within all of us. Yeah sure, that's about as Sci-fi or slice-of-life as Norse mythology. I would have been glad to at least see some sort of an attempt at science here but no such luck. \\n\\n\r\nIn between bouts of acts of god the story also tries its hand at drama and fails because most of said drama is either caused or attributed to... you guessed it - more paranormal acts. 6 episodes in and I already had to force myself to keep watching this anime because I knew that nothing intriguing would come from it. Moreover after the first 3 episodes, the story just starts repeating its own premise with minimal plot and character progression. Why did Erio lose her memory? Aliens. Episode 6 - Why did Erio lose her memory? Aliens. Episode 9 - Why did Erio lose her memory? Aliens. Episode 12 - Why did Er... Hey we don't know but here, chew on more alien and esper theory.\\n\\n\r\nI think what this anime relies on is the fact that you can't disprove the supernatural. You may not believe it but you can't steadily disprove it. At the same time this anime offers no insight or explanation of the supernatural. Most sci-fi works rely on some mixture of quantum physics, time traveling, parallel universes etc to explain their seemingly ESP-esque characters. 'Denpa' is more of a case of \"believe it or don't\". Unfortunately that also means that most watchers will either love it or hate it, depending on their beliefs. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters in this show possess a decent degree of originality, as I haven't noticed any known popular arc-types in this anime, they also receive very little development throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nA prime example of that would be Erio. Initially a social recluse, she opens up a little after her cousin's arrival and... stays that way throughout the whole show. She engages in very little dialogue and even though the name of the show and the synopsis would imply that the story will heavily revolve around her - that's not actually true. I was disappointed to see that she is pushed away and focus shifts primarily towards the protagonist and his micro-harem. \\n\\n\r\nThe male lead himself seems to be among the only three rational and realistic characters in this show, refusing to believe in the supernatural without proper evidence. The other two would be Makoto's classmates Maekawa and Ryuuko who seem to provide even more realism to the series. Again, the problem with this section is that there is practically no character development present. The relationships between Makoto and his classmates go nowhere, the show doesn't expand upon their personalities from what we originally see and from the beginning to the end the show maintains a near-perfect status quo. \\n\\n\r\nMakoto's aunt, Meme, serves no real purpose apart from comic relief, with her over the top perverted antics. While initially being quite surprising and slightly amusing it quickly gets old, luckily the show reduces her role in comic relief just before it starts to get annoying. \\n\\n\r\nYashiro's late introduction to the series made little sense and I think that it would be fair to hail her as the most underdeveloped character in this series. Personality-wise, she's an annoying shallow tsun character who runs around screaming about esper supremacy. Everyone else that I haven't mentioned is so far down on the totem pole that they are plot insignificant and only there to serve as background characters.\\n\\n\r\nART (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is the strong point of 'Denpa' as the art here is flawless. The characters are certainly appealing and attention has been paid to every single little detail. Static background is crisp and well drawn. I haven't noticed any mistakes in the coloring, the art is consistent all throughout and true to its style and as such this section deserves a full mark of 10 points. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND ( 7/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhile the opening is rather irritating with that high-pitched squealing for 2 minutes straight, not to mention that the rhythm just completely doesn't fit to the drum solo in the background - watchers will find respite in this anime's OST. It does contain some decent pieces, especially the ones that play during the more dramatic sequences of 'Denpa'. The ending song, while a little bit bland, at least wasn't annoying. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting itself was authentic and matched the characters quite well. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I didn't enjoy this series. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. Something to watch if you're really bored or you're really into the whole ESP stuff but a casual anime watcher will be confused, bored and then agitated while watching this - in that order. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned in the story section you will either love or hate this anime. Holding a middle ground here is extremely difficult because this anime does not attempt to reference its content in any way. If anything, watch it for Meme's wackiness, or watch it for the lighthearted high school dramedy. Either way, not taking this anime seriously is paramount if any enjoyment is to be had.\\n\\n\r\n5 points out of 10.",

            "content": "In one of the opening scenes of this anime, a certain character welcomes the main character (along with the viewers) by saying \"Welcome to the city watched over by aliens.\" After watching this I have come to realize one thing: how horribly distasteful these aliens are.\r\nSeasoned anime fans will take notice of the fact that this show is directed by Shinbou Akiyuki. You might recognize him for directing great shows such as Bakemonomgatari, Arakawa Under the Bridge, and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, which all have a similar formula going on: a male character surrounded by a harem of weird quirky females. Considering how much of thistype of show he has done, and the valuable attribute of the human mind to gain experience, one might expect him to have garnered enough knowledge to create enjoyable shows with absolutely no effort at all. Well, apparently, no. Either his brain has become too dense with all the success and praise from his previous works, or he just suffered a nervous breakdown to which he responded by making the most incoherent, dumb, and most boring anime he could possibly conjure. And that is Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko (Electromagnetic Wave Woman and Adolescent Man).\\n\\n\r\nThe story is the same old \"Guy moves into a city\" \"New home has cute girls in it\" \"New school has cute girls in it\" and so on. Oh, and the girls garner an inexplicable affection towards the main character. In the case of Denpa, a regular country bumpkin Niwa Makoto moves into the city to live at his aunt's house. Upon entering the house he notices a girl wrapped in a mattress lying near the doorway. This is how we are introduced to the show's main attraction, Touwa Erio, an amnesiac girl who believes she is an alien put on earth for observational purposes. The story then resolves around Makoto as he tries to help Erio overcome the barrier she has put up between herself and society. Of course, this is not a story-driven anime. You get the vibe that the makers didn't have any idea what they were doing and the story goes down the drain pretty quickly, as this is apparent half way into the show when all the characters are just loitering around trying awkwardly hard to get a giggle out of you. I'd gladly pay you if you find anything groundbreaking about this anime's plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this show really throws everything at you, which at the base level boils down to a 'hit or miss' game where the chance of a hit is that of winning in a million dollar lottery. The so-called witty conversations between characters that SHAFT does so well literally falls apart here. There are tons of dialogue but they just go into one ear and come out of the other, rarely triggering anything along the way. How could anyone rely on a cast of such uninteresting characters to deliver good jokes is beyond me.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is generally quite colorful and neat, but there's just something about the character designs that make them look overly childish, to the point that it's hard to call them \"high schoolers\". From an objective point, it felt to me like most of the work done in this department went into Erio's appearance and elaborate schemes to make her more cute, as she glaringly stands out among all the other bland characters that occupy this show. One of the few redeeming features of Denpa Onna is it's OP and ED. The OP sung by Erio's voice actor in an epic karaoke voice is quite fun and almost makes the rest of the show worthwhile. Maybe the unimpressive dialogue mentioned earlier might have been the cause of poor chemistry among voice actors because the voice acting here is decent at best. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have to say that Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko fails in soaring through the sky, not to mention space. The first few episodes might keep you occupied with a false sense of more to come but what's to come is mind-numbing stupidity and a whole load of wasted of time.",

            "content": "An anime with a normal, ordinary boy couldn\u2019t be anything but an ordinary slice-of-life comedy right? Well, hate to break it to you, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s much more complex, intricate, and amazing than a run-of-the-mill standard anime. Even though the plot may seem a bit bewildering at first, the series proves itself worthy of an amazingly high score.\r\nThe basics? A high school boy named Niws Makoto recently moves to his Aunt\u2019s house and becomes a Transfer Student. There he meets his mysterious cousin, Touwa Erio. She walks around every day wrapped around a futon and believes that there are aliens and tries to stop\u201calien invasions.\u201d Touwa Erio lost her memories one day after being missing for half a year and then being found floating out in the sea. Makoto thinks her idea and beliefs are absurd and believes that she is using aliens as a cover up for her missing memories. Touwa Erio then dropped out of school and everyone thinks of her with harsh memories and treats her as \u201cextremely weird.\u201d At school, Makoto makes good friends with two girls, Mifune Ryuuko (or Ryuushi, which is kind of a teasing nickname for her) and Maekawa, a tall girl who gets dizzy easily and works at a lot of different part-time jobs. Makoto is into \u201cadolescence points\u201d which are points that he gains when something good and memorable happens, like when a girl is invited to his house.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's get scoring!\\n\\n\r\nPRESENTATION: Beautiful from the first episode. The animation and art were both wonderful, and so were the background designs. Not really any complaints, as this is for first impressions. [10]\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Done well, for the most part. Most people are all shown to be moving, the sky to be animated, and the beautiful colors of the scenery and the characters themselves. I loved the whole art aspect, I could daresay it\u2019s approaching the level of art of 5cm/s. Though, some parts are lacking, as they fail to animate most people during the summer festival, and some explosions as well. Overall, the main portions (characters, setting) are all animated and drawn beautifully. [9]\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: As you can see from the basics, it\u2019s a great sci-fi story. The first three episodes are Erio\u2019s main story, but after that, critics state that Denpa Onna lacks interest to continue hooking the viewer. I believe in the opposite. Each of the episodes after reveal much more insight to the characters, as one episode revealed Meme\u2019s true feelings towards things than just what she acts like on the outside, and adds in character personality for Ryuuko and Maekawa as well. This is certainly not a harem (even though it could be considered one) nor a normal slice-of-life.  I guess it\u2019s to say that there are an infinite number of mysteries out there, and no one theory of belief relating to a mystery is false. It takes belief and consideration and respect, not ignorance. That\u2019s almost like my moral in life, which is one of the reasons I ended up loving this series. Of course, I wish the ending was still more resolving, but what can I say. The way it doesn\u2019t resolve everything but manages to leave us in awe and in mystery is good enough to net it a [10].\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Obviously the strong point of this anime. With a happy, energetic, and flustered fruitist Ryuuko to a tall dizzy Maekawa and an ignorant but considerate Makoto and a childish but caring Meme and a serious but silly Yoshira really brings the story to light. Of course, don\u2019t forget Erio. She used to be without personality, almost unhuman, but now she\u2019s become a shy, reserved girl. With these characters and episode insight, we can see deeply into their character and feelings even. Great development, and great characters. [10]\\n\\n\r\nMOOD: What can I say for mood? Generally, if it doesn\u2019t play a big role in any anime I end up scoring it with a 10 unless major faults were here. I can\u2019t really think of any. There were a few stand-out exciting mood areas, especially where he biked off a cliff (when he was planning not to but his brakes failed) and when he made that long speech cheering Ryuuko on, and that final meteor hit. It strays a bit far away from slice-of-life, but after all, this is sci-fi, is it not? [10]\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\n              (OP) The OP isn\u2019t exactly to my tastes. In my opinion, it\u2019s sung a bit off-key and a bit too screamy and high-pitched. That was my first impression, but now, I like the OP. It takes a while to get used to it, like Hana no Iro (which has now become one of my favorites as it has become the first full song I can play on my guitar), but once you get used to it, I like it. Still, I wish it wasn\u2019t as\u2026screamy\u2026but still, a lot of jRock is like this. So, what can I say? High pitched voices isn\u2019t really my concern, and the song\u2019s melody is really something that is kinda memorable. Also, this song doesn\u2019t seem to fit with the overall story of Denpa Onna, being fairly relaxed with a few jolts and anxiety mood changes, but this song is pretty drastic and surprising and emotional and\u2026loud. The only place where it could describe could be that meteor hit\u2026[9]\\n\r\n              (ED) The ED was a song I love. It began a bit too slowly, which almost turned me off, but then it suddenly becomes much more upbeat in the middle. It\u2019s cheery and all-around happy, which kind of fits Erio\u2019s new personality. The OP was a bit\u2026too drastic to really represent anything in the anime except for the meteor hit. It\u2019s quite memorable, and I have no complaints. [10]\\n\r\n              (InAnime) If it\u2019s not noticeable, it\u2019s good. That\u2019s my motto for OST music in-anime. Nothing was really spectacular, but nothing was really noticeable and bad either. There were a few songs that played that were really good, such as the track that played when the cast launched all the bottle rockets and the final ending ost before the credits in episode 13. With this, really no complaints. [10]\\n\\n\r\nMusic Average = I don\u2019t really give 10s for music averages unless there are multiple OPs and EDs and spectacular OST songs and insert songs. I don\u2019t count character songs in this also, so I\u2019ll give it a [9].\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Loved it all the way. The first episode was a bit dull as it was a bit\u2026surprising and not to my tastes, and I ended up temporarily dropping it after the 5th episode because of schedule conflict. When I picked it back up, it got extremely interesting. I ended up loving it. I watched it at a fair pace, finishing the rest of the anime in 2 days. I loved the whole story, and enjoyed all the characters and all the conflicts and resolution. I definitely enjoyed all of Ryuuko\u2019s parts, her energetic personality and her silliness always brings light into the story. I loved the series and enjoyed the ride to the max. Definitely worth a rewatch, if I had the time. Ugh. It just shows to watch it through, you'll definitely enjoy it, especially if your a fan of slice of life. [10]\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: It\u2019s amazingly wonderful. Easily strikes into my top 5% of all anime. The presentation and animation is just wonderful, and the characters are spectacular. I\u2019m hoping for a season 2 because I really enjoyed watching this, even though I did temporarily drop this anime. But it turns out, like Nichijou, animes that I drop for a while and go back on easily become one of my favorites. If you're a fan of slice of life, this is definitely for you. If not, I still recommend that you give this a chance. It is true that the first episode may be weird and turn most people off, but endure it and keep watching, since the first episode gives you the main idea to the brilliant series. So, give it more than just one episode, give it 3, or maybe 4, or 5. Maybe you'll love it like me?\\n\\n\r\nRating:\\n\r\n\u00b7       Presentation = 10.00\\n\r\n\u00b7       Animation = 9.00\\n\r\n\u00b7       Story = 10.00 x2\\n\r\n\u00b7       Characters = 10.00 x2\\n\r\n\u00b7       Mood = 10.00\\n\r\n\u00b7       Music = 9.00\\n\r\n\u00b7       Enjoyment = 10.00 x2\\n\\n\r\nTotal: 9.80; Excellent\\n\r\nOpinionated Total (My biased opinion): 9.80, Excellent\\n\r\nFINAL (Whole number rating): 10/10 [10]",

            "content": "Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko (English: Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl) is an excellent series that can be counted as a unique and hidden gem among more popular titles. The story follows the daily life of high schooler Niwa Makoto who has recently transferred to a new school and a new neighbourhood. Makoto is a fairly normal guy, but the characters that soon surround him are an eccentric bunch to say the least. He quickly finds out he is one of the few people in this new town who does not belive in aliens, is a fan of dressing up as an eggplant (among otherridiculous things) or openly declares themself as an otherwordly being. Its hard not to empathise with Makoto\u2019s confusion, and its an extremely fun ride to watch as he discovers more about his new friends and family. In particular \u2013 the most intriguing cast member has to be his cousin Erio \u2013 a young girl almost as gorgeous as she is mysterious who has a penchant for wrapping herself in a futon and not coming out.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto\u2019s new home belongs to his Aunt (Meme), who lives alone with the enigmatic and bizarre Erio. The dynamic of the 3 works to great success. Meme loves nothing less than to tease Makoto in particularly hilarious, manipulative and inventive ways which makes for a number of great moments. Throw Erio into the mix and the show presents a highly entertaining and unpredictable household as we watch Makoto struggle to live a normal life amidst all the weirdness. We soon discover that Erio has a fascination with aliens and the supernatural \u2013 she\u2019s incredibly shy so it\u2019s very  rewarding to find out more about her personality as the story unfolds. But the strangness does not end at home. At school Makoto befriends the bright and bubbly Ryuuko, along with the very tall, mysterious Maekawa. This pair also have distinctly odd characteristics and stand up as interesting and well fleshed-out characters by the conclusion of the series. To summarize, the underlying plot comes as a secondary device to the character comedy but toward the last few episodes the sci-fi theme kicks in a little more and the many mysteries of the show get a closer look. The balance of narrative and comedy is well paced and works to great effect.\\n\\n\r\nDenpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\u2019s clever writing and character design are matched with equally brilliant visuals and a charming OST. The background tracks are dreamy yet catchy. Both the OP + ED are top quality and the latter comes with some great lyrics in reference to Erio -\u201dI\u2019ll catch a cold, I\u2019ll catch a cold, It\u2019s cold without my futon\u201d. Art and sound combine to make Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko a unique viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nI can guarantee that you will not once get bored watching this show, and that you will miss Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko by the time it wraps up. You will miss the hilarity, the atmosphere, and most of all the bizarre characters that call it\u2019s equally bizarre universe home. Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko is fresh, inventive, smart and often hilarious. I strongly urge you to pick it up and find out for yourself.",

            "content": "A few weeks ago, as I\u2019ve watch the last episode of this anime, I kinda felt a bit disgusted with the genre of this anime, but the weird slice of life and mystery does made up for it, so my rating for this anime are the following:\r\nStory \u2013 good 7.\r\nSo, this anime is not exactly sci-fi even thought there mentioned of extraterrestrial aliens and espers in it, but the story is not focus on Erio, rather it is Makoto who is the story here, co\u2019z every episode is on him and his struggle to cope up within the weird world of the people around him.Also, the very thing make him the story here, is the way he keeps his sanity when everyone else is going cuckoo  by simple have a positive attitude and going with the flow. There isn\u2019t much any comedy here and the sci-fi aren\u2019t that much around it either, in fact those mentioned genres are just tidbits which makes up this anime, you might say the Yashiro is the only esper in here. There is of course the mystery genre like where did Erio went and what has happen to her during her disappearances only to reappear again and walks around with a mattress covering her upper body and why does her mother Meme is not even bothered by it, also why does Maekawa have to wear her mascot outfit even when she\u2019s hardly even near her place of work and does Ryuuko have any idea what she talking about, those are the stuff that makes the mystery genre of this anime more profound than the sci-fi and comedy and what make me give this portion a \u201cGOOD\u201d rating.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t much for me to say about it. But I really like the way Meme the MILF is drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nSame here, except I like the opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I guess even if the muchacho (male lead) is the story of this the anime and everyone else are just additives it still deserves such rating. I don\u2019t have much to say about each character since their roles are pretty simple. In fact their role can be compare to that of other characters from other anime such as Haruri Suzumiya , but with some twist (read between the lines \u201cwith some twist\u201d).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nAs in fair enough to be watch by everyone, even though the skirts that the female characters were wearing are short  no panty shot were seen and it is also fair enough that it can be watched everybody that is if you focus on the muchacho and not on the Chiquita.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nI think that it\u2019s enough that this anime would just remain as a season 1, that is unless some fan service would be included if the author decides to make a season 2. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Denpa Onna is a slow paced, light hearted anime. Quite the contrast from Shaft's Madoka Magica which aired the previous season. The show benefits from strong and likable characters, good art, and a feel good type atmosphere.\r\nThere is less of a plot and more of a tale personal growth and change for each character, especially our protagonists, Niwa and Erio. Not only how they grow, but how their actions, beliefs, and personalities effect those around them.\r\nAs stated above, Denpa does not have a super deep plot, or a really anything out of the ordinary as far as the genre goes, but the charm the showdelivers is stellar. The closest show I can think of with the same charm level is Aria. However, while denpa might not have a complex plot, it does have a small one that connects the characters together.\\n\\n\r\nA person's enjoyment of Denpa Onna will most likely depend on how much they like the characters in the show and their gimmicks. Some have found them annoying, while others have loved them. Each character does have a distinct personality and a unique way to put a smile on your face. \\n\\n\r\nThe show gives you a sort of X Files complex. As in, you really want to believe aliens exist in the show somehow. It does a good job messing with your head making you think one thing, and then all of a sudden you're not sure anymore. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend you check this out. You might struggle a little early on because of the pacing, but once you get to know the characters you'll be a believer. \\n\\n\r\nThe Truth is Out There.",

            "content": "I just had to write a review for this because I really enjoyed this anime.\r\nAnd for a change of pace, I'll break down this review to its components: Story, Art and animation, Sound and Overall enjoyment. (I don't do this normally and wanted to try it out)\r\nStory= 8\r\nDenpa Onna to Seishun Otoko deals on the mysterious and the unexplained. We have Touwa, Erio who has been missing for half a year and claims to have been abducted by aliens. But really, what actually happened while she was missing? What caused her to have amnesia? And then there's Niwa, Makoto, whose line of thinking depends onwhat can be seen and is proven, has to face these events. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this serious-sounding background, this anime is quite far from being serious at all. Dealing with Erio's condition and helping her return to  society as a normal Earthling is what Makoto is aiming for, while having to deal with some other things. I don't really think I've seen any anime with this plot, but I think it's actually pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation= 10\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the art for this anime. Its art is actually quite similar to the more recent Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (Which is another good anime I recommend) It's bright and very well-done. The animation (especially of that on the opening song) flows rather smoothly and deserves a perfect score on my review.\\n\\n\r\nSound= 10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects were unexpectedly good. The opening song didn't quite get to me at first, high and weird squeaky voice and all. But eventually, I came to like it and it's actually pretty catchy. The ending song, however, I didn't like as much. Voice acting is also good. No complaints there. The background music is what I'd like to point out, especially. \\n\\n\r\nThe music  that plays sometimes in the background is outstanding and very well-done. It doesn't distract you from whatever is happening, and actually helps improve the setting of the scenes. Another perfect score there. \\n\\n\r\nOverall= 9\\n\\n\r\nDenpa Onna to Seishun Otoko would've been nice if it had more romance in it. Relationships between cousins are legal in Japan, right? Either way. despite not having an romantic elements in it, it's still a very enjoyable anime and I recommend watching it. No regrets guaranteed.",

            "content": "First, before I jump right into the review of Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, there are some things to be said. Let me level with you for a sec:\r\nCharacters in the anime:\r\nNiwa Makoto: A dumbass going through puberty, but is probably the most normal person around.\r\nTouwa Erio: As intelligent as a puppy.\r\nMifune Ryuuko: As smart as a six year old.\r\nMaekawa: Wear cosplay to work and evening walks.\r\nTouwa Meme: Mentality of a sixth-grader despite being 40 years old.\r\nHoshimiya Yashiro: Dresses up as an astronaut to play baseball.\r\nTamura (the old coot): Pretty senile. Obsessed with cattle mutilation.\r\nAnd they are involved in a comedy.\r\n  Whenyou have loony characters in a comedy, you can expect the intellect of the show to be pretty much in the drains. Despite that, there\u2019s actually morals to be learnt which I will go through later in the review. There\u2019s a lot of similarity between Denpa Onna and Arakawa Under the Bridge (also directed by Shinbou Akiyuki), and I will be constantly mentioning them in the review because it is just ridiculous how much Denpa Onna borrows from Arakawa.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n  The plot is extremely vague. Check out the synopsis. Everything written up there are the original bits of the anime that makes it interesting. So like Arakawa, there is a pretty girl who claims to be an alien. The interesting and most original part is that she wraps herself in a futon mattress as a way to avoid the society. She\u2019s a typical hikikomori(social withdrawal). Then her cousin Makoto moves in and helps her get back into society. This is the proposed plot. Up to this point, there\u2019s nothing wrong with this main plot. However, the plot constantly wavers to the side-lines as Makoto flirts with all the girls. There\u2019s this one episode where he goes out with Ryuuko, and then the next episode, he hangs out with Maekawa. There are only 12 episodes to find out the mystery behind the disappearance of Erio for six months, where Elliot (Erio\u2019s irresponsible dad) is, who Hoshimiya really is and which pipe hole she crawled out of and 2 goddamned episodes are wasted on building up the relationship with the two girls. Not that this is wrong or anything, but there\u2019s just too much unexplained mysteries in Denpa Onna. How the hell can Meme (Makoto\u2019s 40 years old aunt) look 18 years old? \\n\r\n  The worst of all is the way Denpa Onna ended. Okay, here\u2019s how it works: the city is divided up into two, the City and the Shopping District. They have a baseball match involving the main characters and the winning side would have the upcoming festival taken place in their area. This is cool and all. It is a good scenario to allow the characters to interact with each other. But this is the last episode. The LAST goddamned episode! Why the hell are they playing baseball when they should be solving one or all of the above mysteries? Then things took a turn for total shitstorm when they decided to end it off with Makoto talking to some old guy about life lessons rather than using that time to show us footage of the festival. It ended very disappointingly, just like Arakawa did.\\n\\n\r\n  The story isn\u2019t nearly as linear as the plot suggests. An event happens and even though it could have been summed up in a single episode, three episodes were aired instead to show the same event from three different character\u2019s point of view. This is without a doubt, derived from the creative mind of the director. Now let\u2019s talk about the morals that can be taught in Denpa Onna. It teaches the viewers, behind the slap-stick Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei-like humor that if you try your best, you will succeed. Also, there\u2019s the part about finding courage to return back to society, among various other things to be learnt from Denpa Onna. I expect Denpa Onna to come up with a second season to explain everything.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n  The art is really beautiful. It can be compared to Bakemonogatari or 5 centimeters per Second. All the girls are incredibly pretty and well designed. That\u2019s pretty much all to be said. You won\u2019t be disappointed with the art in Denpa Onna. That is a given. The main reason why this anime got a score of 8 from me depends heavily on the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n  I am not a big fan of the opening and ending song. Initially, the opening song sounded like a squeamish toddler singing into my ear, but I have come to liked it because the song suits Denpa Onna very well. The ending song was really emo but I guess it was calming. The background music in Denpa Onna is pretty good. There\u2019s the light piano music when Makoto hangs out with one of the girls, which builds up the mood. There\u2019s good music to be found here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n  Now I\u2019m about to rant about how original/unoriginal some of the characters are, so forgive me if I write out of topic. I can\u2019t help but notice how Makoto is a mirror image of Ryuugamine Mikado in Durarara!! I mean, the hair is just uncanny! I found myself typing Mikado rather than Makoto many times in this review. Ryuuko might as well be the twin sister of Minori Kushieda from Toradora! I mean, aside from the hair color, she\u2019s basically a more childish version of Minori. They have the same \u2018overly-energetic-attitude-that-makes-me-shout-out-everything-in-my mind\u2019 personality. Then, obviously Meme can be found in the thousands of anime which have \u2018Moe\u2019 in it. All this characters kind of make the cast unoriginal, but then, there\u2019s Maekawa. God, she is the best character in Denpa Onna. She likes to cosplay a lot, which isn\u2019t an uncommon anime character trait. But in a certain episode, she dresses up as a Xenomorph from the Aliens series. A freaking Xenomorph from Aliens. I could not even begin to comprehend how awesome that was. I must have replayed that scene more than ten times. The way she nonchalantly walks into the baseball field with that costume. That was pure genius.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n  Well I must admit that I have cracked up a couple of times when Makoto tries to be the straight man against his aunt Meme and fails miserably. So that makes Denpa Onna pretty enjoyable. I don\u2019t particularly hate being drowned in Moe when Erio, Meme or any of the female characters come into the scene either. The weird score board that determines Makoto\u2019s adolescence points is pretty entertaining as well. I was intrigued by the unexplained mysteries but soon gave up on the hope of ever achieving the answers to them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n  Denpa Onna is like the Arakawa it never was\u2014Arakawa with Moe. I guess the director realised that having half the cast being whacked out wierdos wearing freaky masks wasn\u2019t going to win the hearts of the viewers. Denpa Onna is then created to make up for those mistakes, replacing crude old-men\u2019s humor with cute Moe comedy and toning down the level of weirdness of the cast. Still, it is unique in its style and comes about to be a pleasant anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\n  Ps. Oh by the way, it probably wasn\u2019t the best idea to have the hottest character of the anime be a 40 year-old aunt. Seriously, Meme is hotter than her 16 year-old  daughter and the majority of the school girls Makoto ever had the pleasure to meet.\\n",

            "content": "Note: This is one of my works from Sekijitsu\r\nArt\r\nWhat pulled me into this series was the art. There was something about it that appealed to me and I don\u2019t regret being pulled in because Denpa Onna has some great art. Sure Erio might sparkle a bit too often but those sparkles add effect and I really don\u2019t mind it. There were times when Shaft decided to degrade the art during those not-so-special scenes which was fine by me. Although, during a certain episode, the art was so deformed it looked half-assed. Overall Shaft sure does some good close up shots and we\u2019re talking about theguys who did Bakemonogatari here!\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nTalk about the most dreaded OP I\u2019ve EVER heard! Maybe I\u2019m exaggerating a little but I really didn\u2019t like that opening at all. The notes in the singer were going everywhere and being a music student, I couldn\u2019t really take it. I will admit it was catchy but it\u2019s just not my type of music. The ED was nice to listen to, but it doesn\u2019t fall under the \u2018like\u2019 category. This also goes for the BGM in the series which also didn\u2019t fall under the \u2018like\u2019 category. With the use of BGM\u2019s, you want to try and add more emphasis to the certain scene. At times Denpa did execute it well but most of the times it wasn\u2019t anything special.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t think Denpa was originally supposed to have a strong story line to its slice-of-life feeling and because of that I was lead to disappointment. With all the alien references, I had hoped for the series to take a deeper dive into the sci-fi but considering I haven\u2019t seen Arakawa Under the Bridge, I didn\u2019t really know what to expect from Shaft. I still enjoyed the series for what it was.\\n\\n\r\nBouncing off each character and giving each character individual episodes did help in character development but at times it felt as though some characters should of appeared in certain scenes but just didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nThe flow of the series seemed on par with the story. There were plot holes and some characters just disappeared after a nice build-up of events leaving a very blended flow going up and down. There were times I liked some episodes and there were times I didn\u2019t. An example of this was Shaft leaving the proclaimed esper near the end made me wish she was introduced earlier.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example included the cow tag man being spoken of but was left till an episode or two later for him to actually get introduced and Elliot was never heard of after we saw a child version of him. Of course, it\u2019s not all so bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nOther than being filled with heaps of moe moments and maybe some fan-service, it wasn\u2019t as interesting and enjoyable to watch as I thought it would\u2019ve been. Erio deciding to take on star gazing and a part-time job wasn\u2019t what I expected for her social comeback towards society and the other characters had some lack of importance too in certain scenes. As I\u2019ve said, the music wasn\u2019t that great, the art was nice to see but there wasn\u2019t an actual solid story to this series.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it?\\n\\n\r\nYou might be hesitant to watch it after a score of 6 out of 10 but this is to appeal towards a wider audience. If you enjoy moe, sparkles, slice-of-life or nice occasional art then I\u2019d recommend this show to you.",

            "content": "Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko manages to slowly drag you into the story only to give up on you by the end. Providing a constant stream of comedy each episode is enjoyable, but after soaring to great heights the plot falls into a river. No, literally. I never questioned dropping it, but I felt like the focus switched from a comedy of a young girl who thinks she is an alien and the events conspiring around that to a slice of life.\r\nNiwa Makoto, our male lead, moves into his aunt's house who was apparently living alone. To his surprise he finds a girl his agewrapped tight in a futon to be living with her. Thus, his sanity is put to the test as he takes it upon himself to convince Erio she is not an alien but a normal girl. On the side we have the classmates who disapprove of Erio, and warn him to try and stay away from her. \\n\\n\r\nThat encompasses everything that transpires in a nutshell. At first the story is rather captivating and the comedy works well with it. However, after the first arc ends the focus drastically changes. The story switches to a baseball tournament. Wait, I thought this was about adjusting Erio back to a normal person? Now, it is still funny and it is nice to see him interacting with his classmates and neighbors. It just betrays your expectations a little that the story just turned into something average.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Erio there isn't much backstory, but instead the strength of the characters is in their personality. Let us take the aunt Meme for example; she may be 40 but acts like she is a little kid teasing Niwa, and is just awesome fun. We have Ryuushi who is energetic and who makes a very cute couple with Niwa. We also have Maekawa the more collected one in the show who almost subconsciously cosplays everywhere she goes. If we add Erio that makes up the entire cast of the show, including a few supporting characters. It may be that because the cast is so small it is able to make the few characters it has look even better.\\n\\n\r\nDenpa Onna was always fun to watch. After a good introductory story I was very disappointed in how it transpired after that. Yet, as a comedy it never failed to make me laugh once or twice. While ending up a different show than expected I would still recommend it to others.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review and I hope it was helpful. Comments and questions are welcome!",

            "content": "I'll be the first to admit that the only reason I watched this anime is Buriki, the original character designer. Ever since watching Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai and the sequel, I've been a huge fan of his.\r\nDenpa Onna to Seishun Otoko unfortunately has quite a few ingredients that I hate. First, the protagonist is the 'hobby psychologist' type, who thinks his viewpoint on others is absolutely correct, and won't back down from his arrogance unless punted in the head with absolute proof. Granted, we are talking about a girl who thinks she's an alien here, but the whole 'I am going to fix you'mentality of this guy is too cringeworthy to bear. Luckily, he gets past that stage fairly early and the rest of the season can be enjoyed in peace. Additionally, it does tie into the conclusion, so I am forced not to deduct any points for it.\\n\\n\r\nAs much of a fan I am of Buriki's character designs, I think this is his weakest hour. Apart from Erio Touwa herself, he didn't bring a magic touch to much of the rest of the cast, though his style does pop out in every character. I just feel they weren't characterized much, not only in art but also in writing.\\n\\n\r\nAll that aside, the anime does feel like a low budget job. From the opening theme, Erio Touwa's voice acting, to the fast-forwarding of minor events and the decapitated \"adolescence points\" sub-plot/ time-filler that has no relation to the anime at all - there are a lot of incongruities that makes this anime at times look like it was given away as an amateur prize in a chocolate bar; \"create your dream anime storyboard\".\\n\\n\r\nThe season does get a lot better in the final quarter - maybe someone on the staff floor realized that the potential of this anime was greater than the effort they had put in it up to that point. Whatever the reason, it is a bit sad that it got a bit neglected early on, and that it didn't get a second season.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully, Buriki will stay away from SHAFT from now on. His work on Haganai and Nagi no Asukara were way less of a waste of his mountainous talent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSummary of my ratings:\\n\\n\r\nStory : 6\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

            "content": "I have really come to love and appreciate the work that SHAFT does when it comes to anime and this show really continues to win me over!\r\nI think that hidden in this cutesy show about a a small town boy learning to find his voice in the big city is a deeper story about mental health and how it effects a family and in this case the community.  Something happened to Erio something so bad she lost half a year of her life and can only find solace in hiding wrapped in a futon. She is shown in flash backs lashing out at herclass mates. Really thinking deep into this it makes you wonder what happened and what if her fathers disappearance is linked? \\n\\n\r\nThe point i think this anime tries to get across using metaphors is that when some one is depressed and hurt that just sitting with them and listening can better than any therapy. the opening song even mentions its lyrics. The people around Erio where so involved in there own issues they immediately vilified Erio, her mother even deciding it was easier to ignore her instead of trying to help. I think in a culture that is being so rocked by suicides there is an important message here. \\n\\n\r\nAll it took was her cousin spending  a small amount of his time and caring to take a girl hiding from the world to getting a job and joining a baseball team.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several other great sub plots about growing up and even in the end the ESPer story i think was more a metaphor for learning to question convention than it really was about a girl from outer space. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all very few animes has left me days later thinking about all the different deeper meanings and hidden ideas. I could be wrong it could just be a cute show with another quiet reserved female lead for the male lead to fawn over but i don't think i am.",

Characters\r\nThere's the eccentric 40 year old mum who is seemingly happy and carefree. In reality though, she has no idea how to approach her daughter who seems to have some loose screws in her head and is unable to tie her shoe or cut a paperstraight. How on earth is this girl so beautiful when even the basics of hygiene are unknown to her?  \\n\r\n In comes the young boy from the title to take care of his eccentric cousin. I don't know if teenage boys would wipe my face from food stains and find it cute but maybe if I wore a see through dress, why the hell not. In any case, transfer student is somewhat of a typical harem protagonist. The story is mostly from his perspective, so somewhere halfway through you'll be thinking \"why doesn't this have a harem tag?\"\\n\\n\r\nDon't let yourself get distracted by sparkling cute girls or nurse cosplay because then the show suddenly switches perspectives. \\n\r\nThere's a little heartwarming, family friendly part. There's the cool, youth-like, DO YOUR BEST!!! part. There's baseball and summer festival and school lunches and cicadas. It becomes less of a harem and more of a feel good slice of life where even the side characters get their time to shine. \\n\\n\r\n2. Story is... where you find it.\\n\r\nIn the second half, a sudden body of water appears and it's up to your interpretation whether you make it the depth of a puddle or the Mariana Trench. \\n\\n\r\n3. Art \\n\r\nWell, it's Shaft. Enjoy sparkling water in a swimming pool, meteor shower, lips, nails, hair and various body curves of 2D babes to your hearts content. \\n\\n\r\n4. Sound\\n\r\nMy guess that the OP is denpa which is a genre of music. It's like pop-rock on drugs. \\n\r\nED is sung by Yakushimaru Etusko and it's a slow, lullaby type of a song that I really liked. \\n\r\nBGM is fitting. Aliens/space play a big role in the series and so whenever we're watching stars there's this soft music in the background that's a little mysterious and nicely completes the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment\\n\r\nEvery Shaft creation is like cake with sweet topping with strawberries and chocolate and cream but because of that I don't know how the pastry actually tasted. Though I know for sure it wasn't bad at all. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR \\n\r\npros: gorgeous art, quirky characters\\n\r\ncons: stuck somewhere between harem and slice of life. nothing much happens. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Some of you, after watching series like Madoka or Bakemonogatari may have wondered what would romance series made by SHAFT be. Well, this is the answer.\r\nAt first, art. SHAFT's trademark, all those unrealistic sceneries and situations that together somehow make sense. I rate the art in this series as outstanding. Just watch one episode and you'll understand.\r\nSecondly, story. This is the only flaw of this series - there was no real plot, basically every episode was a bunch of more or less connected scenes, so we can enjoy the characters.\r\nSince we're at it, characters. Aside from the only significant male character being protagonist himself, thisseries still deserves 10 in this section. I really liked them all, and when it comes to Erio and Ryushi (hehe) the combination of the way they acted and awesome art usually made me just stare at monitor and smile like a retard. They were insanely cute. At the same time cute like a puppy and feminine. Up to now, I never thought it is really possible.\\n\r\nI'm not saying that Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko was the best romance anime. In my opinion it hardly qualifies to 9/10 because of the lack of plot. But I'm not saying it was bad at all! I really enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing is that some of you not used to SHAFT style may not enjoy it. All those unrealistic situations, talks, and just the way everybody acts may spoil the fun for you at first. My tip is, don't fight it, just deal with it that this anime looks like this. Treat it like an ongoing joke, and I promise, you will enjoy the series.\\n\\n\r\nAaaand, that's basically it. I hope I helped you decide to try out this anime, or to look at it a little differently with my kinda messy review. Also, please keep in mind that I'm not native English, and some grammar, vocabular or construction mistakes may occur. If you detect one, write to me, and I'll fix it.",

            "content": "I'm still not really quite sure what to think of Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko.\r\nOn the one hand, you have a generally thoughtful and depth-seeking piece that tries to provide meaning to one's adolescent life through alien and superpower metaphors.\r\nOn the other, you have a not particularly interesting, if weird, harem anime comprised of 1 guy, 3 girls + 1 annoying perverse aunt.\r\nThe thing with Denpa Onna is that it managed to keep my interest, but provided nearly no fun. It had a lot of attitude and style to its characters, but I didn't really like any of them much. It is, overall, an interestingexperience, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a complex thing.\\n\\n\r\nWell there are some aspects of it that are plainly good or bad:\\n\\n\r\n-The general art style, voice acting, and execution effort are all very satisfactory.\\n\r\n-The pacing is a bit slow, but it is necessary for all the inner monologues of the hero, which are the meat of the show, and do make it stand out very much.\\n\r\n-The storytelling that constantly colludes an allegated \"aliens and superpowers are among us\" with conversations that make it sound like the hero is really looking for aliens and superpowers, is a very serious effort and keeps you posted\\n\\n\r\n-The characters reaaaaally aren't that fantastic, none of them, or even good, they're just a step above decent, a twinge above average if you're being generous\\n\r\n-The story is interesting but is all over the place, never giving you a clear vibe for whether we're supposed to ship someone or not, if this is a show that tries to be deep, or if it's a harem with some weirdness\\n\r\n-There is no real value to any story thread because of the aforementioned point, you always wonder if we're getting somewhere, and no, we never are\\n\\n\r\nThe gist of Denpa Onna is this: I don't know what they're really going for. What kind of story, what sort of message? There is a lot of value in the soul-searching about adolescent life and the relationships, even if it's a little too wordy for what it is. But is there something they're really going for? I don't know, even after having finished the anime, I simply don't. \\n\\n\r\nErio is supposed to come back to society. Does she really? Not really, but a bit. She also has an affection for \"Itoko\" aka Cousin, aka Makoto Niwa, aka protagonist, but is it supposed to evolve into love, or evolve into him becoming her bridge to a successful social reinsertion? I still don't know at the end.\\n\r\nRyuushi is supposed to be the love interest chuniibyou, and I guess she does become the \"main girl\", but not entirely.\\n\r\nMaekawa is the possible love interest that will almost certainly remain in the friendzone. But at the end, is she firmly established as a friend or as a love interest? More than the others, but still not entirely.\\n\\n\r\nThere are loads of plots that are started but unfinished, thoughts that are expressed but unclear, and questions are raised by the dozens each episode but seldom get answered, by the anime or by us.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the conundrum here: I was interested, but don't know what I was supposed to be interested about. There were creative ideas, but I have no idea what they were trying to express.\\n\\n\r\nDenpa Onna was a mess, an interesting, original mess, but a mess nonetheless. I enjoyed it far more than less deep or less creative animes. But at the end of the day, I don't know what I was supposed to get out of it. For most animes, enjoyment is enough, but there was little enjoyment in this one, as it is burdened by long monologues that don't amount to much, and plot points that end nowhere. I see it as a project that didn't really know what it was going for, or was setting up for a very long run but only had 12 episodes and wanted to show off what it had coming in whatever light novel or manga it was showcasing.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't a disapointment, but I feel as confused about it now as I did 2/3rds into the season, except my interest started dying out somewhere around that time. I finished it hoping for a conclusion, I didn't get one, and I'll be left confused. I still don't regret watching it.",

Well I'm not usually into a slice of life anime, I cant watch them but my favorites are all action and thrillers. \r\nThe pace was random I suppose but all perfectly fitting to the end.\r\nThe art and characters are beautiful, the story has a lot of comedy, whats not to like?\r\nBut my very favorite is how deceptive the slow and oh so regular slice of life pace was, and completely whirled the story around last minute. Astounding plot twist, loved it! The anime left me stunned and impressed. Taught me not to underestimate the slice of life genre after all.",

I have no idea where the writers came up with the title for this anime.\r\nStory 3/10\r\nIt's difficult for me to talk about this anime's story since so little seemed to happen in this anime. I understand that this is a slice-of-life anime, but typically in slice-of-life anime there's morecharacter development or drama or something. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure you can even call this a comedy since there were so few jokes and I didn't laugh at the few there were. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, there all these plot points that were never resolved.

Where was she when she disappeared?\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you watch a lot of anime then you know this trick: if your anime is dull and boring then just put a picture of a cute girl on the cover. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't anything that special about the art in terms of animation and character design. It's very basic and average. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned before how this is a slice-of-life anime thus there's more focus on the characters then the story, but the problem all these characters are so boring that I'm having trouble thinking of things to say about them. \\n\\n\r\nRyushi is a cute girl who doesn't like people telling her she's cute\\n\\n\r\nMaekawa is a tall girl who likes to wear random cosplays like she'll wear a fish costume to play baseball.\\n\\n\r\nMeme is Makoto's aunt who constantly flirts with him which is more uncomfortable than funny.\\n\\n\r\nErio goes through some development, but it isn't a very drastic change. By the end, she's still shy and afraid of people.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI was really disappointed with this anime. There's no story. The character development was minimal at best.

            "content": "(This is my first review, so please don't be that harsh on me! I'm still learning obviously.)\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe first episode introduces Makoto Niwa, a young male teenager who moves into his Aunt Meme T\u014dwa's house after his parents go overseas. Erio T\u014dwa, Makoto Niwa's cousin, is then introduced to the story, who is constantly wrapped up inside of a futon (which is to be believed to hide herself from society) and she also believes that she is an alien due to a loss of memory because of an accident that happened 6 months before Makoto's arrival. As the plot continues on, Makoto helps Erio reachout to society (also known as getting out of her futon and to stop believing she herself is an alien) and she opens up by getting a part time job at her great-grandmother's convenience store and she joins a baseball team. \\n\\n\r\nI thought the plot was very interesting and there were many questions that came up in my head that wanted to be answered, like \"Where is Elliot?\" (Meme's husband), \"Where did Erio go for six months?\", \"Who is Hoshimiya? What's her importance in the story?\" but as it got up to Episode 10 I felt that the plot totally dropped Erio and her importance in the story as a once self proclaimed alien and the anime started focusing more on Matoko and the girls' he's surrounded by relationships. That honestly made me very mad. If they were going to drop Erio they could have at least explained A LOT more about her and then focus on Matoko x -insert girl here-! Also, I understand that Hoshimiya was introduced in the 9th episode or around there, but they didn't even explain her reason of being in the story at all in the last 3 episodes! \"Because's she's an alien esper?\" Please, there has to be a better reason than that, and that doesn't even explain WHY she's in the story in the first place.\\n\r\nThere was so much that was unexplained and that ticked me off, maybe it's just me, but I couldn't honestly care less about Ryuuko's & Matoko's relationship, that goes for Maekawa as well. \\n\\n\r\nI think what the worst part is is that the last episode was a baseball game. A BASEBALL GAME. I was actually sort of freaking out when I finished episode 12, the last episode, and was desperately searching for the non-existing 13th episode, I just couldn't believe that the 12th was the last! The baseball game had little to do with the actual plot that I was interested in and instead of attempting to solve one of the mysteries that they were once trying to solve other stuff was happening like Matoko lecturing Maekawa's Father about life and so on (which I thought was completely random), I would also like to throw in that they didn't even include the festival that the City and Shopping District were even having the baseball game for, but I've heard from a friend that the OVA that I have yet to watch is about the festival so I won't argue about that.\\n\\n\r\nSo to basically summarize all that I have just said above, this anime had a promising plot but then it all changed into some pointless non sense that didn't involve Erio's case at all, since that changed so did my rating. There was once a time that I had rated Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko's story an 8/10, but since all of this useless stuff happened between episodes 10-12 and none of my answers were answered I dropped it down to a 6, mostly because I felt like I was teased by the makers of this anime but it was an interesting anime at one point, which it still is, but if I ever re watch it I will not be re watching Episodes 10-12.\\n\\n\r\nThey had better make a Second Season to explain everything that was not explained in the first! If not then I'll keep the story rating the same.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nWhen I first saw Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko from an anime music video that I had stumbled across on YouTube I couldn't help but be captivated by it's wonderful art! The scenery looked amazing and the girls looked stunning! Don't even get me started on how much I wish I could look like Erio! Because of the way Erio was drawn I actually now am starting to love light blue haired girls. The only thing that I didn't like though was the way that their lips were drawn, it actually has always sort of annoyed me. Besides that though I adored the art and it really helped raise the overall rating since I'm a huge nazi on art styles. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI'll talk about the opening and ending for Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko first, the opening honestly annoys me. I don't like it at all. It sounds like a 3 year old screeching, the sound behind the voice is pretty good though, but the singing just ruins it for me. The ending though is very cute and relaxing, and actually when watching this anime instead of skipping the ending like I usually do with all the anime I watch I actually would sometimes listen to the whole thing while in another tab. The soundtrack for the anime is, well, fitting. Nothing really else I can say, there wasn't really an OST that played that didn't fit with the current scene that was showed at the time, I personally thought Hoshimiya's soundtrack that would play whenever she appeared was perfect for her. The question is though, is it the best soundtrack ever? I'd have to say no. You have to give this anime some slack though, I've watched some anime that has a very emotional soundtrack like Fullmetal Alchemist which honestly brought me to tears, but you just can't compare this anime's OST with a masterpiece such as Fullmetal Alchemist, that's like saying Selena Gomez is better than Skrillex, (bad example, spare with me) those 2 are a very different genre of music and so are Denpa Onna and Fullmetal Alchemist, they are both very different (especially genre and depth wise), they are both very different with only minor (and I mean MINOR) things in similarity. \\n\\n\r\nMy point is though Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko's sound was perfect  for the type of anime it is, but it isn't anything memorable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10:\\n\r\nI afraid I struggle in describing characters for many reasons, but I'll try to summarize the main and some supporting characters personalities (and similarities to other character's in other anime that I've seen compared to the character's personalities I'm summarizing) in one go.\\n\\n\r\nErio T\u014dwa (Touwa):\\n\r\nSince the first episode she appears to have a very awkward personality. But after she acknowledged the fact that she was not an alien, she starts to relieve her true personality, that she is actually very shy and is hiding from society. I have to say that she is very unique and I actually cant say I've ever seen anyone that was like her, yet. \\n\\n\r\nMeme T\u014dwa (Touwa):\\n\r\nShe has a silly and cheerful personality, and often at times a little evil. She enjoys teasing Makoto in any sexual way that she can. She also seems to care about Erio, even though she tries to hide it as proven in the first few episodes, by getting her a job at Tamura's shop. The only similarly I have for her is that she looks a lot like Ami from Toradora!, but that's the art's fault. Meme is also a type of character that can be seen in many moe anime, which makes her character unoriginal. She still is an alright character though. \\n\\n\r\nMakoto Niwa: \\n\r\nHe has a calm and collective personality but at times tries to go along with the flow and replies with an answer such as (\"I see\" or \"okay\"). He thankfully isn't perverted like some male leads in moe anime that I've seen which makes him very like-able in my eyes, there really isn't anything I can say about him besides that though. He's original in some ways, but not really. \\n\\n\r\nRyuuko Mifune:\\n\r\nShe has a very active personality, which is what most moe anime character's seem to have, I find her annoying for that reason and she's also just like Minorin from Toradora, which annoys me because I don't like Minorin one bit for her personality, even though Minorin does change I'm talking about Denpa Onna, not Toradora!\\n\\n\r\nMaekawa: \\n\r\nShe has a calm personality but also likes to tease Ryuuko by saying things that Ryuuko tends to misunderstand, she also loves to cosplay and go on evening walks. Maekawa in my eyes is somewhat unique, I've never seen an anime character that loves to cosplay 24/7 before so it's kind of neat to see someone such as herself in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nHoshimiya Yashiro: \\n\r\nShe has a childish personality and she can get irritated pretty fast, I've seen her type of character many time in anime and therefore find her annoying and unoriginal, but the fact that she is a self proclaimed esper makes her somewhat interesting so I'll give her that.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all though I think the characters are basically all unoriginal with only the slightest things that make them unique, Erio and Makoto are very amazing characters though since their personaitlies sort of made this anime what it is so that's why I rated it a 7, and plus Erio is one of my all time favorite characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm normally a person who doesn't laugh while watching moe anime, but, especially in the first few episodes, I found myself awwing and laughing, at a lot of things in this anime, mostly at Erio & Makoto's relationship which is one of the reasons why I really liked Denpa Onna. But just like I stated in the story rating explanation, the plot failed to answer so many questions and the ending made me want to scream, not in a good way. I did like the first 8 or so episodes though! I thought they were both very interesting and exciting, and don't get me started how much I smiled at the whole E.T. parody scene! Therefore I have decided to rate it 8/10, it's a weak 8 though, I could probably lower it down to 7 but I can't exactly say there was an episode that I found boring. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko is an amazing anime to watch if you're looking for a cute, moe anime with a supernatural theme. Stay away though if you're looking for a serious supernatural plot with cute art style, because that's what I was looking for at the time, but I was sad to see that as the plot continued on that it was turning into a more of a slice-of-life anime by the second and not so much a supernatural, and I was kidding myself about the 'serious' bit. But overall, the art's outstanding, the sound's good, the character's are fitting with this type of anime, it's very enjoyable and the plot (aka story) is promising until the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo even though it does end up to being a let down, I still recommend you watch it if you have some time to kill, because to be honest even after being let down I still don't regret watching this anime, I just hope there is a Second Season... \\n\\n",

            "content": "Art (7/10)\r\nThere were some things that I liked about the art and some that I didn't. I'll go with the pros first: good detail, realistic scenery, smooth animation of moving objects. As for the cons: characters look awkward at times, annoying reddish shades on knees, exaggerated lips. From this, it's easy to tell that I liked the artwork and animations for anything not human. The excessive use of sparkles didn't work for me most of the time as well. The OP and ED sequences were interesting and unique. \r\nCharacters (8/10)\r\nIf you were to take this from a teenager's point of view and a young adult'spoint of view, the score might be different. If you like characters that develop and change their thought patterns and ideals as the story continues, then you may rate this higher than me. However, since I dislike  long and detailed soliloquies, I didn't pay much attention to them, thus, the characters were less developed in my point of view. Nonetheless, it is obvious that the main protagonist, Niwa Makoto, had his views of different aspects of life change a lot during these 12 episodes. Whether these changes are good or bad, it was nice to see this development. As for the other characters, they were interesting but not memorable. Although I must say that Touwa Erio easily takes the award for most moe character of the Spring 2011 season. Hanazawa Kana making an appearance as herself was a nice surprise. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nLike many others, the first time I heard the OP, I was extremely surprised. However, after listening to it multiple times, I found it quite catchy and addicting. The ED, on the other hand, didn't quite fit my tastes. As for the BGM and voice acting, they weren't particularly outstanding. Only the voice of Hanazawa Kana was recognizable for me but maybe that's just because I haven't watched much anime. Other than that, the sound didn't really play a huge role. \\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10)\\n\r\nHonestly, this anime could have ended when Erio realized that she isn't an alien. Dragging it on for that many episodes decreased my rating. For the last half of the series, there wasn't much of a \"story\"; just Makoto rambling on about life and whatnot. Maybe I not paying attention to any character who talked for more than a minute straight is what made me believe that a story line was virtually nonexistent. If split into halves, the first half would be a 9/10 for me while the second half falls to a 5/10. Average out the two and you get 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nI didn't really expect anything from Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko. Maybe the appearance of aliens would've enhanced my experience since they talk about them in almost all the episodes. The only reason why I stuck with it was because of Erio. Yes, during every episode, I watched in hopes of Erio showing up and giving me my episodic dose of moe. Not a disappointing series but could have been much better. Maybe Episode 13 may influence me to edit my review. Who knows? But for now, the score of 7/10 stands.",

            "content": "To begin with i only picked up this show when i realised the art was identical to Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, which I've grown quite fond of this season, comparisons shall be drawn.\r\nI've not scored this show all that highly, and it could have very easily been much, much higher.\r\nThe story is actually pretty deep, Makoto moves into a new town, with his 39 year old Aunt, because his parents have moved over seas for work, pretty standard scenario. Upon his arrival it turns out his Aunt has a child, his cousin, now a young girl of the same age as him, of whichthe rest of the family has never been told about; again hardly ground breaking stuff here. The interesting part, she's a complete loon, who spends all of her time rapped in a futon, ranting about alien conspiracies. The interesting part here is that rather than being a loveable odd ball, like just about every other show, Erio genuinely has some mental illness/trauma here, and working through it, actually makes this show a little complexed in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is well exactly like Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, i wouldn't know i was watching a different show if the characters started crossing over. For those who haven't seen either, the crux of the art is that the character models are very detailed in terms of facial features, lips and such, character models are all pretty much excellent, backgrounds and everything else is also massively detailed and really bright and cheery and genre suitable.\\n\\n\r\nSound, Op is really different and i really liked it, despite the fact i'd never have played it a second time had i come across it as an actual song, very suitable for the show, good selection for the show from the staff. I'm not so impressed with the voice acting, i have no doubt the cast play the roles they're given as instructed, but its very flat, in stark contrast to Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai which manages to get away with allot of average material purely on the strength of the voice acting, watch both and you observe! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter is kind of a let down, Erio and Makoto are both kinda one tone, slow paced folk, the energy comes from Ryuuko and she annoyed me really quickly, Makoto's aunt was very cliche, although i did like the third love interest Maekawa, but that might purely have been by default. If you're watching these kind of shows, you should be only to aware that the cast are far more important than the story, and the short comings of the cast do hold this show back allot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment wise, i wrote a good chunk about the story being deep, but it doesn't really come to anything, what actually happened to Erio to get her this way is never covered. The romance comes to nothing and Makoto never ends up with anyone, and generally it all feels like it went know were towards the end, with the climax being some largely irrelevant base ball game. The pace never changes, and it really should be shifting up a gear towards the second half. This might be down to purely faithful adaptation of only a part of the material, but still as an anime it is lacking for it.\\n\\n\r\nClosing comments, this is worth watching, it's short enough to be forgiven for pretty much any short comings, the art is always great, the story is light and easy, although ultimately comes to nothing, give it a shot if it sounds appealing to you.",

            "content": "Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko is a series that I picked up on a whim and while not a terrible series, it didn't have any lasting impact for me. \r\nArt: The art is by far Denpa Onna's greatest quality, with varied character models and beautiful visual effects. One of the effects that is most common in the series is a shimmering effect that is displayed on Erio when she has a frame to herself, which serves not only to express her natural good looks, but also perhaps to imply that there may be something otherworldly about her; as if those sparkles are stars and herhome is truly amongst them. The only issue that I really had with the art is that there were a handful of instances in which the characters were \"chibified\" and while I'm not opposed to this style of drawing, the infrequency of that animation style just made it feel out of place in the few instances when it was present. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound design does everything it's supposed to, voices are pretty well done, and the opening and ending songs are pretty good to.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Characters: The story pretty much has to be combined with the characters in this case, due to the series being mostly focused around the characters as opposed to an overarching plot (similar to a slice-of-life, but not quite). The major concept sounds interesting with a town and girl who may have strong ties to extraterrestrials, and a young man attempting to help his shut-in cousin reintegrate into society, but the premise is let down by the characters themselves. My major grievance with the series is that most every character is, for lack of a better word, kooky in some form or fashion with little to no understanding of aforementioned kookiness. Niwa the protagonist seems fixated on the accumulation of \"adolescent points\" which would make sense if he were an otaku obsessed with dating sims or if it were a gag series that mentioned this occasionally. Erio claims to be an alien and wears a futon, Maekawa is a cosplay freak who regularly wears strange costumes when not in school (from an eggplant to a Xenomorph), the elderly shop owner is obsessed with cattle mutilation, Meme is an irresponsible parent genki girl, Yashiro wears a space suit and seems to be cut from the same cloth as Erio and a supporting character wears a cattle tag in his ear. With the possible exceptions Meme and Erio, no explanation to this strange behavior is given, and it's hard to relate to them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Most of the enjoyment I got out of the series came directly from the visuals. There were moments when I did laugh a bit, but for the most part, the characters threw me out of being immersed in the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you like aesthetically pleasing art, a good soundtrack and aren't dissuaded from a series due to flat characters or a somewhat lackluster story, then pick up the series.",

            "content": "I was primarily drawn to this series mainly due to it's great artwork and because it seemed like it would have a decent story as well. So now that I have watched all the episodes I can come up with one definitive conclusion.\r\nStory. It gives us an intro and leads to the introduction of the two main characters Makoto and Erio, Erio of course being the more interesting character. She believes she's an alien sent to observe the humans, thinks she can fly and passes her days wrapped around a futon. She's rather carefree and pretty much doesn't care about the outside world other thanthe usual stuff like food and observance. Makoto, being the main character that he is, can't help but want to know more about her. This leads us to a climax of some sorts early in the series, while entertaining and telling, it pretty much ends there. The good story telling that is. The rest of the series is spent introducing new characters and/or doing silly stuff like launching up stuff in the air or finding Erio something productive to do. While that happens though, you get to know the characters a little bit more. Story wise, it isn't very strong, I\"d say it's ok. Not too bad or not too good, just there. \\n\\n\r\nArt. Lacking in story, but makes it up in the art. DOTSO has some very very nice art work. The backgrounds are detailed, the characters expressions, especially the female cast are very well done and attractive to the viewer. I give it a 9, it's done very well. A few things might bring it down, but I didn't mind much since the most important things stood out more.\\n\\n\r\nSound. I really liked the cast in this. I think they did a good job with the voice of their characters. They just seemed to fit in, which is good. Music was good as well, the opening song was pretty memorable, the ed song was also pretty memorable, but didn't like it as much, but I'm sure you'll remember it. Unique.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. I give it big thumbs up. I really liked the characters. They all were interesting to some degree, except maybe Makoto and Meme who seemed to be the more predictable ones.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall. I enjoyed it. It was entertaining with some funny moments, great artwork and great voice actors. The only downer was the story. Wish they could have moved along better with it, but overall I say it was pretty good. Could be considered a slice of life kind of show since the story isn't really complete in my opinion. I give it a low 8.",

I love how cute the characters are drawn. Great use of colors, just plain and splendid at the same time.\r\nThe story, although, depends onthe personal expectation on the viewer, me myself, I liked the story although the anime ended with a lot of questions left behind. But it is also soothing and funny at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds excel too, it blends well with the cuteness of the artwork, for example, the way Ryuuko-nyan talks, she's cute, I have to agree on that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well made, no annoying characters were made on this anime. That's another thing I like. The primary reason why I drop watching certain shows is sometimes the characters itself, who the hell would want a annoying character that keeps whining. I mean seriously..\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a light-hearted approach with a touch of comedy and romance, I would definitely recommend Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko for you. But if you are looking for more then this anime is not for you. :)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE : 9/10 I love this anime, and I will continue to love it. :) I wish for a second season though.",

            "content": "Anime Review:\u2028 Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\r\nBy Bobjonez98\r\nStory: 7/10-\r\nI would call this a disjointed romantic comedy, there are clearly feelings between the male lead and the 3 females around him (plus the crazy aunt). The story is purely character-driven, the whole story is the development of Erio and how the Cousin is helping her along, and how, in doing so, realizes a lot about himself.\r\nCharacters: 9/10-\r\nThere are a lot of truly memorable characters here, from Erio the futon girl, all the way Grandma. Some interactions are of the shaft school of dialogue and animation, while others stay firmly in romantic comedy territory. All in all,the characters are this series' strongest point.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10-\\n\r\nIt's a bright style, lots of contrast between light and dark. I like the character designs, the use of contrast, and the application of bloom and glow effects really brings an airy feel to some characters.\\n\\n\r\nOp/Ed: 8/10|9/10-\\n\r\nOk, yes the opening is out of tone, and it's schizophrenic, and it's different, it's not for everyone, but I find it particularly catchy, it\u2019s a grower, it takes a few listens to understand how awesome it is. But I really like the animation and lyrics. The ending is awesome... It's disjointed, weirdly synched, uses weird instruments, and isn't so much sung as it is spoken. But I love that voice, and I love that toy piano.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10-\\n\r\nWhile the music isn't always prevalent, there are 2 tracks in particular that make me sing along/get excited when I hear them. That to me is enough to give the series an attitude and a unique feel, but I wish there was more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10-\\n\r\nThis was a fun ride. There are a lot of great moments with great music and great characters, but there are a few lulls and when the story is already sort of weak, those hurt you. In the end, I it was enjoyable, like able, but nothing extraordinarily remarkable besides some unique characters and music. If you like the work of SHAFT, check this out. The story isn't as strong, and the music isn't as good, but the characters and set-pieces are done in that unique SHAFT manner that I really like.\\n",

            "content": "Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, a lighthearted anime. As the rating I gave shows, I enjoyed this show immensely but there is a deeper reason behind it than just a cute story or character. This review contains MINOR SPOILERS WHICH ARE ONLY IN THE STORY SECTION 1st and 2nd PARA.\r\nFirst giving the headlines of the review:\r\n1. It is a deeper story than is usually perceived\r\n2. It is not exactly a typical anime\r\n3. There is little one wants to change about it\r\nNow moving to jumbled subsections:\r\nStory 9/10\r\nSeemingly it is a non-existent story of just a boy staying with his strange cousin and getting along with her,meeting friends and seemingly the story stops midway. I look at it in a different light. The story is about a boy, who came to a city watched by aliens and finds every person strange and weird. The rest of the story takes him (and the viewer more deeply) into how different people, make things up, act certain ways, hide things deep inside, to show an outer covering that isn't what they are inside.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts with him mocking the alien stuff and ends (till the 13th episode) in him questioning whether aliens do exist or not. And other than a few moments, it is all realistic. Now all this deep and slightly emotional (for some) story is well hidden behind cheeky, relatable, and funny characters that make the anime cute but in a warm way. It leaves you happy.\\n\\n\r\nThus it is basically a mix of a deep underlying story of psychology well woven with funny and quirky plus cute moments. It doesn't have any harem aspects (some may hint it) and is not a typical anime of a normal guy winning over girls through sheer love of justice and good will.\\n\\n\r\nAbove, I have also covered Enjoyment so I will skip that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nNow the characters are actually well defined. After watching it completely it is almost as if you can tell what they might be thinking at such a moment or how they would react in a situation. They don't act out of the way and feel like proper... characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound 9.5/10\\n\r\nPersonally, I found the art very smooth, the style that SHAFT production has really shone and the glossy sweet faces matched well with the theme. The background, colors, details, and especially the hair... was beautifully done.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I didn't find a flaw in this anime and enjoyed it above animes like Bleach, One Piece, Basilisk etc. I hope that this review helps you.",

            "content": "This is an often overlooked anime when looking at different anime by Shaft. It's a great example of how care-free you can feel while watching anime. This particular anime is very soothing itself, and should not be overlooked as much as it is.\r\nStory: (6/10)\r\nNothing too special in and of itself. There are two plot-lines you follow. One is Erio trying to become more of a normal girl after living (what seems to be the majority of her life) in a futon, not doing anything. The other is of Makoto trying to get used to his new life in a new house, living with his auntand Erio, and attending a new school. It's charming to see it progress, but it never has you wanting to know what happens next very badly. Take it as it comes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (10/10)\\n\r\nShaft's addiction to turning heads shows up once more, but this time, even more beautiful. Everything is bright, happy, and shiny. Never a dull moment with the art, and the animators don't get lazy.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (7/10)\\n\r\nAlone, the soundtrack is plain, but it is used well in the series. It is silent when it needs to be, and can cause perfect feelings of awkwardness. The voice acting was overall decent, nothing to sneer at.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (7/10)\\n\r\nErio is the most developed character and you grow to like her. The other characters are either cute, funny, or Makoto. He does not develop much, yet his personality makes up for it (mostly). Someone as strange as Erio needs a cynical friend such as Makoto to make moments even more light-hearted and funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8/10)\\n\r\nIt was a nice, quick anime. I enjoyed all the goofiness, the cuteness, and the beautiful art similar to 5 Cm Per Second (even a quick reference if you can find it). Nothing I would go and buy, but it kept me happy and entertained for a good while.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (8/10)\\n\r\nIf you have not seen it yet, I recommend that you do. If you want something light-hearted and visually appealing, this is a great one to go for. Not at all a waste of my time.",

The storyline was puzzling, not in a good way. In my many years of watching animes, usually being puzzled about the story or plot is a very good sign of being interested because it means the series got your attention. But in this series, I was so bewildered in a very complicating way. It\u2019s not even interesting enough for an average story. There were moments when it felt like senseless. Before I knew it, I was already yawning likeI didn\u2019t have any sleep when in fact I had. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters just kept on talking and talking about senseless things. It\u2019s like watching a very boring conversation between two very awkward people. I could not comprehend what the hell were they talking about. Plus, almost everyone was so weird that they were talking and acting like they had their own worlds. Though, I am going to admit that they were very cute and gorgeous characters most especially the female lead. I can\u2019t define whether she\u2019s cute or gorgeous. It felt like she\u2019s too cute for her age but too young to be considered so gorgeous. It\u2019s like she\u2019s at the peak of being cute and already going towards of being beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nWell, at least the animation was so great given that it was one of the latest animes of today. The graphics and how the characters were beautifully done was definitely one of the best.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, I am very disappointed because almost all 2011 animes are not amazing or interesting enough. Oddly enough, for some reasons almost every each of them are pretty much famous but in the end almost all of them are not interesting at all. I am so puzzled why are these series so popular? \\n",

He then takes it upon himself to reintroduce her into society.\r\nThis is one of the most clever anime I have seen. On the face of it is a bizarre story with lots of equally bizarre characters. I have to admit I watched, loved it but had no idea what it was about. After a few days and weeks I eventually realised what it is about and here lies the genius. Although each episodehas the same characters, each one has a different moral tale such as sometimes people just need encouragement from their friends to succeed, people fear people who are different and dont't stop living until you die.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said the characters are bizarre, except for Makato who is normal. Makato's Aunt, Meme, takes every opportunity to make him uncomfortable sexually, Erio thinks she's an Alien, his friend Maekawa goes everywhere in Cosplay, his other friend Ryuko goes through thought processes by making imaginary basketball shots, Yashiro, a small white haired girl, claims to be an alien and esper and wears a spaceman suit but the show leaves you wondering that she might be telling the truth and Meme's friend from childhood, Ashiro, wears a cow tag as a earing. The characters are bizarre but all extremely likeable in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is bright and colourful and well done although it's not innovative.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't a fast paced show. It goes along at its own fun speed. However, it is a very intelligent anime. If you like anime's to spoon feed you the plot you won't like it, however, if you like to find the subtle messages anime's often have you may well love it like me.",

            "content": "I'm not saying it was aliens... But it was aliens. That is quite possibly the best description I can come up with when trying to explain this anime in once sentence. Shaft have a habit of either making an anime with many eyebrow raising points or one with cute but crude humor. In this they found a nice blend point that make you question what the hell did they make.\r\nDenpa Onna to Seishun Otoko has a story around the daily adolescent life of one boy and his high school life in a city well knows for alien encounters. It seems a typical slice of lifestory with an added harem for amusement purposes. Playing through, it seems to have two arcs. The first arc being the confrontation with the cousin Erio and the second arc being the mystery of a self proclaimed esper alien.\\n\\n\r\nArt is very pleasing to the eye but occasionally over done with sparkle effects and wind motion effects that are entirely un-needed. The colour of every thing is very similar apart from some scenery items that that tend to stand out in large amount of detail.\\n\\n\r\nSounds for standing objects and doors, etc. are fairly good with even muffled thump sounds for a futon hitting the floor. It's really thought out well. As for background music most of it sound like it is a slightly altered version of music from famous Nintendo titles. It raises the questions as to what did they use for their musical inspiration as there seems like very little there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is quite amazingly welled played out as from start to finish it so clear as to how the characters change and their feelings for each other change over time. It would have been better if more characters within the school had some development with the main characters as outside of the main group, next to no character progression is had.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor is quite high for the first 8 or so episodes while the last 5 episodes are somewhat dull and just drag on the average school day life with added mentally unstable side character. However the ending seems very well played out as after all the denying the main character does with the existence of illogical things, it really did come as a mind melting surprise.",

I continued to see the main character, Erio Touwa, on the web and googled intensively to see which anime she was in. After I finally found her I was so excited and started the anime up as soon as I could. The first few episodes were soo amazing and I couldn't stop myself from watching them one right after another. But, something happened. The episodes continued to get away from the plot and seemed to turn into fillers. I continued to watch regardless,hoping it would shake off and get back to this amazing plot. Nope.. Not until the very last episode it actually related back to the main story, and at that, left you confused and questioning \"what?...\" \\n\\n\r\nStory: When the show stays on topic to the plot, it is great! \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: Art is absolutely stunning. I adore all the glimmer and sparkles. Sound is average to good as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Touwa is still one of my favorite characters regardless if the anime wasn't all that great. I enjoyed her weird habit of stuffing herself into her futon, and I especially loved her glimmering and sparkly self. Absolutely Beautiful.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10",

            "content": "Denpa Onna is an interesting watch. It starts off as an intriguing sci-fi about a mysterious self-proclaimed alien girl, and then switches gear to a slice-of-life harem surrounding other \"denpa\" girls.\r\nThe first arc of Denpa is great and you should watch it given the chance. The combination of Erio/futon cuteness and denpa-speak creates for some really interesting character development and palatable comedy. The rest of it was average for me, read on to hear why.\r\nAnimation:\r\nDenpa has absolutely stunning animation. The series has a lot of very serene, detailed backgrounds and scenery and some pretty cool effects. There's mysterious shiny particles that occasionally come out ofgirls' hairs (alien? dandruff isn't shiny...). Character designs are mixed as Erio and her aunt look great but the other characters are average. The only minor complaint I have is that the backgrounds lose a great deal of detail in some of the action sequences.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDenpa's OP is a perfect choice for the series. Not only do you have a \"signal\"-like instrument, but the melody and tone perfectly fit the series' slightly out-of-the ordinary nature. The ED is also very interesting though it may induce drowsiness at late hours of the night. The BGM is a good mix of instruments and electronica, with some very distinctive pieces, enough so to acquire the OST.\\n\\n\r\nThe stand out VA goes to Ai Nonaka for giving aunt Touwa an unbelievable amount of energy and moe.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nOur protagonist Niwa-kun is moving to live with his aunt, and suddenly (upon arrival) realizes that his aunt had a child who she did not inform the rest of the family about. This isn't a sudden girlfriend appears as the child, Erio, is only interested in wrapping up in a warm futon and, in general, distancing herself from society.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Denpa is about Niwa's encounters with Erio and other \"denpa\" girls, in a somewhat arc-based format. The story was a bit uneven for me as I was greatly intrigued by the mystery of Erio and later Hoshimiya, while the other randomly outgoing girl and the cosplayer were much less interesting. The plotline is fairly weak after the first arc as it reverts to slice-of-life mode, focusing on character interactions. The series then takes a curveball (watch the last episode to get the pun) and turns to focus on Niwa's self-discovery. The story feels like it lacks a proper conclusion but that is most likely due to the fact that the last episode hasn't yet been released due to the earthquake/tsunami. We'll have to wait till the blue ray to find out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs I've stated above, the characters range from mystifying curious to wtf is this person thinking, though I'm certain that was intended given the series title. The character interactions are very interesting, and expect some jealousy/push-pull over Niwa-kun by the girls late in the series.\\n\\n\r\nI liked how the story kept an air of mystery around certain characters, which is partly what kept me watching. There aren't too many characters in this so you can be sure that anyone who gets airtime is decently important (contrasting with Hoshizora).\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nDenpa is a fairly mixed watch. I absolutely loved certain arcs yet found others boring or confusing. There are definitely some wtf moments, and equally many realistic interaction moments. I just wish they would have focused more on Erio's development.",

            "content": "\"Electric Wave woman and Youthful Man\"!.... You could probably imagine my thoughts on Denpa Onna when I first looked it up. I couldn't really find any substantial reviews or comments about it back then, so I didn't really know what to think about it at first. In the end, I decided to just try it out. And boy, was I surprised.\r\nI didn't really think much about Denpa Onna at first, nor did I have any anxiety towards it. But honestly, I was so wrong when I though it was nothing special. It just proves that you cant judge a book by its cover. Or inthis case, its title.\\n\\n\r\nNow, first of all, \"Electric Wave Woman\" wouldn't really be my first choice on a title. But as I got deeper into the anime, the name just stuck I guess. I honestly don't know where to begin talking about the plot on this one. I can't really explain how the main characters move in this anime. So I'm just going to jump right in.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just give you a little pick-me-up... It's about ALIENS!... ( lol, that so did not do justice to the anime )\\n\\n\r\nThe plot first and foremost, is pretty solid. I didn't see any rushing or signs of chocking on time, so it was okay on that point. Although I can't really say much about the plot. I have to say it is very interesting and original, but for me, I guess it just didn't stand out as much. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development was pretty shakey though. Although it wasn't that rushed, the characters seemed a little bit hollow. But that isn't really a big deal. You can even say it adds more elements to the plot. But still, it does get a bit awkward at times.\\n\\n\r\nIt's actually more of a discovery anime rather than a drama or a comedy. It brings a sense of curiosity to the stage, and distributes it equally and evenly. But don't fret. There will definitely be chuckles and giggles in Denpa Onna. Enough to satisfy the comedically-hungry mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good as well. They wen't pretty straightforward with the \"moe and cute\" theme. The background is pretty descent as well. I can't really say much about the art though. It doesn't stand out that much.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I honestly don't like the OP that much. The ED was fine and cute, and the insert-songs and sound effects are pretty solid. It's just the OP that's bugging me. Although it is pretty catchy once you get used to it. I personally don't want to keep hearing that song in my head. A little too much static.\\n\\n\r\nI guess what really captivated and got me hooked on to Denpa Onna was the atmosphere it sets. It definitely has that whole \"space mystery\" thing going, and I for one think it's pretty cool. Denpa Onna is pretty much good for all kinds of Anime fans. I suggest you watch it if you want a funny anime that also makes you think: \"I wonder what else is out there\".",

After a few episodes the boy very early on convinces the girl she is not an alien, and the most interesting issue this anime had to offer was resolved 4-5 episodes in. Now, i rated this part a 5, but if i were to ratethe first 4 episodes, i would give it an 8...because the last 7-8 episodes are nothing special, just your average high school boy trying to score adolescent points (explained in the anime) by doing various things any normal high school boy would do...which is the problem. The one thing that this anime had above others that made it stand out from being just like everything else in the genre, is the alien theme...it is continued throughout the anime with a self proclaimed \"esper\" who wears a spacesuit, but the anime ends with the boy finally realizing his \"esper\" powers himself....which i thought was stupid because these so called esper powers were little more than what people would call common sense....he is told he can use his esper powers by suddenly cheering  on Ryuuko, giving her the power to make her free throw shots, i mean, normally theres no problem with something like this but this is about it when it comes to the anime, it doesn't try to go above and beyond but sticks to cliches and regularities present in a thousand other animes\\n\r\n Art 7/10\\n\r\nNothing special about it, i only didnt like the facial expressions and how they were drawn, just not exactly something i enjoyed seeing almost every other scene\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nI quite enjoyed the sound track the opening wasn't too bad but the music during the anime was great\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nI can't really explain it much further than this....there wasn't much at all to the characters, about the only character development in the whole anime was Erio going from this self proclaimed alien to showing her normal human side and interests thanks to Makoto. \\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\ni was highly looking forward to the episodes through the first 5 eps, afterwards watching 1 episode became painfully boring\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nHonestly i wanted to give it a 7/10 but i took a look at others that i gave a 7/10 and this one is not even close to being as good as they were, i normally dont rate animes below a 7 unless it really just did nothing for me, which this one did and didn't....maybe i missed something, but after Erio snapped out of the alien mindset, this anime lost its luster to me",

And let me tell you, I enjoyed the heck out of myself!\r\nArt:\r\nLike I said, it's gorgeous. I am a sucker for large, emotional eyes. And have a huge soft spot for long long hair on anime girls. This whole series is just one huge ball of eye candy for me. I can't get enough of the artwork.\r\nPlot:\r\nI won't go into detail, but I originally thought it was purely going to be lighthearted and fun. While it was very comedic, it mademe think too. It also had it's emotional points. Sad/touching sort of stuff.\\n\\n\r\nDialogue:\\n\r\nI always make it a point to review the dialogue on anime that I watch and review. I am always looking for something with clever and well written lines. And I'd say Denpa Onna gets a good rating from me. I found it enjoyable, and the voice cast is rather amazing to boot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I suggest this series to every one of my friends. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and I will re-watch it whenever I get the chance. I also plan on checking out the dub since it got licensed. I will be buying the DVD as well.",

It's not an anime where you'd want to watch the next episode right away because it's so interesting. It's really not that interesting, but it has it's moments. The moments in the Denpa that make this show bearable to watch are the hilarious parts of this anime. The comedy isn't great, but it'll make you chuckle every now and then. Lastly, the music that was chosen for this anime is decent. Not thebest soundtrack I've heard but it's pretty good, especially the op (pretty catchy).\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an answer to whether you should watch this or not, then I'd have to advise you to try it only if you're not looking for a serious anime with an ingenious plot.",

Aesthetically, it is very pleasing and enjoyable.\r\nThe beginning intrigued me with the strangeness and the eccentricity of the characters. The first few episodes seemed quite promising as the development between cousins was furthered. However, the story seemed to get bored of that about halfway through and character development slowed down to a meager crawl, opting instead to go into more eye-candy and humor. The ending felt rushed in trying to achieve some form of closure by further developing the main character into whatfelt like a half-hearted way.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're expecting some sort of masterpiece, Denpa Onna is going to dissapoint. But, if you just want to enjoy the cuteness of the girls and the aesthetic qualities, Denpa Onna shines almost as much as the shiny lights radiating from the girls in every closeup.",

Juicier colours than ever seen before, anywhere. Just stunning.\r\nVery cute, really original characters & character designs. Futon girl Erio is both the most original character design in years and the cutest most kawaii thing ever shown on television.\r\nThe series has its very own, quite different artstyle. One season on, people are already starting to copy it.\r\nUnfortunately, it cuts offcompletely in midsentence, and even with the promised purchase-only EP13, has zero chances of concluding without far more than the second season that it isn't all too likely to get. Meanwhile, the only subplots anywhere near conclusion are Erio taking her first steps into the world, Grandma's depression, and Aunt getting over her midlife crisis (or has she??)... No romances build up past crush stage, despite hints of seven or so pairings. Future Erio friendships are hinted at, but the buildup was just starting. Some characters' relationships aren't even fleshed out and decided (hell, seems like we're not even sure *whose* grandma Grandma is... the Aunt's? Elliot's? nobody in particular's neighbourhood grannie?). And even dedicated fan servant Hot Mom Auntie hasn't been squeezed for anywhere near her fan service potential.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS is the anime that should've been titled \"We Still Don't Know... That Day\", not Ano Hana. Seems suspiciously all-too-likely that we never will find out what happened to Erio, what will happen to Erio, what Niwa's future treasured teenage memories will be, etc. etc.\\n\\n\r\nPity.

They only mention aliens once in a while. it's more of a lighthearted anime. There's nothing big, it's not to be someone's absolute favourite. But, i think it was very cute. It's not deep and something that leaves you with your mouth wide open saying \"oh my god.\" As I watched it, I felt happy, and fluttery throughout the whole series. It didn't have a good vs. evil, or anykind of conflict, it focused more on Niwa Makoto'sdaily life after he moved in with his aunt, Meme. So, to sum it up, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko does not have a complex storyline, it's more fit for people who want something to enjoy out of free time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nI absolutely loved Erio Touwa. In my opinion, she's the best character in the anime. The only character I didn't enjoy was Ryuuko Mifune. She was the MOE-st annoying character there. I highly disliked the way she looked down on Erio simply because the rest of society does. Also, I hated the fact that Niwa wouldn't even defend her. but I have to admit, Ryuuko was pretty. I loved Maekawa. She was the cosplay girl of the group. I liked how she was straightforward, not beating around the bush. Niwa was a pretty average guy, there's nothing special about him. He doesn't influence or anything. Touwa Meme, supposedly 40, does not act or look her age. Although, i loved Meme. And as for Yashiro, she was just as great as Erio. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime looked amazing! I wouldn't watch an anime simply because it looked old. The quality and effects gave this anime a pleasant fuzzy feeling to it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSountrack: 9\\n\r\nI didn't really care for the opening that much, because it doesn't match the anime at all. The background music sure was fitting, and set the mood. I loved the ending, it was cute and fuzzy, just like the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. People looking for something complex, probably wouldn't. But it's great for someone who wants to smile when there's nothing to do. :)\\n",

Erio is a weird and strange girls thinking that aliens are real and stuff like that she is though really sweet and a kind person as well. Ryuuko is another female lead she is has a pretty hyper personality she really the first person to hit it off with Makoto or basically be friends with him otherwise she is a nice and sweat person. Maekawa is the last main of the anime she is basically sweat and what not as well but she also doesn't really like being tall and she does also have cosplay stuff that she likes to do.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: the comedy in this is honestly really good not the greatest but it does its job otherwise i could see this being a romance anime but the thing is its more flirting than real romance though and also a harem as well i could see as well sense like 3 or more girls in a sense like that main guy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall it gets a 7 out of me the comedy wasn't the greatest but easily did the job for me and is easily worth the watch for sure you will get some good laughs out of this anime",

(episode 1- 12, I heard episode 13 is coming on DVD maybe it will be the festival that we won't see for months D: ) \r\nThis anime with potential didn't get the ending it deserves. It ended up like a sports anime. Which there's nothing wrong with but it was an \"out there\" anime (one of the many reason why I love Shaft productions), A girl wrapped in a futon? That's very normal.\r\n This anime would of ended up better as an OVA for three episodes/It would ofended better if the original anime ended at episode three. I watched the anime because of the production, the characters, that oddly catchy opening and ending song, the art, almost everything. The whole thing (or what I thought) was to focus on the character development of  Erio (our cute blue haired main character!) but no .. what happened to getting Erio in society? That idea died out quickly. There are little hints here and there that she is doing better but after that it just goes off. I was disappointed at the story but the art (9), sounds (9), characters (9)  gives Denpa an overall score of \"7\". I enjoyed this anime and I had laugh out loud moments  but that story is still leaving me a bit \"blah\"~\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I can't get out of my head is  \"Meme is a forty year old woman\" xD",

You can't expect any space battles or alien invasions, even though it does have something to do with aliens. \r\nThe music is enjoyable and appropriately strange.  This show is also satisfyingly free from the melodrama that makes a number of similar shows unwatchable.  I wouldn't mind watching itagain some time.",

That is the way this sweet and intelligent series shows ground previously unexplored by the usual means. As in not the typical brainless high school drama. Just getting started. The asides of dialogue are nothing short of hilarious, and all characters play a role in the expanding critique of relationships. More to come.",

            "content": "Denpa Onna caught my attention for the longest time because it came up as a close recommendation for Sakurasou no Pet and had similar characters. As a huge fan of Shaft I was fairly excited to finally watch this anime with high expectations. \r\nI wasn\u2019 all that disappointed to tell you the truth. A few things that stand out in any show or movie are the basics; the sound, the music, the art, the characters, the setting, and the dialogue. As a slice of life, it did its part as being funny, emotional at times, and heart warming. Like any product from Shaft, you seethe art style that sets it apart from any other production company.\\n\r\nNever in my life have I seen such a cute character like Erio. Like fuck, I can\u2019t get over all cute she is, I know she\u2019s just an anime character but get real. I suppose the only normal character in this story is Makoto, he\u2019s just doing his thing, enjoying everything he can, and taking whatever he can in. But basically every other character is really fucking weird, but that\u2019s what makes this anime great right?\\n\r\nSo things that don\u2019t stand out. The opening song is decent for the most part, but the ending is fucking fantastic. No doubt one of my most favorite ending songs ever, everything about it is great, I always watch it. The rest of the background music didn\u2019t stand out at all, I don\u2019t remember any of it and I didn\u2019t like it enough to download the OST, so theres that.\\n\r\nMy least favorite thing and what really made the rating for this anime is the ending, it wasn\u2019t all that great. I mean it was good, but wasn\u2019t what I expected or wanted. But I\u2019m not the writer, so its not really up to me is it? But it could\u2019ve ended waaaay better to make this anime stand out from others. Also, you\u2019re introduced to characters that you don\u2019t see later on. You\u2019ll see them for a bit, they look very important, and they\u2019re gone a minute later.\\n\r\nI gave show an eight on myanimelist and the special a 7. So I\u2019m going to stick with a solid 7 due to the ending not being all that special. If you like comedy and slice of life then you\u2019ll enjoy this very strange tale.",

            "content": "You know, every once in a while, people get bored with what they normally watch.  It doesn't matter what kind of fan you are in terms of anime, you probably WILL get bored of the genre after a while.  When you come out of the realm of what you are used to, you can either enter the world of a different genre, or watch an anime oddity.  Yes, this review is about Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, or Denpa for short, an anime that to me, screams oddity.  Let's begin.\r\nStory (7/10): The story of Denpa is about a boy named MakotoNiwa, a boy who transfers into a city that has a history of strange otherworldly occurrences.  From him moving into the house of his aunt, he finds a strange girl who is wrapped in a futon that turns out to be his first cousin Erio.  From there, the story unfolds as he tries to figure out this strange cousin of his, as well as the city's residents.  From this story, it's easy to see how strange of an anime this can be as the premise itself probably can't be found anywhere else.  While the anime is focused on Makoto's point of view for the most part, the anime switches its perspective on which character its focusing in a sort of style that is similar to how Clannad is formatted.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10): As I have said before, Denpa is a very strange anime.  Therefore, there are very strange characters.  First we have Makoto.  Makoto is a general high school boy who focuses a lot of his time throughout the series on puberty points.  In normal human terms, it's basically how his social life is going.  (They even go on a whole scene explaining it.) As possibly the only real normal one of the whole main cast in the series, Makoto acts as an outsider looking in, eventually delving himself into the world that is this strange city.  Next, we have Erio Touwa.  As the main female of the series, Erio is well, to put it short, an alien.  (self proclaimed.) On account of an accident that happened a few months prior to the anime's beginning, Erio has no memory of who she really is, and thinks herself as an alien, basically wandering about at night with a futon wrapped around her.  For me, I consider these 2 as the only real main characters as the majority of the supporting cast gets almost no screen time compared to them.  But I will say that each supporting member does have an odd quirk or 2 that adds more to the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound (8/10 and 7/10): For art, the majority of the anime is standard fair as the characters themselves don't look as spectacular as some other works out there.  Most of the female cast has a sort of moe feel to it that I felt I needed to mention.  However, it does have a higher score due to the design of Erio.  They always put some sort of mystical feel or aura around her that makes her more unique then any other character out there.  Seriously, just look at her eyes.  For the sound however, I'm a bit sketchy about.  The voices themselves fit the roles well and I'm happy about that.  The ending itself is a little song that could probably bring a smile to anyone's face as how bouncy and fun it sounds.  It's just the opening that throws me completely off.  Upon hearing it for the first time, all I could hear was this out of tune screechy little girl voice that made me avoid it like the plague.  It's just really unbearable to hear in my opinion.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment (7/10): Denpa is one of those animes that you can't find anywhere else.  It's not a typical slice of life or any of the typical tags that are put onto this show.  For me, this was a true oddity and a gem in the realm of anime.  Because this anime was just so out of the ordinary due to its characters and premise, I couldn't stop watching.  This anime is so strange, that it's good.  However, there were times where the anime just dragged on and on, and it really hurt itself because of that.  The implementation of random characters didn't help either, and frankly, the opening was just bad.  But, this show is good in its own little special way as the show's title can tell you.  So, if you want to watch something that is out of your comfort zone, I would go for this as the majority of this anime isn't about school, it has pretty much zero fanservice, and it has quite an original plot in terms of what is coming out these days.",
