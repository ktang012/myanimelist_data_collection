            "content": "Dealing with the death of a friend or loved one isn't easy, no matter how old you are, and everyone comes to terms with their loss in different ways. Adults can drink themselves into a stupor in an effort to dull the pain, take off on a journey of self discovery, bury themselves in their work, or find some other coping mechanism. Unfortunately the same isn't true for children, and all too often they are unable to truly deal with the emotional turmoil that occurs.\r\nNow it may seem a bit odd to talk about death, grief, and learning to deal with the loss of someoneclose, but essentially that's what Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (We Still Don't Know the Name of the Flower We Saw That Day), is all about.\\n\\n\r\nThe story opens with Yadomi Jinta, a seemingly grumpy teenager who is playing a game in his room on a hot summer's day whilst his childhood friend Honma Meiko (Menma), pesters him repeatedly. Having had enough of the game, Jinta decides to  make lunch, but only for himself and his father which annoys Menma no end as she also wants to eat the ramen he has made.\\n\\n\r\nIt all seems like a fairly normal, everyday scene that one might see in anime, but not everything is as it seems ...\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface AnoHana looks like a fairly straightforward tale of teenagers learning to deal with a past trauma and maturing in the process, and for the most part that's a fairly accurate perception. The plot is well constructed and takes a measured, almost methodical approach to events which is reflected in the often placid tone of the narrative. Unfortunately this leads to a degree of predictability as certain events in the storyline are clearly foreshadowed, and while the series promotes a degree of empathy for the characters and their situation, there may be occasions where viewers want the story to get to the point.\\n\\n\r\nOne surprising aspect is the manner in which flashbacks are used to punctuate specific occurrences or emotions, whilst adding historical context to the relationship between Jinta, Menma, and the rest of the \"Super Peace Busters\". These sojourns into memory act as a nice counterpoint to the current state of relations between the characters, and highlight just how much has changed for each of them over the last ten years.\\n\\n\r\nThis contrast is also reflected in the visuals, and while there is a marked difference in the appearance of almost all of the Super Peace Busters, it's actually the subtle contextual setting that makes the change much more pronounced. The key thing to remember is that people often romanticise personal history and memories, especially if one has undergone some kind of trauma, and AnoHana plays on this by sharpening the focus and darkening the tones on the present day, which contrasts with the soft focus flashbacks that are often filled with \"light\".\\n\\n\r\nThe design itself is well handled, but while efforts have been made to really highlight the changes ten years can make to a child's physical growth, it's the character animation that stands out. A-1 Pictures have tried to visualize the movement differences between a child and an adolescent, and while there are a few niggles here and there, the overall effect promotes the sense that the characters are no longer the children they once were.\\n\\n\r\nBecause AnoHana is a character driven piece there is a heavy emphasis placed on the dialogue, and while the majority of the script is actually pretty intuitive, the manner of speech during the flashback scenes can sometimes seem a bit odd. Thankfully the series has some very talented seiyuu on hand, and it's interesting to note that some of the roles feature two different voice actors - one for the present day and one for the past. Each role is given due care and attention, so it's unfortunate that even with so much talent on hand, there are a few issues from time to time as the seiyuu handling the child roles are all adults. Now while this may be standard practice in the industry, studios like Ghibli have proven time and again that children are much more capable of playing the younger roles than the majority of adults, and while the relatively minor flaws in the dialogue do stand out, one has to wonder how different the series could have been if child actors had been used.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana features a number of slow pieces of background music performed on piano or guitar that reflect the measured plot and add a slightly bittersweet air to the storyline. The opening theme, Aoi Shiori by Galileo Galilei, features a sequence that shows the characters in their past and present forms and hints at the the reason for their emotional difficulties. The ending sequence features a montage of the three girls of the Super Peace Busters, Menma, Anjou Naruko (Anaru), and Tsurumi Chiriko (Tsuruko), and is set to Secret Base ~Kimi ga Kureta Mono~ (10 years after Version), which is a cover of the 2001 single by Zone and is performed by Kayano Ai, Tomatsu Haruka and Hayami Saori, the seiyuu who play the roles of Menma, Anaru and Tsuruko.\\n\\n\r\nNow given the nature of the series and the near constant focus on the characters, certain viewers may assume that AnoHana should feature almost continuous development, so it may come as a surprise to some people that the show takes more of a \"stop-start\" approach. Because of the attempt to apply a degree of realism to the characters and the emphasis on depicting them as plausible, any attempts at continuous development would seem overly contrived.\\n\\n\r\nBalancing that though, is some rather strong characterisation. One of the key things to remember about each person in the story is that they have experienced a specific defining moment in their lives, and that allows the characters to be depicted as individuals from the start. The strength of the characterisation is even more palpable if one compares the present versions of the Super Peace Busters with their past selves from the flashbacks. That said, there are occasions where the story has difficulty finding a resolution to a given situation so it can sometimes seem as though events are being dragged on in a effort to develop the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana is a surprisingly simple, yet slightly over sentimental, look at the coping mechanisms of children and adolescents when coming to terms with a past trauma, and in that respect it's one of the more surprising titles of the last few years. The series errs more on the side of soap opera than outright drama from time to time, but like many of the other relatively minor flaws, this can be forgiven in light of the fact that the subject matter is well managed and delivered. In truth, the closest neighbour to AnoHana would probably be Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 as that also highlights the difficulty children have in dealing with the sudden loss of a loved one.\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to say whether I actually enjoyed the series or not. On the one hand it has some genuinely entertaining moments, but on the other the series deals with an issue that has little enjoyment value (unless watching kids coming to terms with emotional scars is your thing), and even though AnoHana isn't a story without flaws, that doesn't mean it's bad. In fact, the reverse is true as while the series does take a slightly romanticised look at the characters and events, the constant element of realism that runs through the narrative sets this anime apart from many others.\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, AnoHana is a great example of how good a completely original anime can be.",

            "content": "Moderator Edit: This review contains spoilers.\r\n--------\r\n''Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae o Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai'' (We Still Don't Know the Name of the Flower We Saw That Day) is a series that sets lofty goals for itself. It is, in essence, a ghost story that aspires to be a poignant drama about (unrequited) love, loss, adolescence and self (re-)discovery. Heavy themes that require a delicate touch. \r\nThat last part is where things go wrong, but more on that later.\r\nAs the show begins, we see a boy sitting at home while his female friend is pestering him. The boy's father is remarkably unfazed by whatis going on. Soon enough, we learn why. The girl, Meiko, died 10 years ago and is a ghost visible only to our protagonist, Jinta. She's come to him with a request: he has to help fulfill her last wish so she can part for the afterlife. Problem is that Jinta has grown up to be a recluse. Nonetheless, he gathers all his courage and ventures outside.\\n\\n\r\nEarlier episodes show Jinta in his attempts to reconnect with his group of old friends to find out what Meiko's final wish could be. The Super Peace Busters (the name of the group) are a colorful bunch, and the series is at its best when it shows them getting back in touch. AnoHana nails that mix of awkwardness and nostalgia felt between people who haven't seen each other for a long time. In particular when they're connected by tragedy. In this regard, the character interactions feel incredibly authentic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then Meiko comes into play.\\n\\n\r\nMeiko, as portrayed by the series, is the most wonderful girl ever. She's incredibly sweet, loving, selfless, wonderful and innocent. Jinta is in love with her, even after all these years; as are the other boys from the Super Peace Busters. And the girls? Their emotional crises are all about how they could never match up to Meiko, even now that she's dead.\\n\\n\r\nKeep this in mind: we're referring to a girl who died over 10 years ago, when all of them were around 5. I repeat: this happened 10 years ago. A lot can happen in so much time, especially for  children growing up. The death of a friend, tragic as it is, will usually stop hurting quite as much. Life goes on, and day-to-day concerns have a way of catching up. AnoHana doesn't seem to grasp this. Every single person who knew Meiko even the slightest bit is still devastated over her death because she was simply the most wonderful girl ever. \\n\\n\r\nOr so we're told.\\n\\n\r\nThe Meiko we can see, however, is an annoying caricature. Her personality is that of ditzy, clingy, ''moe'' characters such as Yui Hirasawa (K-ON!). Her reactions mostly consist of either crying or being incredibly cheerful, and things she does on her own usually boil down to misguided attempts at cheering up Jinta with antics that we're supposed to consider cute. The makers even shoehorn in some fanservice of her. Raising the question of how seriously they really want us to take her.\\n\\n\r\nVery seriously, it turns out.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole plot ends up revolving around Meiko and her wish. By the end it's difficult to remember any aspect about the other characters that doesn't trace back to Meiko in some way. Worse yet, the series spends a lot of its running time having characters doubt Jinta's claims that he can communicate with Meiko's ghost. This in spite of the fact that Meiko is a ghost who can interact with physical objects. That's right. Proving her existence would be incredibly easy and yet the series keeps contriving ways to wring melodrama out of other characters' disbelief. One could defend this by claiming that people in real life don't always go for the best solution and make stupid mistakes. Which is true. But the characters in question are portrayed as decently smart in spite of their issues so it feels strange that such an easy to solve problem is dragged out for so long. Worse yet, the actual narrative ends up pointing this out. Indeed, the series itself pokes fun at how long it took to solve its nonexistent problem. It would be cute if it wasn't so infuriating.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the frustration only gets worse from there. As the series culminates in an ending that's composed and executed with such bombastic melodramatic sincerity I almost felt bad about laughing at it. The climax basically abandons any pretense of subtlety in favor of having characters shout their feelings at each other, only to neatly wrap up their issues with an instant-cure group therapy session. If only it were that easy in real life.\\n\r\nReal grief, of course, is a totally different beast. It's not something you get over after a miraculous event. Rather, it's a constant uphill battle as you struggle to pick up the pieces and try to fill the void  that's appeared in your life. The way AnoHana presents a one-size-fits-all solution is hopelessly na\u00efve, however well-meaning.\\n\\n\r\nThat last bit is a great way to sum up the series in a nutshell. Its superb presentation and handful of interesting parts are ultimately wasted on a series that decides to focus on all the wrong things. Pandering, sentimental and ultimately frustrating. ''Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae o Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai'' is a crushing disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nPS: \\n\r\nThe ideas I have formed about the themes explored in this series are based on my own imagination and second-hand accounts of people less fortunate than I. Should you disagree things I have written in this review then please do not hesitate to write me a message. I apologize for any offense I may have caused and wish to explicitly state that it is in no way intentional.\\n",

            "content": "There\u2019s nothing quite like the loss of a loved one for changing a person. We always feel that death is such an alien concept, it exists but is somehow detached and unrelated to our own little world until it comes knocking on our doorstep. Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (We Still Don't Know the Name of the Flower We Saw That Day), tries to show us just how powerful an effect death can have on us.\r\nThe keyword is \u2018tries\u2019, and for the most part, AnoHana succeeds. It is one of those anime that illustrates perfectly the idea that therelative distance to perfection is inversely proportional to the obviousness of huge, glaring flaws. For everything that AnoHana does just beautifully right, there is usually something little it gets horribly wrong.\\n\\n\r\nBefore we go on, I would like to state for the record that I absolutely endorse this anime to anyone who asks, reasons which are perfectly illustrated in Archaeon\u2019s neatly succinct review, of which I direct you to. There really is no reason to write another straightforward review reiterating everything he's said when you can just go and see his. Instead, for those who have already finished the anime and are looking for a more critical approach to viewing AnoHana, it may interest you to read further here.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no denying AnoHana is fine piece of work. Everything from animation to sound, characterization to story are all quality material and together form both a visually and emotionally satisfying experience. The anime is far past the point of debate about whether watching it would be enjoyable and worth one\u2019s while, because it most certainly is. The proceeding point of scrutiny would be to examine the anime at it\u2019s core fundamental level. This is the point where the \u2018really good\u2019 pieces of work are separated from the true masterpieces. This is also the point where AnoHana unfortunately falls flat. Specifically speaking, AnoHana\u2019s screenplay just isn\u2019t very good.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, considering how well rounded the anime feels as a whole, the screenplay is actually deceptively and surprisingly bad.\\n\\n\r\nOkada Mari, one whom I respect greatly for her work on Tordora and Kuroshitsuji is back again; this time she is chief script writer for AnoHana. Unfortunately Mari\u2019s apparent inexperience in writing shines through clearly in the screenplay. There is no doubt she has talent and a knack for good ideas, which makes it disappointing to see she still stumbles on some basic areas of writing. The narrative for example, is sorely lacking in woven exposition, with the many aspects of the story left feeling one dimensional and underdeveloped (more on that in a moment).\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is also inconsistent; the majority of the time it is written and delivered beautifully, but there are frequent punctuations of awkward, out of place lines that leaves something to be desired. Most of these instances are offset by the talent of the seiyuu who try their best to bring emotion to these parts, but the moments are still unavoidably noticeable. For instance, count how many times this scene happens: Jin-tan glances to his side at Meiko and mutters \u2018Menma...\u2019 another character looks at him, confused, and questions \u2018Yadomi?\u2019 \\n\\n\r\nThere are very clear distinctions between the lines that have significance to the plot or the character, and lines which are simply conversational pieces, with almost no blending of the two types. At times it feels like the latter lines have no contextual meaning at all and are simply there to fill in time because the script writer couldn\u2019t think of anything else to write. For an anime like AnoHana where the entirety of the narrative is delivered via dialogue and character interaction, this is a very dangerous habit to fall into.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many good things that Okada Mari brought from her experience working on the series compositions of titles like Toradora, Fractale and Gosick. Unfortunately one of them also happened to be the abysmal pacing that they all suffered from at one point or another. Naturally, the structure Exposition-Rising Action-Climax-Falling Action-Resolution can\u2019t possibly be adhered to as strictly for anime as it does for say, novels or films, simply due to the episodic nature of anime; there is an underlying need for each episode to be standalone in it\u2019s own right, even if it is meant to contribute to the overall story. However that isn\u2019t to say we shouldn\u2019t at least make an effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with AnoHana is that it simply tried too hard to be episodic. Each episode\u2019s substory warranted so much attention that there was very little room left to develop the main plot. Although each individual 24-minute segment was neatly tied into a little package with it\u2019s own structure, which seemed fine at the time of watching, suddenly we reach the end of episode 9 and we realize with 2 episodes to go we\u2019re still on the exposition part of the main story. This is again, partly due to the fault of the narrative not having any woven exposition in itself, relying instead on almost purely dialogue and flashbacks to establish the backstory, an alternative which is both more time consuming and less efficient. (To throw an example out there, think how easy it would have been to tell stories of Popo\u2019s adventures around the world by simply including a few souvenirs from his travels in his little hut. A few frames to easily explore an episode\u2019s worth of exposition, which can then be used to add elements to Popo\u2019s character without the need for spoken exposition.)\\n\\n\r\nI am strongly hesitant in calling AnoHana a melodrama. The constant hint of realism in both the visuals and characters suggest otherwise, as does the very real themes that it tries to convey. The anime obviously works very hard to provoke an emotional response and I wonder at times if it is trying a little too hard. Not a scene goes by without Yadomi frowning at something, and the prevalence (or rather excess), of falling tears in every episode almost screams at me: \u201cHere is an emotional scene, indicated by the tears. Feel sadness you sheep!\u201d The need for AnoHana to constantly use the act of crying to convey sorrow seems almost shortsighted, and while they are a good tool for reinforcing the emotional instability of the characters, they seem to serve little other purpose.\\n\\n\r\nAll this cumulatively leads to the biggest flaw of AnoHana: as an anime observing death and how people cope with it, there is shockingly little character development observed. What AnoHana tries to offer instead are single characters at two points in time. On one hand we have the happy-go-lucky childhood of the super-peace-busters, on the other we have the sullen, withdrawn adolescent individuals of those friends, drifting apart and trying to move on with their lives. At first sight it is amazingly easy to mistake this contrast of past and present for \u2018character development,\u2019 however true character development demands something a little more in-depth than, \u2018friend dies, people become sad.\u2019 Yukiatsu is arguably the only character who experiences true change, *spoiler alert* in his brief contact with Menma *spoiler alert* he experiences denial, confusion, jealousy and anger, and in doing so, realizing his self-loathing attitude and changing himself. Yadomi\u2019s development is also arguable, though I remain skeptic as to whether what seems to me as merely an overdue self realization can be categorized as development if it were there subconsciously all along. In comparison, the other characters, experienced only minimal changes, exchanging confessions and realization which, while heart-moving, can hardly be justified as \u2018development,\u2019 begging the question of whether there was any point to the whole thing other than being an emotional roller-coaster of adolescent diversions.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve managed to read this far and haven\u2019t yet \u2018unhelpful\u2019d\u2019 this review or thrown your mouse across the room in anger, then props to you, and perhaps you\u2019d like stay a bit longer and allow me to explain where all this nonsense is coming from.\\n\\n\r\nThe mindset of a critic is slightly different from that of an average viewer. We\u2019ve seen, considered and analyzed far more than what would be considered healthy for a normal human being and as a result, we view things a bit differently. Cliches and archetypes you\u2019ve seen maybe half a dozen times, we\u2019ve seen hundreds of times. We get bored quickly, we\u2019re more easily dismissive, we hone in on small mistakes like vultures, we\u2019re very excited by originality and we\u2019re far more disappointed when a promising series falls short just inches from the finish line.\\n\\n\r\nNine out of ten times, the things we watch are mediocre at best. Stuff that\u2019s so average that it takes all of our willpower just to struggle through a normal review; talk about some story, mutter about some character, drag on about some animation and call it a day. But then something like AnoHana comes along, something new, something exciting, something to sink our teeth into. We may end up enjoying it, we may not, but the fact that it had piqued our interest meant it had already established itself as something special, something good enough to be able to be improved upon in the future, something we WANT to spend time thinking about, something actually WORTH criticizing.\\n\\n\r\nThink of this review not as a \u201ceverything that was wrong with AnoHana\u201d review, but as a \u201cAnoHana was this close to being a true masterpiece, I found myself taking time out of my busy schedule to watch it twice and write up this critique, if only it had improved on these points, I might have given out my first ever 10/10\" review. In fact, consider this review a praise by exception, in that everything I DON'T mention is absolutely friggin' brilliant. That's a LOT of stuff.",

            "content": "\"Oh no, here come the tears!\"\r\nAnohana was a fantastic, emotional story of loss that struck all the right heart chords.  Anyone who has abruptly lost someone premature in their lives can relate to this series.  What it does, it does very good in fact... And I really started empathizing with the characters like I knew exactly what tragedy they had gone through.  All of the characters and their motives were believable, and it made for one enjoyable experience.\r\nAlthough Anohana only had 11 episodes to get it's point across, I had no problem understanding any part of the plot.  Six kids, inseparableit seemed were devastated when one of them was tragically killed in an accident. Now they all gather back several years later to attempt to send off the memory of one of their best friends by granting an eternal wish.  The exact details of Menma's death were never explained, but it was unneeded.  The writers did an incredible job of making that information irrelevant.  The subject was so sad to even talk about,  the characters all got fragile when they started talking about it.  \\n\\n\r\nI can't help but think the writer had some personal tie to a similar situation like had transpired in the series.  It seemed so gripping and personal to me.  Especially near the end, none of the characters wanted to let go of the memory they had of Menma, and often had trouble coming to terms with their own personal guilt.  I'll just say it takes a lot to make me cry, but at the end as the closing theme played, I lost it.  Incredible, original and emotional storyline.\\n\\n\r\nLike I previously stated, all of the characters in Anohana were believable... and it made the show that much better.  The main, Jintan struggled constantly between wanting to move on and wanting Menmas memory and love to stay with him forever.  He is obviously stricken by what had happened that day, and leads a very closed off life because of it.  However, Jintan opens up more and more as the show continues.  I love the growth he had even through such a short amount of time.\\n\\n\r\nPoppo reminds me a lot of myself.  He handles grief by putting on a \"everything is ok\" fa\u00e7ade, which the others mistake for him just being a goofy individual.  Deep down is more than likely a sad grieving man desperate to make amends with his regret from that day.  Yukiatsu kind of rubbed me the wrong way, but his character was still strong and understandably jealous of Jintan.  The only strange thing I thought about the characters were how they all filled in a strange love triangle of sorts.  I felt it was unnecessary to write in love interests of 10 year olds... And after years later their feelings were all still so strong.  A bit odd.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was very good in this series, but nothing buzzworthy.  I thought it was a little strange how they made Menma age, but still not quite as much as everyone else.  I'm not sure what the artists were going for here.  The opening was also alright, but didn't feel as as fitting as the ending song (which I felt was very good).  Especially how it was incorporated into some of the episode's conclusions.  \\n\\n\r\nI think it's safe to say that after all of the action animes I've seen recently, it was really nice to see Anohana.  Even with as blubbery as I was at the end, I felt it showcased the feeling of loss and grief to the best extent possible.  I would recommend this anime to just about anyone, especially those who enjoy heart-felt stories.  Loved it!",

            "content": "Ano Hana follows the flashbacks of six teenagers. Well, to be exact, five of them. \r\nHonma Meiko (Menma), Yadomi Jinta's childhood friend returns after many summers. Jinta, annoyed by her childish attitude, tries to ignore her with everything he's got. But Menma is so persisting, Jinta can't overlook her anymore.\r\nJinta, who has been an all energetic boy from his childhood now finds himself to be a lethargic teen, uninterested and unmotivated to absolutely everything, ignores people around him and a complete shut-in. As he merged himself to video games over the years, his grades dropped and couldn't even make it to a reputed high school.\r\nAnjoNaruko (Anaru), one of the six childhood friends has grown interest in make ups and dresses, like most of the teenage girls of her age. But she has become more distant and snaps pretty easily. She is not the all shy \"Anaru\" Jinta and Menma used to know anymore. \\n\\n\r\nMatsuyuki Atsumu (Yukiatsu) and Tsurumi Chiriko (Tsuruko) are different. They are now students of a very good high school. Both got themselves absorbed in school and are taking life more seriously as anyone should. But in the process, they have become distant too.\\n\\n\r\nHisakawa Tetsudo (Poppo), who was the smallest of the childhood friends, is a big guy now. He has grown interest in 'erotic' stuff, well, any teen of his age should be interested in stuff like that.\\n\\n\r\nWith everyone drifting apart from each other over the years, Menma is left with shock as she met her childhood friends after so many years. She thought everyone would remain the way they were during those colourful summer days. And now, she insists that everyone should get along just like before. A wish she has unfulfilled and wants Jinta to grant it for her. Just that, she has no idea that her childhood friends have all drifted apart because of none other than herself, ever since that day in a summer she left them. For all eternity.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being in its very first episode of an 'Anime-Original' story, Ano Hana caught me off guard as I wasn't expecting such a sad story to unfold. \\n\\n\r\nAs the name translates, \"We still don't know the name of the flower we saw that day,\" it is understandable after the first episode that the \"We\" is the five of them and the \"flower\" is Menma, their childhood friend who was the slowest of the lot, but was an inseparable member that kept them together. Only after she was gone, they realized it as their bond fell apart.\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning, I was kinda annoyed the way they started the anime thinking it will be yet another loli-chara anime. But it all made sense after I realized she is an existence made by Jinta's imagination, the Menma who died so young, that everything she does is nothing more than the shards of  memories Jinta has. She might have a physical appearance of a teenager, but everything about her remains exactly of the Menma Jinta got to know, making her the only one unchanged after so many summers have come and gone. But is she really an existence made by Jinta's imagination? Her existence around Jinta is so profound, that I was unable to tell.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so brilliantly portrayed in the very first episode, you can already tell them apart. You can already see their inside like a mirror. Despite all of them showing they have moved on since that summer day, their facial expressions say otherwise. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is so nicely paced and gently told with flashbacks and fond memories, I don't see places where it might improve to get your attention, yes, it is that good. Noitamina at their very best.\\n\\n\r\nThe character animation style is nice. Exactly like Toradora. The background is very detailed and it is one of those shows you wanna see in glorious 720p resolution at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are nice and the lyrics go wonderfully well with the storyline so far.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of nice slice-of-life anime or in general, looking for a very good anime, then this should be your auto-pick of the spring season. Ano Hana left me with an impression powerful enough to make me write a review just after completing episode 1.",

            "content": "I've heard of depressing animes being \"stupid shit\", because feelings and emotions are such \"garbage\". No, I disagree. If pulled off with realistic character psychology, such \"depressing animes\" may teach a viewer a lesson. Any anime can teach a viewer a lesson.\r\nSo, why do we care about AnoHana? Simply, because of death's inevitability. AnoHana portrays different ways in which people cope with a death, whether through blaming oneself, becoming a shut-in, or obsessively buying anything in relation with the deceased one. These examples presented by AnoHana helps us delve deep into characters.\r\n\"Jintan\" has the core of a leader, but Menma's death has made him ashut-in, as it is his way of coping. However, he shows leadership in several parts throughout the 5 episodes, but he's just unsure of his ability to lead after Menma's death. He acts as a leader that had just been defeated. On the outside, he looks like a messed up person. However, he is dependable because he is true to himself.\\n\\n\r\n\"Anaru\" is a dependent person, struggling to fit in with society and reaching conformity. Little does she realize that the path she is going down does not lead to happiness, because she is preventing herself from expression and self-freedom. She actually like games and being at home, but she decided to stop doing that because it doesn't help her reach \"normality\". According through direct dialogue, it is said she is easily influenced by others. I agree, because the concept of \"normality\" is created by others.\\n\\n\r\n\"Yukiatsu\" is the most messed up dude in this show. On the outside, he is a charming honors student that seems to have a great future. However, his unstable core depends on either a person and/or a dream. For example, his dream of being with Menma is ruined by her death. Now he couldn't depend on anything in regards to that situation. He fell apart. But he creates a facade of a responsible and dependent guy so he won't be looked down upon. \\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty more characters a viewer would get to know.\\n\\n\r\nThat message I'm getting from this show is that when somebody dies, or anything bad happens, breathe in, accept the fact, swallow it, maybe cry, breathe out, and keep living.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, the art is brilliant...\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is brilliant...\\n\\n\r\nAnd I enjoy it a lot, except for the beginning. Sure, maybe to hook the nasty people out there. But oh well, it's a great show with deep characters, and has a message. Why should one watch this show? What is the purpose?\\n\\n\r\nMy guess, it's to deliver a message saying: Let's not forget the dead, but let's not obsess over it, either.",

            "content": "What do you do, when you suddenly see a ghost of a person that you were close to? Most people would think it's just their imagination or the effect of stress. But what if your mind doesn't play tricks on you and you really encounter a ghost from the past? AnoHana plays with this idea. The story starts out on a usual day for the shut-in Jinta, who suddenly sees the ghost of his childhood friend Menma. Menma tells Jinta she has a wish that she wants to be granted by him. And from here on, Jinta's unusual summer starts.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story itself centers around thesix members of the Super Peace Busters, which was seemingly disbanded after the death of one their members. At first you'd expect that the story revolves around Menma and her wish but the truth is, the story tries to center around the members' lives and the way they were affected by the death of their friend and the show does a sloppy job with that. Of course true friends wouldn't leave each other in times of need. So why were the Super Peace Busters disbanded? Obviously there are more reasons behind that than the death of their friend.\\n\r\nI personally thought that story would be a coming-of-age story, where the characters deal with the problems of becoming adults and finally dealing with the death of their beloved friend. And boy was I wrong. Instead, the show turned out to be a love story pretty soon and the romance became the major driving force of the entire show. The mystery behind Menma's wish didn't unfold until the last episode and tension has been lifted so suddenly, at first I didn't know how it happened. The story itself moved forward pretty slowly, until the last 3 episodes, where the pace suddenly changed and everything was wrapped rather quickly up in one final episode. Not to mention many questions were left open and many were left unexplained.\\n\r\nThe first 4 or 5 episodes were very promising, but after them, the plot went down the drain pretty soon and was dragged out for too long. I think the story could have been told in roughly 6 episodes, and then we could have been spared of all those unnecessary scenes that were dealing with the love polygon between the characters. It's a pity that they wasted 11 episodes on a story that was worth roughly 6 episodes.\\n\r\nThe reason why AnoHana became popular is the romance and the fact that you could ship many characters together. Most of the characters rethink their relations to the others and since the cast is half male half female, it is inevitable that some of them play with the thought of starting a relationship with someone other from the Super Peace busters.\\n\r\nThe plot wasn't really planned out from the start and it seemed the writer didn't know what to do with the 11 episodes he or she got, the pacing of the story made this obvious. This problem affects most of the original anime shows and AnoHana wasn't an exception either.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOne of the major strong-points of the show. The animation is consistent, the backgrounds are well drawn. This is no wonder, since the anime was originally meant to attract tourists to Chichibu city and I think that AnoHana managed to capture the beauty of the region pretty well and reached its goal with this.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe background music fits in the show perfectly, it was very well done. The opening and ending songs are very catchy and perhaps they are the best of the season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere are 6 main characters in the story. The creators could have used 6 episodes to explore their backgrounds and the nature of their problems, but the show wasn't able to do this either. I would have really liked if we could have gotten more info about Chiriko and Poppo too, since they were as important as the other four. The characters aren't any special and there is little to no character development throughout the story.  Not to mention everyone is emotionally so unstable, that they can break into crying every now and then. This became very annoying especially in the last two episodes. The conflicts between them feel over-exaggerated most of the time and everyone runs in circles until the very last episode. But the execution of the last episode was so terrible, I can even tell the exact moment when all the problems are suddenly solved. The character interactions are melodramatic and take everything to the extreme. As I was telling earlier I was expecting a coming-of-age show, so I thought maybe the characters were going to discuss their problems and try to find a solution to them, but all the cast was doing was crying and complaining about their issues throughout the story and they didn't even care about the things the others were saying. Without analyzing characters I must say, that they weren't original, the show just managed to re-use some common and popular character archetypes. They are rather easy to forget.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis show makes a perfect job on summoning emotions from the viewers and fills the holes of the plot with the tears of the viewer. It started out as a promising drama but failed to live up to its high expectations. But this might be a good start if you're unfamiliar to dramas, because AnoHana heavily relies on the sympathy that you feel towards the characters and takes you on an emotional rollercoaster and sucks you in to the story easily. If you had experiences with dramas before, I suggest you skip the show, because it\u2019s forgettable and has many flaws that might disturb you and the rushed ending basically ruins the tension that has been building up since the beginning. Overall I say that AnoHana is a mediocre show, that had potential, but failed to exploit it, but despite this it became very popular. If you like shipping in general and crying over love stories, AnoHana is the anime for you.",

I was going to sum this up in one word, but I realized that no single word in the English language does this piece justice. \r\n  Since if you're looking at this page, I'll assume that you will have some idea of what the story is about, and that you're into this genre. In that case, to make it short, this is absolutely worth watching.Having only watched the first episode, I find this show quite promising. In fact, I can honestly say that it is the best first episode I've ever seen. Even masterpieces such as clannad and elfen lied did not contain so much emotions in one episode. This first episode is at least as good as the first episode of five centimeters per second, and considering that it's a whole series and not a movie or OVA, that is quite impressive.\\n\\n\r\n  I know a couple of people who are not used to this kid of a character design, but if you're one of those people, you'll get used to it, and the background is quite good. \\n\\n\r\n  My only concern, is that such an impressive first episode might bring too much of an expectation for a great ending, which seems quite hard considering how fast paced the first episode is. I hope this series doesn't lag on for 20+ episodes, it doesn't seem to have enough material to fill in that much. If this series nails the ending at say 12 episodes, it may just become my all time favorite, and one of the best animes of all time.",

            "content": "I don't often follow currently airing shows. It's usually hard to tell which shows are genuinely good until the hype dies down a bit. But under intense peer pressure, I started following a certain series this season. That show is \"Deadman Wonderland\". To cut a long story short, it sucked. So to deal with the disappointment I decided to follow another series, the sleeper hit \"Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai\", which apparently translates roughly to \"We Still Don't Know the Name of That Flower We Were Smoking When We Came Up With This Title\". Something like that. With atitle that long, no wonder everyone just calls it \"AnoHana\" instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I chose AnoHana is because while everyone around me was talking about \"Deadman Wonderland\" and \"C\" before the season began, those talk quickly became dominated by AnoHana soon after the season got under way. And as the show also looked like a drama that isn't bursting with moe juices, I honestly thought it was going to be awesome.\\n\\n\r\n...but it's not.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is not to say it's a bad, or even mediocre series, but while I definitely think the positives outweigh the negatives, I certainly don't think Ano Hana is a show that deserves all the praise it's been garnering.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, let me get something off my chest: having recently been annoyed by the spontaneously violent, clingy, cheesily cheerful, hyperactive white haired girl Shiro from \"Deadman Wonderland\", I was dismayed to find a clingy, cheesily cheerful, hyperactive white haired girl in AnoHana too. If you extracted everything that's annoying from Shiro and put it into a new character, you would essentially end up with Menma from AnoHana.\\n\\n\r\nAnd unfortunately, Menma is one of main characters of the series. In short, AnoHana is about this exceedingly annoying ghost girl Menma returning to the world to make her childhood friends' lives miserable.\\n\\n\r\nOk ok, I jest - it was only me she made miserable... her friends were already miserable to begin with, and her re-appearance just brings their problems into focus. These group of friends, who collectively called themselves the \"Super Peace Busters\", had drifted apart after the unfortunate accident involving Menma that left them all mentally scarred in one way or another. But her return succeeds in bringing them back together again, and in doing so opens up the old wounds that never really healed. \\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, I should mention that there're a couple of catches in the set up. The first one is that only one of Menma's childhood friend can see her - and that's the main character Jinta (but this gets a satisfactory explanation). The other catch is that she apparently returns in order to get her wish granted... except she can't remember what it is (which smells like a bullsh*t plot device to me), and so they spend the series going on wild goose chases in order to make this unknown wish come true and thus help Menma achieve nirvana.\\n\\n\r\nThis second catch helps to illustrate one of main issues I have with the series - though the concept itself is promising, the story is over reliant on convenient plot devices. In the short space of 11 episodes, I counted at least four or five major plot devices being used to keep the story on its intended track, resulting in some quite exasperatingly un-natural plot progression, not to mention some massive plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem I have with AnoHana is its melodrama. It may not have it by the bucketload, but it does have it in spades. The \"Super Peace Busters\" sure live up to their name, as whenever they come together, the peace is bound to be busted at some point. The dialogue and character interactions would often take up baffling turns that inevitably lead to lots of confrontations, angst and tears. I guess if you try hard enough, you can come up with reasons for why a character say this and does that etc, but at the end of the day, the way it all comes together just doesn't feel quite right to me. I can often feel the tug of melodrama taking the flow of conversations etc off their natural course.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana's habit of overcooking promising drama into melodrama gives me the impression that the makers are a little insecure about the potential of AnoHana to move people, and so felt like they had to work it harder in order to cement its idenity as an emotional drama. But the thing is, I feel AnoHana a show with enough good material and interesting ideas that it doesn't NEED the melodrama to make it tick. A good example of this is during final episode, when the realisation regarding Menma's situation dawned on her friends. In all honesty, it was a great moment, perhaps the best one in the entire series... and then the girls started screeching and grappling at each other and completely ruined the mood. What the hell were the makers thinking??\\n\\n\r\nBut while I was complaining to my friends about my disappointments regarding this series (as well as this overrated experience of following currently airing anime), I was struck by a sudden realisation: in spite of its shortcomings, I really WANTED to like AnoHana, and kept desperately hoping the show would get it right. It's a striking contrast to \"Deadman Wonderland\" where I couldn't care less what happens. Despite AnoHana's frequent heavy handling of drama, there's a sincerity about what it's is trying to achieve. Also, being a nostalgic person, the strong sense of melancholy about the show really speaks to me. The bittersweet joys of getting together with old friends and briefly re-living the carefree days of childhood, the aching sense of loss as you realise things can never quite be the same again... these are all feelings that the show manages to convey very successfully.\\n\\n\r\nThe role that the background music plays in creating the poignant moments in AnoHana cannot be underestimated. While the show itself can be accused of trying too hard at times, the same accusation certainly cannot be levelled at the music. Simple, and yet quietly evocative, it barely put a foot wrong throughout the series. In fact it's hard to fault the music in AnoHana at all - the opening and ending themes are both very solid songs, which is quite rare in anime as at least one of them is a dud normally.\\n\\n\r\nGiven everything AnoHana has going for it, it's a real pity that it isn't a lot better. Perhaps, given the length of the series, the makers made the decision to rely heavily on contrived plot devices in order to keep things moving along, and on melodrama as a shorcut to character development. But some things are not meant to be hurried, especially when some of the problems the characters have are quite bizarre, and the hurried execution just made them seem more random than anything else. However, it is a show that deserves some credit for its good intentions and powerful ideas. In some respects it reminds me of \"Cross Game\", as the two shows have some overlapping themes, particularly in the early episodes of AnoHana. \"Cross Game\" though, does it so much better.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, this whole following currently airing show thing has proved to be quite a disappointing experience. Don't think I'll be doing it again in a hurry (unless I succumb to peer pressure again). On the plus side, finishing a show so soon after it airs did briefly make me feel like I was down with the kids for once...",

            "content": "In this review I will defend the claim that \"Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai\" is an absolutely terrible show.  It is well known that this show get's a lot of positive attention.  At the time of this write-up, it is currently ranked 42nd on the site overall (or, if the site had good programmers, 39th since Gintama 2015, Unlimited Bladeworks season 2, and One Punch Man are above it and have not even aired any episodes), with a weighted score of 8.70.  It is often discussed in forums as being a tear jerker.  Indeed, therewere points where I simply couldn't stop the tears of laughter from flowing down my face.  This is a spoiler-filled review.\\n\\n\r\nAno Hana begins with a boy (Jinta) hanging around a house.  There is an immature, white-haired girl pestering him.  It turns out that she is the ghost of a girl who died in an accident ten years ago. Her name is Menma, and she has come back to earth to fulfill her wish, just as soon as they find out what it was that she was wishing for. His father's non-reaction to Menma's antics, and a visit from Jinta's friend (Naruko Anjou) suggests that only he can see her, but that she can physically affect things.  In other words, the only element of her non-corporeality is that she is invisible and cannot project her voice.  She is in no other way a non-corporeal entity, and is LITERALLY just a normal human, except not visible to anybody but Jinta.  She can pick things up, and she can eat things, and when she jumps on Naruko her weight is felt.  \\n\\n\r\nMenma is portrayed as a very sweet, wonderful little girl.  Ignoring nitpicky aspects about how annoying she is, let us examine the larger picture.  She is haunting a childhood friend until he spends copious amounts of energy fulfilling her unknown wish.  To me, this negates any \"cuteness\" she may possess and makes her a menacing turd.\\n\\n\r\nThe above was merely a subjective issue I had with the show.  Now, let's get to the biggest objective issue that I have already alluded to earlier: the fact that Jinta can prove his assertions to everybody, literally, by handing Menma any object whatsoever and pointing out the levitating object.  In fact, you could show that it's Menma, and not some other supernatural entity, by draping anything over her body that would reveal the shape of her body.  You could even splatter her with mud or paint and you could basically be able to see her just walking around.  This is a huge issue because he doesn't do this for the vast majority of the show, and the vast majority of the melodrama can be traced to this plot point.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot point starts off as a background thing that could more or less be rationalized away in the first few episodes.  Perhaps she cannot do physical things unless Jinta is around, but that's not true because of the scene where she jumps on Naruko and her weight is felt.  Perhaps she is limited in some other way.  Maybe the things that she touches and cooks are also only visible to Jinta.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show transitions into it's middle section, these rationalizations become more and more difficult to contrive.  It would be one thing if this didn't affect the character interaction very much, but nearly every tension and grievance can be traced back to the fact that Jinta cannot muster up the 2nd grade level brainpower required to prove Menma's existence.  The entire time, I was assuming there was some technicality, but situation after situation confirmed that Menma can just move stuff around at will, as she demonstrates by opening a door (and everybody in the room noticing), knocking stuff off of tables, other people feeling her weight when she jumps on them, and her moving a light and then everybody remarking how the wind couldn't have possibly done it.  There is even a sequence where Menma tries to communicate with people and is actually able to place phone calls (but her voice messages aren't there since only Jinta can hear her voice).  Meanwhile, the old friend group has a long stick up their collective asses about whether Jinta is just outright lying, and large amounts of time are devoted to melodrama derived from this.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several times where Menma is in the room with Jinta, reminiscing with somebody else about the wish situation.   Hey... hey idiot... just hand her a thing... hand her literally anything... hey... you can remove all doubt by picking up those chopsticks over there, and then saying \"hold this\"... you can immediately resolve half of the plot... right now.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, you're still holding out hope that the show will ignore it and you have to come up with your own rationalization for it, or that the show will explicate some as yet hidden concrete reason as to why Jinta cannot provide evidence for his claims.  Nope.  The worst possible thing happens: he finally has her just hold objects to prove his claim.  In episode 9.  They even try to rationalize it away by using a character to conjecture that Jinta wanted Menma to himself.  Then what was the point of his endless pleading for the group to just believe him in the prior episodes?  Essentially, the resolution of this simple plot hole takes six of the eleven episodes.  I say six because it is not a central plot point in the first two episodes, whereupon it then becomes important, and then isn't resolved until the 9th episode of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nLet's get to the second worst aspect of the show: the characters.  We have already shown that Jinta and Menma are terrible characters.  We also know that the average IQ of the entire friend group hovers around 40 by dint of their inability to devise any experiments demonstrating the existence of a ghost that can be seen and interacted with by one person and can move physical bodies like a normal person.  Moving away from the plot hole (which by itself ruins the entire show) the dynamic between the characters in the group (which is called the 'Super Peace Busters' or SPB) is as follows: two of the males are in love with Menma (Jinta and Matsuyuki), one (Hisakawa) is just a chill dude and the only one to suggest that Menma could just hold something, and the two remaining girls are left wondering why two males are still in love with a girl who died when they where about 5 years old.  However, this doesn't stop them from wanting to date them.  \\n\\n\r\nA prominent theme in the show is the guilt that all of them feel about the circumstances of their group the day that Menma died.  Jinta is a broken human because he defensively argued against accusations of a crush and called Menma ugly, just like every 5 year old on the planet.  Matsuyuki is still intensely in love with Menma.  In fact, he keeps a broom with a white wig in his closet and frequently takes it out to sniff it; and then runs out in the woods in a cross-dressing cosplay of Menma for multiple consecutive nights.  The last two sentences were not a hyperbole or a joke.  Hisakawa is the best character, the only one who suggests any way of proving Menma is there prior to episode 9, and the only one whose past (actually seeing Menma get carried down the river and drowned) actually warrants the amount of sadness he exhibits (and he is still less sad than the other group members by orders of magnitude).  Anjou has a crush on Jinta, and Tsurumi has a crush on the cross-dressing creep.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot hole and terrible characters make the melodrama hard to care about, and it's poorly executed anyways.  The show doesn't actually show you anything sad.  Instead, it has characters cry so that they can beat you over the head with a metaphorical hammer that says \"ITS SAD, WE SWEAR! CRY RIGHT NOW!\".  You can feel the writers using the crying characters because you don't actually feel sad: you have to be told that something is sad.  Nearly every scene in the entire show is melodramatic, which means that the characters only speak in lines that are emotional jabs at one another.  At virtually no point do we see more than one consecutive minute of logical, level-headed discussion.  Nearly every scene of the last three episodes is insufferably overdramatic, and by the end of the series everybody is bawling all the time and screaming out their feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first ever review.  Why did I decide to write this review?  I chose to write this review for one main reason: it is the most divergent my opinion has ever been from general consensus about the quality of a show. I am in no way the type of person who diverges on opinion for the sake of divergence.  In my opinion, if a show is in the top 100 on MAL, it is probably a very enjoyable show.  I also believe that shows with higher ratings are generally better than shows with lower ratings.  Popular anime is probably popular because it has good elements in it. I was genuinely shocked at the appalling quality of this anime and cannot possibly see why everybody would think that it's even watchable, let alone near perfect or perfect.  The only saving grace was the better than average animation, which prevented it from being a 1.",

            "content": "Updated in response to Uriel1988 1/01/2012 Happy New Years!\r\n[Hello,\r\nHaving just read your review on Anohana, I'm truly saddened to see you didn't enjoy it, at the very least you didn't buy into any of the hype. But more on that later, the main issue I would like to point out is that I don't agree with you on a couple fine points. First off, the series sets no lofty goals, it's flawed with execution errors and plot holes undoubtedly, but its base method in itself is its simplicity. Like you stated, it's a story of loss in a form of a \"ghost story\". I don'tsee it as a profound series at all, in fact, it often lacks in presenting a serious tone. However, for someone who can step into the characters' mindset, the technicality and surface value of the anime is rendered forgivable, reason falls apart in the face of emotions. And I believe it's not fair to only judge it from your eyes. Especially when you claim most people in real life eventually forget about such a \"loss\" as day-to-day routines and just life in general forces us to forget. Which normally I would more then agree with you on, we see it happen all the time e.g the death of a relative/loved one or the shock of a sudden  undue revelation. However, keep in mind these are indeed kids you're talking about. And no matter how you argue, children are at their most vulnerable age, they soak in every detail and every event influences their personality. From my personal experiences and working with many mentally challenged individuals, I can tell you it's no small thing to have someone/ something you love taken away, especially with all the implications of painful realism, forcing decisions upon unanswered questions. Without a doubt all individuals react differently and I can't say such a generalization of yours can be made. And additionally, I don't believe that all the characters' inability/ or at least difficulty of moving on is hinged on the fact of how \"perfect/wonderful\" Menma really was. Think of it in a child's perspective instead of an adults'. And add that to the fact of how her death marked the end of innocence for all those involved and the beginning of regret, so many words left unspoken, the true manifestation of loss/grief with no way to set things right. Then tell me if it's simply normal to walk away, that might be the case in today's modernized western world but it's not within the culture of the Japanese. They don't blot out the deaths of cherished family/friends, but instead pay their respects to something that clearly defines what they are to that day. That being said, I clearly understand your position on this anime but am having difficulty just accepting it, I loved this anime not for what it is but what it provided me as a medium, the joys of adolescent friendship preserved, the remembrance of certain things I thought had left me, rediscovering elements I've clearly needed to think more upon.]\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Review:\\n\\n\r\nIf you're reading this, it means you have no life.\\n\\n\r\nRead on if you dare... All jokes aside, if it takes you this many positive reviews and what-not just to convince you to pick this series up, then I have no words to say.\\n\\n\r\n*But, however, if you're like me and like to read over some of the reviews of your favorite anime then proceed. (Warning: I'll be including as little plot summary as possible.)\\n\\n\r\nAfter the completion of this work of art (Yes, in my opinion it's that great) there's only one phrase I could write.\\n\\n\r\n\"This anime defines the reason why I watch anime.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo much so that I didn't even bother writing a cliched philosophical statement regarding this work's main theme and/or problem. \\n\r\nFor those who ignored my first statement and still wish to continue -It's best to go in with no expectations and no prior knowledge of the plot... It'll make it even more amazing. If that's possible.- \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, after deciding to place this among the top of my \"planned-to-watch\" list I had very high expectations and was ready to judge harshly if necessary. I can be a cruel sadistic bastard when it comes to something that I find dry and overly lacking in innovation. However... even I'm surprised at how badly I contracted brain damage. I went in with my many preconceived notions (Is this just another tragedy?) and cognitive biases (If it's repetitive material then I'm going to hate) (My friends are probably up to their usual \"Freak of the moment\" rants).\\n\\n\r\nThe end result? I was still absolutely floored.\\n\\n\r\nNow time to analyze:\\n\\n\r\nIs it original? Perhaps, but it still had many of the elements found in other less-than-original-anime. And what are those? The setting for one. Childhood friends centering around a memory-ridden landmark. Slight plot-holes due to the rapid transformation of adolescence characters into adulthood. Transition was done quite well and even the middle episodes were quite interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nIs it life-changing? Few works are. But this one could perhaps edge out one or two of the masterpieces. Although there's only 11 episodes there's more than one pivot point in the anime where raw tendrils of earth-shattering thought are summoned from even the dullest of minds. (No offense, I don't mean dull. Just dense in the metaphysical criteria) You feel this sort of fire and restlessness from a simple scene. There is definitely power in Anohana to be witnessed.\\n\\n\r\nIs it emotionally provoking? Sometimes, but there is also a smooth liquid quality to most of the story. The beginning started strong. I was immediately hooked. You sort of get used to the quality of the scenes. It becomes mentally harder and harder to draw yourself away from each and every little detail.\\n\\n\r\nIs it informative? Critical issues are addressed but this is not one of those slice-of-life portraits. But if you mean informative in terms of sheer joy and gratification you'll be hard pressed to find another that is both serious and light. \\n\\n\r\nWhy exactly is this anime so damned good?\\n\\n\r\nI guess it all goes back to the holistic representation + the sum of all its parts. The message is almost starkly dismally hopeful, pardon the oxymoron. You dream of life for the characters but at the same time you are sad because of the result. The story-line is balanced and well construed. There are almost no fillers of any kind and almost each little conversation and flashback plays a paramount position in the overall work. The music made starting each episode easier, as well as giving one of those joy-rides upon the completion of each sequence. The characters are quite realistic and not your typical stereotypes; They are also designed well with actual capacities for growth. \\n\\n\r\nHowever...\\n\r\nFor me at least, those were just the key points of a good anime. Not a great anime. So why did I just give it a score of 10 overall? \\n\\n\r\nAlong with many other titles I enjoy there is a goal the main characters hope to achieve. And just like those titles there should be a pleasing story that usually runs smooth while finishing the conclusion with a bang. But what sets Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokuachi wa Mada Shiranai apart, asides from it's slightly long name, is a thoroughly different approach to a traditional method. It's this style that makes Anohana so enjoyable. But how is this possible? What possible ploys and techniques from the usual suspect directors have we not seen? A profound sense of loss? Death and an unavoidable universal subject matter? A basis on a belief of afterlife and reincarnation? Psychological dilemmas and love triangles? Of course not. The truth is by the time most of us get to watching Anohana, we would have witnessed some of these more than just a couple of times. \\n\\n\r\nBy now you are probably a little tired of the reviewer for avoiding the point. Here's where you skeptics ask \"Yes, I reckon it's a good anime but why should I drop what I'm doing and give it a try?\"\\n\r\nMore than one person has already suspected this review is another one of those multi-section circular breakdowns which is a practice in the art of saying nothing. But it's missing a few things.\\n\r\n1.) Where's the statement of undying loyalty? \\n\r\nor\\n\r\n2.) Where's the \"It was damn good but I'm too cool to admit it because I'm the reviewer so I'll just pretend I didn't love this anime so much that I apparently wasted my time writing a review\". \\n\\n\r\nAnd if you didn't understand what I just wrote up there then look down.\\n\\n\r\nQuestions have arisen. Such as: I understand Anohana is probably amazing but how come you haven't explain it properly yet in your own terms? What are you exactly saying and where's that ground-breaking theory of yours at? Why should I waste my time reading this kind of wishy-washy overly florid review? (aka when I could just STARE AT THE NEXT REVIEW DOWN and read me a complete plot-based thriller or a fan's praise-fest) The answer? I don't know. At this time of writing this review I still have no idea. Ha, you think If I knew I wouldn't tell you? Probably. But once I know I'll most likely share. Until then, I'll try to abstain from writing at 3 in the morning, even if it's about my favorite anime. It would also be good if I didn't fret so much if I was being too sarcastic. \\n\r\nRest assured I loved this anime and you should too unless you didn't get past my first statement in which case...\\n\\n",

            "content": "Death of a close friend is always difficult to deal with, mainly because it always comes when you least expect it. It is especially hard to portray it accurately in any medium, let alone anime. When I first heard of Anohana, I was expecting a beautiful story about a group of friends coming to accept the death of their beloved friend and eventually becoming better people. I was sorely mistaken. Anohana is a travesty of writing and I have no idea why this deserved any praise whatsoever.\r\nStory- My first issue is, that Anohana is OVERLY melodramatic. The first couple episodes had me hooked to thecomputer screen, they gave me hope of seeing a great show but sadly I was wrong. Every episode after that is basically a crying contest. In all of the upcoming episodes, a different character breaks down in tears to get an emotional rise out of the viewer. This is not only laughable, but it boils down to poor writing and obvious emotional manipulation.\\n\\n\r\nMy second issue is the ghost herself, Menma. Menma is the star of the show, every character in the show loved her and never got over her death. I assume she was supposed to be a plot device to facilitate the development of the other characters, but this never happened at all. Instead of the characters reflecting upon themselves, we got a group of morons crying over a ghost without addressing their own problems. Wasn't that the point of the story? Moving on and becoming better people? I guess not.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is that many episodes are wasted on trying to prove Menma exists. In the first episode, Menma herself is a semi-corporeal being able to move objects around. Jinta ignored this fact and continued to think that she still didn't exist, despite objects moving around the room. This takes time away from the much needed development of character.\\n\\n\r\nMy last issue is the ending itself. Not only was it horribly executed, but none of the character's problems resolved. People were misled into thinking this was a great ending because everyone was crying and Menma, \"moved on,\" but ultimately everyone basically remained the same aside from a few minor changes. \\n\\n\r\nArt- The artstyle was pretty nice, a lot of vibrant colors and scenic backgrounds. Nothing to complain about here.\\n\\n\r\nSound- I only liked the ED, \"Secret Base~Ten years later,\" it was a very catchy and sweet song. Such a shame that the song was wasted on a horrible show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- In a show like this, the characters are arguably the most important aspect. This, however, is where the writers failed once again. The cast of this show is so unlikeable and idiotic that they failed to get any emotional reaction out of me. First we have Jinta, an NEET/social recluse who never recovered from Menma's death. He is the main protagonist of the show and a poor one at that. Jinta is so oblivious to the feelings of others that it becomes irritating just to watch him on the screen. Menma, as mentioned previously, is a moeblob with the personality of a doormat. Her one and only flaw is caring too much about other people? Isn't this supposed to be a slice of life? Aren't people supposed to have multiple flaws as opposed to just one that can't really be considered one? \\n\\n\r\nToo summarize this all up, basically we have a group of unlikeable nitwits who cry a lot, are selfish, and cross-dress. Now this wouldn't be a problem if they became better people but they never did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Anohana gets a 4/10 from me. To me, this is the most overrated show on Myanimelist. Maybe it is because people are suckers for people crying. In all honesty, that is all the show is, just a bunch of losers crying over a dead girl and never getting over it. Am I cold for saying this? Not at all. Many shows have done drama right EX: Kanon(2006) Clannad, Rumbling Hearts etc. and Anohana isn't one of them. I implore everyone who is going to watch this show to look at it with open eyes, do not be misled by the buckets of tears you are bound to see. The show has a poorly mis-managed plot, bad writing and terrible characters. I would not recommend anyone watch this.",

            "content": "After finishing Anohana, I could only think of one thing.\r\n\"So what's the point?\"\r\nThere are many positive things to say about Anohana. Its opening is well designed, featuring the characters in their past and present forms as well as hinting at their emotional problems. The theme (\"Aoi Shiori\") is not only a great song by itself, but also well fitting with the show's melancholic tone. Its ending is similarly well made, and it is sung by some of the voice actors of the cast.  \r\nThe animation/art is amazing. It is fluid and never drops in quality.\r\nThe show also does a pretty good at demonstrating characterinteraction (for the most part). It's meant to be awkward and unpleasant, given the long period of time the characters went without talking to each another after the death of Menma. And, I do think the characters feel realistic (with some exceptions). They are all deeply flawed and selfish people, which is OK. In fact, it is very refreshing to see this in anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe issue is they don't ever develop from their mistakes, or hell, develop at all. In fact, it's very debatable whether or not most of them see what they did wrong in the first place. The show doesn't go into them actually becoming better human beings. They end up basically the same as they started, only able to slightly accept that Menma is indeed dead. There's no catharsis, no growth. The only thing you get at the end of the series is screaming and crying for the sake of it. So what the hell was the entire point of the confessions, the crying, Menma coming back as a ghost- everything? Was the entire point of the show \"Haha these people are really bad human beings\"?\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is only made worse with the copious amount of melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'll be the first one to say people overuse the term \"melodrama\". Under stress, or when angered, humans will act in very irrational ways. This is natural. But Jesus Christ, the characters can just put a damn blanket on Menma and 9/10 of the drama could be solved. Jinta genuinely can't figure out a way to prove the ghost's existence. Please, Jinta, make her hold something. Anything. The object will appear to be floating. She's pretty much an invisible person. Hell, just put some paint on her and none of the characters will ever have a difficult time figuring out where the hell she is. It is insane how severely lacking the characters' mental faculties are, and it's genuinely distracting. This wouldn't be that bad by itself, except for the fact that many plot points revolve around Jinta being unable to prove the damn ghost's existence. The characters argue vehemently about whether or not she exists, even accusing Jinta of being a liar rather than assume he's hallucinating. This goes on for almost half the show, and it is extremely stupid. Eventually, the show devolves into the characters crying hysterically together and yelling about fucking nothing for most of the screen time. It's almost as if the show is holding audience cue cards, where the show tells you you're supposed to feel emotion when the characters bawl their eyes out.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, some of the characters' emotional hurdles are very unbelievable. Although I did say the characters are realistic, I say that with a grain of salt. Yukiatsu, for one, is god damn insane for little reason. He dresses up as Menma and obsesses over her, hopelessly in love with what is a walking loli moeblob. It was a childhood crush- they were 5 years old when Menma died, it's been literally over a decade. There's just no way he could still have that amount of feelings for her. It's hard to take his character seriously, which is detrimental to a drama like Anohana. His character is there just to add more drama, and he never contributes anything.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of not being able to take things seriously, it was difficult for me to empathize with the characters, mostly because the \"tragic\" event of Menma's death is pretty much just alluded to. It takes very little screen time actually developing this extremely important event. I genuinely wonder why this show didn't start with their childhood, featuring their reactions to Menma's death, with the rest of the series as a time skip showing with their hatred for one another, their eventual acknowledgement, and finally their realization/redemption. It would make a lot more sense, and the events would have more of an impact on the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Anohana is a melodrama that has way too many things wrong with it for me to give it a positive score. Certainly, I am in the minority when I say this, as at the time of writing the show has an 8.52 on MAL. However, I want to make it clear that I am not being contrarian for the sake of it. There are plenty of popular, highly rated shows I love (my favorites include Ghibli movies, Monogatari, and Jojo), but this show just didn't do it for me. For reasons mentioned in the review, I cannot recommend Anohana to anyone. If you are looking for a coming-of-age story, I suggest you to watch Ping Pong the Animation or Nagi no Asukara, and for manga, read Onanie Master Kurosawa or if you love action, Vinland Saga. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 2 (dreadful presentation of the story events, combined with the massive plothole of being unable to prove menmas existence makes it the lowest category, good concept for a coming-of-age tale though)\\n\r\nArt: 8 (what you would expect from A-1 Pictures)\\n\r\nSound: 9 (exceptional op/ed, bgs were fine too)\\n\r\nCharacter: 3 (tons of potential for these characters, but 0 development and little reason to empathize with them)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4 (the excessive crying and yelling in the second half was quite annoying, but the first few episodes were pretty entertaining)\\n\r\nOverall: 3 (I believe art and sound are not enough to save this show)\\n\\n\r\nPlease leave a comment letting me know if you have a criticism of my review. Feedback would be great.",

I saw a lot of posts about this on tumblr so I decided to give it a try. \r\nStory:\r\nI really liked this story. Well, the story wasn't exactly out there but it was still very interesting and I was able to watch episode after episode eagerly. The cliff hanger endings were great and I've already rewatched the whole series. The story was great!\r\nArt:\r\nThe art was indeed outstanding! The characterswere all different and easy to tell apart and they each had an appropriate set of outfits (except Menma of course). I had no problems with the art. In fact I was extremely impressed. The animation was great too. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAll the voice actors did a great job and I really love the sound track. A cry manly tears when I listen to 'Last Train Home'. The voice actor who played Anaru did superb! So much emotion! I was really impressed!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nVery interesting... I found it kind of odd, coz well, Menma died when she was a kid. She has grown like everyone else but... she still thinks like a kid. Isn't that a little awkward, I mean there seems to be something going on between her and Jintan but how is that okay, when she's still emotionally a kid? Menma's character was okay. She really was a bother to me though. All the other mains were very interesting and unique. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot! I felt like crying in every episode (welll almost every). It's definitely one of my favourites! Unforgettable anime!\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this anime to shoujo fans and people who like a good tear jerker. I want to rewatch this anime..",

            "content": "Ano Hana is quite mediocre when it comes to acquiring good themes from it. The characters are hard to relate to because their problems are extreme and unrealistic. For the love of God it is a girl they knew back in grade school, get over it already... The amount of drama is too much, real people adapt the the death of family members, they move on. But Ano Hana is like a show featuring schizophrenics who are so shaken up by the death of a friend that they have delusions about her. Ano Hana is an oasis for hopeless idealists that think that friendship andlove can last beyond death. When people die, they are no longer in our lives. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story (7/10)\\n\r\nI give the story an C, because it contains too much unrealistic emotional responses. It is basically an existentialist story about 5 teens that are unable to take responsibility for actions or feelings they had towards Menma. They are all,  traumatized (believe it or not), by the death of a friend in grade school. Now this schizophrenic main character, Jintan, can some how see this Menma and now he tries to fulfill the needs of this delusions. There will be people defending that Menma is not a delusion, that she actually has a physical body, since she needs to eat and can move things. My response to that claim would be: those moments are implied to be caused by Menma and all five friends that are alive are schizophrenics that are traumatized by the death of Menma, therefore they are all delusional. The story is way too idealistic. It is an interesting story sure, but filled with emotions that are just confusing and out of place. In other words, it felt too contrived. This device used by the writers of Ano Hana is something the English majors call BS.  \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) \\n\r\nThe art is good. It is unique the quality of the art is good too. The backgrounds are very colorful and detailed. This category and the sound category contain the least amount of bull sh**. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe music is very nice, and the use of music in parts of the anime is very nicely done. I would like to point out how artistic it is to start playing the ending theme before the episode is actually over.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10)\\n\r\nHorrible characters. Can't relate to any of them, maybe except for the father of Menma. I think the characters are so shallow because they stopped being friends after the death of Menma. Wait what? Did I hear that correctly? The great group of friends stops being friends after one friend dies? I thought friends were suppose to share the burden, clearly something they did not do or else they wouldn't be so traumatized. Therefore they are all really crappy people. Their problems and personality are very shallow, pitiful, and not worth empathizing with. I feel completely disconnected from the plot and the emotional appeal the writers try to accomplish, because these characters are so stupid. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\r\nTo be honest, despite the mediocre plot and the characters, it was quite fun watching them fail at every single attempt to reach peace with the death of Menma. I feel happy because I am not a emotional train wreck like these 5 friends. This anime is mediocre overall but it is still enjoyable to watch these pitiful people struggle with their stupid shallow problems. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\r\nAno Hana isn't a masterpiece by a long shot but it was still worth watching. I feel like every single anime about idealistic friendship, attempt at a deeper meaning through BS, and unique art is getting all the support. And I end this review with this quote. \u201cThe Masses are Asses\u201d - For Children Learning How to Rhyme\\n",

            "content": "Anohana is a story of a close group of friends that loses one of their members in an accident when they were young. After this incident, the group disbands and becomes distant. However, one of the characters, Yadomi Jinta, is still able to see the ghost of the dead friend, Menma, and has the duty of granting Menma\u2019s wish which she had wanted before she passed away in order for her to rest in peace. When Jinta claims to the rest of his friends that he can still see Menma and wishes to grant her wish together, they do not believe him and thinks he\u2019sinsane. However, as the story progresses, the situation begins to change.\\n\\n\r\nStory [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Anohana is beautiful and exceptionally well told considering it only has a short 11 episodes. A key theme of this anime would be tragedy and guilt. After Menma passes away, all the main characters carry heavy burdens on their backs for the rest of their lives as they each have something they are guilty of, whether it is jealousy in love or the inability to help and not being courageous enough. However, even if all the characters do have negative attributes, the story progresses to show that each of the characters are trying their very best to try to make up for what they did or still think. Overall, Anohana has a fluent progression in plot and does not waste any potential development.\\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nAnohana has one of the most relaxing and pleasing art styles to watch of all time. Although not intricate, the scenes are extremely close to reality and you get the feeling that you have been to the places in the anime before. Personally, I really like the art even though it did not stand out, it certainly did not fall short in this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nI really, really, really like the ending of Anohana, through all 11 episodes, I don\u2019t think I skipped it once. I still listen to it almost every time I get on the car and honestly think it might be my favourite soundtrack for any anime. The opening music, however, was quite bland and never really caught my attention.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really fall for or become overly attached to any one of the characters in Anohana, but maybe that\u2019s because I just didn\u2019t get to spend enough time with them. Despite this, all of the characters in this anime are very realistic and relatable. For example, our main character Jinta is a slacker in school and plays games all day. He is stuck in his past due to the fact that Menma is still with him and wants to be with her forever. However, he also wants to grant Menma\u2019s wish so that he can move onto the future and make a life for himself. This can be considered a representation of our life decisions and what we choose to do, for the better or for the worse.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]\\n\r\nOverall [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nAnohana is an extremely sad story but at the same time very enjoyable. This anime is a must watch for all out there that are into drama and want to be emotionally moved. It has become an unforgettable experience for me and surely will be for you too.",

            "content": "I begin this review with informing you.\r\nIf you want the full effect of this show then don't read anything about it. I just recommend to watch it as blind as you can, as long as you aware of its genres.\r\nIt's not just because every review contains somewhat spoilers but I speak out of experience. I wish I wouldn't have known anything about this before I watched it, then it would have been even better. So this is my final warning, just go ahead and watch it, ignore all other information.\r\nNow that that is out of the way, I will start by making a bold claim.\r\nThereare only 2 kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nType 1 - This type is about telling you a compelling story, with cliffhangers, plot twists and and interesting setting or theme.\\n\r\nThis is all about to make you think.\\n\\n\r\nType 2 - This type on the other hand is all about making you feel a certain way. It's not that Type1 cannot make you feel, it's just that Type 2 disregards the plot more than type1 and focuses more on manipulating your emotions.\\n\r\nThis is all about to make you feel.\\n\\n\r\nOf course you could argue there are Type 3s that are a mixture of both, or then there are weird ones that are all about art. But those could usually be categorized in one of the 2 more than the other.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is AnoHana?\\n\r\nType2 it's that simple.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana isn't about telling you this interesting story that keeps you hooked and craving for more. It's about making you feel. It is entertainment for the heart not for the brain.\\n\\n\r\nSo the right mindset to watch it would be: Turn off your brain as much as you can, and embrace the feelings that will overcome you. If you focus to much on details you will find yourself in a spot where you cannot appreciate what this show is about.\\n\\n\\n\r\n!!! Warning - Some Spoilers contained !!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana was directed by Tatsuyuki Nagai, who is also responsible for Toradora! and Railgun. But also directed Ano Natsu de Matteru and Honey and Clover 2.\\n\\n\r\nYou can see a pattern here. He likes SoL. And drama.\\n\r\nAnd he is really good in this.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Nagai, Mari Okada was responsible for the Script of AnoHana.\\n\r\nShe also worked on Toradora!, and wrote the script on Black Rock Shooter, Gosick, Sakurasou and True Tears. (as well as many more).\\n\\n\r\nYou can see a pattern here as well, she loves drama and romance.\\n\\n\r\nWith this background information we can take a look at the \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana takes place at the end of Summer in an idyllic small town in midst of Mountains and surrounds a group of Teenagers who used to be best friends in their childhood. Though a tragic event happened, in which one of their friends died, which led to the disband of the group.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story revolves around how Meiko Honma returns as a ghost to bring these friends together and get her wish granted.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise sounds already heartwarming and is maybe not something you never have seen before in some way or the other but still gripping enough to make you interested. \\n\\n\r\nThrough out the course of only 11 episodes we see the maincharacter Jinta Yadomi, who is the only one who can see \"Menma\" ghost try to come in contact with his old childhood friend again and get back on track with his life, as well as seek redemption for the burden he imposed on himself regarding Menmas death.\\n\\n\r\n11 Episodes though is far enough, and 10 would have been enough as well.\\n\r\nThe story does not drag on and is fast enough/things happen on a steady pace, that you never get bored.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not particularly complex, which is good, since it can focus completely on the plot and the characters. The viewer doesn't need to know much in advance, nor is it 100% necessary to pay attention at all times.\\n\\n\r\nThough AnoHana is farm from being plausible. There are so many things that are never answered or looked into with great detail it fills the plot with so many holes, if it was a ship it would sink the moment it enters the water.\\n\r\nBut as I said, this show is not about a great, well thought out plot. But about emotions.\\n\\n\r\nIf you disregard all the supernatural things that never get any explanation then you will have much more fun watching it than nagging on every occasion something doesn't make sense.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the ending is solid and we get a satisfying, sad but yet still happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the Story is just cute, nothing too heavy. It's about themes like, friendship, love, redemption and dealing with the death of a loved one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIt boils down to 6 characters that matter in the show, and a handful of sidecharacters that are at least mentionable.\\n\\n\r\nYadomi, Jinta (Jin-tan), is the male maincharacter, he skips school for quite some time and lives alone with his father. He is the only one who can see Menma and first thinks of her as a mere hallucination. He is stressed, not only did he lose his childhood friend he could never tell his true feelings, but also his mother due to an illness.\\n\r\nSince he is the maincharacter, we'll find out the most about him compared to other characters in the show. Not only do we have the biggest insight on his past and the way he lives, but also on his thoughts and emotions. Obviously he grows the most as a character comes from accepting Menma as real, to confessing to her and finally in a struggle to let her go, lets her go.\\n\\n\r\nHe is by far one of the most likable characters in the show, though not the most likable character I've ever seen in such a show. At least he feels somewhat new and original and I have trouble fitting him into a stereotypical archtype without thinking about it too much. If I had to, he would be the antisocial \"emo\" teenager.\\n\\n\r\nHonma, Meiko (Menma), is the second most important character. Even though the story revolved around her, Jin is still the protagonist and we get the most insight on him.\\n\r\nMenma is still like a child even though she (supposedly) has grown (but still looks like a loli). Her attitude is that of a curious happy go lucky girl with very playful character traits. She is pushy and somewhat clumsy. Compared to Jin she is much easier to identify as stereotypical character as him, but that's mostly because you are supposed to feel sorry for her.\\n\r\nI personally enjoy characters like her, and wish I'd have a ghost like her being around me, she is just too cute, both in her appearance and in her attitude.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to tell if she grows as a character since her mindset is so simple at times. Unlike Jin who turns from an antisocial emo to a strong, independent male.\\n\r\nHer change comes more from what happens to her, rather what she becomes.\\n\\n\r\nAnjou, Naruko (Anaru), is almost as important in the show as Menma, though the story doesn't revolve around her. Besides Jin she gets the most attention and undergoes the most changes. She starts of as being your typical tsundere, but is a bit more than that. She is in love with Jin and always thought as Menma, not only has her friend, but also as a rival.\\n\r\nShe grows in terms of confessing to Jin, forgiving herself and accepting Menma as the \"winner\". She learns to stay true to herself and becomes less easily influenced by those around her. Similar to Jin she learns to become less dependent.\\n\r\nShe was more likable than I first thought she'd be and I found it kinda tragic that she didn't \"win\". But it wasn't so much a romance as it was a drama.\\n\\n\r\nTetsudo Hisakawa (Poppo), is the comic relief of the show show, but turns later to become a bit more than that, though I kinda found his motives too attached and not well fleshed out. They were tagged on way to late in the series and thus never truly making him a really serious character like the others were.\\n\r\nBut that said he was good comic relief and a very likable character. You kinda feel sorry for him being the \"forever alone\" guy of the group, but they handled it well and so did he.\\n\r\nHe doesn't go through a lot of transformation but was a very important character in bringing everyone together again, also he was a true friend to Jin.\\n\\n\r\nAtsumu Matsuyuki (Yukiatsu), I personally couldn't stand him. Right from the start he is introduced as Jins childhood rival/friend who has turned to a real dick. It is revealed later on, that he didn't really overcome Menmas death either and also was jealous of the bond between Jin and Menma. Though not the most likable character, he is important and is the direct counterweight to Jin, which was very important for the story.\\n\r\nUnlike Poppos resolution, his wasn't as cheap but also not really founded in the end. They gave him enough screentime though, yet I had the feeling they didn't really know what to do with him in the end. I found it hard to see him as anything but a counterweight.\\n\\n\r\nChiriko Tsurumi (Tsuruko), the forgotten character. No really she has not only the least amount of screentime, also her backstory is explained the least. I can't really say if I liked her or not, but I feel sorry for her being so underrepresented in the show.\\n\\n\r\nMentionable sidecharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIrene Honma, the crazy mother of Menma, who also got her salvation in the end. Not much to say here.\\n\r\nAtsushi Yadomi, Jins father who is like the coolest dude ever. He is calm and lets his son work out his own way without leaving him behind. He wins the award for best dad 2011.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else isn't really that mentionable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall AnoHana has a good, l likable cast with fleshed out characters and interesting interactions.\\n\r\nThe entire cross romance thing felt like attached drama though. Especially since some of it wasn't really mentioned before ep10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana uses a mixture of warm but soft colors, emphasis realism over stylizing things and is in tradition with similar shows like ToraDora or Sakuraso no Pet na Kanojou. It didn't use any crazy techniques or ugly 3DCG that was out of place. It was overall very clean looking and had simple but somewhat realist animation.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being \"just\" a Slice of Life, Drama, AnoHana actually had some really well animated scenes. But sometimes you also got some \"quality\". I can only remember one occasion where it actually was unintentionally funny, when Poppos eyes looked cross-eyed and everything around him was super serious. Despite that, it is neither amazingly animated nor bad. Above average.\\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds were good looking but not stunning. I cannot remember any amazingly beautiful drawn backgrounds but it was always fitting and looked well made. \\n\r\nI mean, it's \"just\" a SoL, don't expect some crazy action scenes with stunning backgrounds and beautiful light effects. Well done is all you'll get here.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about character designs is more interesting, because those were done by Masayoshi Tanaka, who also did the character designs for Ano Natsu de Matteru, Highschool of the Dead, Toradora! and others.\\n\r\nI personally don't really like his style. His characters Hair always looks like one piece of cotton, rather than hair. It's way more puffy that it could be, and also he likes to use all sorts of colors for his hair, instead of sticking to more realistic ones.\\n\r\nThat aside his style is at least rememberable and you'll see the similarities in his other works (especially Ano Natsu).\\n\r\nI do give credit for Menma though. She was darn cute.\\n\\n\r\nAgain. AnoHana is not about winning awards for amazing animation, it's a cute story with cute visuals which are somewhat realistic. So don't go in and expect to be blow away.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to voiceactors AnoHana had some famous names like Haruka Tomatsu (Asuna/SAO, Shizuku/Tonari), Ai Kayano (Inori/GuiltyCrown, Shiina/Sakurasou), Takahiro Sakurai (Suzaku/Code Geass, Makishima/PsychoPass), Miyu Irino(Makoto/DenpaOnna, Kiritsugu/FateZero).\\n\r\nSo needless to say the voice acting is great as for most modern shows done but big studios such as A1 pictures.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was pretty cute, but I personally skipped it (mostly out of time issues) since I wanted to see the show. I watched it 3/11 times and maybe a 4th time considering the song was in the last ep at the end.\\n\r\nThe ending was also good but inferior to the opening in my opinion. Both were fitting to the show though. Not the best but good ones at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost is a mixture of Piano pieces, acoustic songs, sometimes mixed with hip-hop beats (don't misunderstand that, with hip hop beats I mean 4/4 with the snare on the 3).\\n\r\nIt wasn't special or anything but fitting for a SoL and was well used in dramatic scenes. Overall it was calm and melancholic, like the show itself. I think it's hard to fuck up soundtracks in well made anime nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nValue/Enjoyment:\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn MAL AnoHana is one of the top anime, and also THE top anime under A1 pictures.\\n\r\nNot my personal favorite of A1 pictures (that would be Shinsekai Yori) but I can understand why.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself wasn't anything new or special. But it was really well executed and deserves to be one of the best anime of A1 pictures. Yet I think it is overrated.\\n\r\nIt gets compared to Angel Beats a lot, and I know Angel Beats has a lot of Problems as well and they are both tearjerkers. But if I had to pick one, I'd go with Angel Beats offering more than AnoHana.\\n\r\nSo AnoHana stands among all the sad, romance/drama/SoL of the history of anime, but where?\\n\r\nIt is one of the best, yes. Tatsuyuki knows how to make a good SoL, and so AnoHana was one of his successions. It will be remembered and watched by many to come and will make many people cry, it's just that good. But not the best...\\n\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it greatly and will treasure it, but it is not as good as people say it is, at least for me. I know the problems and I am not afraid of pointing them out if I need. I just ignored them because I can enjoy both, a great story and a great emotions.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow to the Scores:\\n\\n\r\nStory\t\t7/10 (good)\\n\\n\r\nPremise\t\t2 (intriguing)\\n\r\nPacing\t\t2 (through out interesting)\\n\r\nComplexity\t1 (Simple but sufficient)\\n\r\nPlausibility\t0 (none)\\n\r\nConclusion\t2 (manly tears)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\t7/10 (good)\\n\\n\r\nPersonality\t2 (multidimensional)\\n\r\nBehavior\t1 (sometimes illogical)\\n\r\nDevelopment\t1 (mostly good)\\n\r\nMotivation\t1 (at placed tagged on)\\n\r\nLikability\t2 (great cast)\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \t6/10 (fair)\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle\t2 (Fitting)\\n\r\nQuality \t1 (mostly good)\\n\r\nBackground\t1 (well done)\\n\r\nCharacter D.\t2 (good but nothing great)\\n\\n\r\nSound\t\t7/10 (good)\\n\\n\r\nVoiceacting\t3 (top notch)\\n\r\nOP/ED\t\t2 (good op, fitting)\\n\r\nOST\t\t2 (nothing outstanding but fitting)\\n\\n\r\nValue/Enjoy\t14/20 (7/10) (good)\\n\\n\r\nValue\t\t6\\n\\n\r\nRewatch/2.S\t1 (maybe some day)\\n\r\nSentimental\t3 (very attaching)\\n\r\nHistorical\t2 (A1 pictures \"best\" work)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\t8\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\t1\\n\r\nMusic & Sound\t\t1\\n\r\nStory & World\t\t2\\n\r\nCharacters\t\t2\\n\r\nValue & Attachment\t2",

            "content": "Ano Hina has a charming premise and interesting first few episodes. A lot of times in the later of the series there are tear-jerking moments. However I was a little disappointed with how it played out in the end. Of course, I stuck with it until the end because there was something sweet about it.\r\nThere are plenty of issues surrounding the death of a childhood friend that can be dealt with in a dramatic, interesting way. However, the series relies mostly on petty high school love triangles. \"I have a crush on him he has a crush on her! Waah!\" This wasn't set up likea typical high-school drama show...why did it end up trying to be one? Especially since it had presented itself with such a promising first few episodes. I did, however, stick to it for certain reasons.\\n\\n\r\nI liked Menma enough to want to see her have a happy ending. Anaru was the best character for me, the only one who showed some semblance of development. Her character was the only one with any sort of depth, and the only one I got attached too. The other characters are mostly forgettable, particularly Yukiatsu and Tsuruko. Popo is enjoyable but he has so little involvement in aspects of the story he seems misused. Menma, is of course, an ultra-cute, joyful loligirl, but you kind of know what her fate will be from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the last episode: hated the first half and thoroughly enjoyed the second half. Yeah, I got teary. Overall, not overly depressing and perhaps maybe a little uplifting. It's started as story about dealing with loss, growing up, and moving on. While is maintained that to a degree, it later focused more on love and relationships. Without going into spoiler territory, I'll settle at an overall opinion of average for the final chapter.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, there's another thing I don't want to spoil, but it's a plot hole that made me want to bang my head on a table. We know Jintan can see Menma from day one. However, there's something about how she is able to communicate in a later episode that made me think, \"Well why the hell didn't you do that from the beginning!!\" I mean, I know lolis can be airheads, but seriously! \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it drew me in  during the beginning. The drama got lackluster later in the series, but  kept me watching because I wanted to see Menma's wish fulfilled. The last few episodes, with the exception of 10 which was a little better than the others, bumped the series down to just \"okay\" when it possibly could have been a very good and heartfelt story.\\n\\n\r\nbonus points: I really love the ED, wherein hundreds of white flowers burst into color.",

            "content": "In youth, we tend to over-exaggerate, over-analyse, and over-experience any event. That ice cream we ate for the first time as a child will never quite taste that good again; even as teenagers and later adults, we chase after these childhood fantasies, never quite giving up on finding that metaphorical \"fountain of youth.\" What's the most likely thing, then, to happen if one were to experience childhood trauma? Perhaps insanity in later life, a cold heart, apathy, denial, or maybe all of the above? What exactly does happen? Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai explores this phenomenon that happens whenwe simply can't let go of the past, because in all of us, there exists a child that yearns for the good ol' days. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen you experience something earth-shattering (that's awful) isn't the first thing you want to do is forget about it? To bury it with something, anything to get rid of those horrid memories? Don't you just want to curl up in a ball and forget reality for maybe, ever? Years have passed since a tragic accident happened between what used to be five really close friends. How do they interact? How will they react to one another if they become forced in close proximity? Isn't something so terrible it's hard to speak of it without bringing up memories supposed to be left buried? Yadomi and the gang struggle to make peace with their past, all the while finding out who they are and what they mean to each other in the present. \\n\\n\r\nI was shocked, more like flabbergasted, when the series laid out. It opened up faster than expected and completely caught me off guard. Where I thought there was a continuity, it turned out to be a broken link in the old rusted chain of the past. Maybe there weren't many plot twists; maybe the story got a little repetitive; maybe it was just a little too short. However, the anime moves fast, and you have to keep up. It really was beautiful story-telling; the truth is a dark, dark secret many are willing to risk their lives to keep hidden. Many times, it's to protect people you love or to have the burden of it on yourself. Yadomi and the gang have to learn: is it worth it to keep your true emotions hidden? Or are you actually hurting those around you for your own individualistic needs? This anime delves deeper than simple human or friendship or even love relationships. It answers questions much deeper that pervade the subconscious. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, many a time the art wasn't gloomy. In fact, it was almost like a juxtaposition of light and dark: when Yadomi was happy, sometimes the colors flitted about between midnight and sunshine. However, the majority of the time, the colors stayed neutral; but there were key moments where light had an interesting role in keeping up the story.... The characters were drawn normal, skinny, not too flashy and not to dull either. The animation wasn't disappointing in the least. I didn't see many flaws; however, nothing really jumped out at me. However, I do want to mention the facial expressions. They were accurate and went anywhere between lighthearted laughter to deadly serious in seconds. Each character had their moments, and what fantastic moments they were.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe score is high, not because of the OP and ED, but because of the voice acting. My goodness, I have never seen such raw emotion in a voice before. The pain is almost tangible; you can literally almost empathize with every fiber of the being, even if you weren't there and this isn't your life. It was beautiful, really, to hear the sounds of human emotion, of raw pain, pleasure, or sadness, to creep into the voices of each character. Normally, the voice acting is pretty sub-par, but that's because nothing compares to the depth at which these morals and lessons pierce through one's fragile childhood heart. The OP is upbeat, a little slow; the ED is sad and depressed, almost like a love song to a deceased wife or husband. It's not like I didn't like them, it's that I thought they were pretty plain, considering the weight this anime carries.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: a perfect 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPeople have blasted this anime because of how \"static\" or \"inflexible\" these characters are; how they don't change throughout the anime, and how each of them is surprisingly bland. Who in their right mind would drastically, completely change because of a trauma? I know it sounds wrong to judge others so harshly, but the reason people go into depression or turn to alcohol or drugs when they experience such trauma isn't because they changed as a person, but because they want to get out of the past. But it haunts them, day in and day out, never ceasing to be erased from the curse and blessing that is the human memory. Yadomi exhibits this through his attachment issues; Anjou through jealously; Hisakawa, through belongingness; Atsuma, through clinging to a hopeless past; Tsurumi through learning to let go; and Homna Meiko? You're going to have to find out.\\n\\n\r\nThis fantastic anime takes average kids, high schoolers, and really brings out basic qualities of a person that can't be changed from the past. Interestingly, it does so with accuracy and gusto, with plenty drama in between. The character score is a perfect 10/10 because they followed the human condition with such perfection I tend to never see. Maybe this is my opinion; maybe you are supposed to change after a series of events happen. I personally have experienced trauma; maybe not in this sort of way nor in the magnitude, but it has happened. And you don't change. That's simple and plain. You slowly turn into a shell of yourself if you don't let your emotions out from time to time. Externally, you may lose friends, become antisocial, or turn to other forms of relieving yourself. But inside, you stay who you inherently are, reliving that experience for the rest of your life, afraid to change because change is what made said event happen in the first place. So coming from personal experience, these characters really nailed that topic. Hard.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was more than astounded at what this had to offer. Originally recommended by friends, I only agreed to watch it because it was barely 11 episodes. Trust me, you won't be disappointed in the least. There was enough drama to keep you riveted in your seat, enough emotions to keep your head spinning, and even some metaphysical references that keep the story interesting as a whole. I loved every juicy bit of this wonderful show; it took the worst out of people, and could turn it around so quickly to show the best of humanity. So if you know where to look, hide and seek is a really easy game to win....",

            "content": "At first AnoHana didn't catch my attention at all. I thought it was a plotless anime about a group of friends who spend their summer with each other. When I ran out of ongoing anime I could look forward to during my week, I decided to try this one. I realized that I had completely underestimated this show.\r\nAbout the story:\r\nLike I mentioned before, I thought that there was no real plot to this anime. The reason might be that the information on the website I visited to watch the anime wasn't complete. Well, I encountered an anime that made me tear up every single episode.\\n\r\nI like how the show describes various possibilitys on how different kind of people react to the loss of their dear friend and which impact it has on them, even after a few years.\\n\r\nEvery character had their own way to handle Menma's death, but in the end it is shown that none of them has been able to be at peace with themselves. They are only able to do that once all of them have revealed their feelings regarding Menma's death.\\n\\n\r\nI apologize for those vague statements, but the rules say that I am not allowed to write spoilers, which makes the rating of the story pretty hard.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the art:\\n\r\nThe art itself isn't really that outstanding. However, it accompanies the plot really well. Every place in this anime becomes familiar during the show and we can relate them to certain events.\\n\r\nEspecially the group's 'secret base' in the forest is a constant reminder of old times and gives off a feeling of safety and home.\\n\r\nThe character's personalities are outlined by their individual character design.\\n\r\nThe artwork is pretty colorful, which supports the overall theme of summer and gives off a comfortable feeling.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis one is probably the one thing, one can praise the most. I don't know about the background music, since I don't remember it. Well, that probably means that it mixed in so well with the rest of the anime that I didn't realize it individually.\\n\r\nHowever, what I want to praise is the opening and especially the ending theme.\\n\r\nThe opening song 'Aoi Shiori' makes one start the episode with a relaxed, maybe abit nostalgic feeling, which -in my eyes- is a really important thing for this anime. \\n\r\nI am pretty sure that it was the ending theme, which made me tear up at the ending of every episode. It starts playing during the last few sentences and makes the whole thing a lot more sentimental. I also think that it was a really good choice to make the female main cast sing it. \\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast in this anime show did a really great job. They transmitted the feelings of their characters really well. I have to admit that I didn't know most of them, excluding Takahiro Sakurai. The fact that one of my favorite seiyuu voiced the anime's male hottie probably got it a few extra points.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nBecause the story is about a group of friends, there isn't such a wide palette of characters. However, that was made up by the big character development.\\n\r\nWell, the next part is going to get hard again, since I don't want to spoil anyone, so I want to apologize beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nMenma:\\n\r\n Menma died when she was a child, so even though she looks like she has become older, she has maintained the pure and innocent character of a child.\\n\r\nShe does her best to make her childhood friends become close again.\\n\r\nI think that they did a really good job giving her that kind of personality. Her appearance was probably chosen to be that of a teenager, because she is a love interest. Since it's a show with a serious plot and just as many ecchi moments as needed with a male teenage protagonist, a prepubescent love interest would have been totally misplaced.\\n\\n\r\nJinta:\\n\r\nJinta has become a shut-in because of Menma's death and the way his friends changed since then. He is the kind of teenager, who is angry at the world.\\n\r\nHe wants to grant Menma's wish because he thinks that it is his fault that she died. However, he often doubts his decisions, because he often comes to the conclusion that his childhood friends won't help him.\\n\r\nIn my eyes he represents teenagers who feel abandoned by their friends.\\n\\n\r\nAnaru:\\n\r\nAnaru has always had a one-sided love for Jinta, which made her become jealous of Menma. She can't hate her, though, because Menma is her friend and has always been nice to her.\\n\r\nShe is heavily influenced by her female classmates. She wants to be part of a group, so she adapts herself. She has an inner conflict, because she likes Jinta, who is an outsider, but does not want to be one herself.\\n\r\nShe represents teenager, who make themselves fit into a group, even if that means that they won't be themselves anymore.\\n\\n\r\nYukiatsu:\\n\r\nYukiatsu is handsome, smart and charming to his classmates.\\n\r\nHe suffers because of his one-sided love for Menma and treats Jinta in a bad way, because he is jealous of him.\\n\r\nI like the fact that despite the characteristics mentioned above, he is not perfect. As he said himself: ''I'm hot and I'm smart, but unfortunately I'm lacking a bit in the strength department''.\\n\r\nHe represents the misjudged teenager, who is idolized or envied by others.\\n\\n\r\nTsuruko:\\n\r\nTsuruko is a quiet, smart girl. She seems to be pretty apathetic to the things that happen arround her, which is proved wrong later during the series.\\n\r\nShe represents the misjudged teenager, who seems think of him/herself as superior.\\n\\n\r\nPoppo:\\n\r\nPoppo seems to be the only one from the group who hasn't changed. He is the first who believes that Jinta can see Menma and is pretty desperate to help her. the reason is mentioned later in the series and would be considered a spoiler.\\n\r\nHe represtent the kind of teenager, who acts like a happy person around others even though he doesn't feel happy.\\n\\n\r\nWell, so in the end all kinds of problems that teenagers can face are represented by this set of characters. That's why everyone who watches this series can be sure to find a character whom he/she can identify him/herself with.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of everything mentioned above i think of AnoHana as a really enjoyable anime and I would recommend it at any time.\\n",

            "content": "Dealing with the death of a friend or loved one isn't easy, no matter how old you are, and everyone comes to terms with their loss in different ways. Adults can drink themselves into a stupor in an effort to dull the pain, take off on a journey of self discovery, bury themselves in their work, or find some other coping mechanism. Unfortunately the same isn't true for children, and all too often they are unable to truly deal with the emotional turmoil that occurs.\r\nNow it may seem a bit odd to talk about death, grief, and learning to deal with the loss of someoneclose, but essentially that's what Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (We Still Don't Know the Name of the Flower We Saw That Day), is all about.\\n\\n\r\nThe story opens with Yadomi Jinta, a seemingly grumpy teenager who is playing a game in his room on a hot summer's day whilst his childhood friend Honma Meiko (Menma), pesters him repeatedly. Having had enough of the game, Jinta decides to  make lunch, but only for himself and his father which annoys Menma no end as she also wants to eat the ramen he has made.\\n\\n\r\nIt all seems like a fairly normal, everyday scene that one might see in anime, but not everything is as it seems ...\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface AnoHana looks like a fairly straightforward tale of teenagers learning to deal with a past trauma and maturing in the process, and for the most part that's a fairly accurate perception. The plot is well constructed and takes a measured, almost methodical approach to events which is reflected in the often placid tone of the narrative. Unfortunately this leads to a degree of predictability as certain events in the storyline are clearly foreshadowed, and while the series promotes a degree of empathy for the characters and their situation, there may be occasions where viewers want the story to get to the point.\\n\\n\r\nOne surprising aspect is the manner in which flashbacks are used to punctuate specific occurrences or emotions, whilst adding historical context to the relationship between Jinta, Menma, and the rest of the \"Super Peace Busters\". These sojourns into memory act as a nice counterpoint to the current state of relations between the characters, and highlight just how much has changed for each of them over the last ten years.\\n\\n\r\nThis contrast is also reflected in the visuals, and while there is a marked difference in the appearance of almost all of the Super Peace Busters, it's actually the subtle contextual setting that makes the change much more pronounced. The key thing to remember is that people often romanticise personal history and memories, especially if one has undergone some kind of trauma, and AnoHana plays on this by sharpening the focus and darkening the tones on the present day, which contrasts with the soft focus flashbacks that are often filled with \"light\".\\n\\n\r\nThe design itself is well handled, but while efforts have been made to really highlight the changes ten years can make to a child's physical growth, it's the character animation that stands out. A-1 Pictures have tried to visualize the movement differences between a child and an adolescent, and while there are a few niggles here and there, the overall effect promotes the sense that the characters are no longer the children they once were.\\n\\n\r\nBecause AnoHana is a character driven piece there is a heavy emphasis placed on the dialogue, and while the majority of the script is actually pretty intuitive, the manner of speech during the flashback scenes can sometimes seem a bit odd. Thankfully the series has some very talented seiyuu on hand, and it's interesting to note that some of the roles feature two different voice actors - one for the present day and one for the past. Each role is given due care and attention, so it's unfortunate that even with so much talent on hand, there are a few issues from time to time as the seiyuu handling the child roles are all adults. Now while this may be standard practice in the industry, studios like Ghibli have proven time and again that children are much more capable of playing the younger roles than the majority of adults, and while the relatively minor flaws in the dialogue do stand out, one has to wonder how different the series could have been if child actors had been used.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana features a number of slow pieces of background music performed on piano or guitar that reflect the measured plot and add a slightly bittersweet air to the storyline. The opening theme, Aoi Shiori by Galileo Galilei, features a sequence that shows the characters in their past and present forms and hints at the the reason for their emotional difficulties. The ending sequence features a montage of the three girls of the Super Peace Busters, Menma, Anjou Naruko (Anaru), and Tsurumi Chiriko (Tsuruko), and is set to Secret Base ~Kimi ga Kureta Mono~ (10 years after Version), which is a cover of the 2001 single by Zone and is performed by Kayano Ai, Tomatsu Haruka and Hayami Saori, the seiyuu who play the roles of Menma, Anaru and Tsuruko.\\n\\n\r\nNow given the nature of the series and the near constant focus on the characters, certain viewers may assume that AnoHana should feature almost continuous development, so it may come as a surprise to some people that the show takes more of a \"stop-start\" approach. Because of the attempt to apply a degree of realism to the characters and the emphasis on depicting them as plausible, any attempts at continuous development would seem overly contrived.\\n\\n\r\nBalancing that though, is some rather strong characterisation. One of the key things to remember about each person in the story is that they have experienced a specific defining moment in their lives, and that allows the characters to be depicted as individuals from the start. The strength of the characterisation is even more palpable if one compares the present versions of the Super Peace Busters with their past selves from the flashbacks. That said, there are occasions where the story has difficulty finding a resolution to a given situation so it can sometimes seem as though events are being dragged on in a effort to develop the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana is a surprisingly simple, yet slightly over sentimental, look at the coping mechanisms of children and adolescents when coming to terms with a past trauma, and in that respect it's one of the more surprising titles of the last few years. The series errs more on the side of soap opera than outright drama from time to time, but like many of the other relatively minor flaws, this can be forgiven in light of the fact that the subject matter is well managed and delivered. In truth, the closest neighbour to AnoHana would probably be Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 as that also highlights the difficulty children have in dealing with the sudden loss of a loved one.\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to say whether I actually enjoyed the series or not. On the one hand it has some genuinely entertaining moments, but on the other the series deals with an issue that has little enjoyment value (unless watching kids coming to terms with emotional scars is your thing), and even though AnoHana isn't a story without flaws, that doesn't mean it's bad. In fact, the reverse is true as while the series does take a slightly romanticised look at the characters and events, the constant element of realism that runs through the narrative sets this anime apart from many others.\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, AnoHana is a great example of how good a completely original anime can be.",

            "content": "Moderator Edit: This review contains spoilers.\r\n--------\r\n''Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae o Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai'' (We Still Don't Know the Name of the Flower We Saw That Day) is a series that sets lofty goals for itself. It is, in essence, a ghost story that aspires to be a poignant drama about (unrequited) love, loss, adolescence and self (re-)discovery. Heavy themes that require a delicate touch. \r\nThat last part is where things go wrong, but more on that later.\r\nAs the show begins, we see a boy sitting at home while his female friend is pestering him. The boy's father is remarkably unfazed by whatis going on. Soon enough, we learn why. The girl, Meiko, died 10 years ago and is a ghost visible only to our protagonist, Jinta. She's come to him with a request: he has to help fulfill her last wish so she can part for the afterlife. Problem is that Jinta has grown up to be a recluse. Nonetheless, he gathers all his courage and ventures outside.\\n\\n\r\nEarlier episodes show Jinta in his attempts to reconnect with his group of old friends to find out what Meiko's final wish could be. The Super Peace Busters (the name of the group) are a colorful bunch, and the series is at its best when it shows them getting back in touch. AnoHana nails that mix of awkwardness and nostalgia felt between people who haven't seen each other for a long time. In particular when they're connected by tragedy. In this regard, the character interactions feel incredibly authentic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then Meiko comes into play.\\n\\n\r\nMeiko, as portrayed by the series, is the most wonderful girl ever. She's incredibly sweet, loving, selfless, wonderful and innocent. Jinta is in love with her, even after all these years; as are the other boys from the Super Peace Busters. And the girls? Their emotional crises are all about how they could never match up to Meiko, even now that she's dead.\\n\\n\r\nKeep this in mind: we're referring to a girl who died over 10 years ago, when all of them were around 5. I repeat: this happened 10 years ago. A lot can happen in so much time, especially for  children growing up. The death of a friend, tragic as it is, will usually stop hurting quite as much. Life goes on, and day-to-day concerns have a way of catching up. AnoHana doesn't seem to grasp this. Every single person who knew Meiko even the slightest bit is still devastated over her death because she was simply the most wonderful girl ever. \\n\\n\r\nOr so we're told.\\n\\n\r\nThe Meiko we can see, however, is an annoying caricature. Her personality is that of ditzy, clingy, ''moe'' characters such as Yui Hirasawa (K-ON!). Her reactions mostly consist of either crying or being incredibly cheerful, and things she does on her own usually boil down to misguided attempts at cheering up Jinta with antics that we're supposed to consider cute. The makers even shoehorn in some fanservice of her. Raising the question of how seriously they really want us to take her.\\n\\n\r\nVery seriously, it turns out.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole plot ends up revolving around Meiko and her wish. By the end it's difficult to remember any aspect about the other characters that doesn't trace back to Meiko in some way. Worse yet, the series spends a lot of its running time having characters doubt Jinta's claims that he can communicate with Meiko's ghost. This in spite of the fact that Meiko is a ghost who can interact with physical objects. That's right. Proving her existence would be incredibly easy and yet the series keeps contriving ways to wring melodrama out of other characters' disbelief. One could defend this by claiming that people in real life don't always go for the best solution and make stupid mistakes. Which is true. But the characters in question are portrayed as decently smart in spite of their issues so it feels strange that such an easy to solve problem is dragged out for so long. Worse yet, the actual narrative ends up pointing this out. Indeed, the series itself pokes fun at how long it took to solve its nonexistent problem. It would be cute if it wasn't so infuriating.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the frustration only gets worse from there. As the series culminates in an ending that's composed and executed with such bombastic melodramatic sincerity I almost felt bad about laughing at it. The climax basically abandons any pretense of subtlety in favor of having characters shout their feelings at each other, only to neatly wrap up their issues with an instant-cure group therapy session. If only it were that easy in real life.\\n\r\nReal grief, of course, is a totally different beast. It's not something you get over after a miraculous event. Rather, it's a constant uphill battle as you struggle to pick up the pieces and try to fill the void  that's appeared in your life. The way AnoHana presents a one-size-fits-all solution is hopelessly na\u00efve, however well-meaning.\\n\\n\r\nThat last bit is a great way to sum up the series in a nutshell. Its superb presentation and handful of interesting parts are ultimately wasted on a series that decides to focus on all the wrong things. Pandering, sentimental and ultimately frustrating. ''Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae o Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai'' is a crushing disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nPS: \\n\r\nThe ideas I have formed about the themes explored in this series are based on my own imagination and second-hand accounts of people less fortunate than I. Should you disagree things I have written in this review then please do not hesitate to write me a message. I apologize for any offense I may have caused and wish to explicitly state that it is in no way intentional.\\n",

            "content": "There\u2019s nothing quite like the loss of a loved one for changing a person. We always feel that death is such an alien concept, it exists but is somehow detached and unrelated to our own little world until it comes knocking on our doorstep. Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (We Still Don't Know the Name of the Flower We Saw That Day), tries to show us just how powerful an effect death can have on us.\r\nThe keyword is \u2018tries\u2019, and for the most part, AnoHana succeeds. It is one of those anime that illustrates perfectly the idea that therelative distance to perfection is inversely proportional to the obviousness of huge, glaring flaws. For everything that AnoHana does just beautifully right, there is usually something little it gets horribly wrong.\\n\\n\r\nBefore we go on, I would like to state for the record that I absolutely endorse this anime to anyone who asks, reasons which are perfectly illustrated in Archaeon\u2019s neatly succinct review, of which I direct you to. There really is no reason to write another straightforward review reiterating everything he's said when you can just go and see his. Instead, for those who have already finished the anime and are looking for a more critical approach to viewing AnoHana, it may interest you to read further here.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no denying AnoHana is fine piece of work. Everything from animation to sound, characterization to story are all quality material and together form both a visually and emotionally satisfying experience. The anime is far past the point of debate about whether watching it would be enjoyable and worth one\u2019s while, because it most certainly is. The proceeding point of scrutiny would be to examine the anime at it\u2019s core fundamental level. This is the point where the \u2018really good\u2019 pieces of work are separated from the true masterpieces. This is also the point where AnoHana unfortunately falls flat. Specifically speaking, AnoHana\u2019s screenplay just isn\u2019t very good.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, considering how well rounded the anime feels as a whole, the screenplay is actually deceptively and surprisingly bad.\\n\\n\r\nOkada Mari, one whom I respect greatly for her work on Tordora and Kuroshitsuji is back again; this time she is chief script writer for AnoHana. Unfortunately Mari\u2019s apparent inexperience in writing shines through clearly in the screenplay. There is no doubt she has talent and a knack for good ideas, which makes it disappointing to see she still stumbles on some basic areas of writing. The narrative for example, is sorely lacking in woven exposition, with the many aspects of the story left feeling one dimensional and underdeveloped (more on that in a moment).\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is also inconsistent; the majority of the time it is written and delivered beautifully, but there are frequent punctuations of awkward, out of place lines that leaves something to be desired. Most of these instances are offset by the talent of the seiyuu who try their best to bring emotion to these parts, but the moments are still unavoidably noticeable. For instance, count how many times this scene happens: Jin-tan glances to his side at Meiko and mutters \u2018Menma...\u2019 another character looks at him, confused, and questions \u2018Yadomi?\u2019 \\n\\n\r\nThere are very clear distinctions between the lines that have significance to the plot or the character, and lines which are simply conversational pieces, with almost no blending of the two types. At times it feels like the latter lines have no contextual meaning at all and are simply there to fill in time because the script writer couldn\u2019t think of anything else to write. For an anime like AnoHana where the entirety of the narrative is delivered via dialogue and character interaction, this is a very dangerous habit to fall into.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many good things that Okada Mari brought from her experience working on the series compositions of titles like Toradora, Fractale and Gosick. Unfortunately one of them also happened to be the abysmal pacing that they all suffered from at one point or another. Naturally, the structure Exposition-Rising Action-Climax-Falling Action-Resolution can\u2019t possibly be adhered to as strictly for anime as it does for say, novels or films, simply due to the episodic nature of anime; there is an underlying need for each episode to be standalone in it\u2019s own right, even if it is meant to contribute to the overall story. However that isn\u2019t to say we shouldn\u2019t at least make an effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with AnoHana is that it simply tried too hard to be episodic. Each episode\u2019s substory warranted so much attention that there was very little room left to develop the main plot. Although each individual 24-minute segment was neatly tied into a little package with it\u2019s own structure, which seemed fine at the time of watching, suddenly we reach the end of episode 9 and we realize with 2 episodes to go we\u2019re still on the exposition part of the main story. This is again, partly due to the fault of the narrative not having any woven exposition in itself, relying instead on almost purely dialogue and flashbacks to establish the backstory, an alternative which is both more time consuming and less efficient. (To throw an example out there, think how easy it would have been to tell stories of Popo\u2019s adventures around the world by simply including a few souvenirs from his travels in his little hut. A few frames to easily explore an episode\u2019s worth of exposition, which can then be used to add elements to Popo\u2019s character without the need for spoken exposition.)\\n\\n\r\nI am strongly hesitant in calling AnoHana a melodrama. The constant hint of realism in both the visuals and characters suggest otherwise, as does the very real themes that it tries to convey. The anime obviously works very hard to provoke an emotional response and I wonder at times if it is trying a little too hard. Not a scene goes by without Yadomi frowning at something, and the prevalence (or rather excess), of falling tears in every episode almost screams at me: \u201cHere is an emotional scene, indicated by the tears. Feel sadness you sheep!\u201d The need for AnoHana to constantly use the act of crying to convey sorrow seems almost shortsighted, and while they are a good tool for reinforcing the emotional instability of the characters, they seem to serve little other purpose.\\n\\n\r\nAll this cumulatively leads to the biggest flaw of AnoHana: as an anime observing death and how people cope with it, there is shockingly little character development observed. What AnoHana tries to offer instead are single characters at two points in time. On one hand we have the happy-go-lucky childhood of the super-peace-busters, on the other we have the sullen, withdrawn adolescent individuals of those friends, drifting apart and trying to move on with their lives. At first sight it is amazingly easy to mistake this contrast of past and present for \u2018character development,\u2019 however true character development demands something a little more in-depth than, \u2018friend dies, people become sad.\u2019 Yukiatsu is arguably the only character who experiences true change, *spoiler alert* in his brief contact with Menma *spoiler alert* he experiences denial, confusion, jealousy and anger, and in doing so, realizing his self-loathing attitude and changing himself. Yadomi\u2019s development is also arguable, though I remain skeptic as to whether what seems to me as merely an overdue self realization can be categorized as development if it were there subconsciously all along. In comparison, the other characters, experienced only minimal changes, exchanging confessions and realization which, while heart-moving, can hardly be justified as \u2018development,\u2019 begging the question of whether there was any point to the whole thing other than being an emotional roller-coaster of adolescent diversions.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve managed to read this far and haven\u2019t yet \u2018unhelpful\u2019d\u2019 this review or thrown your mouse across the room in anger, then props to you, and perhaps you\u2019d like stay a bit longer and allow me to explain where all this nonsense is coming from.\\n\\n\r\nThe mindset of a critic is slightly different from that of an average viewer. We\u2019ve seen, considered and analyzed far more than what would be considered healthy for a normal human being and as a result, we view things a bit differently. Cliches and archetypes you\u2019ve seen maybe half a dozen times, we\u2019ve seen hundreds of times. We get bored quickly, we\u2019re more easily dismissive, we hone in on small mistakes like vultures, we\u2019re very excited by originality and we\u2019re far more disappointed when a promising series falls short just inches from the finish line.\\n\\n\r\nNine out of ten times, the things we watch are mediocre at best. Stuff that\u2019s so average that it takes all of our willpower just to struggle through a normal review; talk about some story, mutter about some character, drag on about some animation and call it a day. But then something like AnoHana comes along, something new, something exciting, something to sink our teeth into. We may end up enjoying it, we may not, but the fact that it had piqued our interest meant it had already established itself as something special, something good enough to be able to be improved upon in the future, something we WANT to spend time thinking about, something actually WORTH criticizing.\\n\\n\r\nThink of this review not as a \u201ceverything that was wrong with AnoHana\u201d review, but as a \u201cAnoHana was this close to being a true masterpiece, I found myself taking time out of my busy schedule to watch it twice and write up this critique, if only it had improved on these points, I might have given out my first ever 10/10\" review. In fact, consider this review a praise by exception, in that everything I DON'T mention is absolutely friggin' brilliant. That's a LOT of stuff.",

            "content": "\"Oh no, here come the tears!\"\r\nAnohana was a fantastic, emotional story of loss that struck all the right heart chords.  Anyone who has abruptly lost someone premature in their lives can relate to this series.  What it does, it does very good in fact... And I really started empathizing with the characters like I knew exactly what tragedy they had gone through.  All of the characters and their motives were believable, and it made for one enjoyable experience.\r\nAlthough Anohana only had 11 episodes to get it's point across, I had no problem understanding any part of the plot.  Six kids, inseparableit seemed were devastated when one of them was tragically killed in an accident. Now they all gather back several years later to attempt to send off the memory of one of their best friends by granting an eternal wish.  The exact details of Menma's death were never explained, but it was unneeded.  The writers did an incredible job of making that information irrelevant.  The subject was so sad to even talk about,  the characters all got fragile when they started talking about it.  \\n\\n\r\nI can't help but think the writer had some personal tie to a similar situation like had transpired in the series.  It seemed so gripping and personal to me.  Especially near the end, none of the characters wanted to let go of the memory they had of Menma, and often had trouble coming to terms with their own personal guilt.  I'll just say it takes a lot to make me cry, but at the end as the closing theme played, I lost it.  Incredible, original and emotional storyline.\\n\\n\r\nLike I previously stated, all of the characters in Anohana were believable... and it made the show that much better.  The main, Jintan struggled constantly between wanting to move on and wanting Menmas memory and love to stay with him forever.  He is obviously stricken by what had happened that day, and leads a very closed off life because of it.  However, Jintan opens up more and more as the show continues.  I love the growth he had even through such a short amount of time.\\n\\n\r\nPoppo reminds me a lot of myself.  He handles grief by putting on a \"everything is ok\" fa\u00e7ade, which the others mistake for him just being a goofy individual.  Deep down is more than likely a sad grieving man desperate to make amends with his regret from that day.  Yukiatsu kind of rubbed me the wrong way, but his character was still strong and understandably jealous of Jintan.  The only strange thing I thought about the characters were how they all filled in a strange love triangle of sorts.  I felt it was unnecessary to write in love interests of 10 year olds... And after years later their feelings were all still so strong.  A bit odd.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was very good in this series, but nothing buzzworthy.  I thought it was a little strange how they made Menma age, but still not quite as much as everyone else.  I'm not sure what the artists were going for here.  The opening was also alright, but didn't feel as as fitting as the ending song (which I felt was very good).  Especially how it was incorporated into some of the episode's conclusions.  \\n\\n\r\nI think it's safe to say that after all of the action animes I've seen recently, it was really nice to see Anohana.  Even with as blubbery as I was at the end, I felt it showcased the feeling of loss and grief to the best extent possible.  I would recommend this anime to just about anyone, especially those who enjoy heart-felt stories.  Loved it!",

She is not the all shy \"Anaru\" Jinta and Menma used to know anymore. \\n\\n\r\nMatsuyuki Atsumu (Yukiatsu) and Tsurumi Chiriko (Tsuruko) are different. They are now students of a very good high school. Both got themselves absorbed in school and are taking life more seriously as anyone should. But in the process, they have become distant too.\\n\\n\r\nHisakawa Tetsudo (Poppo), who was the smallest of the childhood friends, is a big guy now. He has grown interest in 'erotic' stuff, well, any teen of his age should be interested in stuff like that.\\n\\n\r\nWith everyone drifting apart from each other over the years, Menma is left with shock as she met her childhood friends after so many years. She thought everyone would remain the way they were during those colourful summer days. And now, she insists that everyone should get along just like before. A wish she has unfulfilled and wants Jinta to grant it for her. Just that, she has no idea that her childhood friends have all drifted apart because of none other than herself, ever since that day in a summer she left them. For all eternity.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being in its very first episode of an 'Anime-Original' story, Ano Hana caught me off guard as I wasn't expecting such a sad story to unfold. \\n\\n\r\nAs the name translates, \"We still don't know the name of the flower we saw that day,\" it is understandable after the first episode that the \"We\" is the five of them and the \"flower\" is Menma, their childhood friend who was the slowest of the lot, but was an inseparable member that kept them together. Only after she was gone, they realized it as their bond fell apart.\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning, I was kinda annoyed the way they started the anime thinking it will be yet another loli-chara anime. But it all made sense after I realized she is an existence made by Jinta's imagination, the Menma who died so young, that everything she does is nothing more than the shards of  memories Jinta has. She might have a physical appearance of a teenager, but everything about her remains exactly of the Menma Jinta got to know, making her the only one unchanged after so many summers have come and gone. But is she really an existence made by Jinta's imagination? Her existence around Jinta is so profound, that I was unable to tell.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so brilliantly portrayed in the very first episode, you can already tell them apart. You can already see their inside like a mirror. Despite all of them showing they have moved on since that summer day, their facial expressions say otherwise. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is so nicely paced and gently told with flashbacks and fond memories, I don't see places where it might improve to get your attention, yes, it is that good. Noitamina at their very best.\\n\\n\r\nThe character animation style is nice. Exactly like Toradora. The background is very detailed and it is one of those shows you wanna see in glorious 720p resolution at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are nice and the lyrics go wonderfully well with the storyline so far.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of nice slice-of-life anime or in general, looking for a very good anime, then this should be your auto-pick of the spring season. Ano Hana left me with an impression powerful enough to make me write a review just after completing episode 1.",

            "content": "I've heard of depressing animes being \"stupid shit\", because feelings and emotions are such \"garbage\". No, I disagree. If pulled off with realistic character psychology, such \"depressing animes\" may teach a viewer a lesson. Any anime can teach a viewer a lesson.\r\nSo, why do we care about AnoHana? Simply, because of death's inevitability. AnoHana portrays different ways in which people cope with a death, whether through blaming oneself, becoming a shut-in, or obsessively buying anything in relation with the deceased one. These examples presented by AnoHana helps us delve deep into characters.\r\n\"Jintan\" has the core of a leader, but Menma's death has made him ashut-in, as it is his way of coping. However, he shows leadership in several parts throughout the 5 episodes, but he's just unsure of his ability to lead after Menma's death. He acts as a leader that had just been defeated. On the outside, he looks like a messed up person. However, he is dependable because he is true to himself.\\n\\n\r\n\"Anaru\" is a dependent person, struggling to fit in with society and reaching conformity. Little does she realize that the path she is going down does not lead to happiness, because she is preventing herself from expression and self-freedom. She actually like games and being at home, but she decided to stop doing that because it doesn't help her reach \"normality\". According through direct dialogue, it is said she is easily influenced by others. I agree, because the concept of \"normality\" is created by others.\\n\\n\r\n\"Yukiatsu\" is the most messed up dude in this show. On the outside, he is a charming honors student that seems to have a great future. However, his unstable core depends on either a person and/or a dream. For example, his dream of being with Menma is ruined by her death. Now he couldn't depend on anything in regards to that situation. He fell apart. But he creates a facade of a responsible and dependent guy so he won't be looked down upon. \\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty more characters a viewer would get to know.\\n\\n\r\nThat message I'm getting from this show is that when somebody dies, or anything bad happens, breathe in, accept the fact, swallow it, maybe cry, breathe out, and keep living.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, the art is brilliant...\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is brilliant...\\n\\n\r\nAnd I enjoy it a lot, except for the beginning. Sure, maybe to hook the nasty people out there. But oh well, it's a great show with deep characters, and has a message. Why should one watch this show? What is the purpose?\\n\\n\r\nMy guess, it's to deliver a message saying: Let's not forget the dead, but let's not obsess over it, either.",

            "content": "What do you do, when you suddenly see a ghost of a person that you were close to? Most people would think it's just their imagination or the effect of stress. But what if your mind doesn't play tricks on you and you really encounter a ghost from the past? AnoHana plays with this idea. The story starts out on a usual day for the shut-in Jinta, who suddenly sees the ghost of his childhood friend Menma. Menma tells Jinta she has a wish that she wants to be granted by him. And from here on, Jinta's unusual summer starts.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story itself centers around thesix members of the Super Peace Busters, which was seemingly disbanded after the death of one their members. At first you'd expect that the story revolves around Menma and her wish but the truth is, the story tries to center around the members' lives and the way they were affected by the death of their friend and the show does a sloppy job with that. Of course true friends wouldn't leave each other in times of need. So why were the Super Peace Busters disbanded? Obviously there are more reasons behind that than the death of their friend.\\n\r\nI personally thought that story would be a coming-of-age story, where the characters deal with the problems of becoming adults and finally dealing with the death of their beloved friend. And boy was I wrong. Instead, the show turned out to be a love story pretty soon and the romance became the major driving force of the entire show. The mystery behind Menma's wish didn't unfold until the last episode and tension has been lifted so suddenly, at first I didn't know how it happened. The story itself moved forward pretty slowly, until the last 3 episodes, where the pace suddenly changed and everything was wrapped rather quickly up in one final episode. Not to mention many questions were left open and many were left unexplained.\\n\r\nThe first 4 or 5 episodes were very promising, but after them, the plot went down the drain pretty soon and was dragged out for too long. I think the story could have been told in roughly 6 episodes, and then we could have been spared of all those unnecessary scenes that were dealing with the love polygon between the characters. It's a pity that they wasted 11 episodes on a story that was worth roughly 6 episodes.\\n\r\nThe reason why AnoHana became popular is the romance and the fact that you could ship many characters together. Most of the characters rethink their relations to the others and since the cast is half male half female, it is inevitable that some of them play with the thought of starting a relationship with someone other from the Super Peace busters.\\n\r\nThe plot wasn't really planned out from the start and it seemed the writer didn't know what to do with the 11 episodes he or she got, the pacing of the story made this obvious. This problem affects most of the original anime shows and AnoHana wasn't an exception either.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOne of the major strong-points of the show. The animation is consistent, the backgrounds are well drawn. This is no wonder, since the anime was originally meant to attract tourists to Chichibu city and I think that AnoHana managed to capture the beauty of the region pretty well and reached its goal with this.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe background music fits in the show perfectly, it was very well done. The opening and ending songs are very catchy and perhaps they are the best of the season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere are 6 main characters in the story. The creators could have used 6 episodes to explore their backgrounds and the nature of their problems, but the show wasn't able to do this either. I would have really liked if we could have gotten more info about Chiriko and Poppo too, since they were as important as the other four. The characters aren't any special and there is little to no character development throughout the story.  Not to mention everyone is emotionally so unstable, that they can break into crying every now and then. This became very annoying especially in the last two episodes. The conflicts between them feel over-exaggerated most of the time and everyone runs in circles until the very last episode. But the execution of the last episode was so terrible, I can even tell the exact moment when all the problems are suddenly solved. The character interactions are melodramatic and take everything to the extreme. As I was telling earlier I was expecting a coming-of-age show, so I thought maybe the characters were going to discuss their problems and try to find a solution to them, but all the cast was doing was crying and complaining about their issues throughout the story and they didn't even care about the things the others were saying. Without analyzing characters I must say, that they weren't original, the show just managed to re-use some common and popular character archetypes. They are rather easy to forget.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis show makes a perfect job on summoning emotions from the viewers and fills the holes of the plot with the tears of the viewer. It started out as a promising drama but failed to live up to its high expectations. But this might be a good start if you're unfamiliar to dramas, because AnoHana heavily relies on the sympathy that you feel towards the characters and takes you on an emotional rollercoaster and sucks you in to the story easily. If you had experiences with dramas before, I suggest you skip the show, because it\u2019s forgettable and has many flaws that might disturb you and the rushed ending basically ruins the tension that has been building up since the beginning. Overall I say that AnoHana is a mediocre show, that had potential, but failed to exploit it, but despite this it became very popular. If you like shipping in general and crying over love stories, AnoHana is the anime for you.",

I was going to sum this up in one word, but I realized that no single word in the English language does this piece justice. \r\n  Since if you're looking at this page, I'll assume that you will have some idea of what the story is about, and that you're into this genre. In that case, to make it short, this is absolutely worth watching.Having only watched the first episode, I find this show quite promising. In fact, I can honestly say that it is the best first episode I've ever seen. Even masterpieces such as clannad and elfen lied did not contain so much emotions in one episode. This first episode is at least as good as the first episode of five centimeters per second, and considering that it's a whole series and not a movie or OVA, that is quite impressive.\\n\\n\r\n  I know a couple of people who are not used to this kid of a character design, but if you're one of those people, you'll get used to it, and the background is quite good. \\n\\n\r\n  My only concern, is that such an impressive first episode might bring too much of an expectation for a great ending, which seems quite hard considering how fast paced the first episode is. I hope this series doesn't lag on for 20+ episodes, it doesn't seem to have enough material to fill in that much. If this series nails the ending at say 12 episodes, it may just become my all time favorite, and one of the best animes of all time.",

            "content": "I don't often follow currently airing shows. It's usually hard to tell which shows are genuinely good until the hype dies down a bit. But under intense peer pressure, I started following a certain series this season. That show is \"Deadman Wonderland\". To cut a long story short, it sucked. So to deal with the disappointment I decided to follow another series, the sleeper hit \"Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai\", which apparently translates roughly to \"We Still Don't Know the Name of That Flower We Were Smoking When We Came Up With This Title\". Something like that. With atitle that long, no wonder everyone just calls it \"AnoHana\" instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I chose AnoHana is because while everyone around me was talking about \"Deadman Wonderland\" and \"C\" before the season began, those talk quickly became dominated by AnoHana soon after the season got under way. And as the show also looked like a drama that isn't bursting with moe juices, I honestly thought it was going to be awesome.\\n\\n\r\n...but it's not.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is not to say it's a bad, or even mediocre series, but while I definitely think the positives outweigh the negatives, I certainly don't think Ano Hana is a show that deserves all the praise it's been garnering.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, let me get something off my chest: having recently been annoyed by the spontaneously violent, clingy, cheesily cheerful, hyperactive white haired girl Shiro from \"Deadman Wonderland\", I was dismayed to find a clingy, cheesily cheerful, hyperactive white haired girl in AnoHana too. If you extracted everything that's annoying from Shiro and put it into a new character, you would essentially end up with Menma from AnoHana.\\n\\n\r\nAnd unfortunately, Menma is one of main characters of the series. In short, AnoHana is about this exceedingly annoying ghost girl Menma returning to the world to make her childhood friends' lives miserable.\\n\\n\r\nOk ok, I jest - it was only me she made miserable... her friends were already miserable to begin with, and her re-appearance just brings their problems into focus. These group of friends, who collectively called themselves the \"Super Peace Busters\", had drifted apart after the unfortunate accident involving Menma that left them all mentally scarred in one way or another. But her return succeeds in bringing them back together again, and in doing so opens up the old wounds that never really healed. \\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, I should mention that there're a couple of catches in the set up. The first one is that only one of Menma's childhood friend can see her - and that's the main character Jinta (but this gets a satisfactory explanation). The other catch is that she apparently returns in order to get her wish granted... except she can't remember what it is (which smells like a bullsh*t plot device to me), and so they spend the series going on wild goose chases in order to make this unknown wish come true and thus help Menma achieve nirvana.\\n\\n\r\nThis second catch helps to illustrate one of main issues I have with the series - though the concept itself is promising, the story is over reliant on convenient plot devices. In the short space of 11 episodes, I counted at least four or five major plot devices being used to keep the story on its intended track, resulting in some quite exasperatingly un-natural plot progression, not to mention some massive plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem I have with AnoHana is its melodrama. It may not have it by the bucketload, but it does have it in spades. The \"Super Peace Busters\" sure live up to their name, as whenever they come together, the peace is bound to be busted at some point. The dialogue and character interactions would often take up baffling turns that inevitably lead to lots of confrontations, angst and tears. I guess if you try hard enough, you can come up with reasons for why a character say this and does that etc, but at the end of the day, the way it all comes together just doesn't feel quite right to me. I can often feel the tug of melodrama taking the flow of conversations etc off their natural course.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana's habit of overcooking promising drama into melodrama gives me the impression that the makers are a little insecure about the potential of AnoHana to move people, and so felt like they had to work it harder in order to cement its idenity as an emotional drama. But the thing is, I feel AnoHana a show with enough good material and interesting ideas that it doesn't NEED the melodrama to make it tick. A good example of this is during final episode, when the realisation regarding Menma's situation dawned on her friends. In all honesty, it was a great moment, perhaps the best one in the entire series... and then the girls started screeching and grappling at each other and completely ruined the mood. What the hell were the makers thinking??\\n\\n\r\nBut while I was complaining to my friends about my disappointments regarding this series (as well as this overrated experience of following currently airing anime), I was struck by a sudden realisation: in spite of its shortcomings, I really WANTED to like AnoHana, and kept desperately hoping the show would get it right. It's a striking contrast to \"Deadman Wonderland\" where I couldn't care less what happens. Despite AnoHana's frequent heavy handling of drama, there's a sincerity about what it's is trying to achieve. Also, being a nostalgic person, the strong sense of melancholy about the show really speaks to me. The bittersweet joys of getting together with old friends and briefly re-living the carefree days of childhood, the aching sense of loss as you realise things can never quite be the same again... these are all feelings that the show manages to convey very successfully.\\n\\n\r\nThe role that the background music plays in creating the poignant moments in AnoHana cannot be underestimated. While the show itself can be accused of trying too hard at times, the same accusation certainly cannot be levelled at the music. Simple, and yet quietly evocative, it barely put a foot wrong throughout the series. In fact it's hard to fault the music in AnoHana at all - the opening and ending themes are both very solid songs, which is quite rare in anime as at least one of them is a dud normally.\\n\\n\r\nGiven everything AnoHana has going for it, it's a real pity that it isn't a lot better. Perhaps, given the length of the series, the makers made the decision to rely heavily on contrived plot devices in order to keep things moving along, and on melodrama as a shorcut to character development. But some things are not meant to be hurried, especially when some of the problems the characters have are quite bizarre, and the hurried execution just made them seem more random than anything else. However, it is a show that deserves some credit for its good intentions and powerful ideas. In some respects it reminds me of \"Cross Game\", as the two shows have some overlapping themes, particularly in the early episodes of AnoHana. \"Cross Game\" though, does it so much better.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, this whole following currently airing show thing has proved to be quite a disappointing experience. Don't think I'll be doing it again in a hurry (unless I succumb to peer pressure again). On the plus side, finishing a show so soon after it airs did briefly make me feel like I was down with the kids for once...",

            "content": "In this review I will defend the claim that \"Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai\" is an absolutely terrible show.  It is well known that this show get's a lot of positive attention.  At the time of this write-up, it is currently ranked 42nd on the site overall (or, if the site had good programmers, 39th since Gintama 2015, Unlimited Bladeworks season 2, and One Punch Man are above it and have not even aired any episodes), with a weighted score of 8.70.  It is often discussed in forums as being a tear jerker.  Indeed, therewere points where I simply couldn't stop the tears of laughter from flowing down my face.  This is a spoiler-filled review.\\n\\n\r\nAno Hana begins with a boy (Jinta) hanging around a house.  There is an immature, white-haired girl pestering him.  It turns out that she is the ghost of a girl who died in an accident ten years ago. Her name is Menma, and she has come back to earth to fulfill her wish, just as soon as they find out what it was that she was wishing for. His father's non-reaction to Menma's antics, and a visit from Jinta's friend (Naruko Anjou) suggests that only he can see her, but that she can physically affect things.  In other words, the only element of her non-corporeality is that she is invisible and cannot project her voice.  She is in no other way a non-corporeal entity, and is LITERALLY just a normal human, except not visible to anybody but Jinta.  She can pick things up, and she can eat things, and when she jumps on Naruko her weight is felt.  \\n\\n\r\nMenma is portrayed as a very sweet, wonderful little girl.  Ignoring nitpicky aspects about how annoying she is, let us examine the larger picture.  She is haunting a childhood friend until he spends copious amounts of energy fulfilling her unknown wish.  To me, this negates any \"cuteness\" she may possess and makes her a menacing turd.\\n\\n\r\nThe above was merely a subjective issue I had with the show.  Now, let's get to the biggest objective issue that I have already alluded to earlier: the fact that Jinta can prove his assertions to everybody, literally, by handing Menma any object whatsoever and pointing out the levitating object.  In fact, you could show that it's Menma, and not some other supernatural entity, by draping anything over her body that would reveal the shape of her body.  You could even splatter her with mud or paint and you could basically be able to see her just walking around.  This is a huge issue because he doesn't do this for the vast majority of the show, and the vast majority of the melodrama can be traced to this plot point.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot point starts off as a background thing that could more or less be rationalized away in the first few episodes.  Perhaps she cannot do physical things unless Jinta is around, but that's not true because of the scene where she jumps on Naruko and her weight is felt.  Perhaps she is limited in some other way.  Maybe the things that she touches and cooks are also only visible to Jinta.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show transitions into it's middle section, these rationalizations become more and more difficult to contrive.  It would be one thing if this didn't affect the character interaction very much, but nearly every tension and grievance can be traced back to the fact that Jinta cannot muster up the 2nd grade level brainpower required to prove Menma's existence.  The entire time, I was assuming there was some technicality, but situation after situation confirmed that Menma can just move stuff around at will, as she demonstrates by opening a door (and everybody in the room noticing), knocking stuff off of tables, other people feeling her weight when she jumps on them, and her moving a light and then everybody remarking how the wind couldn't have possibly done it.  There is even a sequence where Menma tries to communicate with people and is actually able to place phone calls (but her voice messages aren't there since only Jinta can hear her voice).  Meanwhile, the old friend group has a long stick up their collective asses about whether Jinta is just outright lying, and large amounts of time are devoted to melodrama derived from this.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several times where Menma is in the room with Jinta, reminiscing with somebody else about the wish situation.   Hey... hey idiot... just hand her a thing... hand her literally anything... hey... you can remove all doubt by picking up those chopsticks over there, and then saying \"hold this\"... you can immediately resolve half of the plot... right now.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, you're still holding out hope that the show will ignore it and you have to come up with your own rationalization for it, or that the show will explicate some as yet hidden concrete reason as to why Jinta cannot provide evidence for his claims.  Nope.  The worst possible thing happens: he finally has her just hold objects to prove his claim.  In episode 9.  They even try to rationalize it away by using a character to conjecture that Jinta wanted Menma to himself.  Then what was the point of his endless pleading for the group to just believe him in the prior episodes?  Essentially, the resolution of this simple plot hole takes six of the eleven episodes.  I say six because it is not a central plot point in the first two episodes, whereupon it then becomes important, and then isn't resolved until the 9th episode of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nLet's get to the second worst aspect of the show: the characters.  We have already shown that Jinta and Menma are terrible characters.  We also know that the average IQ of the entire friend group hovers around 40 by dint of their inability to devise any experiments demonstrating the existence of a ghost that can be seen and interacted with by one person and can move physical bodies like a normal person.  Moving away from the plot hole (which by itself ruins the entire show) the dynamic between the characters in the group (which is called the 'Super Peace Busters' or SPB) is as follows: two of the males are in love with Menma (Jinta and Matsuyuki), one (Hisakawa) is just a chill dude and the only one to suggest that Menma could just hold something, and the two remaining girls are left wondering why two males are still in love with a girl who died when they where about 5 years old.  However, this doesn't stop them from wanting to date them.  \\n\\n\r\nA prominent theme in the show is the guilt that all of them feel about the circumstances of their group the day that Menma died.  Jinta is a broken human because he defensively argued against accusations of a crush and called Menma ugly, just like every 5 year old on the planet.  Matsuyuki is still intensely in love with Menma.  In fact, he keeps a broom with a white wig in his closet and frequently takes it out to sniff it; and then runs out in the woods in a cross-dressing cosplay of Menma for multiple consecutive nights.  The last two sentences were not a hyperbole or a joke.  Hisakawa is the best character, the only one who suggests any way of proving Menma is there prior to episode 9, and the only one whose past (actually seeing Menma get carried down the river and drowned) actually warrants the amount of sadness he exhibits (and he is still less sad than the other group members by orders of magnitude).  Anjou has a crush on Jinta, and Tsurumi has a crush on the cross-dressing creep.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot hole and terrible characters make the melodrama hard to care about, and it's poorly executed anyways.  The show doesn't actually show you anything sad.  Instead, it has characters cry so that they can beat you over the head with a metaphorical hammer that says \"ITS SAD, WE SWEAR! CRY RIGHT NOW!\".  You can feel the writers using the crying characters because you don't actually feel sad: you have to be told that something is sad.  Nearly every scene in the entire show is melodramatic, which means that the characters only speak in lines that are emotional jabs at one another.  At virtually no point do we see more than one consecutive minute of logical, level-headed discussion.  Nearly every scene of the last three episodes is insufferably overdramatic, and by the end of the series everybody is bawling all the time and screaming out their feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first ever review.  Why did I decide to write this review?  I chose to write this review for one main reason: it is the most divergent my opinion has ever been from general consensus about the quality of a show. I am in no way the type of person who diverges on opinion for the sake of divergence.  In my opinion, if a show is in the top 100 on MAL, it is probably a very enjoyable show.  I also believe that shows with higher ratings are generally better than shows with lower ratings.  Popular anime is probably popular because it has good elements in it. I was genuinely shocked at the appalling quality of this anime and cannot possibly see why everybody would think that it's even watchable, let alone near perfect or perfect.  The only saving grace was the better than average animation, which prevented it from being a 1.",

            "content": "Updated in response to Uriel1988 1/01/2012 Happy New Years!\r\n[Hello,\r\nHaving just read your review on Anohana, I'm truly saddened to see you didn't enjoy it, at the very least you didn't buy into any of the hype. But more on that later, the main issue I would like to point out is that I don't agree with you on a couple fine points. First off, the series sets no lofty goals, it's flawed with execution errors and plot holes undoubtedly, but its base method in itself is its simplicity. Like you stated, it's a story of loss in a form of a \"ghost story\". I don'tsee it as a profound series at all, in fact, it often lacks in presenting a serious tone. However, for someone who can step into the characters' mindset, the technicality and surface value of the anime is rendered forgivable, reason falls apart in the face of emotions. And I believe it's not fair to only judge it from your eyes. Especially when you claim most people in real life eventually forget about such a \"loss\" as day-to-day routines and just life in general forces us to forget. Which normally I would more then agree with you on, we see it happen all the time e.g the death of a relative/loved one or the shock of a sudden  undue revelation. However, keep in mind these are indeed kids you're talking about. And no matter how you argue, children are at their most vulnerable age, they soak in every detail and every event influences their personality. From my personal experiences and working with many mentally challenged individuals, I can tell you it's no small thing to have someone/ something you love taken away, especially with all the implications of painful realism, forcing decisions upon unanswered questions. Without a doubt all individuals react differently and I can't say such a generalization of yours can be made. And additionally, I don't believe that all the characters' inability/ or at least difficulty of moving on is hinged on the fact of how \"perfect/wonderful\" Menma really was. Think of it in a child's perspective instead of an adults'. And add that to the fact of how her death marked the end of innocence for all those involved and the beginning of regret, so many words left unspoken, the true manifestation of loss/grief with no way to set things right. Then tell me if it's simply normal to walk away, that might be the case in today's modernized western world but it's not within the culture of the Japanese. They don't blot out the deaths of cherished family/friends, but instead pay their respects to something that clearly defines what they are to that day. That being said, I clearly understand your position on this anime but am having difficulty just accepting it, I loved this anime not for what it is but what it provided me as a medium, the joys of adolescent friendship preserved, the remembrance of certain things I thought had left me, rediscovering elements I've clearly needed to think more upon.]\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Review:\\n\\n\r\nIf you're reading this, it means you have no life.\\n\\n\r\nRead on if you dare... All jokes aside, if it takes you this many positive reviews and what-not just to convince you to pick this series up, then I have no words to say.\\n\\n\r\n*But, however, if you're like me and like to read over some of the reviews of your favorite anime then proceed. (Warning: I'll be including as little plot summary as possible.)\\n\\n\r\nAfter the completion of this work of art (Yes, in my opinion it's that great) there's only one phrase I could write.\\n\\n\r\n\"This anime defines the reason why I watch anime.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo much so that I didn't even bother writing a cliched philosophical statement regarding this work's main theme and/or problem. \\n\r\nFor those who ignored my first statement and still wish to continue -It's best to go in with no expectations and no prior knowledge of the plot... It'll make it even more amazing. If that's possible.- \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, after deciding to place this among the top of my \"planned-to-watch\" list I had very high expectations and was ready to judge harshly if necessary. I can be a cruel sadistic bastard when it comes to something that I find dry and overly lacking in innovation. However... even I'm surprised at how badly I contracted brain damage. I went in with my many preconceived notions (Is this just another tragedy?) and cognitive biases (If it's repetitive material then I'm going to hate) (My friends are probably up to their usual \"Freak of the moment\" rants).\\n\\n\r\nThe end result? I was still absolutely floored.\\n\\n\r\nNow time to analyze:\\n\\n\r\nIs it original? Perhaps, but it still had many of the elements found in other less-than-original-anime. And what are those? The setting for one. Childhood friends centering around a memory-ridden landmark. Slight plot-holes due to the rapid transformation of adolescence characters into adulthood. Transition was done quite well and even the middle episodes were quite interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nIs it life-changing? Few works are. But this one could perhaps edge out one or two of the masterpieces. Although there's only 11 episodes there's more than one pivot point in the anime where raw tendrils of earth-shattering thought are summoned from even the dullest of minds. (No offense, I don't mean dull. Just dense in the metaphysical criteria) You feel this sort of fire and restlessness from a simple scene. There is definitely power in Anohana to be witnessed.\\n\\n\r\nIs it emotionally provoking? Sometimes, but there is also a smooth liquid quality to most of the story. The beginning started strong. I was immediately hooked. You sort of get used to the quality of the scenes. It becomes mentally harder and harder to draw yourself away from each and every little detail.\\n\\n\r\nIs it informative? Critical issues are addressed but this is not one of those slice-of-life portraits. But if you mean informative in terms of sheer joy and gratification you'll be hard pressed to find another that is both serious and light. \\n\\n\r\nWhy exactly is this anime so damned good?\\n\\n\r\nI guess it all goes back to the holistic representation + the sum of all its parts. The message is almost starkly dismally hopeful, pardon the oxymoron. You dream of life for the characters but at the same time you are sad because of the result. The story-line is balanced and well construed. There are almost no fillers of any kind and almost each little conversation and flashback plays a paramount position in the overall work. The music made starting each episode easier, as well as giving one of those joy-rides upon the completion of each sequence. The characters are quite realistic and not your typical stereotypes; They are also designed well with actual capacities for growth. \\n\\n\r\nHowever...\\n\r\nFor me at least, those were just the key points of a good anime. Not a great anime. So why did I just give it a score of 10 overall? \\n\\n\r\nAlong with many other titles I enjoy there is a goal the main characters hope to achieve. And just like those titles there should be a pleasing story that usually runs smooth while finishing the conclusion with a bang. But what sets Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokuachi wa Mada Shiranai apart, asides from it's slightly long name, is a thoroughly different approach to a traditional method. It's this style that makes Anohana so enjoyable. But how is this possible? What possible ploys and techniques from the usual suspect directors have we not seen? A profound sense of loss? Death and an unavoidable universal subject matter? A basis on a belief of afterlife and reincarnation? Psychological dilemmas and love triangles? Of course not. The truth is by the time most of us get to watching Anohana, we would have witnessed some of these more than just a couple of times. \\n\\n\r\nBy now you are probably a little tired of the reviewer for avoiding the point. Here's where you skeptics ask \"Yes, I reckon it's a good anime but why should I drop what I'm doing and give it a try?\"\\n\r\nMore than one person has already suspected this review is another one of those multi-section circular breakdowns which is a practice in the art of saying nothing. But it's missing a few things.\\n\r\n1.) Where's the statement of undying loyalty? \\n\r\nor\\n\r\n2.) Where's the \"It was damn good but I'm too cool to admit it because I'm the reviewer so I'll just pretend I didn't love this anime so much that I apparently wasted my time writing a review\". \\n\\n\r\nAnd if you didn't understand what I just wrote up there then look down.\\n\\n\r\nQuestions have arisen. Such as: I understand Anohana is probably amazing but how come you haven't explain it properly yet in your own terms? What are you exactly saying and where's that ground-breaking theory of yours at? Why should I waste my time reading this kind of wishy-washy overly florid review? (aka when I could just STARE AT THE NEXT REVIEW DOWN and read me a complete plot-based thriller or a fan's praise-fest) The answer? I don't know. At this time of writing this review I still have no idea. Ha, you think If I knew I wouldn't tell you? Probably. But once I know I'll most likely share. Until then, I'll try to abstain from writing at 3 in the morning, even if it's about my favorite anime. It would also be good if I didn't fret so much if I was being too sarcastic. \\n\r\nRest assured I loved this anime and you should too unless you didn't get past my first statement in which case...\\n\\n",

            "content": "Death of a close friend is always difficult to deal with, mainly because it always comes when you least expect it. It is especially hard to portray it accurately in any medium, let alone anime. When I first heard of Anohana, I was expecting a beautiful story about a group of friends coming to accept the death of their beloved friend and eventually becoming better people. I was sorely mistaken. Anohana is a travesty of writing and I have no idea why this deserved any praise whatsoever.\r\nStory- My first issue is, that Anohana is OVERLY melodramatic. The first couple episodes had me hooked to thecomputer screen, they gave me hope of seeing a great show but sadly I was wrong. Every episode after that is basically a crying contest. In all of the upcoming episodes, a different character breaks down in tears to get an emotional rise out of the viewer. This is not only laughable, but it boils down to poor writing and obvious emotional manipulation.\\n\\n\r\nMy second issue is the ghost herself, Menma. Menma is the star of the show, every character in the show loved her and never got over her death. I assume she was supposed to be a plot device to facilitate the development of the other characters, but this never happened at all. Instead of the characters reflecting upon themselves, we got a group of morons crying over a ghost without addressing their own problems. Wasn't that the point of the story? Moving on and becoming better people? I guess not.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is that many episodes are wasted on trying to prove Menma exists. In the first episode, Menma herself is a semi-corporeal being able to move objects around. Jinta ignored this fact and continued to think that she still didn't exist, despite objects moving around the room. This takes time away from the much needed development of character.\\n\\n\r\nMy last issue is the ending itself. Not only was it horribly executed, but none of the character's problems resolved. People were misled into thinking this was a great ending because everyone was crying and Menma, \"moved on,\" but ultimately everyone basically remained the same aside from a few minor changes. \\n\\n\r\nArt- The artstyle was pretty nice, a lot of vibrant colors and scenic backgrounds. Nothing to complain about here.\\n\\n\r\nSound- I only liked the ED, \"Secret Base~Ten years later,\" it was a very catchy and sweet song. Such a shame that the song was wasted on a horrible show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- In a show like this, the characters are arguably the most important aspect. This, however, is where the writers failed once again. The cast of this show is so unlikeable and idiotic that they failed to get any emotional reaction out of me. First we have Jinta, an NEET/social recluse who never recovered from Menma's death. He is the main protagonist of the show and a poor one at that. Jinta is so oblivious to the feelings of others that it becomes irritating just to watch him on the screen. Menma, as mentioned previously, is a moeblob with the personality of a doormat. Her one and only flaw is caring too much about other people? Isn't this supposed to be a slice of life? Aren't people supposed to have multiple flaws as opposed to just one that can't really be considered one? \\n\\n\r\nToo summarize this all up, basically we have a group of unlikeable nitwits who cry a lot, are selfish, and cross-dress. Now this wouldn't be a problem if they became better people but they never did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Anohana gets a 4/10 from me. To me, this is the most overrated show on Myanimelist. Maybe it is because people are suckers for people crying. In all honesty, that is all the show is, just a bunch of losers crying over a dead girl and never getting over it. Am I cold for saying this? Not at all. Many shows have done drama right EX: Kanon(2006) Clannad, Rumbling Hearts etc. and Anohana isn't one of them. I implore everyone who is going to watch this show to look at it with open eyes, do not be misled by the buckets of tears you are bound to see. The show has a poorly mis-managed plot, bad writing and terrible characters. I would not recommend anyone watch this.",

            "content": "After finishing Anohana, I could only think of one thing.\r\n\"So what's the point?\"\r\nThere are many positive things to say about Anohana. Its opening is well designed, featuring the characters in their past and present forms as well as hinting at their emotional problems. The theme (\"Aoi Shiori\") is not only a great song by itself, but also well fitting with the show's melancholic tone. Its ending is similarly well made, and it is sung by some of the voice actors of the cast.  \r\nThe animation/art is amazing. It is fluid and never drops in quality.\r\nThe show also does a pretty good at demonstrating characterinteraction (for the most part). It's meant to be awkward and unpleasant, given the long period of time the characters went without talking to each another after the death of Menma. And, I do think the characters feel realistic (with some exceptions). They are all deeply flawed and selfish people, which is OK. In fact, it is very refreshing to see this in anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe issue is they don't ever develop from their mistakes, or hell, develop at all. In fact, it's very debatable whether or not most of them see what they did wrong in the first place. The show doesn't go into them actually becoming better human beings. They end up basically the same as they started, only able to slightly accept that Menma is indeed dead. There's no catharsis, no growth. The only thing you get at the end of the series is screaming and crying for the sake of it. So what the hell was the entire point of the confessions, the crying, Menma coming back as a ghost- everything? Was the entire point of the show \"Haha these people are really bad human beings\"?\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is only made worse with the copious amount of melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'll be the first one to say people overuse the term \"melodrama\". Under stress, or when angered, humans will act in very irrational ways. This is natural. But Jesus Christ, the characters can just put a damn blanket on Menma and 9/10 of the drama could be solved. Jinta genuinely can't figure out a way to prove the ghost's existence. Please, Jinta, make her hold something. Anything. The object will appear to be floating. She's pretty much an invisible person. Hell, just put some paint on her and none of the characters will ever have a difficult time figuring out where the hell she is. It is insane how severely lacking the characters' mental faculties are, and it's genuinely distracting. This wouldn't be that bad by itself, except for the fact that many plot points revolve around Jinta being unable to prove the damn ghost's existence. The characters argue vehemently about whether or not she exists, even accusing Jinta of being a liar rather than assume he's hallucinating. This goes on for almost half the show, and it is extremely stupid. Eventually, the show devolves into the characters crying hysterically together and yelling about fucking nothing for most of the screen time. It's almost as if the show is holding audience cue cards, where the show tells you you're supposed to feel emotion when the characters bawl their eyes out.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, some of the characters' emotional hurdles are very unbelievable. Although I did say the characters are realistic, I say that with a grain of salt. Yukiatsu, for one, is god damn insane for little reason. He dresses up as Menma and obsesses over her, hopelessly in love with what is a walking loli moeblob. It was a childhood crush- they were 5 years old when Menma died, it's been literally over a decade. There's just no way he could still have that amount of feelings for her. It's hard to take his character seriously, which is detrimental to a drama like Anohana. His character is there just to add more drama, and he never contributes anything.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of not being able to take things seriously, it was difficult for me to empathize with the characters, mostly because the \"tragic\" event of Menma's death is pretty much just alluded to. It takes very little screen time actually developing this extremely important event. I genuinely wonder why this show didn't start with their childhood, featuring their reactions to Menma's death, with the rest of the series as a time skip showing with their hatred for one another, their eventual acknowledgement, and finally their realization/redemption. It would make a lot more sense, and the events would have more of an impact on the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Anohana is a melodrama that has way too many things wrong with it for me to give it a positive score. Certainly, I am in the minority when I say this, as at the time of writing the show has an 8.52 on MAL. However, I want to make it clear that I am not being contrarian for the sake of it. There are plenty of popular, highly rated shows I love (my favorites include Ghibli movies, Monogatari, and Jojo), but this show just didn't do it for me. For reasons mentioned in the review, I cannot recommend Anohana to anyone. If you are looking for a coming-of-age story, I suggest you to watch Ping Pong the Animation or Nagi no Asukara, and for manga, read Onanie Master Kurosawa or if you love action, Vinland Saga. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 2 (dreadful presentation of the story events, combined with the massive plothole of being unable to prove menmas existence makes it the lowest category, good concept for a coming-of-age tale though)\\n\r\nArt: 8 (what you would expect from A-1 Pictures)\\n\r\nSound: 9 (exceptional op/ed, bgs were fine too)\\n\r\nCharacter: 3 (tons of potential for these characters, but 0 development and little reason to empathize with them)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4 (the excessive crying and yelling in the second half was quite annoying, but the first few episodes were pretty entertaining)\\n\r\nOverall: 3 (I believe art and sound are not enough to save this show)\\n\\n\r\nPlease leave a comment letting me know if you have a criticism of my review. Feedback would be great.",

            "content": "I watched Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (I will call it Anohana in this review) after all the episodes had aired so I didn't have to wait for each episode. I saw a lot of posts about this on tumblr so I decided to give it a try. \r\nStory:\r\nI really liked this story. Well, the story wasn't exactly out there but it was still very interesting and I was able to watch episode after episode eagerly. The cliff hanger endings were great and I've already rewatched the whole series. The story was great!\r\nArt:\r\nThe art was indeed outstanding! The characterswere all different and easy to tell apart and they each had an appropriate set of outfits (except Menma of course). I had no problems with the art. In fact I was extremely impressed. The animation was great too. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAll the voice actors did a great job and I really love the sound track. A cry manly tears when I listen to 'Last Train Home'. The voice actor who played Anaru did superb! So much emotion! I was really impressed!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nVery interesting... I found it kind of odd, coz well, Menma died when she was a kid. She has grown like everyone else but... she still thinks like a kid. Isn't that a little awkward, I mean there seems to be something going on between her and Jintan but how is that okay, when she's still emotionally a kid? Menma's character was okay. She really was a bother to me though. All the other mains were very interesting and unique. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot! I felt like crying in every episode (welll almost every). It's definitely one of my favourites! Unforgettable anime!\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this anime to shoujo fans and people who like a good tear jerker. I want to rewatch this anime..",

            "content": "Ano Hana is quite mediocre when it comes to acquiring good themes from it. The characters are hard to relate to because their problems are extreme and unrealistic. For the love of God it is a girl they knew back in grade school, get over it already... The amount of drama is too much, real people adapt the the death of family members, they move on. But Ano Hana is like a show featuring schizophrenics who are so shaken up by the death of a friend that they have delusions about her. Ano Hana is an oasis for hopeless idealists that think that friendship andlove can last beyond death. When people die, they are no longer in our lives. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story (7/10)\\n\r\nI give the story an C, because it contains too much unrealistic emotional responses. It is basically an existentialist story about 5 teens that are unable to take responsibility for actions or feelings they had towards Menma. They are all,  traumatized (believe it or not), by the death of a friend in grade school. Now this schizophrenic main character, Jintan, can some how see this Menma and now he tries to fulfill the needs of this delusions. There will be people defending that Menma is not a delusion, that she actually has a physical body, since she needs to eat and can move things. My response to that claim would be: those moments are implied to be caused by Menma and all five friends that are alive are schizophrenics that are traumatized by the death of Menma, therefore they are all delusional. The story is way too idealistic. It is an interesting story sure, but filled with emotions that are just confusing and out of place. In other words, it felt too contrived. This device used by the writers of Ano Hana is something the English majors call BS.  \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) \\n\r\nThe art is good. It is unique the quality of the art is good too. The backgrounds are very colorful and detailed. This category and the sound category contain the least amount of bull sh**. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe music is very nice, and the use of music in parts of the anime is very nicely done. I would like to point out how artistic it is to start playing the ending theme before the episode is actually over.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10)\\n\r\nHorrible characters. Can't relate to any of them, maybe except for the father of Menma. I think the characters are so shallow because they stopped being friends after the death of Menma. Wait what? Did I hear that correctly? The great group of friends stops being friends after one friend dies? I thought friends were suppose to share the burden, clearly something they did not do or else they wouldn't be so traumatized. Therefore they are all really crappy people. Their problems and personality are very shallow, pitiful, and not worth empathizing with. I feel completely disconnected from the plot and the emotional appeal the writers try to accomplish, because these characters are so stupid. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\r\nTo be honest, despite the mediocre plot and the characters, it was quite fun watching them fail at every single attempt to reach peace with the death of Menma. I feel happy because I am not a emotional train wreck like these 5 friends. This anime is mediocre overall but it is still enjoyable to watch these pitiful people struggle with their stupid shallow problems. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\r\nAno Hana isn't a masterpiece by a long shot but it was still worth watching. I feel like every single anime about idealistic friendship, attempt at a deeper meaning through BS, and unique art is getting all the support. And I end this review with this quote. \u201cThe Masses are Asses\u201d - For Children Learning How to Rhyme\\n",

            "content": "Anohana is a story of a close group of friends that loses one of their members in an accident when they were young. After this incident, the group disbands and becomes distant. However, one of the characters, Yadomi Jinta, is still able to see the ghost of the dead friend, Menma, and has the duty of granting Menma\u2019s wish which she had wanted before she passed away in order for her to rest in peace. When Jinta claims to the rest of his friends that he can still see Menma and wishes to grant her wish together, they do not believe him and thinks he\u2019sinsane. However, as the story progresses, the situation begins to change.\\n\\n\r\nStory [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Anohana is beautiful and exceptionally well told considering it only has a short 11 episodes. A key theme of this anime would be tragedy and guilt. After Menma passes away, all the main characters carry heavy burdens on their backs for the rest of their lives as they each have something they are guilty of, whether it is jealousy in love or the inability to help and not being courageous enough. However, even if all the characters do have negative attributes, the story progresses to show that each of the characters are trying their very best to try to make up for what they did or still think. Overall, Anohana has a fluent progression in plot and does not waste any potential development.\\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nAnohana has one of the most relaxing and pleasing art styles to watch of all time. Although not intricate, the scenes are extremely close to reality and you get the feeling that you have been to the places in the anime before. Personally, I really like the art even though it did not stand out, it certainly did not fall short in this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nI really, really, really like the ending of Anohana, through all 11 episodes, I don\u2019t think I skipped it once. I still listen to it almost every time I get on the car and honestly think it might be my favourite soundtrack for any anime. The opening music, however, was quite bland and never really caught my attention.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really fall for or become overly attached to any one of the characters in Anohana, but maybe that\u2019s because I just didn\u2019t get to spend enough time with them. Despite this, all of the characters in this anime are very realistic and relatable. For example, our main character Jinta is a slacker in school and plays games all day. He is stuck in his past due to the fact that Menma is still with him and wants to be with her forever. However, he also wants to grant Menma\u2019s wish so that he can move onto the future and make a life for himself. This can be considered a representation of our life decisions and what we choose to do, for the better or for the worse.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]\\n\r\nOverall [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nAnohana is an extremely sad story but at the same time very enjoyable. This anime is a must watch for all out there that are into drama and want to be emotionally moved. It has become an unforgettable experience for me and surely will be for you too.",

            "content": "I begin this review with informing you.\r\nIf you want the full effect of this show then don't read anything about it. I just recommend to watch it as blind as you can, as long as you aware of its genres.\r\nIt's not just because every review contains somewhat spoilers but I speak out of experience. I wish I wouldn't have known anything about this before I watched it, then it would have been even better. So this is my final warning, just go ahead and watch it, ignore all other information.\r\nNow that that is out of the way, I will start by making a bold claim.\r\nThereare only 2 kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nType 1 - This type is about telling you a compelling story, with cliffhangers, plot twists and and interesting setting or theme.\\n\r\nThis is all about to make you think.\\n\\n\r\nType 2 - This type on the other hand is all about making you feel a certain way. It's not that Type1 cannot make you feel, it's just that Type 2 disregards the plot more than type1 and focuses more on manipulating your emotions.\\n\r\nThis is all about to make you feel.\\n\\n\r\nOf course you could argue there are Type 3s that are a mixture of both, or then there are weird ones that are all about art. But those could usually be categorized in one of the 2 more than the other.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is AnoHana?\\n\r\nType2 it's that simple.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana isn't about telling you this interesting story that keeps you hooked and craving for more. It's about making you feel. It is entertainment for the heart not for the brain.\\n\\n\r\nSo the right mindset to watch it would be: Turn off your brain as much as you can, and embrace the feelings that will overcome you. If you focus to much on details you will find yourself in a spot where you cannot appreciate what this show is about.\\n\\n\\n\r\n!!! Warning - Some Spoilers contained !!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana was directed by Tatsuyuki Nagai, who is also responsible for Toradora! and Railgun. But also directed Ano Natsu de Matteru and Honey and Clover 2.\\n\\n\r\nYou can see a pattern here. He likes SoL. And drama.\\n\r\nAnd he is really good in this.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Nagai, Mari Okada was responsible for the Script of AnoHana.\\n\r\nShe also worked on Toradora!, and wrote the script on Black Rock Shooter, Gosick, Sakurasou and True Tears. (as well as many more).\\n\\n\r\nYou can see a pattern here as well, she loves drama and romance.\\n\\n\r\nWith this background information we can take a look at the \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana takes place at the end of Summer in an idyllic small town in midst of Mountains and surrounds a group of Teenagers who used to be best friends in their childhood. Though a tragic event happened, in which one of their friends died, which led to the disband of the group.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story revolves around how Meiko Honma returns as a ghost to bring these friends together and get her wish granted.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise sounds already heartwarming and is maybe not something you never have seen before in some way or the other but still gripping enough to make you interested. \\n\\n\r\nThrough out the course of only 11 episodes we see the maincharacter Jinta Yadomi, who is the only one who can see \"Menma\" ghost try to come in contact with his old childhood friend again and get back on track with his life, as well as seek redemption for the burden he imposed on himself regarding Menmas death.\\n\\n\r\n11 Episodes though is far enough, and 10 would have been enough as well.\\n\r\nThe story does not drag on and is fast enough/things happen on a steady pace, that you never get bored.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not particularly complex, which is good, since it can focus completely on the plot and the characters. The viewer doesn't need to know much in advance, nor is it 100% necessary to pay attention at all times.\\n\\n\r\nThough AnoHana is farm from being plausible. There are so many things that are never answered or looked into with great detail it fills the plot with so many holes, if it was a ship it would sink the moment it enters the water.\\n\r\nBut as I said, this show is not about a great, well thought out plot. But about emotions.\\n\\n\r\nIf you disregard all the supernatural things that never get any explanation then you will have much more fun watching it than nagging on every occasion something doesn't make sense.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the ending is solid and we get a satisfying, sad but yet still happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the Story is just cute, nothing too heavy. It's about themes like, friendship, love, redemption and dealing with the death of a loved one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIt boils down to 6 characters that matter in the show, and a handful of sidecharacters that are at least mentionable.\\n\\n\r\nYadomi, Jinta (Jin-tan), is the male maincharacter, he skips school for quite some time and lives alone with his father. He is the only one who can see Menma and first thinks of her as a mere hallucination. He is stressed, not only did he lose his childhood friend he could never tell his true feelings, but also his mother due to an illness.\\n\r\nSince he is the maincharacter, we'll find out the most about him compared to other characters in the show. Not only do we have the biggest insight on his past and the way he lives, but also on his thoughts and emotions. Obviously he grows the most as a character comes from accepting Menma as real, to confessing to her and finally in a struggle to let her go, lets her go.\\n\\n\r\nHe is by far one of the most likable characters in the show, though not the most likable character I've ever seen in such a show. At least he feels somewhat new and original and I have trouble fitting him into a stereotypical archtype without thinking about it too much. If I had to, he would be the antisocial \"emo\" teenager.\\n\\n\r\nHonma, Meiko (Menma), is the second most important character. Even though the story revolved around her, Jin is still the protagonist and we get the most insight on him.\\n\r\nMenma is still like a child even though she (supposedly) has grown (but still looks like a loli). Her attitude is that of a curious happy go lucky girl with very playful character traits. She is pushy and somewhat clumsy. Compared to Jin she is much easier to identify as stereotypical character as him, but that's mostly because you are supposed to feel sorry for her.\\n\r\nI personally enjoy characters like her, and wish I'd have a ghost like her being around me, she is just too cute, both in her appearance and in her attitude.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to tell if she grows as a character since her mindset is so simple at times. Unlike Jin who turns from an antisocial emo to a strong, independent male.\\n\r\nHer change comes more from what happens to her, rather what she becomes.\\n\\n\r\nAnjou, Naruko (Anaru), is almost as important in the show as Menma, though the story doesn't revolve around her. Besides Jin she gets the most attention and undergoes the most changes. She starts of as being your typical tsundere, but is a bit more than that. She is in love with Jin and always thought as Menma, not only has her friend, but also as a rival.\\n\r\nShe grows in terms of confessing to Jin, forgiving herself and accepting Menma as the \"winner\". She learns to stay true to herself and becomes less easily influenced by those around her. Similar to Jin she learns to become less dependent.\\n\r\nShe was more likable than I first thought she'd be and I found it kinda tragic that she didn't \"win\". But it wasn't so much a romance as it was a drama.\\n\\n\r\nTetsudo Hisakawa (Poppo), is the comic relief of the show show, but turns later to become a bit more than that, though I kinda found his motives too attached and not well fleshed out. They were tagged on way to late in the series and thus never truly making him a really serious character like the others were.\\n\r\nBut that said he was good comic relief and a very likable character. You kinda feel sorry for him being the \"forever alone\" guy of the group, but they handled it well and so did he.\\n\r\nHe doesn't go through a lot of transformation but was a very important character in bringing everyone together again, also he was a true friend to Jin.\\n\\n\r\nAtsumu Matsuyuki (Yukiatsu), I personally couldn't stand him. Right from the start he is introduced as Jins childhood rival/friend who has turned to a real dick. It is revealed later on, that he didn't really overcome Menmas death either and also was jealous of the bond between Jin and Menma. Though not the most likable character, he is important and is the direct counterweight to Jin, which was very important for the story.\\n\r\nUnlike Poppos resolution, his wasn't as cheap but also not really founded in the end. They gave him enough screentime though, yet I had the feeling they didn't really know what to do with him in the end. I found it hard to see him as anything but a counterweight.\\n\\n\r\nChiriko Tsurumi (Tsuruko), the forgotten character. No really she has not only the least amount of screentime, also her backstory is explained the least. I can't really say if I liked her or not, but I feel sorry for her being so underrepresented in the show.\\n\\n\r\nMentionable sidecharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIrene Honma, the crazy mother of Menma, who also got her salvation in the end. Not much to say here.\\n\r\nAtsushi Yadomi, Jins father who is like the coolest dude ever. He is calm and lets his son work out his own way without leaving him behind. He wins the award for best dad 2011.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else isn't really that mentionable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall AnoHana has a good, l likable cast with fleshed out characters and interesting interactions.\\n\r\nThe entire cross romance thing felt like attached drama though. Especially since some of it wasn't really mentioned before ep10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana uses a mixture of warm but soft colors, emphasis realism over stylizing things and is in tradition with similar shows like ToraDora or Sakuraso no Pet na Kanojou. It didn't use any crazy techniques or ugly 3DCG that was out of place. It was overall very clean looking and had simple but somewhat realist animation.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being \"just\" a Slice of Life, Drama, AnoHana actually had some really well animated scenes. But sometimes you also got some \"quality\". I can only remember one occasion where it actually was unintentionally funny, when Poppos eyes looked cross-eyed and everything around him was super serious. Despite that, it is neither amazingly animated nor bad. Above average.\\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds were good looking but not stunning. I cannot remember any amazingly beautiful drawn backgrounds but it was always fitting and looked well made. \\n\r\nI mean, it's \"just\" a SoL, don't expect some crazy action scenes with stunning backgrounds and beautiful light effects. Well done is all you'll get here.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about character designs is more interesting, because those were done by Masayoshi Tanaka, who also did the character designs for Ano Natsu de Matteru, Highschool of the Dead, Toradora! and others.\\n\r\nI personally don't really like his style. His characters Hair always looks like one piece of cotton, rather than hair. It's way more puffy that it could be, and also he likes to use all sorts of colors for his hair, instead of sticking to more realistic ones.\\n\r\nThat aside his style is at least rememberable and you'll see the similarities in his other works (especially Ano Natsu).\\n\r\nI do give credit for Menma though. She was darn cute.\\n\\n\r\nAgain. AnoHana is not about winning awards for amazing animation, it's a cute story with cute visuals which are somewhat realistic. So don't go in and expect to be blow away.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to voiceactors AnoHana had some famous names like Haruka Tomatsu (Asuna/SAO, Shizuku/Tonari), Ai Kayano (Inori/GuiltyCrown, Shiina/Sakurasou), Takahiro Sakurai (Suzaku/Code Geass, Makishima/PsychoPass), Miyu Irino(Makoto/DenpaOnna, Kiritsugu/FateZero).\\n\r\nSo needless to say the voice acting is great as for most modern shows done but big studios such as A1 pictures.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was pretty cute, but I personally skipped it (mostly out of time issues) since I wanted to see the show. I watched it 3/11 times and maybe a 4th time considering the song was in the last ep at the end.\\n\r\nThe ending was also good but inferior to the opening in my opinion. Both were fitting to the show though. Not the best but good ones at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost is a mixture of Piano pieces, acoustic songs, sometimes mixed with hip-hop beats (don't misunderstand that, with hip hop beats I mean 4/4 with the snare on the 3).\\n\r\nIt wasn't special or anything but fitting for a SoL and was well used in dramatic scenes. Overall it was calm and melancholic, like the show itself. I think it's hard to fuck up soundtracks in well made anime nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nValue/Enjoyment:\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn MAL AnoHana is one of the top anime, and also THE top anime under A1 pictures.\\n\r\nNot my personal favorite of A1 pictures (that would be Shinsekai Yori) but I can understand why.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself wasn't anything new or special. But it was really well executed and deserves to be one of the best anime of A1 pictures. Yet I think it is overrated.\\n\r\nIt gets compared to Angel Beats a lot, and I know Angel Beats has a lot of Problems as well and they are both tearjerkers. But if I had to pick one, I'd go with Angel Beats offering more than AnoHana.\\n\r\nSo AnoHana stands among all the sad, romance/drama/SoL of the history of anime, but where?\\n\r\nIt is one of the best, yes. Tatsuyuki knows how to make a good SoL, and so AnoHana was one of his successions. It will be remembered and watched by many to come and will make many people cry, it's just that good. But not the best...\\n\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it greatly and will treasure it, but it is not as good as people say it is, at least for me. I know the problems and I am not afraid of pointing them out if I need. I just ignored them because I can enjoy both, a great story and a great emotions.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow to the Scores:\\n\\n\r\nStory\t\t7/10 (good)\\n\\n\r\nPremise\t\t2 (intriguing)\\n\r\nPacing\t\t2 (through out interesting)\\n\r\nComplexity\t1 (Simple but sufficient)\\n\r\nPlausibility\t0 (none)\\n\r\nConclusion\t2 (manly tears)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\t7/10 (good)\\n\\n\r\nPersonality\t2 (multidimensional)\\n\r\nBehavior\t1 (sometimes illogical)\\n\r\nDevelopment\t1 (mostly good)\\n\r\nMotivation\t1 (at placed tagged on)\\n\r\nLikability\t2 (great cast)\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \t6/10 (fair)\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle\t2 (Fitting)\\n\r\nQuality \t1 (mostly good)\\n\r\nBackground\t1 (well done)\\n\r\nCharacter D.\t2 (good but nothing great)\\n\\n\r\nSound\t\t7/10 (good)\\n\\n\r\nVoiceacting\t3 (top notch)\\n\r\nOP/ED\t\t2 (good op, fitting)\\n\r\nOST\t\t2 (nothing outstanding but fitting)\\n\\n\r\nValue/Enjoy\t14/20 (7/10) (good)\\n\\n\r\nValue\t\t6\\n\\n\r\nRewatch/2.S\t1 (maybe some day)\\n\r\nSentimental\t3 (very attaching)\\n\r\nHistorical\t2 (A1 pictures \"best\" work)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\t8\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\t1\\n\r\nMusic & Sound\t\t1\\n\r\nStory & World\t\t2\\n\r\nCharacters\t\t2\\n\r\nValue & Attachment\t2",

            "content": "Ano Hina has a charming premise and interesting first few episodes. A lot of times in the later of the series there are tear-jerking moments. However I was a little disappointed with how it played out in the end. Of course, I stuck with it until the end because there was something sweet about it.\r\nThere are plenty of issues surrounding the death of a childhood friend that can be dealt with in a dramatic, interesting way. However, the series relies mostly on petty high school love triangles. \"I have a crush on him he has a crush on her! Waah!\" This wasn't set up likea typical high-school drama show...why did it end up trying to be one? Especially since it had presented itself with such a promising first few episodes. I did, however, stick to it for certain reasons.\\n\\n\r\nI liked Menma enough to want to see her have a happy ending. Anaru was the best character for me, the only one who showed some semblance of development. Her character was the only one with any sort of depth, and the only one I got attached too. The other characters are mostly forgettable, particularly Yukiatsu and Tsuruko. Popo is enjoyable but he has so little involvement in aspects of the story he seems misused. Menma, is of course, an ultra-cute, joyful loligirl, but you kind of know what her fate will be from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the last episode: hated the first half and thoroughly enjoyed the second half. Yeah, I got teary. Overall, not overly depressing and perhaps maybe a little uplifting. It's started as story about dealing with loss, growing up, and moving on. While is maintained that to a degree, it later focused more on love and relationships. Without going into spoiler territory, I'll settle at an overall opinion of average for the final chapter.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, there's another thing I don't want to spoil, but it's a plot hole that made me want to bang my head on a table. We know Jintan can see Menma from day one. However, there's something about how she is able to communicate in a later episode that made me think, \"Well why the hell didn't you do that from the beginning!!\" I mean, I know lolis can be airheads, but seriously! \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it drew me in  during the beginning. The drama got lackluster later in the series, but  kept me watching because I wanted to see Menma's wish fulfilled. The last few episodes, with the exception of 10 which was a little better than the others, bumped the series down to just \"okay\" when it possibly could have been a very good and heartfelt story.\\n\\n\r\nbonus points: I really love the ED, wherein hundreds of white flowers burst into color.",

            "content": "In youth, we tend to over-exaggerate, over-analyse, and over-experience any event. That ice cream we ate for the first time as a child will never quite taste that good again; even as teenagers and later adults, we chase after these childhood fantasies, never quite giving up on finding that metaphorical \"fountain of youth.\" What's the most likely thing, then, to happen if one were to experience childhood trauma? Perhaps insanity in later life, a cold heart, apathy, denial, or maybe all of the above? What exactly does happen? Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai explores this phenomenon that happens whenwe simply can't let go of the past, because in all of us, there exists a child that yearns for the good ol' days. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen you experience something earth-shattering (that's awful) isn't the first thing you want to do is forget about it? To bury it with something, anything to get rid of those horrid memories? Don't you just want to curl up in a ball and forget reality for maybe, ever? Years have passed since a tragic accident happened between what used to be five really close friends. How do they interact? How will they react to one another if they become forced in close proximity? Isn't something so terrible it's hard to speak of it without bringing up memories supposed to be left buried? Yadomi and the gang struggle to make peace with their past, all the while finding out who they are and what they mean to each other in the present. \\n\\n\r\nI was shocked, more like flabbergasted, when the series laid out. It opened up faster than expected and completely caught me off guard. Where I thought there was a continuity, it turned out to be a broken link in the old rusted chain of the past. Maybe there weren't many plot twists; maybe the story got a little repetitive; maybe it was just a little too short. However, the anime moves fast, and you have to keep up. It really was beautiful story-telling; the truth is a dark, dark secret many are willing to risk their lives to keep hidden. Many times, it's to protect people you love or to have the burden of it on yourself. Yadomi and the gang have to learn: is it worth it to keep your true emotions hidden? Or are you actually hurting those around you for your own individualistic needs? This anime delves deeper than simple human or friendship or even love relationships. It answers questions much deeper that pervade the subconscious. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, many a time the art wasn't gloomy. In fact, it was almost like a juxtaposition of light and dark: when Yadomi was happy, sometimes the colors flitted about between midnight and sunshine. However, the majority of the time, the colors stayed neutral; but there were key moments where light had an interesting role in keeping up the story.... The characters were drawn normal, skinny, not too flashy and not to dull either. The animation wasn't disappointing in the least. I didn't see many flaws; however, nothing really jumped out at me. However, I do want to mention the facial expressions. They were accurate and went anywhere between lighthearted laughter to deadly serious in seconds. Each character had their moments, and what fantastic moments they were.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe score is high, not because of the OP and ED, but because of the voice acting. My goodness, I have never seen such raw emotion in a voice before. The pain is almost tangible; you can literally almost empathize with every fiber of the being, even if you weren't there and this isn't your life. It was beautiful, really, to hear the sounds of human emotion, of raw pain, pleasure, or sadness, to creep into the voices of each character. Normally, the voice acting is pretty sub-par, but that's because nothing compares to the depth at which these morals and lessons pierce through one's fragile childhood heart. The OP is upbeat, a little slow; the ED is sad and depressed, almost like a love song to a deceased wife or husband. It's not like I didn't like them, it's that I thought they were pretty plain, considering the weight this anime carries.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: a perfect 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPeople have blasted this anime because of how \"static\" or \"inflexible\" these characters are; how they don't change throughout the anime, and how each of them is surprisingly bland. Who in their right mind would drastically, completely change because of a trauma? I know it sounds wrong to judge others so harshly, but the reason people go into depression or turn to alcohol or drugs when they experience such trauma isn't because they changed as a person, but because they want to get out of the past. But it haunts them, day in and day out, never ceasing to be erased from the curse and blessing that is the human memory. Yadomi exhibits this through his attachment issues; Anjou through jealously; Hisakawa, through belongingness; Atsuma, through clinging to a hopeless past; Tsurumi through learning to let go; and Homna Meiko? You're going to have to find out.\\n\\n\r\nThis fantastic anime takes average kids, high schoolers, and really brings out basic qualities of a person that can't be changed from the past. Interestingly, it does so with accuracy and gusto, with plenty drama in between. The character score is a perfect 10/10 because they followed the human condition with such perfection I tend to never see. Maybe this is my opinion; maybe you are supposed to change after a series of events happen. I personally have experienced trauma; maybe not in this sort of way nor in the magnitude, but it has happened. And you don't change. That's simple and plain. You slowly turn into a shell of yourself if you don't let your emotions out from time to time. Externally, you may lose friends, become antisocial, or turn to other forms of relieving yourself. But inside, you stay who you inherently are, reliving that experience for the rest of your life, afraid to change because change is what made said event happen in the first place. So coming from personal experience, these characters really nailed that topic. Hard.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was more than astounded at what this had to offer. Originally recommended by friends, I only agreed to watch it because it was barely 11 episodes. Trust me, you won't be disappointed in the least. There was enough drama to keep you riveted in your seat, enough emotions to keep your head spinning, and even some metaphysical references that keep the story interesting as a whole. I loved every juicy bit of this wonderful show; it took the worst out of people, and could turn it around so quickly to show the best of humanity. So if you know where to look, hide and seek is a really easy game to win....",

            "content": "At first AnoHana didn't catch my attention at all. I thought it was a plotless anime about a group of friends who spend their summer with each other. When I ran out of ongoing anime I could look forward to during my week, I decided to try this one. I realized that I had completely underestimated this show.\r\nAbout the story:\r\nLike I mentioned before, I thought that there was no real plot to this anime. The reason might be that the information on the website I visited to watch the anime wasn't complete. Well, I encountered an anime that made me tear up every single episode.\\n\r\nI like how the show describes various possibilitys on how different kind of people react to the loss of their dear friend and which impact it has on them, even after a few years.\\n\r\nEvery character had their own way to handle Menma's death, but in the end it is shown that none of them has been able to be at peace with themselves. They are only able to do that once all of them have revealed their feelings regarding Menma's death.\\n\\n\r\nI apologize for those vague statements, but the rules say that I am not allowed to write spoilers, which makes the rating of the story pretty hard.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the art:\\n\r\nThe art itself isn't really that outstanding. However, it accompanies the plot really well. Every place in this anime becomes familiar during the show and we can relate them to certain events.\\n\r\nEspecially the group's 'secret base' in the forest is a constant reminder of old times and gives off a feeling of safety and home.\\n\r\nThe character's personalities are outlined by their individual character design.\\n\r\nThe artwork is pretty colorful, which supports the overall theme of summer and gives off a comfortable feeling.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis one is probably the one thing, one can praise the most. I don't know about the background music, since I don't remember it. Well, that probably means that it mixed in so well with the rest of the anime that I didn't realize it individually.\\n\r\nHowever, what I want to praise is the opening and especially the ending theme.\\n\r\nThe opening song 'Aoi Shiori' makes one start the episode with a relaxed, maybe abit nostalgic feeling, which -in my eyes- is a really important thing for this anime. \\n\r\nI am pretty sure that it was the ending theme, which made me tear up at the ending of every episode. It starts playing during the last few sentences and makes the whole thing a lot more sentimental. I also think that it was a really good choice to make the female main cast sing it. \\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast in this anime show did a really great job. They transmitted the feelings of their characters really well. I have to admit that I didn't know most of them, excluding Takahiro Sakurai. The fact that one of my favorite seiyuu voiced the anime's male hottie probably got it a few extra points.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nBecause the story is about a group of friends, there isn't such a wide palette of characters. However, that was made up by the big character development.\\n\r\nWell, the next part is going to get hard again, since I don't want to spoil anyone, so I want to apologize beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nMenma:\\n\r\n Menma died when she was a child, so even though she looks like she has become older, she has maintained the pure and innocent character of a child.\\n\r\nShe does her best to make her childhood friends become close again.\\n\r\nI think that they did a really good job giving her that kind of personality. Her appearance was probably chosen to be that of a teenager, because she is a love interest. Since it's a show with a serious plot and just as many ecchi moments as needed with a male teenage protagonist, a prepubescent love interest would have been totally misplaced.\\n\\n\r\nJinta:\\n\r\nJinta has become a shut-in because of Menma's death and the way his friends changed since then. He is the kind of teenager, who is angry at the world.\\n\r\nHe wants to grant Menma's wish because he thinks that it is his fault that she died. However, he often doubts his decisions, because he often comes to the conclusion that his childhood friends won't help him.\\n\r\nIn my eyes he represents teenagers who feel abandoned by their friends.\\n\\n\r\nAnaru:\\n\r\nAnaru has always had a one-sided love for Jinta, which made her become jealous of Menma. She can't hate her, though, because Menma is her friend and has always been nice to her.\\n\r\nShe is heavily influenced by her female classmates. She wants to be part of a group, so she adapts herself. She has an inner conflict, because she likes Jinta, who is an outsider, but does not want to be one herself.\\n\r\nShe represents teenager, who make themselves fit into a group, even if that means that they won't be themselves anymore.\\n\\n\r\nYukiatsu:\\n\r\nYukiatsu is handsome, smart and charming to his classmates.\\n\r\nHe suffers because of his one-sided love for Menma and treats Jinta in a bad way, because he is jealous of him.\\n\r\nI like the fact that despite the characteristics mentioned above, he is not perfect. As he said himself: ''I'm hot and I'm smart, but unfortunately I'm lacking a bit in the strength department''.\\n\r\nHe represents the misjudged teenager, who is idolized or envied by others.\\n\\n\r\nTsuruko:\\n\r\nTsuruko is a quiet, smart girl. She seems to be pretty apathetic to the things that happen arround her, which is proved wrong later during the series.\\n\r\nShe represents the misjudged teenager, who seems think of him/herself as superior.\\n\\n\r\nPoppo:\\n\r\nPoppo seems to be the only one from the group who hasn't changed. He is the first who believes that Jinta can see Menma and is pretty desperate to help her. the reason is mentioned later in the series and would be considered a spoiler.\\n\r\nHe represtent the kind of teenager, who acts like a happy person around others even though he doesn't feel happy.\\n\\n\r\nWell, so in the end all kinds of problems that teenagers can face are represented by this set of characters. That's why everyone who watches this series can be sure to find a character whom he/she can identify him/herself with.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of everything mentioned above i think of AnoHana as a really enjoyable anime and I would recommend it at any time.\\n",

The ending though I gotta say it's very good, it even made me shed a tear (previously I think I only shed a tear at One Piece Merry, anime wise), which is quite rare and should say something about it. The character progression for the MC is good, but most characters are enjoyable too(even if they were perverts :-p) exceptTsurumi which I found to be a bit annoying. The premise of the story is that there was an accident and Meiko Honma died when the cast was young. Now several years later she appears as a \"summer hallucination\" in Jinta Yadomi's room , a no-life slacker. From there one you will see a great character progression in Jinta and the rest of the cast over the course of these 11 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt   9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good, fluent and good to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound   9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good. It's nothing too fancy but I think it fits the anime just right.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment   9/10\\n\\n\r\nWell I gotta say  I really enjoyed this anime and the feeling of it. It delivered something fresh I guess, at least in my repertoire and I watched it all in one siting (even though I had a final the next day T.T).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is easely a great anime with very few, if no drawbacks that I would recommend to anyone who wants an anime with a very good story.\\n\\n\r\nOther thoughts & Rant :\\n\r\n-------------------SPOILER ALERT-----------------SPOILER ALERT---------------\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I do not like is that we don't know for sure what happened with Menma. I mean yes I know she fell and kinda is implied that she drowned but  how did she fell, why did she drown...Yes I know I am picky but oh well. It's not a deal breaker though and it does not take away from the overall enjoyment of the anime!\\n\\n\r\n-------------------SPOILER END-----------------SPOILER END---------------------",

            "content": "\"I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was [little]. Jesus, does anyone?\"\r\nChildhood friends often mean a lot to us, maybe because we feel they understand us better for having a longer relationship than anyone else, or maybe it's the memory of having fun without having to worry about anything. But what happens when you lose one in your early life? What happens if you're stuck in the past?\r\nThis series is about a group of six kids who had a very poor naming sense, once called themselves the \"Super Peace Busters\" as well as giving one of the girlsthe nickname \"Anaru\". Yes, that's how the Japanese pronounce \"anal\". Other members of the group are \"Jintan\", \"Menma\", \"Poppo\", \"Yukiatsu\", and \"Tsuruko\".\\n\r\nFast forward 10 years and Menma is dead, with the group almost completely split up.\\n\r\n'AnoHana' is the tale of Menma's mysterious return from afterlife to reunite the \"Super Peace Busters\".\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the first half of the story focuses on \"seishun (coming of age)\", with childhood friendship and the bond that connects the six as a major theme. The second half focuses on 'Junai (pure Love)', the unwavering love and the pain of losing someone dear, and the inability to move on with their lives.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are all suffering from Menma's death in their own unique ways, and conflicted with their own inner struggles.\\n\r\nJintan and Yukiatsu are still obsessed over Menma, Anaru and Tsuruko can't get over her because she's still the focus of the guys they love, and Poppo for always watching in the sidelines. The story really focuses on the development of the five living characters, and there are many memorable, touching moments of youth.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation in this series is extremely fluid as expected from an A-1 Pictures production. The director Nagai Tatsuyuki who worked on 'Toradora' and 'To Aru Kagaku no Railgun' is a master at presenting seishun series in anime. 'AnoHana' is set in a countryside town with a slow, gentle atmosphere, but the director manages to inspire in key scenes as usual, using dynamic animation and sudden change in pace after building up for climax in each episode. The slower scenes have interesting camera positions and composition to draw in the attention of the audience.\\n\\n\r\nSound in this series is absolutely spectacular. BGM is the single most effective element in this series in setting the atmosphere, especially enhancing the inspirational and touching scenes.\\n\r\nSeiyuu cast, other for Menma, were also extremely well done. One can tell they are all very much absorbed into their characters, and really sound like they mean it rather than just reading the script. This is especially crucial in emotional/sentimental scenes, because acting make or break a series like this.\\n\r\nThe OP 'Aoi Shiori (Blue Bookmark)' has a very catchy tune with matching vocal by Galileo Galilei and poignant lyrics. It should also be noted that \"blue\" is a part of kanji for \"seishun (\"blue\" + \"spring\")\", symbolizing coming of age.\\n\r\nThe ED 'secret base ~what you have given me~ (10 years after Version)' is a masterpiece. I was a ZONE fan back in the day, and 'secret base' is undeniably their iconic song, and one of the most memorable Jpop songs of the decade. I hate to admit it, but the vocals and the music composition in this remake has surpassed the original. Not only that, the choice of this song as ED is absolutely godly. The lyric is about the memory of childhood and dreams for the future, and also a verse about \"10 years later in August\". The original song was released in 2001, AND the story of 'Ano Hana' is about a girl returning 10 years after death, in August. The ED animation scene with gray flowers falling to colored flowers rising was nothing short of incredible. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say, this may be one of the best ED ever made.\\n\\n\r\n'AnoHana' is rather generic as a seishun/junai series. In fact, the premise of this show: \"Dead girl coming back into life, and tracing back\" is identical to that of 'Ima, Ai ni Yukimasu (Be With You)', except the girl is still much younger, and that only the protagonist can see her. And eventually, turns into 'Sekai no Chuushin de, Ai wo Sakebu (Crying Out Love, In the Center of the World)' type developments.\\n\r\nStill, it has an interesting use of plot devices, effective flashbacks, and very strong presentation. It feels like a true Japanese story and direction, and if you can connect with the characters, it's a very touching and memorable series.",

            "content": "Writing a review as I sit in a hospital bed.... DEDICATION!\r\nThis anime struck a sour cord for me when it finally clicked in the first episode what the setting was all about, because at that point it hit far too close to home for me, and if you must ask, yes one of my childhood friends died when I was in year 6(Last year of elementary school), only really difference is I'm pretty sure none of us can see her. So please be aware that there might be bias in this review, but I think my reason is justified.\r\nAno Hi Mita Hana no Nam-. Nopefuck that. Ano Hana or The Flower We Saw That Day by the English translation is about loss at a young age and how that effects people later in life, specifically the Super Peace Busters! a former collection of some no-longer-really close friends, with our main view of the story coming from the eyes of Jintan (Only nicknames shall be used in this review) an almost prefect depiction of shut-in gamer, almost never venturing outside and when he must leave his den he does so with a disguise.\\n\\n\r\nNext in the second focal character Menma an awfully cheery little thing who loves her ramen with egg mixed in and is almost inseparable from Jintan, more would be said but that enter's spoiler territory. Next on the block is my personal favorite character Poppo he is just one of those guys that everyone needs in their lives, the funny, energetic if occasionally loud dude that you meet at parties, again not much else to say without cross the line.\\n\\n\r\nFourth to the plate is Anaru who I'll say is the most deliqual of everyone, hanging around (in the words of the anime) \"Crotch loose girls\", there's something between her and Jintan but I'm not telling.\\n\\n\r\nThe fifth and sixth members of the former Super Peace Busters! I can some up in two words each for Yukiatsu, tranny and cunt (sorry but he is, at least at the start, and Tsuruko, bitch and bitch. These opinion will change over the anime but first impression are what i remember people by.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really fluid when it wants to be and there are moments when my brain clicked \"Well that looks pretty.\" The sound is par I only give it a 10 because the piano came in when it was needed.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that I noticed when I finished Ano Hana, apart from the standard fact that I was crying, was that it just did in 11 episode what other shows fall to do in 26, I think that feat speaks for itself.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.",

            "content": "First things first... This will be mah first EVER Review... plus, I wouldn't even bother calling it a review... I'd say more of a guide to why U should watch this show !! I will edit and write more when the series comes to a final. Until then, this is loosely based on the first episode, since thereis only one out !!\r\nOver the years, I've been struggling to find time to really sit down and enjoy many different Anime (oh, the joy of being a teenager again). There are soo many Animes out there, and very few good ones to say the least... I usedto be the one that watched everythang, hoping for the next big Anime in life. But w00t I found was dissappointment after dissapointment. So I started narrowing thangs down a bit... now I basically only watch new released Anime. Since those are the ones I tend to like the most. But even so... there hasn't been any Anime that has REALLY blowed mah mind, since the 2009 period. (Clannad AS, Hatsukoi Limited, Toradora etc...) A show that would gief meh back a reason to watch Anime...(except 2nd seasons of good shows) because I am not getting any younger... and where I am from, Anime is not very popular... It's considered geeky, weird and childish in many comparisons, but that's probably why I luv it so much !! Liking somethin that the majority doesn't... It becomes more \"special\" d; )\\n\\n\r\nBut now I think I've finally found it in: Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai, also known as Ano Hana. The Anime was able to shockingly surprise meh !! I was mesmerized from the gecko. The story and staff was w00t interested meh the most. The story seemed beautiful !! And I felt this was a story not only I, but mostly everyone that is growing up to adulthood can relate too. U sit back and remember how wonderful, easy and problem free, life used to be. But not only do people change, ur surroundings and way of thinking aswell. U lose touch with old friends and family, u perhaps wish u still had contact with. U get new priorities, more responsibilites, and less time.\\n\\n\r\n I mahself is blessed with still having contact with most of mah childhood friends, but I don't see em as often as I used to. Mostly during holidays etc... and even then, it's hard to find time for each other. But, not only that... people DO change, and some of mah friends that used to be all lively, and easy-going, are drenched in responibilites, rules, goals and ambitions. Not to mention, some has married and gotten children... so thangs will never be the same... NOT that this is a negative thang...\\n\\n\r\n But u still look back sometimes, wishing thangs could be more like back in the dayzz. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and art was w00t surprised meh the most. The art is exceptional good. The backgrounds, the characters, everythang is so smuuuth and detailed. And they've created the perfect setting and mood for the show. It giefs a nostalgic, summerfeel about it, but also perfectly mixes a melancholy mood in it all. The first episode gave me a huge SMILE on mah face, and also gave meh the longing for summer. \\n\r\nThe music is also very good. They have chosen the right songs to fit the mood and settings for the show. Which for meh means everythang to get out the feelings and emotions of a person. So expect a tear-jerking finale, or at least a bitter-sweet one !!\\n\r\nd; )\\n\\n\r\nAno Hana Has the same director as Honey & Clover and Toradora,\\n\r\nThe same script writer as Toradora and True Tears. Which means... I have lots of expectations for this show. It is also  an original work. Which means it's not based on any manga or game. \\n\r\nConsidering the first episode and the history and experience of the staff, I do not think this is one of the shows that will dissappoint !! Hopefully it will live up to mah expectations, and if they stick to the theme and don't do anythang to clich\u00e9, this show will most def end up in mah favorites !!\\n\\n\r\nFeedbacks are always welcome, both negative and positive !!\\n\r\nBut REMEMBER, this was mah first review... and the show is still not finished d; )\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I will be analyzing Anohana in explicit detail; you were warned.\r\nIntroductory information:\r\nI want to preface this review by stating that I seldom write reviews. After finishing this show I needed some sort of catharsis and this is the best I could do. Rather than glance at my overall rating and dismiss my opinion, please take the time to read on; perhaps your opinion of this anime will change.\r\nAnohana was created by studio A-1 Pictures, the same studio that produced Sword Art Online, Your Lie in April, and Fairy Tail (all of which I consider to be poor products). Studio A-1 Pictures has an interesting reputationamong western audiences; in that they\u2019re known for their unceasing barrage of subpar shows that occasionally becomes popular in the mainstream. Anohana is a notable example of this phenomenon. Is every show produced by A-1 Pictures bad? Not necessarily, but this one certainly is. It\u2019s among the worst that I\u2019ve seen.\\n\\n\r\nPlot summary and the primary plot contrivance:\\n\r\nAnohana follows five high school students as they deal with the guilt and pent-up frustration they feel following the death of their beloved childhood friend, Meiko Honma \u201cMenma\u201d. In the years following her death, the group of friends have drifted apart. Unbeknownst to all but the protagonist Jinta Yadomi \u201cJintan\u201d, Menma has returned from the ether to torment her perceived kille- I mean, ask her friends to help her fulfill her childhood wish. Until her wish is fulfilled she cannot pass on to the afterlife. One problem: she doesn\u2019t remember what her childhood wish is (It must not have been very important...). With that in mind, Jinta\u2019s goal is to reunite all five childhood friends with the common interest of helping Menma pass on. Will he be able to convince them that Menma has returned? Is this a shitty melodrama? The answer to both questions is a hard yes.\\n\r\nThe first (and arguably most significant) of many problems begin with the details realized in the premise. While Jinta is the only person capable of seeing Menma, Menma is able to limitlessly interact with her surroundings and leave a tangible effect on our world. Though she does not have a body and she cannot speak, she is capable of touching, grabbing, pushing, pulling, kicking, picking up, and setting down anything she sets her mind to. She\u2019s even capable of eating food and baking confectionary, tasks that dead people generally cannot perform. As it applies to the plot, Menma\u2019s lasting effect on her surroundings is demonstrated in episode one, and she doesn\u2019t utilize it to prove her existence until end of episode eight. Yes, you read that correctly. Neither Jinta nor Menma think to prove Menma\u2019s existence until the end of episode eight. What happens in the first eight episodes, then? I\u2019m glad you asked. Inconsistent treatment of the in-universe logic, love triangles, melodrama, contrived misunderstandings, overblown pathos, gossip, name-calling, fist-fighting, and crossdressing (more on that later). You\u2019re definitely in for a treat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and Characterization:\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the primary cast consists of five high school students and dead girl. A few other minor characters make the occasional appearance, but only Jinta\u2019s father and Menma\u2019s mother have a small influence on the plot. I\u2019ll touch on them briefly, then I\u2019ll address the five high school students and Menma.\\n\r\nJinta\u2019s father takes a passive role in his life. Despite being a single parent, he does not try to guide or teach Jinta. While most other anime going for a realistic tone would characterize this as bad parenting, Jinta\u2019s father is relegated to the role of the wide-eyed, unassuming, oblivious man-child. He likes cute things and occasionally cooks dinner. The father and son never bond, argue, or have a notable conversation whatsoever, presumably because it would impact the plot.\\n\r\nMenma\u2019s Mother is still grieving her dead daughter. She occasionally comments on how Menma behaved as a child and how well Menma got along with her friends. She gives the protagonists Menma\u2019s diary, which proves useful in episode eight. Aside from furthering the pathos and occasionally delivering exposition, she offers nothing.\\n\\n\r\n-Chiriko Tsurumi \u201cTsuruko\u201d\\n\r\nTsuruko is extremely judgmental and standoffish toward every character aside from Yukiatsu. She frequently berates and belittles Anaru specifically. Years after Menma\u2019s death, she remains close to Yukiatsu because she has feelings for him. She is somewhat jealous of Menma and Anaru for stealing Yukiatsu\u2019s attention. She secretly took the barrette Yukiatsu had planned on giving Menma and wears it in private. Tsuruko offers nothing to the main plot and she's quite a selfish, distasteful character. Her sole purpose is to pad the story by adding more melodramatic misunderstandings. This anime would have been much better without her, she takes away a lot of time that could have been spent on other characters.\\n\\n\r\n-Atsumu Matsuyuki \u201cYukiatsu\u201d\\n\r\nYukiatsu is frequently at odds with Jinta and often threatens violence against him. Years after her death, Yukiatsu is still deeply in love with Menma, to a disturbing degree. He is angered when Jinta claims Menma is still on earth, presumably out of jealousy. He claims he too can see Menma and crossdresses as her late at night. I wish I had made that up, but unfortunately it\u2019s true. The scene in which Yukiatsu is caught crossdressing as Menma is both easily and clearly unintentionally the funniest in Anohana. Yukiatsu does nothing to further the main plot of Anohana, the quality of Anohana would be improved without him. Like Tsuruko, he exists solely to add to the melodrama. Time spent on him could be used to expand on other characters.\\n\\n\r\n-Tetsud\u014d Hisakawa \u201cPoppo\u201d\\n\r\nPoppo is arguably the most sane, realistic character in this shitfest of an anime. Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t a shred of skepticism in the poor bastard\u2019s head. He is the first person to believe Jinta\u2019s outlandish claims and he does so without a shred of evidence, much less proof. He assists Jinta and Menma in every endeavor, and he has a goofy, amicable attitude while doing it. He is the only character that isn\u2019t caught up in an unrequited love subplot. He is the only character that has realistic thoughts, feelings, and memories regarding his childhood and Menma\u2019s death. Poppo\u2019s inclusion makes Anohana a more bearable venture.\\n\\n\r\n-Naruko Anj\u014d \u201cAnaru\u201d \\n\r\nInitially cold and distant, Anaru is skeptical when Jinta claims Menma hasn\u2019t left earth. Despite this, she tries to help Jinta in any small way she can because she still has feelings for him. She is jealous of the now-dead Menma for taking Jinta\u2019s thoughts away from her. While she is necessary for the plot to move forward, her jealousy toward Menma and unrequited love for Jinta are distracting and annoying. Any interactions between Anaru, Yukiatsu, and Tsuruko are uncomfortable and unnecessary. Anaru, like most of the other characters in this anime, is selfish and unlikable. A better show would've given her more redeeming qualities.\\n\\n\r\n-Jinta Yadomi \u201cJintan\u201d\\n\r\nInitially Jinta believes Menma is a delusion, despite her observable affect on her surroundings. Jinta never once tries to prove Menma\u2019s existence, instead he just claims she\u2019s there and holds one-sided conversations with her. He is a frustrating character to deal with, because he holds the story back for no discernible reason. After Menma\u2019s death, Jinta secludes himself and mopes around in his house. Upon her return, Jinta realizes he\u2019s still in love with Menma, and is sexually attracted to her ghost. Some point before granting her childhood wish, he asks her to stay on earth with him as his ethereal waifu. Jinta is possibly the most selfish character in this anime. His character could be improved by making him less selfish and more relaxed and amicable.\\n\\n\r\n-Meiko Honma \u201cMenma\u201d\\n\r\nMenma is the most difficult character to write about because she has no character. She is unable to ascend to the next plane, but doesn\u2019t know why, or what triggered this period of stasis. She doesn\u2019t seem to know anything at all. Though her ethereal body has aged with everyone else\u2019s, she still displays the mentality of a child. Or, rather, a hack screen writer\u2019s impression of a child. She is nothing more than a contrived child archetype. She displays no personality and the only personality trait she\u2019s given is selflessness, a trait that she (demonstrably) does not possess. Menma is every bit as selfish as the rest of the characters in this anime, or she wouldn\u2019t have returned to earth in the first place. When prompted, she tells Jinta she loves him, not that this admission means anything. She\u2019s dead, she can tell him whatever she wants and he\u2019ll be none the wiser.\\n\\n\r\nEnding of the Anime and Final Thoughts:\\n\r\nWhile the majority of this anime focuses on melodramatic subplots involving feelings of unrequited love between most of the cast members, the ending isn\u2019t a bad sendoff. The characters realize how selfishly they\u2019ve behaved up to this point and vow to send Menma off out of love, rather than out of their own desires. While the realization and acknowledgement of their flaws is good, the end result is the same, so it comes off as a bit hollow and meaningless. The characters aren\u2019t instantaneously redeemed after several wasted episodes of bickering, but the possibility of them learning from this experience is entertained. Anohana could have ended on a worse note.\\n\r\nAnohana is an awful anime with far too many unrequited love subplots (most of which are dropped), a sparse main plot, inconsistent (and frequently nonsensical) logic, overly melodramatic dialog, major plot contrivances, underdeveloped leading characters (some of which were not necessary), and inexplicable crossdressing. Unless you want to watch this bizarre, disturbed anime to try and figure out what went wrong, I\u2019d recommend you stay far away from this thing.",

            "content": "Despite all the bad things in this world,  or how the anime industry seems to sink lower than the bottom of the sea, there is always place for originally and quality content. Even though we seem to dig in a pile of charcoal, there\u2019s always a diamond hiding underneath. All in all, the summer season hasn\u2019t been particularly a bad one. We had a share of original productions that didn\u2019t work the way it had to be, we had some disgusting shows such as a 10 years old succubus princess and some other shows that you still don\u2019t know what it supposed to beabout. In other words, it was one of those normal seasons.  However, there was one anime that truly went above standards with a solid point in every aspect, and that is AnoHana.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why AnoHana is so solid is because of the direction it was given. For once, you actually know what it will be about during the first episode. No, it doesn\u2019t offer a pointless 4 episodes introduction with a beach episode in between, nor does it wander around in circle thinking what cheap trick I can use to please the viewer. AnoHana is a simple story about the lost of a childhood friend and the repercussion it had on them years later. With a glimpse of a look, AnoHana might as well be just one of those cheap dramas, but it is in fact not cheap. What makes this series above the other drama is the fact that this anime has a mission, or should I say a purpose. Really, the whole charm of it resides in the simplicity and naivety of the story. This is to say that nothing in AnoHana is overcomplicated. Only, AnoHana is absolutely not a flawless show. It does feel like the series is dragging or simply not getting to point. This is mostly due to unnecessary side plot that doesn\u2019t really develop into something concrete. In example, some sort of love triangle will develop, but this is merely as a form of emotional fan service. There are also some few scenes in the anime that aren\u2019t really needed, but it is far from being distracting. While it doesn\u2019t derivate the plot by much, the audience might find it irritating. Also, AnoHana\u2019s story falls into the category of melodrama. There is a lot of crying in this anime, but unlike some other anime out there, the melodrama is justified and doesn\u2019t feel embarrassing in any bit.  All in all, these small problems aren\u2019t enough the flip over the quality of the storyline. AnoHana has a good story and this is entirely because of the cast. Which is not surprising, since this is a character\u2019s driven show.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be direct on this, AnoHana really has a good cast. Now I am not talking about the flash backs where their children past was showcased with some childish moments. I am talking about the whole point of the anime, and that is dealing with the lost of someone who is dear to you. We all know that death in anime is often a plot element to create a mental breakdown for the main character, but it\u2019s often too deep shit for me. Now of course, there is some sort of mental breakdown in AnoHana, but nothing that goes batshit insane. It is mostly due because the characters didn\u2019t know how to adapt after the event. Thankfully, there is actually more to the characters than some mourning. Through the small 11 episodes of the show, the main cast is developed into a three dimensional way that is simply amazing. Basically, it is marvellous to see how the broken relation between them will rebuild once again. As for the side characters, they serve the purpose to show the consequences from another point of view, since there are more than friends in the life of someone. However, my main problem is with Menma\u2019s mom. Whether she is a good character or not isn\u2019t the question. It is actually her behaviour and reaction that I find a bit unbelievable.  To sum it up, a near perfect cast supported by a perfect main cast. \\n\\n\r\nProduction value doesn\u2019t have anything that is notable, but it end it is pretty much solid all way through. The animation is fluid for the most and it is beautiful supported with its background. The character design for the most part is well done. My main issue is with Naruko\u2019s bunches which looks rather silly at times. Thankfully, her hair style changes in the series so that she can actually look beautiful. As for the music, it does a perfect job at highlighting the dramatic moments. The opening song and ending song are also well fitting with the anime series. There\u2019s also a great job that is done with the voice actors. Their performance feels for the most part believable and strong.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana is a good show and there is no doubt about it. Only, even though I only pointed few flaws that don\u2019t really matter, it is not a show that is exceptional either. Mostly, this show is a melodrama that can often feel too dramatic for some viewers, so it all depends on the viewer\u2019s taste. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, in the drama aspect, it is a solid one because it is supported by a strong story and a great cast. It is truly one of the highlights of the spring season.\\n",

            "content": "A few days ago, I'd download every anime that had passable art and wasn't a complete brain-kill experience to watch, because I believed that since people took the time and effort to make it, the least I could do is show my appreciation for their (and the anime characters that I personify as real entities) efforts by watching the anime. I'd feel like not downloading an anime was missing out on a unique experience so I forced myself to watch all of them to the point where watching anime became almost like an obligative burden rather than an enjoyment. Watching Ano Hi Mita Hana noMamae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai has made me realize my mystake in that regard. It was that horrible. Each anime is certainly unique but Ano Hana was \"Uniquely Horrible\". Perhaps it's my low tolerance of bland, unoriginal slice-of-life plotline set-ups that fueled this review, but I simply hope that this review will reach out to the likeminded people out there in the world (however few there may be) to prevent them from suffering this excruciatingly painful experience. I took up Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai for the hell of it since the ridiculously long trolling name amused me. Unfortunately, it actually did give me hell.\\n\\n\r\nStory (3/10)\\n\r\nAno Hana is about this guy Jintan who was the leader of a small group of friends back some number of years in elementary school. After Menma, the one girl he apparently had feelings for, died in a car accident, he disbanded the group and everyone drifted apart. The entire point of this anime is to grant Menma, who is now supposedly a ghost that haunts Jinta with childish tantrums, her final wish that SHE doesn't even remember. Great, so we're gonna watch another Yumekui Merry plot with subpar Onii-chan no Koto art that doesn't have a single, clear, defined purpose to fulfill. No thank you. I'm not about to waste what little precious free time I have looking under garbage cans for a plot. Nor am I willing to waste hours learning about the fulfillment of her wish that requires everyone in the old gang to be present (the wish is probably something retarded like \"I wish everyone would get along again... BYE GUYS I DIED\", \"Jintan stop being a hikikomori and go get laid\", or \"Jintan I love you... *dissolves into particles\"). Even looking beyond this boring, unoriginal plot and these cheesy attempts to incite emotions from the viewer, the incompetent character/ structure development is inexcusable. Nearly half way through the first episode, I didn't know wtf was going on. If I didn't read the synopsis on wikipedia half way through, I'm pretty sure I still wouldn't know what the fok Ano Hana was about. All I know was that some girl who was apparently supposed to be dead is sitting on top of this guy. No one else interacts with her or responds to her childishness except Jinta, suggesting that she's a ghost, but in this day and age of anime revolution, who know what the hell it could have been. But seriously, I don't think I should need to bust into Linear Algebra Abstract Inter-Dimensional analysis mode just to find out why a girl is there and what the hell is going on. It's over half way through the episode. We should at least know what's going on before they start flinging cheesy character interaction crap around.\\n\\n\r\nArt (3/10)\\n\r\nThe art is truly horrible for an anime in this technological era. On top of that, the character designs are ugly, annoying, and......you guessed it.. unoriginal, just like everything else in this anime. Menma looks like someone blended Isana from Yumekui Merry and a bunch of weird looking K-ON girls with a chainsaw (seriously look at her facial design.. if that doesn't ring the K-ON bell I don't know what would). Anaru is an obvious crap ripoff of Mikoto from Toaru Kagaku no Railgun, and Jintan himself looks like a geeky shemale (what's up with the rubber band?...). I am overall unimpressed with the character design and art. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1/10)\\n\r\nIt would be inaccurate to say that I watched 1 episode since I couldn't even bear finishing that episode. In actuality I only watched about 60% of the episode. Characters... you know I just won't even...I don't even..sigh*. I've only watched 12 minutes of Ano Hana, but I could probably list so many bad things about the characters that it'll take up the entire bandwidth on this site and cause a temporary server shutdown. I'll just leave it with this: The characters are pathetic. Jintan has no backbone like 99% of all male protagonists nowadays. However, the difference between the characters of this anime and some other anime is that usually the other animes have awesome female characters to compensate. Ano Hana, on the other hand, has none. Menma is slightly tsundere-ish, but not only that... she's a DUMB child tsundere. It certainly doesn't help that she spews this utterly illogical and sentimental mushycrap nonsense: \" I don't like it that you talk bad about Anaru behind her back!\" (What is this suppose to do? Incite a feeling of determination and nobility? That's great, nobody cares what you \"like\".) \" we NEED her\", etc ,etc, trying to not kill off more intelligence remembering more of her quotes. Not only her, but Anaru similarly says these cheesy drama phrases \"You should be ashamed of yourself!\" and Jintan, like a dumb dolt, nods and sulks; doesn't even stand up for himself. Luckily for this review, Jintan and Menma, has created the classic epitome of a cheesy and meaningless conversation at the 11 minute mark:\\n\r\n Menma (Tear): Go ask her! We need her!\\n\r\n Jintan: No.\\n\r\n Menma (Teary and tsundere angry): GOOOO\\n\r\n Jintan *reaction shot! *Surprised *Sulks: OK, let's go.\\n\r\nDumbass.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not wasting my time to watch an anime where crying angry little girls makes spineless wussy guys do degrading mushycrap friendship things. I can go to school tomorrow for that. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1/10)\\n\r\nFrankly I never thought I could grade something lower than I graded MM! but life always suprises me... discontentedly and unpleasantly. Unlike MM!, Ano Hana didn't even have art going for it. The characters were sloppily done and the plot overall was bereft of interest and innovation. Although I didn't have high hopes for it to begin with, this anime was seriously disappointing and irritating. If you had hoped for some comedy in this anime, then you'd be woefully unfulfilled. There were times that comical moments could have appeared. When Menma randomly sat on Jintan's lap and Jintan flustered and turned red, I expected a humorous scene where Jintan makes a southpark >.< face and Menma turns around with a dumb and innocent look on her face and says \"Jintan! Something is pressing against my butt and it's getting bigger!\" Unfortunately that never happened, nor, in my opinion, will it ever happen. Ano Hana will just desperately try, without progress, to pursue that emotion-wrought, endearing sensation, ignoring the classical animation masterpiece techniques of humor, action, suspense, and...of course... fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (2/10)\\n\r\nAno Hana was made with an intent of incurring nostalgia, reminiscence and abstract reflection; however, the actual impact and payout of these efforts are near minuscule. There are other animes that do a much better job of reminiscence, and even some that does a superb job combining different entertainment aspects together. Ano Hana is not even close to that league. I will, however, concede one thing. Since this is review is based off of only 60% of the first episode, I understand that this anime could very well achieve the emotionally-purged pathos that it was initially meant to project. For people who think I cut this anime too short and didn't give it a chance: you're right, this review was semi-whimsical and I didn't give it a chance, but what's wrong with that? In life we don't do what's moral and right, we do what we want and what best satisfies ourself.",

            "content": "Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai, or just Ano Hana for short is an anime that took everyone by surprise this season. I was on another forum looking over the list of anime's that were airing this season and I came across Ano Hana. The plot didn't look too special, especially considering C's and Deadman Wonderland's plot synopsis'. But I decided to to check it out the following night in what would be one of the best first episodes that I have seen in a long time.\r\nThe story starts out in the home of Jinta Yadomi. Jinta is a recluseand has stopped going to school. He's not just any recluse, though. Jinta(n) has the ability to see the ghost of his deceased child hood friend Menma. The story revolves around Jintan and his childhood friends (the super peace busters) attempting to fulfill her wish. The only problem is that they do not know what this wish is.\\n\\n\r\nThe production value of this anime is very high. Both the ED and the OP are excellent. The ED in particular sets the mood perfectly as it often plays during the final scene of the episode and transitions into the ending credits. The music that is played during the episode is usually a soft piano which often goes unnoticed. You know the soundtrack is good when you don't notice any of it. The animation is also superb. The animators did a good job of making the characters look life-like by constantly moving during scenes. Another nice touch is the fact that the characters change their clothes and hairstyles.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime were actually not that special. It didn't feel like any of them were original; they just seemed like old ideas that were rehashed. Actually, I shouldn't say that because nothing was wrong with any of these characters. It's just that there was not anything special about them. The only character that stands out to me is Yukiatsu. At first he is just your typical douche bag, but as you get deeper into the series you find out what a deranged individual he really is. The other characters have realistic motivations, but none of them really stood out to me. Though the characters do go through a good amount of development, the main focus of the show was to show that people never change. Which I thought was brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nThis show wasn't any \"fun\", but I don't mean that in a bad way. This show isn't fun in the way that Code Geass is fun. There is no over the top action or ham-like performances. Ano Hana instead focus' on the main plot: Menma wanting her wish granted before she goes to heaven. This show is very melodramatic, and some parts even I admit I got teary eyed at. Despite it not being a \"fun\" show, I enjoyed it immensely. This is a series I would definitely re-watch in the future. The only complaint about my enjoyment is that it was too short. This series would have been better off as a 26 episode show.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my high score (and now that I will be reviewing anime I will be harsh on scoring), there are many things that stop this anime from being a true masterpiece. There was WAY too much crying, and a lot of the melodrama seemed forced as a result. The show really wanted to get their point across: this is supposed to be sad. But I feel like it would have benefited more if they had more character interactions because the episodes that did show character interactions were some of the best ones. Also, I have another problem with the show: the finale. It is in every way emotionally satisfying, and I admittedly teared up a little despite having a heart of stone. But I felt the ending could have been handled better. I won't explain as it may spoil it, but they could have did without the \"shouting\" in my opinion (among other things).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, despite the many faults this anime has it is still a must watch. Hell, being so short may even be a good thing as you can finish it in no time.",

            "content": "It seems that in recent years there has been a rash of heartstring-tugging dramas featuring high school aged main characters trying to cope with unfortunate events. I normally avoid such shows, having been disappointed by them in the past. They tend to make use of a formula in which the main characters, having been firmly established as big cutie pies, are showered with traumatic incidents in an attempt to garner sympathy from the audience. The audience then watches as the aforementioned cutie pies either get crushed by the pressure of the events they've undergone, or stand up and triumphantly solve all of their problems withsimple, touching solutions. Either route presumably leads to tears on the part of the audience. \\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, that isn't good writing. Imagine for a moment that there's a \u201cPlease Enter Password\u201d box to reach your audience's heart and mind. Writing in the above fashion is equivalent to smashing your face (or any other serviceable part of your anatomy) on the keyboard and hitting enter in the hopes that something will touch the right note. It's lazy, blunt, overtly manipulative, makes certain unflattering assumptions about the intelligence level of the audience, and leads to characters who are defined not by their own personalities, but by the (pardon French) shit luck that they've had in life. Characters become as simple as \u201cthe girl who was raped,\u201d \u201cthe girl whose parents died,\u201d or \u201cthe guy who is a blind, anemic, legless albino.\u201d Memorable characters are those who have formed a unique, composite perception of the world based on what has happened to them\u2014they are not simply defined by the event itself.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, I decided to give \u201canohana: The Flower We Saw That Day\u201d a watch because the concept intrigued me, and there's always the chance that something can surpass the average in an over saturated genre. By the end of the series, I was pleasantly surprised. Anohana isn't quite what I'd call \u201cgreat,\u201d but it's relatively original, and it's leaps and bounds better than many shows which rely on the formula that I described above.\\n\\n\r\nAnohana is about six childhood friends. The death of one member of this childhood circle of buddies drove them apart at a young age. Fast forward ten years; the five remaining friends are now in high school, and a very strange event has forced the friends to gather once more to help each other confront their guilt about what happened on the day that their young friend's life was cut short. \\n\\n\r\nPart of what makes the show so charming is the multitude of ways it plays with traditional character development. The first is that, in a somewhat ass-backwards approach, the show begins by displaying the characters in high school, and then reveals what they were like as children through narrative flashbacks as the plot moves forward. Interesting concept; we're shown the way the characters have changed (or, in some cases, haven't changed) in reverse order. The second thing that's of note here is that every character has been affected by the same event, but they've all responded in different ways. Some throw themselves at school with a passion, some live simple lives of menial labor, and some have dropped all their aspirations and become shut-ins. \u201cDealing with guilt\u201d is a pretty mature theme, and for a show to tackle it using a character study, in such a head-on manner, through showing and not telling, is pretty admirable. The plot itself is relatively simple and a little slow-moving at times, but these characters actually have enough depth that I was content just to watch them interact with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation here strike just the right note: Pretty enough to give a semblance of realism, but not overly flashy. Backgrounds look nice and all that good stuff, but what really shines is the way that the characters have been designed and animated. Obviously childhood vs. adulthood is a running theme in the show, so it looks like special effort was taken to highlight both the similarities and the differences between the adult and child character models. High school isn't that far in the past for me, and I can honestly say that in terms of mimicking the motions of people in the 16-19-ish age group, I feel the animation here is spot on. The awkward sidelong glances at ex-friends, the slouchy manner of walking, the way they expertly handle their smart phones. Every motion that these characters make seems to echo that of real teenagers. A job well done, to be sure.\\n\\n\r\nSo where did the show go wrong? Well, it's a drama, and an essential element of drama is striking the proper balance of emotions. Subtly conveying feelings in a visual medium like animation is a difficult task. To its credit, I'd say Anohana gets it right for about seventy percent of the show's runtime. When the characters stand in uncomfortable silence, avert their eyes at awkward moments, smile wistfully as nostalgia creeps up on them, laugh at old inside jokes, or transition to using old nicknames and phrases instead of proper \u201cadult\u201d speech, that says a lot about their state of mind without out-and-out screaming and crying. However, there are plenty of moments where the series is guilty of the old sin of \u201claying it on too thick,\u201d and resorts to...well...out-and-out screaming and crying. A few of these outbursts are forgivable\u2014after all, sometimes things in real life DO get that heated, especially when dead people are involved\u2014but by the end of the series, there is too much bawling and shouting, and too often. This knocks the show down a few pegs.\\n\\n\r\nAnother flaw, although very slight, lies in the soundtrack. It's not a bad soundtrack (the OP/ED songs are obscenely catchy, and the rest of the music is about average for the genre). But there seems to be one piano-driven melody that plays during just about every potentially sad/touching moment of the show. It's a good track, but my life would have been just fine if I hadn't heard it seventy-five times in the course of four hours, thanks.\\n\\n\r\nThe last main problem I had with Anohana is that, while the characters are interesting, it is necessary to remember that the show does, in fact, have a plot. Sometimes that plot seems to stagnate a little bit, and there are a lot of \u201cfalse conclusion\u201d moments where the characters think they've solved a plot-related problem, only to suddenly go \u201cOh wait...guess that didn't REALLY solve it.\u201d These are gimmicky, cheap excuses for suspense, and the series would be better without them. Similarly, when the show really does conclude, the presence of so many false conclusions makes it not quite as satisfying a payoff as it could have been.\\n\\n\r\nSo, despite a couple of flaws, I found this to be a fairly enjoyable series. Well-crafted characters and decent writing, occasionally marred by some flaws in overdramatic execution, lead me to place this firmly in the \u201cabove average\u201d realm. In my humble opinion, this is teenage drama done well.",

            "content": "Do you enjoy emotional anime where characters have to overcome the trials that life throws at them, ultimately becoming better people from the experience?\r\nThen don't watch this.\r\nAnoHana (of which the full title seems to have no relevance to the story) starts off promisingly enough - we are introduced to two characters, Jinta and Menma, the latter of which turns out to be a girl who passed away ten years prior and is visible only to Jinta due to some supernatural phenomenon. The story follows them as Jinta meets up with his old friends who have all suffered to some extent as a result of Menma\u2019sdeath. \\n\\n\r\nIn its presentation of the main cast and typical slice-of-lifeness, AnoHana is enjoyable enough. \\n\r\nHowever, shortly after the full cast has been introduced, everything turns sharply downhill. Rather than telling a story of a group of friends overcoming past trauma (the death of Menma), we get what should have been titled \"Crying: The Animation.\" \\n\\n\r\nWhile characters crying on screen is not necessarily the main problem, the issue is that everything going on for them is completely unrelatable - unless you happened to lose a friend as a child and not be able to get over it for ten years for some reason. Two of the characters even say that their feelings for Menma (when they 5-7 years old, mind you) have not changed, even though they are now in high school. What. It's quite baffling why they would even care so much about her in the first place seeing that it was shown that she was nothing but an airhead. While the story seems like it should focus on the characters who are alive, the majority of the anime is spent trying to prove Menma\u2019s current existence and fulfill her wish \u2013 a wish that is unknown to all of the characters, including Menma, thus leading into many irrelevant tasks that accomplish nothing of value. Without spoiling it, the wish turns out to be the cheesiest thing I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are thoroughly uninteresting, and a lot of the time are downright irritating to watch. Rather than moving on, the characters whine and cry about their problems, and even by the end none of them have really changed significantly. \\n\\n\r\nVisually, the anime is fine, with distinct main characters, good use of color, and nice backgrounds. Animation was not amazing (although it doesn't really need to be), but definitely good.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the greatest flaw in AnoHana is how completely unrelatable the death of Menma was to them. If the anime was in two parts, the first showing their childhood and the death of Menma, and the second showing them ten years later in high school, their situation would not only be more understandable, but also not so drawn out. However, since it's more focused on crying over an event that is merely referenced, the show fails to incite the emotional reaction that seems appropriate for the situation.\\n\\n\r\nThis is quite possibly the least enjoyable anime I have ever watched. I may sound like a broken record with how much I have complained about the excessive crying, but it isn't emotional, it is aggravating.",

            "content": "The Super Peace Busters will always be the best of friends.\r\nFor all time, for all eternity, even if there\u2019s no reality.\r\nBeing a tale revolving around a tragedy suffered by one of its main characters, Ano Hana does a very good job of showing how the decisive incident had affected the other characters, and how the fact that each of them were unable to let go of the tragedy in their shared past drove them to deal with it in their own ways. This makes for a cast of sympathetic characters, each with unique quirks and underlying motivations, which interact with each other quite seamlessly\u2026 apartfrom the one character which the whole story revolves around in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, in a cast of more or less well-developed personalities, it is Menma which comes across as something of an anomaly, being simultaneously a childish and an idealized figure which everyone else somehow loved unconditionally, despite being rather flat as a character.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the accident which took the life of Honma \u201cMenma\u201d Meiko, the surviving childhood friends which made up the \u201cSuper Peace Busters\u201d broke up, and gradually drifted apart. Several years later, her ghost appears before Yadomi \u201cJintan\u201d Jinta, who was the leader of the band, but had withdrawn from society and become a hikkikomori. However, since she cannot be seen by anyone else, Jintan\u2019s insistence of her reappearance only reopens the old wounds that the rest of the former childhood friends have been harbouring since that day.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana generally achieves an animation standard on par with many of its peers, although it manages to add one or two interesting distinguishing touches. We notice an effort to capture the tone of the story in the visuals - scenes prefer the dusk, dawn, and evening, meaning melancholy shadows creep in many a nook. Though I've got to add I'm a big fan of the animation in this one. It\u2019s really smooth and nice looking. The characters are simple looking, but it's what makes them look more \"down to earth\". Since this story is light and focuses on feelings, the animation is bright and soothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall sound quality in this animation is excellent. The voice acting is great bringing out the emotions of the characters. However, the soundtrack and songs are another matter. The OP/ED really spice up the story! They both are calmer than average, but still make you want to listen to them over and over. \\n\\n\r\nDuring the anime, sad sounding songs are used to add more to the emotions displayed all to make the anime greater.\\n\r\nThis is a wise soundtrack that knows its presence is required to accentuate and not dominate. Melodic, mellow, and utterly fitting, it works with the mood of the show when it is needed and stays completely out of the way when it is not.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana never allows its leads to wallow and instead sends them bumping along a dynamic grieving process marked by poignant rediscovery. The result is a piecemeal deconstruction of their final moments with Menma and how uniquely it affected them. Considering the brief running time, AnoHana manages a heroic amount of characterisation and whenever two characters interact, the resulting drama sparkles. \\n\\n\r\nSuch as when geek Anaru\u2019s relationship with her new vapid friends, for instance, becomes a fascinating glimpse into her pushover personality and brings an added gratification when she rediscovers the joys of gaming with Jintan. Yukiatsu, an arrogant overachiever brimming with undisguised resentment, proves a peculiar success as the hidden contrasts of his personality come to light.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's a must see anime. It's very heart-warming and touches at that right spot. It's very dramatic, so you won't like this if you don't like drama. The story really draws you in, has cute characters and the atmosphere is soothing. If you've lost someone close to you, this is an anime that you can really feel close to you. I'm a person who really doesn't really display my emotions but DAYUUM this one has made me cry for a good 10 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana- Making rivers and dehydrated people since 2011.",

            "content": "In my opinion, this show is everything you shouldn't do in a drama. It drags and the way the emotional moments are handled are almost entirely artificial. This show will have extremely emotional moments( loud music and the characters crying) and after that, the show will return to its original state, only for the next \"emotional\" moment to occur( which is constant like they're trying to beat you over the head with it). Also, the show has no shame in pulling out an attemped sexual assault out of a hat to propel the plot. Furthermore, in the relationships outside Jintan and Menma , the charactersonly talk about Menma. One of the characters crossdress to get past Menma's death  and for the first time, the emotional moment seems justified. However, it's never talked again outside of a few lines of dialogue and leads me to believe that it has to be fanservice. It's a terribly wasted idea that could have been great if handled properly. Okada doesn't handle this even averagely, she handles it in the worst way possible.  It would have been interesting if Yukiatsu, Tsurumi, or Anju talked about each other's lives, maybe fleshed out their backgrounds and motivations outside of Menma but they almost entirely don't. Anju's relationship with these two stereotypically bitchy \"friends\" is very briefly touched upon, but not explored enough to be of any value.\\n\\n\r\n This uniformity in motivations greatly hurts characterization without even mentioning the fact that these relationships aren't explored enough. Perhaps, if the show did a decent job characterizing Menma better by dedicating more screentime to the characters' childhood, it would have been better but once again, they don't. You just have to accept that Menma was the most important thing to these characters when they were 6-16 and that's that. Because their 6 year old selves were jealous of Menma, their 16 year old selves are emotionally breaking down. Jintan has a somewhat legit reason but him being 6 years old when he did it robs it of some emotional impact.  Any genuine reason for the other  breakdowns are infodumped in the last episode and resolved in the laziest way possible. Also, Hisakawa acts as a shitty tonal shift to the melodramatic tone and is not of any use to this story until an asspull at the end. PTSD doesn't work like that folks. It's not just one group therapy session and everyone's laughing again and \"cured\". The ending is shit and prioritizes melodrama over resolving plotlines properly.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's not all bad though. Even though it was convenient, I enjoyed the exchanges between Jintan and Menma's younger brother, Satoshi, despite how brief they were. They just talked and tried to understand each other. Satoshi felt like the only character who was genuine and wasn't a tool to make the audience cry. I also felt Menma's mother, Irene, was actually characterized well and while not focused on enough, her emotional breakdown was appropriate given her circumstance and done well. Jintan was average, which isn't good or bad. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is decent but not enough depth is given to the models. I liked the music. It felt nostalgic and purposeful. The voice acting was good but the way it was used in the script made it somewhat tiresome. The dub is unnatural and offpoint. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I want to say about this show is that I think it would have been much better if the characters were 23-25 and if Menma's death occurred when they were in their early teens. I think it would have made for a much more mature and substantive watch, and the increase in content from concept alone would have solved its dragging pace.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"I wonder... What were the names of the flowers that bloomed during that season?\"\r\nSorry, just give me a minute, I can't seem to stop these tears from coming out of my eyes... my goodness, it's been a long time since I've seen an anime that can make me cry like that.\r\nAnoHana... truthfully, I didn't know what to expect when getting into this anime. The first thing I always do when looking for an anime to watch is get recommendations from my friends, but due to some recent trust issues regarding the recommendation of School Days from a friend of mine, this was probably the firstanime in a looong time I actually decided to give an anime recommended by someone. And let me just say, thank God I listened to her. This anime was beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first read the plot, it seemed simple. The ghost of a girl shows herself to her childhood friend, and he and the rest of his friends from back when they were kids tries to help her figure out what's keeping her earthbound, that way she can pass on and transcend into heaven. Now, the thing that makes this story amazing is how it all plays out, and then the overall outcome of the goal. What I can say right now is that despite the sound of the story, this anime's plot is incredibly unique and very well thought out. One of the things I tend to look for in an anime is how they finish off the series. One bad ending could knock a couple points off the overall score. Luckily, with AnoHana, they ended the series on a good yet emotional note with an overall feel of satisfaction. True, the ending left me in tears, but they were tears of joy.\\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures brought us this magnificently detailed anime. The setting, the characters, and the animation style brought good memories back to me when I watched OreImo and Sword Art Online for the first time. The artwork to AnoHana was remarkable. Sure, at a glance, you might not think much of it. It's simple, but once you start watching it, the animation really pops out at you with its details and color.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no English Dub for this anime. Truthfully, I'm happy about it, because this anime should only be watched in Japanese. The voice acting was top notch. This is easily some of the best work that Ai Kayano and Miyu Irino have brought to us, as well as the rest of the cast. Now, for the music. If you think back to the soundtrack in other anime such as Clannad, Kanon, or Angel Beats, you can get a good idea about what kind of music AnoHana works with. The medleys are soft, slow, and calm, while letting you feel peace within your body. It might be a little hard to notice while the anime is playing, but if you listen closely, you'll see what I mean. As for the Opening and Ending, wonderful. I can't really describe them, so you'll need to listen to them to see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were nearly flawless. Each filled with emotion and unique personalities, while hiding secrets within them that will tell you a lot about them. My personal favorite character was Menma. She seemed so full of life (haha, pun) throughout the series, and her smile was contagious. Jintan was one of the best male protagonists I have seen in a long time. He started off as that one gloomy character you see every once in a while, then started opening up and becoming more likable each episode, until the very end where you can't help but think how cool of a person he is. Poppo was the comedic character in the series. 17 in terms of his physical body, but childlike at heart. He brought joy throughout most of AnoHana, as well as some good laughs here and there. Anjou was the tsundere of the show, well... kind of at least. She seemed nice most of the time, but there were some issues that I had with her every once in a while, but they were easily resolved later on. Chiriko didn't really seem to stand out that much to me. She was shy, quiet, and seemed like the really smart person that you'll see studying in her free time. An overall likable personality though. And then... there's Yukiatsu. He was the one person I had the most problems with. To put it simply, he's a cross dresser with anger issues and can't seem to leave anything alone, even if it meant helping someone out. It doesn't make him a hateable character, but not a very likable one though. But for the most part, the characters in AnoHana were very well made.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana is a tearjerker. My friend told me she cried her eyes out while watching it, but I had to see for myself just how emotional it could get. Well, I figured it out. It was able to make me cry from the last episode all the way to the end of this review. You will get emotionally attached to these characters, I can promise you that. You might cry out of sadness, you might cry out of joy, you might cry out of both. Some of you might be a lot manlier than me, but I'm not ashamed to admit that I have a softspot for anime like this, and this was well worth watching. I hope that you think so as well.",

            "content": "If you're looking for an anime that values the meaning of friendship, this is the right anime for you. This anime is beautiful in so many ways, but mostly because of the message that it gives us. Growing up is a very certain thing, just like death, you cannot stop yourself from growing up. Most of the time, when you become older, you started to lose bonds with other people especially with those who shared memories with you when you were little. Trying to keep that bonds strong just like they were in the old times are hard when we have gone our separate ways.We go to high school, become friends with 'cool' people, changing the real us just to fit in, thinking that we have made it, but are we happy with ourselves ? That's how Naruko feels. She lost herself little by little, trying to be apart of something she's not. In life, you also deal with the hardship of moving on from something or someone that means the whole world to you, even after years of trying to be free from the dark past, you just can't seem to forget that one incident that is killing you from the inside, it seems like it happens just yesterday. This situation portrays Yukiatsu, the guy that tries to act cool but deep inside, he suffers from years of sorrow, just like a volcano waiting for the right time to erupt. One of the most common problems when growing up is making the right choices and trying to change yourself to a better person. Sometimes, you know that what you're choosing is not the right thing, but you just can't seem to change, you. It's still possible for you to be on right track but you at least, just need a little push from behind knowing that someone's got your back. That's Jintan's dilemma. He doesn't go to school, actually skipped the whole semester, but his dad seems to let him be on his own way, that's why he is upset. Love is an exceptional thing when it comes to growing up, sometimes you fall in love with the person that you spent you childhood with, because when you didn't know much about this world, that person gives you so much joy. Just like you, the person that you love also falls in love, but the person is not you. Years pass by, you're still close to him, still spend time together, still walk to school together, and you feelings towards him never change. So does his feelings toward the other girl, and you're torn apart. because no matter how much you try, you will never be good enough to replace the one that he loves. You're right beside him, you exist in his life, and that's how it will always be. You just exist. This is the story of Chiriko. Tetsudou is also one of the main character in this anime. His character is relatable to many of you, or probably people that you know. As a kid, he was always the cheerful one, and even after so many years, he still is. He loves travelling and knows how to regain that strong bonds he once had with his childhood friends, but just like other characters, he hides a terrible feelings about his childhood, but still tries to move on live his life. When you grow apart from those people you used to spend your time with, things will change. It saddens you how you and the rest have changed, you don't talk anymore, you rarely see each other, even when you meet each other, it's not on purpose. But somehow, you want things to go back to the way it used to be, no matter how much time it will take, you just want to feel the way you felt a long time ago. This is how Menma feels. Even though she's just a ghost, she was saddened by the fact that her childhood friends have changed so much, and worse, that might be her fault. \\n\r\nThis anime is probably the closest to what is happening in the real world, except for the ghost part, but this anime is certainly heart warming and soothing. Perhaps it will make you value what you have especially the bonds that you have made with your loved ones.",

            "content": "Tragedies happen everywhere and if you have ever been struck by it then you know how it can change you as a person.\r\nAnoHana is a story along the lines of such where a group of friends are forced to face the death Honma Meiko (Menma) and it takes places years after when they are all in high school. \r\nBy the end of the first episode, Menma and Yadomi Jintas' past have been explored and we get a slight idea of how the death of Menma changed the once energetic and cheerful Jinta into a shut in wrapped up in his own emotions.\r\nThe story sofar is compelling and immediately hooks you by the end of the first episode. The plot gets more and more in depth as each episode progresses which continues to draw you in and keep you interested. The room for interpretation makes the story much more enjoyable and does so leaving you with twists in further episodes and in doing so keeps you guessing and wanting more. Characters are dynamic and draws your desire to connect and understand them more which overall makes this a very moving and enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you interested in a well planned out drama, AnoHana is most certainly worth the time and does not look to disappoint in terms of the depth and as a result makes it one of the better series of spring 2011. Even with all the new releases this spring, AnoHana is sure to be a great series to watch whether you are into this type of genre or not.\\n",

            "content": "AnoHana was one of the few anime that I've really enjoyed watching, it comes up with a Drama, Slice of life, and Supernatural genre that quite fits for most of the people who loves to watch emotional and yet with a twist in the storyline which is supernatural. Also it is divided into two types of mood which is guilt & realization (in my own opinion only, on how did I interpret the story). At the same time the story of Anohana really illustrates on how we struggle with the ghost of our past.\r\nSpeaking of the word \"past\" we often say that past is past.But, for some reason there are really some of these past that we aren't able to move one, especially if you have something to do or something to say that seems to be impossible at the present time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLosing someone you love isn\u2019t an easy as 1-2-3 where in fact there is a worst case scenario involvement where you have to confess your feelings with someone else that seems to be impossible right now because he/she\u2019s gone already. You need a long time to move on and to recover from the past. However, each situation that you\u2019ve come up with is always triggering the ghost factor of the past, which is seems to be so hard.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a generic story as always, but one thing that I\u2019d love in AnoHana is that it came up with an idea that is generic also but both of them really complimented resulting into a masterpiece. \\n\r\nAnoHana\u2019s ghost factor was the highlight for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to art & sound elements there\u2019s nothing special about it. Descent and simple illustration when it comes to characters and other elements that is quite fits to the whole anime which I really enjoyed the most at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nWell, as a matter of fact when it comes to these kinds of genres, being simple in all aspect would be the best asset, as you illustrate the reality.\\n\\n\r\nLeading characters was also the highlights in here, coming from the word guilt & obsession really paired up with the story. Personality for each character and behaviour are really great. What I love in here is Jinta, the way he act and speak really match with the illustration for this main character and Poppo of course.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, probably you will enjoy this one especially if you can relate with the story or you are too depressed or emotional. My advice in here is to watch this one according to your mood it really helps.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, I\u2019ll give it a 9, for being simple and well delivered story.\\n\\n\r\nWant to improve my review? Let me here some words from you \uf04a.\\n\\n\r\nNote: They said, opinions aren\u2019t special as we have our own at the same time, so again this one never intend to please everyone.\\n",

My main problem is that the writing lacks any basic common sense.\r\nEveryone is way too accepting of the fact that Jinta can see this ghost, even if they don't believe him. Jinta never supplies any proof, even though it's readily available (The ghost- Menma- is literally making steamed bread that they're eating for christ's sake). \r\nMenma even hugs or touches the characters, with Jinta watching. And Jinta doesn't bother to say \"oh by the waySHE'S HUGGING YOU RIGHT NOW! SHE'S FUCKING HUGGING YOU.\" Instead he just lets them say \"oh I feel chilly all of a sudden. What is this weight on my shoulders?\" Get the hell out of here Jinta, you are literally the worst character ever.\\n\\n\r\nNo one ever asks the natural questions 100% of us would ask in that situation. No one is even interested. It's infuriating to watch.",

One thing worth mentioning, though, is that it doesn't get all that sad until the end, although there are some sad bits sprinkled throughout the earlier parts of the show.

            "content": "Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai\r\nAnother-great-anime-with-an-awful-long-title.\r\nIs it character-driven? Yes.\r\nMelodramatic/tear-jerking? Yes, sometimes.\r\nConvoluted storyline? No.\r\nOverrated? Definately Not.\r\nThese were the sentences I'd like to start my review... Since I couldn't find a way to put them all together in a short paragraph, I though in leaving them like this. If you're the kind of person who enjoy \"twitter-like\" reviews, these sentences can give you a direction already. However, for a better understanding, I'd recomend you to get your reading glasses because there's a lot to talk about this peculiar anime.\r\nThere are tons of reviews for these recent series, so it's becoming hard to\"say what haven't been said yet\", I'll try not to be repetitive and express my impressions and opinions. Sometimes a well written review is enough to move someone into giving a try or not. isn't it?\\n\\n\r\n\"The beast of summer. The source of my stress. My trauma.\"\\n\r\nThis is how we are introduced to the female lead of the series. Meiko \"Menma\" Homna. The whole plot will move around her and you'll soon find out why within 1 or 2 episodes.\\n\r\nAnoHana have a great starting punch, it opens with a light-hearted comedy mixed with slice of-life, however at the same time, start developing a deeper situation, characteristic from drama animes, that in the 2nd episode takes the main stage.\\n\r\nThe storyline also brings out that philosophy of \"measure your actions/words\" because you never know if they will be the last you spoke and/or someone will hear from you. It's very nice to see how they manage to use a theme that could appear silly and plain to a casual spectator in a way that creates a great atmosphere that blends perfectly with the story. In the other hand... it gets pretty boring after a few episodes. This is one of AnoHana's low points, even though the inicial ideia was great, they spend too much time in the same issue, which one could see as an excuse to not develop more the story. This all gives that feeling of slow paced melodrama that could be solved in 1 ep. but took 5 instead.\\n\r\nHowever it does not take its pride and AnoHana's story still shines due to its other great \"features\". (it may sounds like I'm selling this to you, but isn't this what a review does?) unlike other anime series from the same genre, AnoHana is \"easy\" to understand, it doesn't have a convoluted plot neither ambigous characters making of it the perfect lighthearted drama to watch anytime with everyone.\\n\r\nIn the end, to not spoil anything neither digress too much I'd say AnoHana story is more like a reinvented and adapted Rome&Juli of these years, specially now that there's this commotion about undead, zombies, vampires...so why not ghosts? (you'll get wht I mean when you watch)\\n\\n\r\n\"you haven't changed at all\" / \"you changed a lot\"\\n\r\nSince it's a character-driven story, you have a LOT of character development. Which is great but if not carefully planed may result in messy reactions or into confusing twists from characters behaviors. You may think: we're talking about human relationships, and as we know, they're always unstable and uncertain. But there's a limit where this uncertainty becomes repetitive and contraditory. This is what the production should always pay attention to. Make sure none of the characters say sentences that contradicts with something he said before. I won't go further in this matter since it's a very personal interpretation, and anyone who sees it can have a different ideia. Better to leave this for the discussion boards.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that motivated me for watching this anime was the cast selection. All the voice actors selected are awesome and were perfectly choosen for the characters they played. A lot of friends recomended this to me, but the moment when I opened MAL summary and checked who were the voice actors I knew something good would come from it.\\n\r\nHaruka Tomatsu who voiced the adorable Nagi (from Kannagi) returns as Anjou \"Anaru\" Naruko along with Ai Kayano, the Mayaka Ibara from Hyouka (voicing Menma) and also Miyu Irino, Chizuru Tachibana from Kimi to Boku (Jintan).\\n\\n\r\nWhat I love in drama animes is that they always valorize the entire set of OST, inserted soundtrack, OP, ED... From all the series I've watched, the ones with the best and the most emotional OST, if not from Makoto Shinkai are doubtless from A1-Pictures. What is an opening if not a very well done AMV? The song choosen for AnoHana's opening explains the entire story if you pay atention to it. And the ending? Starting with the perfect timing moving you to tears, while you're wondering \"why the hell am I crying over it?\". Both are soft animated and have a funky feeling not so sad, not so happy, blending well with almost every situation. The background sound exceded my expectations. There were great scenes where the piano or acoustic pieces were ingeniously placed.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately while reviewing I can't talk about the ending of the anime, however, if you need a reason to watch, it is the last 2 episodes. They made up for the entire anime. (God, I loved that ending.) If it happened to end in the 10th episode, it would be perfect. The timing was perfect, the soundtrack as well, the storyline on it's climax... After it, I though to myself \"the final episode gonna sucks\". I was completely wrong. \\n\r\nThat last episode closes up the story in a way I've never seen before. No lose ends at all.\\n\r\nIn the overall, AnoHana is a great anime, with a clean (little moe) artwork, just like others A1-Pictures series, had a great potential, explored it, and corresponded to my expectations. It's not perfect neither the best drama out there, but it's a great story of growing up and friendship. One of those \"meaning of life\" animes to watch and store. :D\\n\r\nFrom the latest releases of romance and drama of this 2012 season this was the most promissing and it seems I'm not the only who thinks like this as we can see in the rating. ^^\"\\n\r\nThe numerical score (if you prefer this way)\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nArtwork: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nArithmetic overall: 8/10 (Very Good)\\n\r\nFull numeric scale 0~10. The average been 5.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read until here BEFORE voting down (or up), thanks!! You made my day.\\n\r\nPleeease talk with me! I don't bite! I'm a needy person, I need comments to improve my reviews! These heartless buttons are useless. There's nothing like interacting with humans :3",

Theanime itself has also given us an idea as to how Japanese perceive life after dead, were they believe in reincarnation, not surprising that it is based on their Shinto belief. I also like the part were the ghost, Menma, doesn\u2019t know why she hasn\u2019t cross-over yet and so the whole 11 episode of this anime is for both Jinta and Menma\u2019s quest (soon everyone else joined in) to find the reason for Menma to cross-over, also the anime deals on the relationship of Menma\u2019s remaining friends to rediscover themselves and to move on.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nWhoever did the illustration of this anime is probability the same one who did \u201cWorking\u201d and \u201cToradora.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m referring to both the opening and closing themes, it really tells something about the anime even if I can\u2019t understand Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nLest start with the ghost.\\n\\n\r\nHonma Meiko (Menma) \u2013 she\u2019s a ghost, like duh, every body knows that (sorry guys, just talking to myself), enough of that, so she can\u2019t cross-over until she has settle her unfinished business with Jinta which she has no idea that it is the reason for her unable to cross-over (I may have said that already), but I really like her childish behavior it kind of make her fun to watch. It\u2019s a good thing that she\u2019s also a poltergeist in which she can manifest herself through physical objects.\\n\\n\r\nYadomi \u201cJintan\u201dJinta \u2013 Well, it is obvious as to why he\u2019s the only one to see Menma, he experienced a double tragedy in his life, first the death of his childhood friend/crush Menma and later on the death of his mother, the double tragedy turn him into a recluse or what they define in Japanese as a \u201cHikikomori.\u201d Like Menma, he wonders as why he\u2019s the only one who can see her and has no idea as to why Menma hasn\u2019t cross-over after so many years of pestering him. I like his character of being stubborn but caring, but, I really am disgusted by him on having to be a freeloader and relay complete on his padre (father) who seems to be too kind to let him be so.\\n\\n\r\nAnjou \u201cAnaru\u201d Naruko- At first one might think that she\u2019s a nice girl turned wild co\u2019z of her association with 2 of her classmates who goes on wild sprees, as it turns out she has some reservation all along being in their company and realized that she prefers the old gang back, unfortunately in the last episode she still seen  with the 2 bitches whom nearly got her into trouble, I sympathize with her desire to be Jinta\u2019s love interest and her jealousy  towards Menma, which I think she\u2019s a match for him instead of being a match for Yukiatsu. I got to hand it to the character\u2019s voice actress I did know that Tomatsu Haruka, the same girl who did Lala Satalin Deviluke  of \u201cTo Love Ru,\u201d it is amazing that she can change the annunciation of her voice base on the character\u2019s personality to the point that you might think it\u2019s a different person . \\n\\n\r\nHisakawa Tetsudo or Poppo- The thing about him is that he\u2019s as devastated as Jintan co\u2019z he\u2019s the first person to see Menma dead. What I like about him is that even if he\u2019s carrying a heavy burden in his heart he still manages to put up a happy face.\\n\\n\r\nMatsuyuki  \u201cYukiatsu\u201d Atsumu \u2013 Like Jintan he\u2019s also affected by Menma\u2019s death, but unlike Jintan and Poppo he was able to move on, I really don\u2019t understand as to what gives about him dressing up as Menma and spooking everyone else, is it to make everybody to forget about Menma or was he trying to make everyone remember her? By the way I really like him paired up with Tsuruko.\\n\\n\r\nTsurumi Chiriko or \u201cTsuruko\u201d- Of all Menma\u2019s friends she probably the only one to completely move on, but was taken a back with her feelings for Yukiatsu, like Anaru she also has some jealousy towards Menma. What impresses me is her tsudere attitude towards the gang, co\u2019z it is not like that she despises them, it\u2019s just that she can\u2019t bare to see some of them who still carries a burden about Menma (how many times do I have to mentioned that name?)  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe genre of this anime did deliver as what is expected, and it\u2019s all good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the slice of life genre of this anime is more profound that the drama genre, co\u2019z this does happen in real life, so about the 11 episode, in the case of Menma (I\u2019m getting tired of mentioning that name) her plan was to make Jintan cry co\u2019z that\u2019s what she promise the latter\u2019s madre (Jintan\u2019s mother), as she gathers the gang, things didn\u2019t when the way she planned and decided to do some damage control, but unlucky for her in such haste death is waiting for her. But the thing here is that what\u2019s keeping her from crossing over was her plan to make Jintan cry all along. Also we see the gang opening up to each other thus rediscovering the friendship they had which what Menma (her again) wanted to do too. The slice of life of this anime shows us that the things we search for, is something that we don\u2019t realizing that what we having been looking for is just near by, it also teaches us a lesson that the world is not gonna stop for anybody and that one must move on regardless of the pain he/she carry\u2019s. In the case of ghost, the most difficult thing about them is guessing what their unfinished business is  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you thought you were an emotionless brick, you could never be so wrong. At first, I thought that I was an emotionless brick not feeling sad at all in multiple death scenes in anime/movies, and sad stories that made others feel emotional wouldn't affect me at all. At times, they would make me laugh rather than cry. I have a dark sense of humor, most things that would bother other people make me laugh, apart from this anime which was capable of having me actually feel sad and on the brink of crying. Along with the top 3 emotional anime, this was capable ofhaving me experience (feels). Clannad, Angel Beats, all these anime are so well produced and it's a genre of anime which has grown out to become my favorite. Anohana is a legendary anime and can be a great impact in your life and have you think things that you never would have thought of.. Anohana displays an amazing scenario of how the death of loved ones can affect us. onto the components of the overall ratings.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nStory : 10\\n\\n\r\nThe story in Anohana is just so well done. The story in Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day is about a group of friends that have gone through a life impacting experience caused by the death one of their friends caused them to split apart. One day in the summer, she came back for an unknown reason to the leader of those group of friends, namely the main character, Jintan. Jintan is the only one capable of seeing Menma, and it worries everyone because they believe he's losing his mind and just can't deal with reality. The story is simply amazing and it pieces together perfectly. I personally find the story one of the best parts of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9\\n\\n\r\nWhile how the main character, Jintan's appearance bothers me the art is actually very good. During emotional scenes, when they shed  tears it isn't like an unrealistic waterfall of water from heaven it's drawn very well and you can really see the pain that character is feeling. The art is able to communicate the feelings and the pain that the characters are enduring and they were able to convey this in such a well manner by simply their drawings.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9 \\n\\n\r\nOne of the hardest parts in emotional scenes is to have the voice sound right. A dramatic scene could be totally ruined and completely obliterated if the voice actor's did a bad job and is a emotionless brick wall, and if the music is off-putting it could make the scene sound weird, sound is a very important part in creating perfect and flawless emotional scenes. Anohana is very capable of creating well made sad scenes, the voice actors do such a good job it sounds like they're truly in pain, like they're the character themselves,you can feel the all the emotions going through the characters as they speak. The music that plays is excellent and is timed out perfectly, the music adds extra feelings and truly make these scenes closer to perfection.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8.5\\n\\n\r\nThe Character Development is particularly good, everyone in the group had their own mixed feelings about everything, they were able to have it feel like each character was their individual person unlike some anime that has the character as interesting as a cardboard cutout. The way each character feels about Menma, (the keywords are obsession, guilt, jealousy and love) matches up so well with the story. They didn't leave anyone out, and everyone had some sort of equal importance in the story, the amount of left over characters were at minimal levels.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you mean \"enjoyment\" as in how sad I ended up feeling than this would be a hands down 11. Anohana was capable of bringing me to tears, which is surprising for me. It remained somewhat consistent on being interesting at the beginning, and the further in you get the more you should prepare for experiencing something you've never experienced before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely a 10 on my book, everything matched up so perfectly and everything just felt so perfect. Anime like this is the reason why I love anime with a burning passion, Anohana completely wrecked me and somewhat fear the death of the ones I love. The last few episodes are definitely the most emotional, once again I warn you if you're watching this in public you better find an excuse to why you're crying. I would definitely recommend watching this anime alone, and make sure you have headphones on and completely awake so you're able to enjoy this anime to it's full potential. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! I hope you enjoyed. This is one of my first reviews, sadly they aren't perfect and have some flaws! \\n\\n",

            "content": "I've never written a review before and I never thought I would until I watched this show. Let me preface by saying this: I am a huge fan of sad shows. Clannad: After Story is easily one of my favorite shows of all time and when I began to watch Ano Hana, I thought I would be getting a similar experience. I will admit, this show is indeed very sad but I had never been more disappointed in anything I had watched. \r\nThe show starts off very strong, giving you a good idea of what you are getting into and sets a very melancholy anddreamy mood. As the episodes progress, you start to realize that the mood created is extremely artificial. While forcing a mood is a very common practice and I understand why studios would abuse it, in Ano Hana, it is way too much. Like anything made by A-1 Pictures, it is overdramatized, drawn out, and everything that occurs is utter bullshit. It's almost offensive how they expect us to fall for their tricks over and over again.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile a show like Your Lie in April had similar problems, YLIP still had redeeming traits such as the amazing production value and decent characters. While Ano Hana does have decent production value, the characters are probably the worst thing about this show, which is saying alot. The show rides on the expectation that you empathize with the characters and feel bad for them. This is very hard to do because none of the characters are likeable at all. As a firm believer that characters don't have to be likeable to be good characters, I can say for certain that the characters aren't good either. In fact, they are probably the worst cast I've ever seen in a show. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very stereotypical which isn't much of a problem for alot of people, including me. What I do have a problem with is how the characters' actions don't support their personality traits whatsoever. Every action that takes place is for the convenience of the plot. What makes things worse is the fact that there isn't much of a plot so basically anything that the characters do is for the purpose of making things more dramatic and eating up time. \\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the point of how there isn't much plot, it surprises me that they were able to stretch about 4 episodes worth of story into 11. Besides the fact that they stretched all the content and added more content for dramatic purposes, the reason that the story was able to go on for so long was due one major flaw in the story of how Jinta and Menma were unable to prove Menma's existence for 10 years. Yet we see in the show how easy it was to prove her existence. With a plot hole as big as this, normally I would completely bash a show for that one reason but to be honest, this plot hole is the least of this show's problems. Usually I don't find garbage or nonexistent plot to be much of a problem if the shows's purpose isn't to tell a compelling story, but for a drama like Ano Hana, there should be at least a decent plot or maybe even decent characters but yet it delivers neither.\\n\\n\r\nThe one redeeming trait of this show besides its decent production value is that it is pretty emotional, but only at the end. It tries so hard to get you emotional and the fact that it only succeeded once is pretty hilarious. But I will say that even after 11 episodes of bullshit and completely hating the show, the fact that it got me emotional even once is pretty impressive. This is probably the only reason it deserves a 2 instead of a 1 for me. However, even on this point, I've gotten way more emotional on shows that weren't even focused on the emotional aspect, than I did watching Ano Hana. Which goes to say how much of a waste of time this show is. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Garbage and nonexistent story, horrible characters, not enjoyable at all, but can be emotional. \\n\\n\r\nEven though I personally haven't watched alot of drama, if you're looking for a good one, I would recommend March Comes in Like a Lion.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something emotional, watch Clannad, Angel Beats, or Koe no Katachi. Hell, I've gotten more emotional watching fucking Assassination Classroom, the original Pokemon, Monogatari, Haikyu, K-on, Love Live, Haikyuu, and Monster than watching Ano Hana. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, there's no reason to watch this show, it's a complete and utter waste of time. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overall?\r\nAno Hana is the best anime i have seen to date, and is the main reason i got into watching anime. I was always hoping for another dose of ano hana in a new story, but i have yet to find an anime that can compete in Ano Hanas genre. Ano Hana is an extremely sweet story of friends gathering again, and their previous 'leader', jintan, overcoming his social phobia. Don't listen to haters, and watch this anime for yourself. My review focuses on the haters points and shows how utterly refutable they are and talks about what is good about this anime. There aredifferent messages one can infer from this anime, some cheesy ones like not to take anything for granted, to deeper ones, like to seize the moment and live life to its fullest. I enjoyed this anime because of its innocence (uh...please ignore the 100% random few sec of fan service in the first episode) and love triangle type themes. These characters are all depressed and its easy to see why as you keep on watching. But, like in reality, they don't always show it. The portrayal of the characters was perfect, in my opinion; from the 'airhead' type innocence that is Menma to the dimwitted/pure Popo, each character is severely effected by the events that took place in their childhood, and each effect is at least implied, it won't take too much thinking too see how each character is effected. The effects seem superficial at first, but once you dig a little deeper, you can really get a sense of how these characters felt. This anime really let me feel the emotions of each character, and it was easy to imagine why they did something or how they felt at a specific moment. This anime took full advantage the fact that it was an anime, and lets you imagine how epic life would be with a sound track, and the innocent type art really falls into place in this anime, blending in with the characters and story line flawlessly. \\n\\n\r\nCriticizing..the haters.\\n\r\nThe hate this anime has been receiving is ridiculous, they mull over idiotic things that actually made the story better for me. If you want to watch, IMO,  one of the saddest and sweetest anime ever, watch ano hana. if you hate romance/tragedy-drama,  watch it anyways, maybe you'll come to your senses when exposed to this masterpiece. You really shouldn't expect heavy ecchi in this anime or any kind of hard core action crap. This anime would best be described as an intense burst of innocent love, though contradicting as it may sound.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Criticism.  \\n\r\n I found the ending slightly repetitive, not about what the did that entire last episode, but the writers couldve held back from ****SPOLIER*** using that \"It's the kind of love when i want to marry you\" line until the end, it wouldve had a greater impact. That was the only flaw i found in this anime, and this is considerably small. Even with this \"flaw\", i still crie-- uh, I was sad and amazed by this anime.Warning- I watched w/o break all 11 episodes right away, just captivated with this anime, so you should start watching in the middle of the day. Haters please read on to get your arguments whipped to pieces.  \\n\r\nYeah, whipped. Like whip cream. I'll frost your Ano Hana hating asses.*** Light story line spoliers may be up ahead***\\n\\n\r\nGeneral Storyline Haters Here! \\n\r\n This could have been presented without supernatural events but that wouldn't be as exciting now would it? It would've been dragged on longer and he would've never realized in certainty of her love for him. As he did know this, he was able to move on in his life and seek out new love instead of mulling over her and how she never found out about it. Without the supernatural element, this would've been another boringly surreal slice of life anime. Even with the amount of hate Ano Hana was receiving now, it is still ranked 21. Without supernatural elements, i wouldn't have rated this a 10, or even a 9. I would've likely categorized it with 5cm per second, which was good in it's own aspects, but definitely unable to compete with Ano Hana. Ano hana is actionless, yet it has supernatural factors. That puts it in a class of its own. There is honestly no anime that can compare to Ano Hana because Ano Hana is extremely unique in its story line. Cross game has this action theme to it, which obviously makes it a longer anime. You can't compare action to non action. Both have their own pros and cons. If you just LOVE action and can't get enough of it, try to be more open minded. Just because guns and knives don't go flying, doesn't mean you have to go \" HUR DUR, HATE, HATE, HATE HATE *goes into Zero Chant beat*. \"  \\n\\n\r\n\"UNORIGINAL DESIGNS BLAH BLAH BLAH\" HATERS HERE.\\n\r\nHey, yeah. What colour is YOUR hair? You stay home all the time?  Do you have a friend you were in love with die? Didn't fking think so. This characters are definitely original. If you just focus on the art, then i have to say how horrible your sense of...anything is. The characters are kind of soft looking, but remember- this anime is an INNOCENT romance. Every char with hourglass figures and bulked up builds- not as innocent... Show me an anime like Ano Hana, and ill show you my foot up your ass after i prove that your anime is almost NOTHING like Ano Hana. Take a second note- I'll be showing the foot-ass motion so you're gunna be in a HORRIBLE position, therefore, i suggest you think a bit before trying prove me wrong. Action is NOT comparable to nonaction like Ano Hana. Saved about 80% of you haters now didnt i? Better yet, just don't compare anime. They all have unique storylines and different characters. I just saved around 10% more now didnt i?\\n\r\nObviously the remaining 10% are gunna be stupid. Hopefully you read my review  on haters BELOW before you try to be even dumber.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Haters Here!\\n\r\nI have to say, when looking around at the hate, most is character centered. You all realize that she DIED while they were CHILDREN, right? If you remember the episode in which they were talking about how they felt it was their fault), and popo, who WATCHED HER DIE you would realize how heavy a burden it was on them. They all went through years thinking it was them that inadvertently caused the death of one of their most loved friends. You'd have to have a heart of stone to not carry that around with you. \"Oh shit, i killed her D: *2 seconds later* Oh well, let's eat some candy :D.\" Awesome. Let me know when that type of story is out and ill jump off the CN Tower (yeah im Canadian, deal with it) and fly.  Now,  before some people say, \"Yeah, EXACTLY. CHILDREN. They wouldn't be too sad for very long.\" Can i ask why the hell not? According to Freud and several other psychologists, childhood is the PRIMARY stages of psyche development. LEARN A BIT ABOUT HUMAN DEVELOPMENT BEFORE TALKING ABOUT HOW UNREALISTIC SOMETHING IS. One argument \" Instead of focusing on them, the show focuses on them and their relation to Menma, downplaying all of their own personal character in favor of them revolving around Menma.\" directly relates to this. I have to point out, their personal character was developed BECAUSE OF their relation to Menma. They wouldn't have developed the way they did if they were all friends and happy now would they? None of these characters remain the same. They all have a dark depressing side that effected them severely in their lives. If you watched this anime, and i mean really watched it instead of look for flaws the entire time just because you don't like lolis or something, you wouldn't be able to come up with any decent arguments in character development.\\n\\n\r\n\"TOO UNREALISTIC\" HATERS HERE!\\n\r\nAno Hana had realistic elements to it. The treatment of Jintan, and how the other friends drifted away and developed was very realistic in my point of view. Jintan was in love with her but he never told her. This resulted in him shutting him self off from the world in the supposed mind set of \"I won't let the world tell me or effect me in anyway since i didn't get a chance to effect Menma\".Anaru and Tsurumi suffered from a kind of inferiority complex. Both the objects of their affections like Menma better. They both developed in their own ways through there on interpretation of how to get closer to their loved ones. Popo SAW her DIE. He dropped out because of that! One of his best friends DIED right in front of him and he got screwed up because of that. I'd have to say thats pretty realistic. And Atsumu- well, typical 'cool' guy with a secret right? He loved his childhood friend, and she didn't like him, even though a lot of other girls would kill to be with him. Of course hes going to be obsessed with the one girl he couldn't get and wanted.   Also please note- WHO LIKES COMPLETELY REALISTIC ANIME? Honestly. Thats like watching a BORING JERSEY SHORE; AND JS IS BAD ENOUGH. Can you imagine the horrors a BORING one will bring?! Anime is for watching unrealistic and uncommon events in our mundane lives. Which Ano Hana portays.  Ano hana was good and still is good because it combined both the realistic and unrealistic, implying even our own lives could be as...EPIC... as these ones. *Super cheesy music HERE* All you have to do is put your all into life. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Get some tissues. \\n\r\nP.P.S. Not that i cried. It doesn't count if the tears don't hit your face. \\n\r\nP.P.P.S. What the hell does ps stand for anyways...\\n\r\nP.P.P.P.S. lol, pp. And if you rate this lower than 10, then you're a.... you're a filthy justin bieb**. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "AnoHana is the worst anime ever!\r\nJust kidding, this is just to get your attention. Quite the opposite actually, AnoHana is one of the best anime I have seen. When I was first recommended to this anime by my brother who claims it to be the \u2018Best Anime Ever\u2019, I brushed it off and thought, \u201cMeh, with that weird name?\u201d I cursed my stupidity for putting off this anime for 2 months before finally getting to it. I have always thought of myself to be a fan of the dark and mystery genre but this is the anime which completely changed that mindset. \r\nAnoHana starts outas a rather light-hearted slice-of-life anime as we are introduced to ghost girl Menma who pesters Jintan. A lot. The characters are the main charm of this anime as each character are unique and have their own personality and way of thinking. Before you ask, no, this is not a romantic comedy of any sort. The main focus of this anime is about getting over the death of a dear friend, about overcoming grief and guilt, sorting out relationships among friends and moving on with life. \\n\\n\r\n Very few anime have made me felt extreme emotion. These are the types of anime which should be considered a masterpiece. When watching AnoHana, you should be ready to bawl your hearts out. It is not a simple tear-jerker that \u2018tells\u2019 you to cry when you watch the anime. \u201cHey, the girl Menma died. Yea, it\u2019s sad because everyone misses her and she\u2019s really nice and cute and all. Poor her. So you should start crying.\u201d No, it does not get pity from the audience and collects cheap tears. Instead, it skillfully orchestrates the viewers to actually be in the shoes of the characters and feel what they are experiencing. You will honestly CARE for the characters and understand the actions of each characters to cope with their grief or loss of their dear friend. It is in no way a manipulation of emotion and AnoHana can create moments where I can relate to myself in life.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so maybe you may think that from the synopsis that this kind of story has been done before. The dead comes back and wants her wish granted so that she can move on. Well, DUMP THE SYNOPSIS! This story is pretty damned original if you ask me, despite the similarities of childhood stories such as 20th Century Boys. The story is simple but beautiful. The themes in the story are straight forward and I felt that I learnt something by the end of each episode. Friendships, families, death and life. What if one day someone dear to you died? What changes would occur? Will you grieve over the person for years to come or accept it and move on with a stronger heart? If I died, will my family and friends be sad? Will they remember me or forget me? One word: DEEP. The story is seriously deep for a 11 episode anime. You will come to realize that it is not as light-hearted as it seems. Oh and there\u2019s the crying. (From me mostly)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nI really cannot complain about the art. It is absolutely beautiful. It has a clean and crisp look and everything is sharp. Watch it in HD and you will know what I mean. In fact, there\u2019s a slight difference in lighting between the past and present, where the past have brighter colors and the present being slightly moodier. If you have watched it already, watch it again and spot the difference, if not, pay attention to every grain of detail AnoHana has to offer. The character design is pretty good and everyone loves Menma so no arguments there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nI love all the music in AnoHana. The opening was relaxing and sweet, accompanied by the smooth animation. I literally have to stop myself from floating into the midst of the light-hearted melody. Then we come to the ending. I can tell you guys a long story about the band Zone and how the song was made 10 years ago and how the lyrics are meaningful in both the anime and in real life. Instead, I\u2019ll just rant about how cute the 3 girls from Super Peace Buster frolicking around in the drifting flower petals look. The song complements everything. I have not skipped past neither the OP nor the ED once throughout the 11 episode. I never got tired of hearing it. That is just how good it is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nFrom how Jintan loves Menma to how Yukiatsu is obsessed over the same person pretty much displays all the difference between each character. Both of them have feelings for Menma but the way of expressing it is very different. This is what I liked about AnoHana. Even though they are all friends, they have their own way of \u2018achieving their goals\u2019 and take up different path even though they have the same feelings for Menma. Jintan is relentless and never gives up to help Menma and while certain others wants to give up so as to not hurt Menma\u2019s family\u2019s feelings. Of course, the best moments are when you see how these great characters change over time and how eventually their hearts are as one and move forward together on the same wavelength.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series very much. Yea that\u2019s all I can really say. It\u2019s just really good and even though crying is not really much of an enjoyment, they are happy tears so I can deal with that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis is a very refreshing anime, a good change from all that gore fest anime I have been watching. I am sure it would lighten your mood some after watching AnoHana and it will probably fight some stress off. I cried and then felt much better after that. Man, this is almost like a therapy anime! This is completely irrelevant but I think I will get myself some AnoHana goods and re-immerse myself into the anime because it is really good. Everything about this anime is great, from the art and characters to the brilliant sound. Watch it. You will not regret it. In fact, you will regret not having to watch it earlier and hit yourself for it soon after like me.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, oh what the heck is that all not enough to convince you that this is a good anime and that you should watch it? \\n\\n\r\nWarning: If you have a solid \u2018reputation\u2019, I suggest you watch this anime by yourself in an enclosed area. Also, parents freaks out when their child walks out of their room teary puffy eyed chanting \u201cYou found me\u2026You found me\u2026You found me\u2026\u201d . Enjoy the anime :)\\n",

            "content": "Little note: My review is not going to spoil any huge nuances because in order to get the full experience of the show, you have to walk in relatively blind. However, I am going to lay out the basic pieces that you should understand by simply watching the first episode, and I may incorporate a reference or hint that individuals who have watched the series already understand. Also, the shortened name of this show is \"Anohana,\" which is the title I will use to refer to it. \r\nStory:\r\nYadomi Jinta is a shut-in. Lacking any drive in his life, he has spent about the equivalent ofa semester in his house doing nothing but playing video games and mulling about with a sense of regret and spite. \\n\\n\r\n(I'm not sure if you call this next part a spoiler, since it's established within the first 3 minutes of the first episode, but I guess \"be warned, spoiler alert\" or something like that)\\n\\n\r\nOne summer day, he encounters what he believes is his summer \"beast,\" a manifestation of his past trauma or \"sin\" if you want to get religious. Jinta's description of negativity exists in the form of his deceased childhood friend, Honma Meiko, or simply Menma. The catch to the sudden reappearance of one of his childhood friends is that only he can see her. The question, and plot, of the story arises: Why exactly is Menma back? Why can only Jinta see her?  How will the 6 protagonists reunite? One particular focus of the story is how it seamlessly transitions between present-day events and those of the \u201ctragic\u201d day 10 years prior. These questions are answered as you progress in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in its barest form is not too complex. Dead friend comes back as ghost and main character has to find out how to resolve this issue to get to a happy ending. However, the essence of the story lies in the relationships between the several characters as friends (and something even closer). A relatively simple-sounding story stretches every boundary to squeeze out every ounce of meaning it can manage in merely 11 episodes. The emotions the story plays with are those that are nearly universal, which explains the vastly positive reception it has received. (Most individuals have experienced the ups and downs of friendship at least once in their lives)The scriptwriters incorporate minute nuances throughout the series to facilitate an almost indescribable connection between the audience and the characters. These small details make this story into what I would call an emotional roller coaster of sorts. \\n\\n\r\nstory: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n An A-1 pictures production, the art of Anohana thrives on simplicity. Definitely not comparable to that of a Kyoto Animation work, the approach to the art is a sigh of relief to the overly focused concept of \"we have to make this girl as pretty as possible with huge boobs\" that we have seen much too often in other shows(which honestly has broken series for me before). You won\u2019t notice amazing details in characters or the most complex hairstyles and clothing. This series just isn\u2019t as polished as others that depend on art to succeed.\\n\\n\r\n However, if I had to choose one artistic nuance that I could deem \u201cnoticeable,\u201d it would be the sky itself. The tones of light and dark are used masterfully to illustrate the feel of the situation. It will become apparent at times that certain scenes happen at just the right time of day/night. In addition, the character designs aid the development of each character\u2019s individual personas. Since each of the main characters is shown as a child and as a teenager, you get to see something that few anime tend to focus on: individual character development. \\n\r\nAlthough I should be mentioning this in the character section, I put it under art because since this series was completely original, I just had to give my kudos to those who led the character design department. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, the show is far from the \"eye candy\" that so many today appreciate, but it is far from sub-par. By not making the series an overly gorgeous one with the most attractive characters, the audience is able to focus on the most important aspects: the story and characters. I believe that although the art was not and still is not considered top-notch, it serves its purpose in all the right ways.\\n\r\nArt-9/10 \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Anohana incorporates the heavy usage of the acoustic guitar, piano, as well as other \u201ccalming\u201d instruments. If you want a heavy metal action rock soundtrack, unfortunately, you\u2019ve come to the wrong place. Most of the background music finds this equilibrium between a soothing yet depressing feel. The series tends to favor specific tracks of their soundtrack, such as \u201cLast Train Home\u201d- a piano piece that carries a nostalgic ambiance, which perfectly accompanies many of the scenes. This same positive is also a negative. I would have personally preferred a wider variety of usage of the background music. Although I do acknowledge the decisions they made may have been the best at the time, but as the saying goes, \u201cvariety is the spice of life.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe opening, Aoi Shiori by Galileo Galilei, is a piece that probably strays the most from the entirety of the soundtrack simply because it does not use the piano as the cornerstone instrument. It definitely is a catchy song though since the tone is more upbeat than any other song in the series despite its relatively lethargic beat. \t\\n\\n\r\nThe ending, \u201cSecret Base~Kimi ga kureta Mono\u201d, is the de facto song of the series. Often, the ending songs in most anime do not stick out as much as the opening; however, Anohana has proved otherwise.  To describe it in laymen\u2019s terms, this is the song that even after the series is over, it will continue to touch your heart. Maybe it\u2019s the tone of the song (sung by the female cast) or it\u2019s the convenient situations the song is used in, but one thing will remain true in my heart: this song defines the series in terms of music. I have had friends listen to it who haven\u2019t watched the series yet and complain it might be a bit too high pitched, but everyone who I have talked to who listened to the song after they finished the series agree that it does stir up some emotion every time they listen to it.\\n\r\nSound- 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWell here we go. If one were to label a certain aspect of Anohana as the \u201cmeat and potatoes\u201d of the show, it would definitely be the character development. There are 6 main characters in this show: Yadomi Jinta (Jintan), Honma Meiko (Menma), Anjou Naruko (Anaru), Hisakawa Tetsuko (Poppo), Matsuyuki Atsumu (Yukiatsu), and Tsurumi Chiriko (Tsuruko). I will mention later why the parenthesized nicknames are important. For now, I will talk about what makes the characters in this show different from many others. \\n\\n\r\nIn many anime I have watched, it has always been story first, art second (or vice versa) and the characters are left behind to gather dust. Some shows throw one character into a certain role simply because it\u2019s \u201cconvenient\u201d but not true to his/her own character while others try to make it fit but simply lack execution. In my opinion, there\u2019s none of that in Anohana. Each character began with a certain conglomeration of traits that made him or her unique, and the script complimented them beautifully. While some may argue that certain characters may stray from their path, in each instance, there is a well thought out explanation for each \u201ctwist\u201d or \u201cloop.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nFor instance, although Jinta is characterized as a shut-in at the beginning of the show, the intriguing form of \u201creverse-development\u201d this show has explains his past as the charismatic, outgoing leader of the 6 characters\u2019 group (Super Peace Busters) quite well and how eventually he fell to his current state. As the story progresses, you\u2019ll see another forward-development in each character to essentially revert to a rather idealized form of who they once were. This begs the question of whether the creators of this show are trying to convey the message that \u201cin the end, no matter how different you may look on the outside, there will always be something important about you that will never change.\u201d While I will not explain the character development in further detail since I do not want to spoil anymore, I will guarantee that each character undergoes a similar type of development, but what\u2019s great about it is that since each character is unique in his/her own way, you will see a wide variety of great character development.  \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, what I find great about the characters is that they are easy to grown onto (unless you don\u2019t like menma\u2019s voice). Since the progression of the story tightly parallels the character development, it is an extremely smooth ride compared to other train-wrecks. \\n\\n\r\nAnother tidbit of advice when viewing the characters: pay close attention to the interaction between the characters. As you watch the show, you will notice small nuances that make the character development one step better than your average show. (I said I would talk about the nicknames, and here we are)\\n\r\nCharacters- 9/10 (Awesome with the combination of the story)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI\u2019m not completely sure whether to call it enjoyment or not, but this show is legitimately the first show where I cried my eyes out (in fact, it still gets to me even if I\u2019ve watched it multiple times already). Others before (when I was a little kid) have done so before, but none since this show have come close since then. The entire experience is necessary to enjoy the whole ride. As I stated before since each nuance of the show is so tightly tied together in what I believe is a near-perfect harmony, I did not regret watching this show at any time. In an unbiased sense, you probably won\u2019t enjoy it as much if you\u2019re too busy trying to get Menma to shut up since her voice is pretty whiny, but I was able to overlook that. Overall though, the \u201cenjoyment\u201d factor was easily satisfied.\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9/10 (oh were the tears shed)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall-8.9/10 \\n",

            "content": "This anime, unlike another anime make me feel there's 3 part of the anime that make this anime complete train wreck at the end of the story. \r\nFirst part is episode 1-7\r\nin those episode the anime gave us the strong fondation of everyone's character and it will be boring for someone who like normal rom-com etc. Same with me, after some few episode i also intended to leave this anime,but then watched it again to feel some accomplishment. I wont blame you for trying to drop this anime some few times, but just go! watch this anime, you will not regret it\r\nSecond part is episode8-10\\n\r\n*minor spoiler here*\\n\r\nAfter episode 7, the pacing in this anime become faster than mayweather's run. The pace become faster and it become interesting and somehow make one hateful character become a friendly character and all them 5 getting back together just for 1 simple objection, to fulfill menma's wish. But they failed to make menma rest in peace.\\n\\n\r\nLast part is the final episode\\n\r\nSeriously this anime is so much alike steins;gate, i mean not the genre but the pacing. At the opening it was very slow, then at the middle part the pacing become faster and one after another mystery opened up, at the last episode, it give us a beautiful ending and every mystery there all solved up in one BIG finale episode.\\n\\n\r\n*some spoilers ahead*\\n\r\nTo be honest, at episode 1 you can already predict the ending if you watched more than 10 anime at last with some drama, it is very predictable. There are 3 things i predict at first episode:\\n\r\n1. The ending must be everyone getting back together\\n\r\n2. The ending must be menma's wishes come true and she dissepeared\\n\r\n3. Because episode 1 is introduction to characters and this is a supernatural anime, episode 2-10 must be the MC finding a way to make them believe about menma while clearing up the understanding.\\n\\n\r\nSo after i watched it , am i wrong? the answer is no. Usually an anime, with predictable plot is boring, not worth it, and cant bring out tears. But this anime, somehow , even the plot is predictable and such, still giving me the feeling to let my tears out. If i were to compare, the last anime with predictable plot i've seen is 'Your lie in April' and it truthfully bore me , but this anime is much more awesome for me(even though the this anime is underrated)\\n\\n\r\n So, i will recomend it to someone that have teary eyes and already watched some anime that have boring opening episodes.",

            "content": "Although I don't think I should write this review immediately after watching the whole thing in one sitting, ergo still under the influence of massive feels, here we go.\r\nAno Hi etc etc is one of those series that you won't forget. Ever. Or at least for a very long time. It is a tear jerker to its core and a damn good one at that. By combining themes of loss and friendship they did an amazing job at delivering an enjoyable (wrong choice of words) and memorable anime. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story revolves around a group of friends who try to confront their past and the traumathat still haunts them. As you would expect from a story like that, there is quite a lot of crying, flashbacks and more crying. However, not in a bad way. The way the story is set up keeps you interested and, quite frankly, tearing up quite often.\\n\r\nThe story does not get full marks from me because I feel it could have done more with the main storyline, instead of quite often theming episodes around side stories, although them most often being quite meaningful and giving you a chance to sympathise with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are great. 9/10 great. Relatable, 'normal' characters, if you will. Each of the 6 main characters have their own 'thing' that sets them asides from the rest, and of course their own flaws, which are very important in Ano Hi. Once again, no full marks. Why? The characters were sometimes a bit too much themselves, especially Jintan. Mostly Jintan. The rest were pretty good. Also, props to the way the anime portrays the side characters, it gave the main characters more identity. \\n\r\nFav character: Poppo\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNot super amazing. Still good. It suited the story and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFirstly, I have to say that I loved the OP. The harmonics in the intro made me shiver (in a good way) every time. \\n\r\nFor the rest, the music really suited the atmosphere of the series. Not too flashy and not too dark. Perfect for an anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n11/10 without a doubt. But that might still be the feels talking. Probably the feels. But that only underlines the fact that I enjoyed (once again, wrong choice of words) it very very much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n9/10 Great anime, with some minor improvements it could have been a true and amazing masterpiece. But still...\\n\\n\r\nWould rewatch 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: 10\r\nMeiko \"Menma\" Honma was killed in a tragic accident as a child. It has been ten years since her accident and her childhood friends have moved on. Jinta \"Jintan\" Yadomi has become a hikikomori and closed himself off from society. Naruko \"Anaru\" Anjou, Atemu \"Yukiatsu\" Matsuyuki, Chiriko \"Tsuruko\" Tsurumi and Tetsudo \"Poppo\" Hisakawa have grown up and moved forward with their lives. One summer, Menma appears before Jinta and says she cannot pass on until her wish has granted. Jinta must now unite the childhood group if he is to send Menma off to Heaven. However, once the group acknowledges Menma's presence many secretssurrounding her death and their feelings around her start to resurface and it leaves them wondering if they want to see their friend leave them a second time.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI personally really enjoyed the animation. I thought the characters and scenery were drawn out really well. The art made the anime even more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about the anime would be the soundtrack. The opening theme is \"Aoi Shiori\" by Galileo Galilei. The opening animation depicts images of each individual character as they start to reminisce about their childhood. However, I think the song is in Menma's point of view since the lyrics suggest that she is stuck and she can't write the next chapter(her afterlife) so she has put a bookmark in the diary. The song also implies for the other characters for it describes that they have one hand out looking for Menma. The ending song is a cover by Zone and it is called, \"Secret Base ~Kimi ga Kureta Mono~ (10 years after Ver.) It is performed by Ai Kayano, Haruka Tomatsu, and Saori Hayami. The lyrics and ending animation tell of how the gang and Menma value their childhood memories and that in ten years time they hope to meet again. Menma especially holds on to these memories for she loves everybody in the club.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe character cast is brilliant with some minor and supporting cast. The main characters are the members of the club: Jinta \"Jintan\" Yadomi, Naruko \"Anaru\" Anjou, Atemu \"Yukiatsu\" Matsuyuki, Chiriko \"Tsuruko\" Tsurumi, Tetsudo \"Poppo\" Hisakawa and Meiko \"Menma\" Honma. Menma was the one who started the group and even gave everyone their nicknames. She appointed Jintan the leader. Menma acknowledges that she is dead but even so, she can still eat, sleep and play like she was alive. Her cheerful and cute personality gives her many admirers and many people to hate her because of that fact. She is like the peacemaker of the group and she can only be seen by Jintan(at first.)  The other characters are deeply affected by Menma's death especially Yukiatsu who had very strong feelings towards Menma. As we explore the pasts with them, we learn very deep and emotional things about the characters and their feelings for the group. The cast is deeply developed and the minor characters include Menma's grieving family and Jintan's carefree father. I enjoyed the cast of characters for they were very much like a real close knit family in the end even going by their old nicknames like friends in real life would do after a friend's passing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nOverall, this piece was absolutely beautiful. It was emotional, tragic, comedic and a bit romantic. Animation was breathtaking and the music was absolutely genius. The downside though is that the anime is only 11 episodes long and the ending can sort of leave the viewer guessing about what happened after. \\n\r\nI highly recommend this slice of life genre anime for it relates to real life and the story is absolutely magnificent. I shed a lot of tears. It is a beautiful, heartwarming story I think everyone would love.",

            "content": "(PLEASE READ BEFORE MARKING IT NOT HELPFUL NOT BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THE SCORE I GAVE IT)\r\n\u201cIll see you again this next August as we all return to our secret base\u201d. In western modern life death is a very distant concept. It\u2019s nearly a taboo to talk about.  Life now is not like the days of old where a loss of your children was common place. Now a days it seems to have a most prolific effect on people and then it\u2019s gone\u2026 people seem to move on, but do they truly ever get over it? Death is something we in modern society forceto the back of our mind. It\u2019s generally made to be forgotten, almost taboo. Yet death is something we dwell on more than any other thing. Truly some of use can never let go\u2026. In Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (Written by Nagai Tatsuyuki) or Ano Hana this is the central theme, but not the only one. It goes into multiple themes of friendship, family, and how we grow with the losses in our lives. I personally like to call this anime The Bridge to Terabithia  \u2026. the after story. If you haven\u2019t read that book or seen its Disney movie adaptation; it\u2019s the story of two kids, one boy and one girl who play in the summer with each other. The girl \u201cTera\u201d dies in the river later in the book. A very similar event occurred 10 years before the events in Anohana. It\u2019s this death of a childhood friend called Menma who was the \u201csunshine\u201d of friends and family that is the catalyst for the plot. After her death the group of friends grows apart and her family becomes distant from people. This is shown especially in menma\u2019s mother, who grows distant from society \u201cshe hasn\u2019t lived since that day\u2026.\u201d  August 10 years later after Menma\u2019s death her spirit appears, yet no one else but our main protagonist \u201cJinta\u201d can see and talk ot her. This is in turn is dismissed at first as hallucinations by Jinta. Soon the \u201cHallucination\u201d is too real and tells him things he never knew. Menma with Jinta must now get their childhood friends back together and fulfill her dyeing wish so she may go on to heaven. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs to the story of this anime it is generally very good, border line great, but not truly amazing. It does have some problems. These problems are generally found within the script writing. The interactions are repeated throughout story. Such as the Fact that the friends can\u2019t see Menma and the friends have trouble believing that she exists. This is annoying as she can affect the physical world, she even eats. It in my opinion is the biggest problem as she can easily reveal herself, but has trouble doing so for 70% of the series. It is not completely detrimental, yet it is one of those things only there for convince of the plot that can annoy the hell out of you. The other flaw is that things are not explained so well, it glazes over major points of 10 years ago very quickly and focuses more on the modern time. It\u2019s this understanding of the events of 10 years ago that a paramount to the feelings of each character, especially the events of \u201cthat day\u201d. Which are still left shrouded somewhat even after the end of the series. This I believe is why they are making a movie about the events 10 years go set for August 31st. to cover the lack of important development in that area. I really can\u2019t blame it though, it\u2019s 11 episodes and doesn\u2019t have the time,.. it just feels a little rushed\u2026 For what Anohana does well it does VERY well. As a slice of life does something unique\u2026 Its main focus is NOT romance and it doesn\u2019t use ENDLESS comedic situations to get your attention. It\u2019s the interaction between characters and their hidden feelings of remorse, grief and love that drive the plot instead.  The main meat of the plot is the modern day. Each character appears to have moved on besides our main Jinta. Yet, it is soon reveled that every person is still shaken by the event of \u201cthat day\u201d even 10 years from it, some just as badly as Jinta, and sometimes worse than Jinta. This then reveals a set of complex character interactions that all revolve around that summer 10 years ago.  The truly great part is how the seemingly happy content people are in the first episodes. Yet, the revival of Menma\u2019s spirit brings out the darker feelings of her death that was pushed to the back of each character\u2019s minds. It\u2019s the use of this as each character with the hidden emotion comes to grippes with her death for the last time. This is what stands true and tall in Anohana and it succeeds this in spades.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was done by A-1, The color Palates are vibrant and animation for both the Ending and Opennning themes is well done. The design for the city and forest are also top notch. The only thing is there is little to no symbolic art direction, and it\u2019s a pretty safe normal slice of life design on characters. Though the characters of Hisakawa and Menma seem to be the most uniquely designed.  All in all animation is good, just nothing truly great or amazing here.\\n\\n\r\nSound was composed by Aketagawa, Jin. Who was in charge of sound in amines like Shakugan no Shana and BlassReiter. Just looking at this list of anime hes composed I must say on pure number I am impressed. Now as for Anohan\u2019s score itself there are two songs that stood out to me. For the Ost my choice is \u201cAll about her death\u201d which is a piano solo with hints of xylophones on occasion in the background and a large dash of violin near the end this is the Ost that plays at the end of the series. For Ost\u2019s it has a love for piano, which for an emotional anime is quit regular. Honorable mention and my 2nd favorite Ost is \u201cThe Last Train Home\u201d. The stand alone best track in the series is the ending theme \u201cKimi ga Kureta\u201d or in English \u201cSecret Base\u201d, which is so fitting its often used as an Ost. It\u2019s a peppy song that I wouldn\u2019t call pop, but more of an ode to summer and the times of children. This also uses piano greatly as the primary instrument with background of violins and I don\u2019t even know\u2026 rocks? But with great vocals it sounds amazing. Overall the score is very fitting, but only has 2 or 3 good to great tracks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the strongest point of Anohana. It\u2019s the simple base personalities that seem bland as first, but they are truly just a faced. Each character that appears fine truly hurts on the inside. With the Catylist of Menma\u2019s spirit it brings out all the pent up regrets and emotion showing the true side to the bland base plain personalities that the characters paint themselves with.  As for the Base Personalities by episode 1\u2019s end ill go as follows:\\n\\n\r\nJinta: Visibly hurt form loses, lost his mother recently and has never gotten over Menma as he loved her, but was shy of it and never confessed it before she died. He shuts himself indoors and rarely goes outside.\\n\\n\r\nMenma: Liked by everyone, peppy and nice. She died that day. She was in the sense the glue that held the friends together.\\n\\n\r\nHisakawa: Is the Jokester, he is always happy and ready to go. Though he has some hidden feelings himself. \\n\\n\r\nAnaru: Now a \u201cpopular girl\u201d use to be nerdy tomboy in group. \\n\\n\r\nMatsuyuki: Boy now on the fast track to success high one responsibility appears to have gotten over the death of Menma.\\n\\n\r\nTsurumi: Conserved girl always hanging out with Matsuyuki, also out of all has gotten over things the most. Tells Jinta to get over with it and calls him pitiful. \\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses of these characters and there childhood group now torn apart. It shows that even the most hardened and most visibly not hurt are hurting just as bad. I can\u2019t go anymore for sake of no spoiler, but believe me when I tell you this is its greatest part, and Anohana in the category has impressed me in every way. \\n\\n\r\nAnoHana was one of the most enjoyable anime I\u2019ve watch recently this summer, which made it feel all the more fitting. Would I call it a Favorite? Hmm maybe for enjoyment top 10 or so somewhere, but critically? No, not by a long shot. This is a show that is good for only certain people. It is not a show id recommend to you unless I knew your taste. But, if you want a story about the morals of death and the grief of them on people in the long term then I cannot recommend a better anime for that. Over all Anohana is a great story whose mistakes are barely notices through the pure amount of feels.  Some may call that a low blow, and it is, but it\u2019s so sweet frankly I don\u2019t care. A truly great story of love and loss. For this I cannot recommend enough. Its shows like these that make me wish to relive those days. The days, 10 years ago with my own friends in our little secret base\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nRaptor-8/10 overall critical score.\\n",

            "content": "Life, we all live it, and some day we'll all lose it. But how do we deal with a situation where someone close to you dies before you do? It has been said that a love that is lost when it is at it's height will never fade. It will haunt you forever. What do you regret doing to that person? What do you regret not having said to that person when you had the chance? What do you do if no matter what you do you are no competition against someone who is already dead, when even their death does not destroy the sourceof your jealousy? AnoHana is about all of that.\\n\\n\r\nJinta, Menma, Yukiatsu, Anaru, Tsurumi, and Popo. a group of young friends that banded together to fight the imaginary evils of the world from their secret base and create fun for all. A bright group where every member seemed like they had a strong future. Now they are all grown up, separated, and in every case except one, depressed. Jinta, our main character who is a shut in who blames himself for the events of his past, was once the great leader of the group until everything spiraled into chaos.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show i would recommend if you are into philosophical and emotional shows. A show where you learn about people or makes you think about yourself. It is easy to sympathize with Jinta. Everyone has at some point in there lives lost loved ones. If not to death, to time and distance.\\n\\n\r\nThe show often jumps back and forth between time lines showing current day events and then jumping to a distant childhood memory that our main cast is reminded of. Due to the age difference and the changes our characters have undertaken, none of the time jumps are confusing and in most cases really help to solidify the events of the current time line.\\n\\n\r\nOverall character development is strong, each one of them is changed by the experiences they encounter during the course of the show. They are tangible and you just can't help but to love each of them and feel sorry for them. The music does a great job of delivering the mood of the moment. If you have the time and are looking to feel a bit of nostalgia for childhood, or looking to have your heart strings pulled, this is a show worth your time.",

            "content": "I started watching the series because it sounded similar to a story idea that I had previous to hearing about the series. Honestly, if it had turned out to be exactly the same as what I had imagined I might've enjoyed it more, but as it seems they were two very different ideas. The concept of a friendly ghost within a series is always pretty intriguing as it can be used as a very good way to flesh out a character who feels \"haunted\" or perhaps literally is haunted. Anohana was the latter, and the protagonist was being followed around by a childhood friend ofhis who, in case you haven't realized it, died when she was young. The girls name is Meiko and she has returned because she has unfinished business and needs help figuring out what needs to be done in order to grant her wish and let her enter the afterlife. The series must cover some pretty sensitive stuff and touch the audience's heart in a very emotionally connecting way, right? Not really.\\n\\n\r\nAnohana set itself up to fail as a series that makes Meiko out to be \"the girl that everyone loves\", \"every girl wants to be Meiko\", \"every boy wants to date Meiko\", among other ridiculous things. This wouldn't have been so bad if they had at least explained WHY everybody liked her so much or at least toned down a bit. It seems as if they assumed the audience wouldn't have been sad about a child dying unless they stress how popular she was, which isn't really true. A simple \"our childhood friend died and it all upset us because she was so young and we all cared about her\" would've sufficed instead of the dragged-on parade about how great she was and how jealous everybody was of this literal toddler. \\n\\n\r\nWhen a character like Meiko gets set up to be the greatest human to have ever lived, it's kind of like a pie in the face when you are actually introduced to her. She isn't that great, she is very annoying, and it is hard to feel bad for her when things go wrong because of these things. However, Meiko isn't exclusive to being the only annoying character in the series. All the other characters except for Tetsudou seem to be malicious for absolutely no reason. Like at worst if you bring up a dead loved one, the surrounding people will either get quiet, maybe get a bit angry or ask you to change the topic. No, these characters go as far as pranking the protagonist into thinking she is still alive by dressing up as her and wandering the woods for a few days JUST BECAUSE they are \"so angry\" with the protagonist for bringing her up after all those years. In case you happen to be new to this world, that is what we call \"over the top\" and \"not very believable\". Honestly the scene was supposed to be sad but I couldn't help but laugh at how ridiculous it was. But it doesn't end there.\\n\\n\r\nRomance seems to be thrown into the series randomly which, not to be blunt, shouldn't have been a priority in a story that starts with a group of 6 year olds. In fact, the reason Meiko dies has something to do with romance that is once again hard to believe and not that sad. There is a subtle romance between every guy and Meiko, and a jealous fit between every girl and Meiko that I personally didn't care about. At all. The amount of times characters literally say \"I wanted to be her\" is unsettling and obsessive to a point where I can't really say I liked any of the characters. But referring back to my main point, the romance was wishy washy, pointless and I would've preferred literally anything else in its place.\\n\\n\r\nAfter an enormous amount of time getting the characters to all sit in one room together without explosive amounts of drama, they get together to accomplish the one wish that Meiko wants. It takes a lot of time, money, effort and quite a bit of screen time but they eventually finish it and find out that it wasn't what Meiko wanted. But luckily, the characters grew closer as friends because of the bond they rebuilt making this big waste of time and are now all friends again....WRONG. They once again go back to bickering. It kind of makes you wonder if they would've stayed friends anyway regardless of if Meiko had lived or not. I won't give spoilers but the series ends with everything all wrapped up and everything is fine again, but a lot of the series gives off the vibe of \"was this all worth the effort?\" to which the answer was usually \"no\".\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap up a big review I'll just say this series, in my opinion, was much like Meiko. Advertised as the literal greatest thing to have ever walked the earth... but ended up being annoying and played out for too long.",

            "content": "What type of anime is AnoHana you might want to ask. I would answer like this:\r\nAnoHana is a breath of fresh air in the anime industry nowadays, a type of anime that is exactly what you think it is.\r\n It has no outstanding twist, complicated course of events, mind-blowing original concept or anything of that sort.\r\nIt is a simple anime,that is wonderful in its modesty, and has an original concept that stands on its own and differentiates himself from the \"Drama & Slice of Life\" genre.\r\n How can such a simple anime breakthrough from the standard and deliver such strong emotions and have such powerfulimpact on viewers? First of all, AnoHana is special, it holds a dear place in my heart, not only because it made me cry throughout the entire story, but because it made me empathise with the characters, get attached to them. It makes you want to support them, to cry when they are sad, to smile when they are happy and makes you feel as if you are not only an outsider, a simple viewer, but as someone that actively takes part in the story. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime made me feel happy not from just watching the odyssey of the growth of adolescent youth, but feeling as if I myself was taking part of it,part of the \"Super Peace Busters\" group of friends.\\n\\n\r\n                                                     ~ Story~:\\n\r\nAs metioned above,AnoHana doesn't have the most original plot, but it certainly adds something new and powerful, pretending to be quiet summer breeze but took the viewers by storm, unleashing its most efficient arsenal: the ability to make people think, to make people realise that the characters could be real people, the type of people you pass by on the street or wait for the train in the subway.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime skillfully manages to portray everyday humans confronting their deepest regrets and sorrows. The story guides you through the lives of the main characters and their inner confilicts that all connect to what happened in the past,when they were just normal kids that befriended each other and formed  \"a secret assemblage that will protect the world\" named Super Peace Busters\". Until one day a dispute emerges between the members of the group culminating with a tragic incident and the loss of the most beloved member, Menma-chan.\\n\\n\r\nThe death of Menma-chan has a domino effect, resulting in the drifting apart of the original members one by one. Interestingly enough the story oscillates between the past and the present, making the viewer feel as if  they stand in front of a  puzzle that needs to be solved, each scene being a piece that needs to be assembled so that it creates an entire scenery.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 7\\n\\n\r\n                                                        ~ Art~:\\n\r\nThe art of AnoHana comes through magnificently. The studios Aniplex (Baccano!, Darker than Black,Durarara!!), A-1 Pictures (Ookiku Furikabutte) and Fuji TV (Haibane Renmei ) combined their efforts resulting in this hidden gem.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8\\n\\n\r\n                                                     ~Sound~:\\n\r\nI find the sound very compelling,especially the ending, \"Secret Base \u79d8\u5bc6\u57fa\u5730\" sung by the all-female band Zone, I think it's one of the most profound yet heartaching songs I ever heard. It evokes feelings of nostalgia and longing fused with the fond memories of the childhood.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8\\n\\n\r\n                                               ~Characters~:\\n\r\nThe characters are for me the strongest element of the entire anime. They \\n\r\nare first introduced to the audience as a group of adolescents that were once best friends but lost personal contact over time. At first glance they seem living a normal life with no hardships or worries, but at a more closer look their carefree masks begins to crack,revealing feelings of remorse and repentance.\\n\\n\r\nThe hikikomori Jinta, once the leader of the group and the most popular kid. The frivolius Anaru, once the shy and timid girl with glasses and also an otaku. The smart, model-student, good-looking Yukiatsu that also crossdresses in secret, once the only kid that would contradict the leader. The quiet, calm and collected Tsuruko that remained unchanged.\\n\r\nThe small but spirited and  whimsical, Poppo, that grew up bigger than expected but other than that remained the same, and finally Menma-chan that other than growing up physically even as a ghost, remains the same cheerful girl showing a bright wide  simle on her face regardless of her inner sorrows.\\n\r\nIt was pure delight to observe their metamorphosis throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8\\n\\n\r\n                                                ~Enjoyment~:\\n\r\nI think that by now the reader of this review already noticed my affinity for this series.I can say this, however: I was shaken by this anime, moved to tears in a way that no anime did through such a subtle and simple,yet refined and powerful way until now. I believe this anime will stay with me long after I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n",

            "content": "I see many people liking, or even adoring this show, and I can see why. But, I don't think this show is worth it. And since I haven't seen a lot of negative reviews of this show, here's what I think of it and why.\r\nSince it seems to be a tradition among reviewers, I'll do this point by point\r\nSTORY (3.0/10)\r\nAt first, AnoHana's story seems interesting: An original story that will deal with the themes of grief, regrets, death and afterlife. It has everything to become a good show!... If only...\r\nVery soon, the story becomes one of the major flaws of this anime: Everything, about thecharacters' backstory, Menma's reappearance and how the characters deal with it, seems childish as hell. This story deals with themes like the grief after someone's death, the passage from childhood to adulthood, the afterlife and of course the power of friendship. It covers these topics, but it does it too superficially: The messages the show addresses are very simplistic (like ''you can accomplish anything with the power of friendship'', or ''if a friend helps you, help him back''), and never let you actually question them by presenting other points of view. In short: AnoHana's story is too simplistic (and the best example of that is near the half of the show, in the ''rocket arc'' (I won't spoil, but if you've seen the show, you'll get), which is something I have seen in most of my childhood shows), though I think it does make it a good kids show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (4.4/10)\\n\r\nAnoHana's characters might not be as shallow as the story, but they aren't particularly good either. Although they do have character development, they all seem quite one-dimensional, and this is due to the fact that, except for the 2 main protagonists, their development seemed incomplete, or even rushed. I think some of them needed to have more screen time. Because of that, none of them was likable, except Menma who is by far the best character in the series\\n\\n\r\nART (7.5/10)\\n\r\nThe art in AnoHana is really good, without particularly standing out: Character-designs are believable (none of them is overly-sexy or overly-moe), backgrounds are nice, the animation is fluid, and there are some stand-out points like the change of tone between the main story and the flashbacks. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8.3/10)\\n\r\nThe sound is certainly the best part of AnoHana. I really liked the voice acting, especially for Menma, since I really like Ai Kayano's voice (it's my personal tastes, though). As for the music, it's simple: AnoHana's soundtrack (including the opening) is one of my favorites. It is simple, peaceful, full of emotions and I always listen to it when I need to relax. Works everytime. I also need to mention the ending, which is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard (it makes me want to cry much more than the anime itself)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (3.4/10)\\n\r\nSince I didn't know where to include it otherwise, I'll now talk about what I think is the worst part of AnoHana (this wasn't even the story). This anime tries to be too dramatic, too often, and does too much to achieve it. Let's take an exemple of an anime that does its emotional part well: Toradora (Without any doubt my favorite Slice-of-life anime). In Toradora, the story focuses on the characters, with a touch of comedy, and make them likable, with a light-hearted story. The emotional climax kicks in only very late in the show, and that's what makes it so powerful: When you get attached to the characters, see them smile and have fun, it hits you right in the feels when you see them cry. AnoHana does exactly the opposite: There is a dramatic scene in almost each episode (and I'm not even talking about how these scenes are exaggerated), and the characters seem permanently sad and depressed. Add to this that, as I said, these characters aren't especially likable, and you'll understand why I'm saying this show is a failed drama\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (4.0/10)  \\n\r\nIf you couldn't tell even after reading my review, I really didn't like AnoHana. It isn't a bad show strictly speaking, but with its childish story, its meh characters and its failed drama, I definitely can't recommend it. Instead, I can recommend you other better animes of the same genre:\\n\r\n-Toradora, as I said before, is my favorite slice-of-life anime\\n\r\n-Angel Beats, dealing with similar themes, but done much better, with a lot of likable characters (it has some flaws though)\\n\r\n-Shigatsu wa kimi no Uso, I just finished watching it, and it's a damn good drama (with awesome music)\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind that I'm still open to discussion, so if you disagree, leave a comment, I'm interested in your opinion",

            "content": "I just want to strangle the guy who created this wonderful piece for making me cry so much. \r\nAnoHi (not going to write out the whole thing) is a beautiful story about a girl who  dies, but returns to one of her best friends in the form of a sort of \"spirit\" - but things are not they once were. Her best friends are now all separated and seems hopelessly... unsalvageable (I don't think that's a word, but screw it). \r\nThe story was simplistic and straightforward - something I really appreciated. There was no need to think hard about what was happening about thescreen in front of me and made it far easier to enjoy and soak in the emotions the story was trying to give off. And the conflicts/drama between the characters with their backstories really put me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The pacing was done well considering that it was a 12-episode piece, finishing off strong with a powerful ending that led me staring at the computer screen long after the credits finished rolling with water leaking from my eyes. One last thing I really liked was that the story didn't end the way I had expected. It caught me by slight surprise, which just added to the leaking water I had pouring out of my eyes. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were also simple - nothing special, yet they were both of high quality that could definitely be appreciated as strengthening supplements to the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the story were so colorful. Junpei, Menma, and the rest of the friends all had their quirks and talents, yet they all had a hidden side to them that was revealed as the story went on. And it was heart-warming to see the development of the friends returning to their close relationship to one another as now young adults. \\n\\n\r\nI was sorely disappointed that the story ended the way it did - and so short too! I might have liked it if they stretched it out over a little longer with more cherishing moments of Menma returning to the gang of friends she left with her death - but the ending was beautiful - something I cannot deny no matter how much I wanted another ending. And I really could appreciate the author taking that route, leaving the ending open-ended to a sliver of hope for the rest of the audience before the curtain closes for the last time.",

            "content": "So, this is my first review on this site, I apologize if it doesn't really make sense / if the sentences are incomprehensible. Anyway, Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai, or AnoHana for short, has been raved about in the anime community, and it's been hailed as a beautifully tragic tearjerker as one of my friends (of whom saw me watch the anime and subsequently enjoyed it) put it. \r\nWell... It was a bit of a letdown, I have to say.\r\nI was excited - star-studded cast and the main being voiced by one of my biases (Irino Miyu)? Sign meup! From what I'd seen before starting the series, it was met with generally positive reviews, the synopsis seemed interesting and hey - the art looked quite decent. So why not give it a shot?\\n\\n\r\nThroughout my viewing of the anime, I have produced a list of pros and cons that will be easier to scan through rather than if I threw in an entire chunk of text.\\n\\n\r\nPROS -\\n\r\n+ The voice acting was wonderfully done. The actors could really capture the emotion and the atmosphere that SHAFT probably wanted us to feel, and it really helped the anime a lot. Their voices just hold so much power, and they thankfully moulded the characters into what we were expecting, so kudos to you, seiyuus!\\n\r\n+ The character designs and most of their personalities. You remember all of their quirky behaviours and actions be it by seiyuu, actions or just appearance, which makes the characters all the more memorable and less flat.\\n\r\n+ The main character, Jinta. Let me just point out that his personality is quite unique and not the typical \"likeable\" type. No, we're talking about a NEET that's exhausted 24/7 that is sometimes long-winded and can be very stubborn. So some of the audience may turn out to dislike him. But in my case, I find his flaws to make him stand out more as his own character. He's not the generic dense main protagonist you might find prevalent in other series. He's so painfully average that it's just so true to him that I can hardly dislike him. Not to mention he is voiced by Irino-san, which may have resulted in him starting on an uneven playing field, unlike the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow, cue the groans and complaints, because here comes...\\n\\n\r\nCONS - \\n\r\n- Menma. I know we're all supposed to melt and gush over the moe moe kyun kyun characters in anime, and I admit I'm guilty of that. But above them, I like more serious girls that have immense character development throughout episodes of the anime they are in (e.g. Tenshi from Angel Beats!). But that doesn't mean I don't like adorable characters. However, Menma is a different story. I sort of got fed up with her clinging to Jinta when all the poor boy wants is to get by his life normally without the ghost of his dead childhood friend tailing him at any given moment squealing \"Jintan!\" at him all the time. When he sometimes snaps at her I don't blame him at all. Frankly, I wouldn't be able to take that much either. I get it, she's the tragic girl that wants her crush to reciprocate her undying love for them and so on. However, having an overboard annoying personality doesn't help her situation. It makes me go more \"goddamn it Jintan, get exorcised already\" rather than \"goddamn it Jintan, just love her already\", truth to be told. \\n\r\n- Yukiatsu's personality. Two words for him: Just no. He may be voiced by Takahiro Sakurai but, and I can't believe I'm saying this, Sakurai-san unfortunately couldn't make this son of a gun likeable. I get he's angsty and all that crap but dude?? Cut it out?? You're making the series worse as it goes on???\\n\r\n- \"Jinta is insane\", \"Menma isn't there\". The frustration fest. Cue the unbelieving stares and sneers directed at our poor main protagonist who is just trying his very best to satisfy everyone. He is a NEET, but goddamn it, NEETs can be trustworthy sometimes! It was just so frustrating to see everyone dismiss Jinta's claims as bullshit and treat him like a piece of worthless trash (except for you Poppo, you're a cool guy. And eventually Anaru too). Like, yes, I get why they might be skeptical of his claims - who suddenly starts spouting stories about their dead friend? - but Jinta has no reason to pull a practical joke on them! His personality doesn't make him that type of person to make up tall tales to get attention; he's a freaking NEET! And shouldn't it take you less than 10ish episodes of constant insisting to go: \"Hey, let's all stop and listen to what Jinta has to say, maybe - and I'm gonna go out on a limb here - he's TELLING THE TRUTH\"? Seriously, couldn't they have talked this through like rational people instead of yelling their feelings out?\\n\r\n- This anime... didn't really succeed at being the tearjerker of the century. Despite all its attempts at making its ending super emotional and beautiful yet heartfelt and sad, I shed only one tear. That was nothing compared to my reaction after watching Angel Beats - hell, I shed slightly more when watching a three to four minute AMV of Hotarubi no Mori E! So since it was supposed to be a \"cry your eyes out\" series I can tell why I don't rate it highly.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Menma is moe moe kyun kyun and may not be likeable and Jintan is subjectively awesome so watch at your own risk.",

You get hyped for it, and also expect a lot from it. But as you watch, you're asking yourself, where is the great show? Are you actually watching the right thing? You want to say no, but the answer is opposite. So you keep going, hoping that it will get better. But it never gets... \r\nWell, mumbling aside, that is the case with me and Anohana. Widely regarded as one of the most emotinal shows out there and definetly oneof the most popular shows of 2010's. Praised for it's great story-telling, beautiful animation, loveable characters and believable relations between them. The qualites of the show were set, atleast that's what I thought. But the truth is, apart from the great animation, none of the mentioned things met my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime tells a story of six childhood friends. In the past, they used to hang out all the time, they had their own club-room and spent a lot of time together. However, a certain accident changed everything and our characters were never the same again. Until the first episode of course, because like it happens everytime, another certain thing made them go back together...\\n\\n\r\nThis is boring tho, saying stuff like \"certain thing\" to hide some possible spoilers won't cut it. The thing is, Menma, the MC of this show, died when they were young. Causing the other 5 friends to blame each other for her death. Ultimatelly, a few years later, Menma comes back as a ghost. She appears in front of Jintan, our second MC, and one from the original group. He's depressed, he doesn't go to school. But when Menma comes in, everything changes. They think that the reason she came back is that she has some sort of a wish. So, to figure out what it is, they decide to gather their group once again.\\n\\n\r\nThey do just like they say. And in an instant, our group is completed. We have Poppo, an energetic dude, that is willing to help his friends with everything. Atsumu, possibly a cool guy, that ends up being the edgiest character I've seen in a while. Chiriko, a heart-of-stone bitch. Naruko, nice and hard-working girl and pretty much the only likeable character the show has. Jintan, who would do everything in the world for a dead Menma, but wouldn't move his ass for anybody else. And of course Menma, the girl the whole show is about.\\n\\n\r\nShe is, I have to say, kinda of a big deal. Not really because she's the main character. Rather because I don't really understand how can so many people like her. She's supposed to be a very loli waifu-like character. Which is a big problem already. I don't know about other people, but I would personally want my waifu to be a little capable. Which goes against Menma, because she actually is the most good-for-nothing character I've ever seen. She only does a couple of things for the whole show. 1) yell for no reason at Jinta 2) cry (like a lot) 3) try to cook something, but fail miserably. She doesn't do anything besides these three things, and she does them quite a lot. She's also super dumb, over-emotional and overall just super annoying. I swear if I could punch her, she wouldn't end with just a one bruise on her face. I also don't find her to be cute at all. \\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, I have a lot of problems with her. To set the bar just a little higher, I also think she's the worst character I've ever seen in any anime. The biggest problem however is that her annoyingness becomes an unbearable thing to overcome. I just simply can't enjoy a show when I'm thinking only about how terrible she is. Which is a shame, because aside the characters, the anime really isn't as bad as the score might suggest.\\n\\n\r\nThe lives and stories in between the other four characters (Poppo, Atsumu, Chiriko, Naruko) are actually quite interesting. Although I think the characters could have been written way better, their relations, argues and problems are one the things that forced me to continue. Sadly enough, the moment the show goes back to the main storyline, that includes Menma and Jinta, it once again goes down to trash. Their shit just doesn't work. Like I already mentioned, Jintan is a stubborn freak, who would move his finger for anybody else, but for Menma, he ends up working 24/7 just to make her wish come true. Nothing but a pain in the ass.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story wasn't as bad. Yes, the parts including Menma and Jintan are not only annoying, but also actually super boring. The side stories including the others are balacing it out tho, they are well made and thought up. These four actually act like normal people (not counting some very extreme moments). The ending is what would you propably expect, full of tears and emotions. Once again of course, I was so busy with thinking about how would I love to punch Menma, that I didn't really pay attention. Just the thing you get when you hate a character to the core.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to say something positive. The animation is beautiful. Stylization aside form Menma is perfect and the whole anime just looks really good. Voice-acting is nice, OST is decent, opening and ending are both god-like. It's a shame that these great production values weren't used for a better written show that this crap was.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nYou see, Anohana isn't a terrible anime. Yes, my enjoyment of it was very low and it's story is very inconsistent. But even though, I know a ton of people who I would recommend it to. My problem with it is that the show itself bets on the fact that you'll fall in love with the characters. Which I sadly can't. I'm sorry, but I just can't love with such a childish, dumb and good-for-nothing character as Menma is. Same goes for Jintan. And same goes for the overall weak cast, that this show presents.",

            "content": "Ano Hana is an emotional tale full of friendship, romance, and, in a lot of ways, redemption. It centers around a close group of childhood friends known as the \"Super Peace Busters\" who inevitably drift apart following the accidental death of one of their members. The group itself is made up of six members, each with an affectionate nickname, including: the hikkikomori Jinta Yadomi (\"Jintan\"), the rebel girl Naruko Anjou (\"Anaru\"), the arrogant playboy Atsumu Matsuyuki (\"Yukiatsu\"), the collected Chiriko Tsurumi (\"Tsuruko\"), the happy-go-lucky Tetsudo Hisakawa (\"Poppo\") and the playful Meiko Honma (\"Menma\") who died in the accident that one summer's day ten years ago.\\n\\n\r\nEach character's distinct personality and the interactions that each has with another create a nice balanced dynamic, much like a good group of friends should. Of course, these characters weren't always the way they are in the present day, and over the course of the series you'll see how Menma's death alters each character's present personality. All the character performances are great, but it's undeniable that Ai Kayano's performance as the eternal child Menma steals the show. While the character's effervescent voice can be hit-or-miss, it's a definite testament to the flexibility of a talented and underrated seiyuu. \\n\\n\r\nThe narrative jumps between the day of Menma's accident and the present day (ten years after), slowly unraveling the events of that day and revealing why things ended up the way they did. Utilizing common elements of a mystery, like suppressed truths and hidden motives, Ano Hana makes you ask questions and does a pretty fantastic job of answering all of them at a reasonable pace that is guaranteed to keep you watching.\\n\\n\r\nWith Ano Hana being a completely original work, A-1 Pictures had a lot of freedom with the animation, and they do not disappoint. Character designs are nice (they actually change clothes!) and there are plenty of details in each facial expression, which is essential for an emotional work like this. Something about the animation that struck me was the cinematic feel of it all. The shot types are varied, from beautiful shots of scenery to extreme close-ups of part of someone's face, and the camera actually moves around, making things feel a lot more alive and organic.\\n\\n\r\nThe score successfully captures the nature of the entire series. It's playful, nostalgic, and even heartrending. From soft piano passages to gentle guitar plucks, the music helps connect the events and the characters from both the past and present. The ending song, \"Secret Base,\" is performed by the three lead female characters and typically plays over part of the last scene of each episode, adding a certain child-like feeling. This allows time to not only reflect on the episode, but our similar experiences as well. The opening song, \"Aoi Shiori,\" is one of my favorite songs of all time and perfectly fits the feel of the entire series: wistful at times, but ultimately hopeful.\\n\\n\r\nOne of Ano Hana's shortcomings is that some of its melodrama can feel forced at times. However, the series definitely does a great job of utilizing comedic breaks to prevent the series from becoming overbearingly maudlin. Its main strength, I feel, is its ability to give layers of depth to each character in such a short amount of time (only 11 episodes). The preconception that you have for a character is often turned upon its head. It's a unique type of character development where their traits already exist; it just takes some trigger to pull back the layers that mask them. That catalyst happens to be Menma's reappearance, and the layers being the years that have passed since her death. It plays upon the idea of the importance of a single person's life and how profound of an impact she can have on everyone in her life.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if I can recommend Ano Hana enough. It's more than an anime. It's an emotional experience that everyone can relate to. We all have friends, we all grow up, and we all experience loss. It's how we cope with these experiences that make us who we are, though. In Ano Hana, the dead feel alive, the alive feel dead, and it takes the reappearance of an old friend to remind the \"Super Peace Busters\" that friendship does not die so easily.",

            "content": "Time.  It changes all of us.  The events and instances that occur within the finite time we have called life, can affect and differ as the illusion of time passes by us.  I've known about this show for a while, and always put if off since I can't handle drama shows.  But, after lots and lots of pestering from my peers, as well as a positive review from one of my favorite reviewers, I finally watched it.  And boy, am I glad I did.  Today, Anohana, the flower we saw that day.  \r\nStory (8.32/10):  The story ofAnohana is simple.  Our main protagonist Jinta is dealt a twisted hand of fate, as a ghost from his past shows up in his home, pestering him to no ends, all the while, looking like a girl that he once knew from his past.  It is then that he embarks on a quest where he must try and find out what this girl's wish is, in order to move her onto heaven.\\n\\n\r\nFor the main plot of the story, the plot is quite simple.  For the majority of the time, we get to see the six main characters' attempts to try and find out what the wish of the ghost girl Menma, is.  However, the plot is more than that, farther than that, and much more better than that.  To put it simply, this show is a character driven drama show detailing the effects of one character's death on a good number of people.  For the entire 11 episode plot line, this is what the show is about, and it definitely executed its idea fairly well.  However, there were a few problems that I found with the show's plot line.\\n\\n\r\nThe first one is with the show's beginning.  Personally, I found the show's beginning episode to be...rather sudden.  In the first few minutes, you're more or less shoved right into the beginning of where the story starts.  Personally, I found it a bit uncomfortable, as I felt that a more gradual approach for the first few minutes would've made it a bit better, as just throwing the ghost girl right at us from minute one seemed a bit much for the very beginning.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the biggest gripe I have with the show, (although not a very large gripe), is the fact that the character stories felt unbalanced.  Since the show is a character focused show, the show is mainly focused on what the characters have in terms of characteristics, as well as what effect the overarching event the show show's plot in revolved around.  Personally, I found an imbalance of character importance, with some characters getting more development, entire episodes being devoted to them, while others barely got any decent screen time in order to explain how they have changed and what their regret was.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall though, regardless of the few flaws that the show had, it was still a very good story overall.  It was a very good effect story, showing what happened after the supposed event, and used what little screen time it had to create quite a powerful and memorable story.  And besides, any show that can make me cry man tears in its end, gets great applause.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Simple Plot idea\\n\r\n+  Very memorable story\\n\r\n+  Very touching ending (I cried many man tears.)\\n\r\n-   Unbalance in character development\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.92/10):  The characters are the star of the show.  Every single one of these main characters has a very large significance in the story and overall, play their parts extremely well.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters cannot be explained without heavy spoilers to those who haven't seen the show, so I'll give an explanation to who they are.  The main characters are greatly detailed.  As you get deeper and deeper into the story, you get to understand who they really are, their regrets, motivations for things, and possibly get emotional attached to them like any other good drama show.  They all have their reasons for doing things and connect with each other in a way that you can only find in a good show. \\n\\n\r\nAs I have mentioned before, some characters get more development than others, but in all honesty, the characters are great nonetheless.  With what the show was able to pull off, the amount of detail they went into on these characters is more than I ever thought.  (Though personally, I would've liked to learn more about Poppo.)\\n\\n\r\nFor supporting cast, we don't get as much development as we get with the main characters.  But there are a few good mentions in the supporting cast that actually have quite a lot of significance in the story, such as both mom characters that are featured in the cast, and Jinta's father.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Fantastically detailed main cast\\n\r\n+  A lot of great character development\\n\r\n+  Significant side characters with decent plot significance\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.33/10): The art for the series felt rather generic in my opinion.  Nothing really stood out as fantastic animation, and everything felt sort of normal, and for some reason, reminded me of the sort of animation style that Studio Shaft creates.  \\n\\n\r\nThere are no real gripes that I have with the animation, as it does look good for what it is, but nothing really stood out to me as fantastic.  For the simple feel of the show, the simple animation definitely fitted with the simple plot line.\\n\\n\r\nFor sound, I would also have to agree that nothing really stood out as very memorable tracks.  Both the OP and the ED songs sounded very calming, peaceful and serene.  For what they were, they sounded very nice, but for me, it didn't stand out as song tracks that would stick in my head for all time.  And while the background music was the same with nothing really standing out, the nice instrumental pieces were a good listen.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Decent art\\n\r\n+  Calming music (not memorable music though.)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.67/10):  I won't lie to you, I cried man tears.  When I first heard about what this show, I thought about putting it on hold, as I am not one to take drama shows lightly.  When something is heart-wrenching, my heart breaks.  When I watched this show, I definitely felt that same heart-wrenching feeling, but in the end of watching it, I felt relieved.  \\n\\n\r\nI did like this show.  I really did.  It gave a good representation of how death should not be taken lightly, as well as the fact that life can change when given the time.  It's a show that I highly recommend watching if you haven't watched it before, as it truly does give a good feeling when watching.  While I didn't cry nearly as much as I thought I would in this series, (that's how I give my bias drama shows, by how much I cry while watching it), it is definitely a nice cry-worthy show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (8.69/10)",

The anime plot progresses as it shows this group of old friends slowly reconnecting with each other and forming new and stronger bonds together.

It kept it on the genuine side and almost made it seem like all the characters were actually real people. I really enjoyed the detailing and uniqueness of each character. They were all different and they all stood out.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI think that the character's were voiced perfectly and all the sounds were relevant to the scene which was playing. Also, this opening is one of my favorites and fits the anime quite well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nLike I mentioned in the Art section of my review, I think that the characters were perfect. They were all a bit different so that's what made it so worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime quite a lot. The ending had me in tears and questioned my own relationships with my past and current friends. If you're looking for a wonderful anime which you can binge watch, then this is definitely it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nEven if this anime starts out a bit slow, it really makes up for it in the long-run. It's undoubtedly a must watch that will certainty leave you shocked.",

            "content": "Well this anime I feel is one of the hidden gems of this season and might not be liked by all but this show is def something you should watch.\r\nFirst off the show throws you in to the life of a boy named Jintan and he is being played around with a girl who you eventually realize he can only see. Now this might seem kind of generic to you but this show does something no other does it does not try to hide the fact that there is a dead person who only wants one thing and that is to find her wish andhave it granted. There is no twist involved, no magic powers or miraculous happenings. Everything is pretty much straight forward and the show is driven by the characters emotions and interactions with one another and not many shows can pull this off.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway by the first episode you will see that this story does involve a group of friends. There are five of them that are currently living and the missing link is Menma (the spirt that only Jintan can see) making a group of 6. They've all lived their own lives since Menma's accident and we basically see how each of the main cast lives have been. Each character has their own different personality type so you won't feel like anyone is overlapping or falling in to the generic personality types. Also no one gets left out in the character development and is given their own background story. Making for a ending with no loose ends. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the story, Ano Hana has a pretty good opening and ending theme song that perfectly fits and always comes in at the right moments, so if you dont like the story thats one thing that should def catch your attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show which you should realize in the first three minutes of the show is exactly like Toradora. So if you enjoyed that anime art style you wont mind this one at all. \\n\\n\r\nI can say this might be one of those hit and miss slice of life/drama anime that people might not like but you should give it the 3 episode test and see if its worth watching for yourself or not. \\n",

            "content": "This anime made me cry. In a good way.\r\nAno Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (Ano Hana for short) was an anime that was brought to many people's attention when it first started airing. I was one of these people, and I would like to share my input on how I felt about this anime.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe death of a childhood friend. Childhood friends getting together as one again. Distance between each friend exists because of time.\r\nMost of these elements I've seen before. I still give it an 8 because this anime displays these elements in such a delicate way that theoverall atmosphere envelops the viewer as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe artwork wasn't anything special, and each character was drawn like any other anime character. But nothing was exaggerated, and not much moe exists (expect for maybe Menma). I like anime like this, since it provides a more realistic feel to the anime, even if it involves spirits.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe BGM, OP, and ED all have such a soft sound, and it fits the anime perfectly. The opening was a personal favorite of mine, and I would listen to the whole thing every time I watch an episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe development the characters go through was amazing. Each character get's a spotlight at one point of the show, and with the flashbacks of their childhood, you can really see how much the characters are going through. It may not be something you can relate to, but it is something you can experience with them as you watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, and unlike some anime, the 11 episodes was really just enough to portray the story well. Watching each episode was never a burden.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI'm fanboy-ing a bit, but Ano Hana was something I haven't watched in a while. I would like to recommend it to each of you. Unless you are those people that can only like fanservice anime, this anime is certainly a good thing to try.",

            "content": "There are many things in life that aren't easy. Sadly, a lot of these things are also guaranteed in life. One of them is losing loved ones; another is drifting apart from people you were once close to. Dealing with these loses in no easy task, and different people will respond to it in different ways. Some react with regret, some with acceptance, and some with guilt. Some prefer just to keep their feelings inside and pretend that there was nothing there to begin with.\r\nThe story of Anohana revolves around a high school dropout and shut in by the name of Jinta Yadomi.  WhenJinta was younger, he had been the leader of a group of friends called the \"super peace busters\". Sadly, one day one of their friends, Menma, died. After the incident, the friends became more and more distant, and before long, it was like they had never been friends to begin with. Then, one summer years later, their old friend appears to Jinta. She tells him that she has a wish that she needs help with, but she doesn't know what it is. All she knows is that the friends have to be together in order for to be fulfilled. Then, another question arises; is this Menma the ghost of their old friend, or just an illusion made up by Jinta's now decaying mind?\\n\\n\r\nReading that summary, obviously the first thing that comes to mind doesn't have anything to do with being happy. This series obviously isn't a happy series by any stretch of the imagination. It is, after all, about a group of childhood friends recovering from emotional scars. It's really sad, and may even seem cruel. It can also be a bit contrived from time to time in order to get its point across and deliver its message, but for the most part it's pretty well grounded in reality. It's presented well, overall, though, and one would have to be hard-pressed not to find something they liked in this series. It's a very well-paced and surprisingly well written story with themes that prove true in each of our individual lives\\n\\n\r\nAs in all slice and life, the plot doesn't really matter as much as the characters do, and luckily Anohana has a lot of lively and colourful characters to help it shine through. Now, to be clear, these characters are all deeply troubled people, and can be a depressing to watch, but they are also very real. Every character was deeply affected by the death of their friend, and each reacted in their own way, and each had to fight hard to overcome their emotional scars throughout the series. It isn't a happy subject, but the series does this very well. \\n\\n\r\nYukiatsu, for example, was perhaps the most effected by the loss, but instead of seeking help or comfort, decided to take the weight of the event on his shoulders and deal with it himself, which only ended in disaster. The other characters all reacted in their own way, most of them with some degree of guilt over the event. All of the characters are very sympathetic, but Menma's mother is most of all. \\n\\n\r\nIt isn't often, but a couple of the character's problems can come off as a bit forced, and it can be very distracting. Some just seem to be added in to make the viewer cry some more. It's irritating, and can take away from the overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus of the whole series, though, is Menma; the girl who died all those years ago. Menma, although she has aged physically as a ghost alongside her friends, has not aged mentally. She still thinks like a child. She's na\u00efve, selfless, and loves her friends deeply, despite how much each of them has changed over time. This makes her arguably the least interesting character in the series, because unlike everyone else, she isn't suffering through any emotional trauma. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Anohana is very good. It doesn't rely on CG effects at all, the movements of the characters are smooth. They animators tried very hard to make the movements of the characters' childhood selves often seen in flashbacks a lot different than the more laid-back teenagers they have become roughly ten years later. They have each changed a lot in appearance over the years, but comparing them to their childhood selves, it is believable that they grew up to look they way they do. It has a few hiccups every now and then, but it's never sub-par.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is very much a character driven show, it relies heavily on interactions between these characters, and thus, dialogue. For the most part, the dialogue is very good, and natural. That is, when the characters are teenagers. When they are children, there are some awkward lines, but all can be forgiven when you have a cast of such wonderful seiyuu. For the most part, the acting is superb. The one problem is that all of the child roles are played by adults. The series doesn't suffer too much from it, and they appear to be trying their best, and they usually sound just fine. In addition, this isn't at all uncommon, but the series would have been improved slightly if they had put in the extra effort to have actual child voice actors. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in Anohana features a lot of slow piano and guitar pieces to fit the overall bittersweet tone of the show. It fits the series perfectly, and is always perfect for the scene it's in. The opening shows each character's current and childhood self, hinting at each of the respective character's problems. It's a very memorable and sweet opening. The ending is slightly less memorable, but also very good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Anohana is a lovingly-made and bittersweet tale about how friends drift apart, and how the loss of a loved one effects people. Despite some slightly supernatural themes, it always remains grounded in reality. The characters are realistic and sympathetic, even if some of their problems can be a little forced. It can be very melodramatic, but it doesn't hinder the series too much. If anything, this proves that an anime can be great as a simple stand alone anime not based on a manga or light novel.",

But it wasn't.\r\nThe main reason is probably because i was expecting too much from the last episode, as people say Anohana is great and I got all hyped up about the show's \"sadness\".\r\nThe whole show is about 10 episodes of build up just for the last episode, I watched all of them thinking the last episode will be worth it. \r\nEpisode 1 to 10 there is just some cute/cool scenes and you be like \"Oh, okay that was kinda cool\"\r\nBut when it comes to the last episode, the plot was likethe \"Breakfast Club\" movie, but cringed hard at them crying at an extremely exaggerated way and at the hide-n-seek metaphoric play at the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe only part that I thought that was sad (and beautiful) was when the scene cut through Jintan's dad coming home and talking to his wife (Jintan's mom) photo in a kind way, almost like she was alive, which contrasted very hard to the messed up teenager feelings the group of Super Peace Busters was going through. I thought the show was about THAT kind of stuff, like some beauty-in-sadness contrasting stuff, but no, it was just some stuff like \"Oh i'm sad because I like you since we were kids\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nMenma's letter to Jintan was a cool play with the episode 10 build up, but that was all. \\n\\n\r\nAnohana had it's moments, but I expected waaaaaay more from the last episode. :(",

            "content": "Well .. how can i tell you my feelings about this show .. THEY TOTALLY BLOWED EVERYTHING UP .. hopefully the initial plot was still there and they managed in 11 eps to hit my heart.. which is just amazing. \r\nPlot: 8/10. The initial plot is quite interesting and manage to create a intense atmosphere between the characters. \r\nThen .. the disaster begins. This anime has only 11 eps long but they still managed to fuck it up by putting some melodrama that was totally meaningless and stupid. Literally there is a scene were everyone is crying like babies.. \r\nI don\u00b4t know why they evendid that .. because of it, the main plot had to be rushed .. WHICH IS JUST STUPID ! I mean they focus a shitty melodrama, and the result was a rush end for the main plot, when it was actually being good. So if you had a main plot being nice, why the hell did you decided to rush it and put some \"drama\" there.. it didn\u00b4t helped at all and even ruined the mood. \\n\\n\r\nDon\u00b4t get me wrong though .. despite that \"thing\" the anime still good enough to make us care in the end and actually pulled of some nice drama with only 11 eps. I've seen animes with more eps and weaker drama. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. The animation is not the best out there, but the bright colours give this anime some sort of mistical aura around it, which sounded nice :D. The OST used here are quite good since they made a good mood. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. If it wasn\u00b4t for that stupid melodrama towards the end, this rate would be much higher. For 11 eps i don\u00b4t request a lot of develop. Only developing Menma and Jin-tan was enough .. but no this anime decided to go \"deep\" with some rushed develop in every single character which just looked extremely bad. \\n\\n\r\nSo basically works like this: The characters that should have develop, Jin-tan and Menma don\u00b4t have quite much because the other chracters stole their screen time.. \\n\\n\r\nEven though the develop on Yukiatsu and Anaru is quite reasonable .. Poppo and Tsuruku .. WTF WAS THAT. Just please i'm tired of animes that blow up nice plots.. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the characters ended up being not so different from the standards, besides Menma which for me, is the best point on this show. I believe, if they only focused the main plot and the 2 main characters Jin-tan and Menma, they would be much better. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. This anime even though with those problems that i mentioned, is still quite entertaining. With the slow progressive develop on the action makes us want more and more of it. And this is something really important on an anime since it's only purpose is to entertain us. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10. This anime has a beautiful plot with a nice drama attached on it. If you are looking for some nice drama, i highly reccomend this one. Since it is so small but still hit me in the heart :)",

            "content": "Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae o Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (We Still Don't Know the Name of the Flower that We Saw that Day) is an anime for everyone, all ages, all genders. If you don't want to have an invisible person cutting onions in your house, resulting in tears, then I wouldn't really recommend this anime for you because I gotta say, this was pretty sad...\r\nStory: 8/10 - A group of six childhood friends drift apart after one of them, Meiko \"Menma\" Honma, dies in an accident. 10 years after the accident, Jinta, our main character, lives as a recluse and refuses togo back out into society (he blames himself for Menma's death). Then one day, he sees Menma's ghost (or does he... we'll get back to this later in the review) and he finds out that Menma can't rest in peace until her wish in life is granted. Jinta gathers his estranged friends together once again, believing that they are the key to fufilling Menma's wish. The other 4 childhood friends reunite with Jinta, though, reluctantly. However, things grow increasingly complicated when his friends accuse him of not being able to get over the death of Menma (but is Jinta the only one that can't let go of the past?).  Later in the plot we find out that the other 4 members blame themselves for Menma's death and hidden feelings for other members of the group are rekindled. Along with feelings of bitterness from Menma's broken mother, the group struggles as they grow from trying to help Menma move on, to helping themselves move on. The pacing was rather good, once you get past the first episode which was rather a slow-start but it's necessary to understand the situation surrounding the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was tragic, enjoyable, original and rather deep. This anime was rather realistic and the Menma's ghost is very debatable. Was Menma really there as a ghost? Or was it Jinta & company's imagination of Menma because they were unwilling to accept what had happened 10 years ago in their childhood? Menma being a ghost and trying to move onto the after-life is just a reflection of the other 5 childhood friends moving on from their past and moving into the future.\\n\\n\r\nWhen we were all children, we had that group of best friends that we'd always want to have a play-day with and ride swings, play pokemon, watch cartoons with and start a tree-house club with. We, individually always wanted to be the center of attention in that group and be the \"coolest\", \"leader-like\" person in the group. The childhood flashbacks in this anime shows all these things and what being a child really is (very realistically in a non-realistic story).\\n\\n\r\nIf I knock the story for one thing though, it's that the sadness (until the very ending) was pretty forced. The ending made me cry a lot but throughout I was left scratching my head as to why the characters were crying so annoyingly so often. But... It all pays off in the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 - Have you ever seen anime like Nagi no Asukara, Fate/Zero and Angel Beats? What do they all have in common? Spectacular art. AnoHana is part of that exclusive club of godly art. The art is just beautiful, in the way that it portrays how realistic the characters (& their feelings too, you'll see what I mean) are. The characters are just... WOAAW. The art is a well-deserved 10/10, nothing more to talk about. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 - This has some of the saddest music you'll ever listen to in an anime. You think the piano music in Clannad, and Angel Beats are sad? Well they are, but I think that AnoHana is even sadder, yeah that's right. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful with the elegant sad whispering sounds, tranquil piano pieces, and melodious violin music. After watching Ano Hana, and going back to listen to the opening theme, will bring back the memories and feels you are sure to experience/have experienced. The opening is just so sad! The ending theme is arguably the saddest ending I've ever heard. It'll play not only at the end of each episodes, but towards to end of the anime when we reach the climax, and if you have a soul, you cannot not ball your tears out (even if you don't have a soul, this'll make you cry). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 - This is where AnoHana flourished. Each of the 6 childhood friends have a past, a present, and a future (that they want). The anime despite being only 11 episodes, went into rather thorough detail about each one of them, explaining what they felt 10 years ago, how they feel now, and what they are longing for. Young people dealing with a devastating loss... Masterfully written. But the 6 childhood friends aren't even the only characters the anime delves into. Menma's parents were obviously affected by Menma's death and are bitter about it, and are obviously going to be upset once seeing Menma's old 5 friends hang out laughing while their daughter's dead. Families Dealing With Loss...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 - I was not always 100% captivated, and my eyes were not always attached to the screen... because I had to wash my face multiple times, and then curse the onions that were somewhere in my room, because I couldn't stop my tears from flowing down my face. The plot was simply amazing, and I got to re-think about my past childhood experiences, my childhood friends whom I'm no longer with, and think about all the things I had to go through in order to get to where I am today... And how I'm going to move onto the future. One of my favorite quotes of all time is \"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.\" This quote doesn't have much to do with AnoHana itself, but it has a lot to do with the future, which is something the characters in AnoHana have to look to, instead of holding onto the unchangeable past. The only knock I'll give this anime is that the sadness was kind of forced by the characters who were crying almost every episode, but I have a weak-heart (not really) and I had no choice but to cry with them. But once again, yes. Some sadness was forced which was a tad bit annoying at times.\\n\\n\r\nAnohana is no doubt one of if not the saddest anime I have ever watched. But at the same time... It's also one of the most uplifting. The story it tells is so painfully real\u2014so emotionally raw\u2014that it will cause even monsters to cry. As loss is a universal part of the human condition, I would recommend AnoHana to absolutely anyone who is prepared for a good cry, and a one way ticket to feels-ville.\\n\\n\r\n\"Telling stories and laughing with friends: precious moments you'll never forget.\"\\n\\n\r\nFriends are the most important people in your present, and they will be the most important people in your future. Live happily~",

            "content": "\u201cFirst review\u201d ;)\r\nWhat would you do if your friend died and you think it was your fault?\r\n\u201cAno Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai\u201d (Anohana) is about six friends [Jintan, Menma, Anaru, Yukiatsu, Tsuruko, and Poppo] who play together all the time, like all kids, have a hide out where they hang out, and they even became the \u201cSuper Peace Busters\u201d to protect the world. However, nothing lasts forever. One day, Menma dies in a tragic accident. \r\nTen years later, the five kids grew up and are now in high school. \u201cAnohana\u201d displays for us the feelings of those five teenagers who,not only didn\u2019t forget about Menma, but feel guilty about what happened that day. They have also drifted apart and became almost strangers to each other. That is until Menma comes back to hunt Jintan (he is the only one who can see and hear her) and tells him that he has to grant her a wish that she herself doesn\u2019t even know what it is (BTW I really didn\u2019t see that wish coming, did not expect that at all). Through different events on the quest to finding out and granting Menma\u2019s wish, the five friends started talking and hanging out with each other only to discover the truth behind what happened ten years ago. Moreover, each and every one of them is looking for a way for redemption and breaking free from the guilt they feel. \\n\\n\r\nI think the plot is pretty unique, unlike other clich\u00e9d stories out there. The character development was good too and how all five started out hiding their true feelings and not even believing in Menma\u2019s presence but then, gradually, started believing and sharing their emotions (even love confessions) with everybody else. The Art was also really awesome. \\n\\n\r\nI really liked \u201cAnohana\u201d I gave it a 10, so I recommend it to anyone who likes dramas. It made me laugh, cry, and think about lost ones. In addition, it made me realize that death could strike any time and, unlike in \u201cAnohana\u201d, I will probably not get a second chance to do a lot of things so I should really live my life to the fullest.\\n",

            "content": "This anime has found the perfect mixture of when to invoke certain emotions in someone. I had though from the beginning that this would be a great anime, but this has easily become one of the legendary animes among clannad and elfen lied. It was absolutely amazing in every way possible.\r\nStory- The story is quite a sad one. Its about a group of childhood friends who where always together, having good times and just being kids. Then one day a series of events happened that lead to the death of one of them named \"menma\". Years later menma appears as a ghost of sorts, butonly jinta can see her. The rest of the gang thinks that he has gone crazy. He couldn't handle the pressure of being called crazy so he dropped out of school and stayed at home playing games and eating most of the day. Then one day menma mentions something about fulfilling a wish that she had to jinta. Through a short series of events that span over 2-3 episodes the whole gang is back together and even thought they think jinta is crazy they still wish to help fulfill minmas wish, or so it seems. Can't really say much more for fear of ruining the story line, but it is definitely a very intriguing story-line. It's not all serious all the time though, which is the way i expected it to be. Not saying that in a bad way, the funny parts did't feel at out of place at all. Some parts had my sides hurting. Then there are other parts that got me really emotional. The ending was just really intense, it was wrote very beautifully. I don't usually tear up or cry while watching animes. The only other anime that got me to cry was clannad. Now 2 animes have got me to that point. It was the saddest thing, other than clannad that I've ever watched in my entire life. The writing was very excellent in this anime, there wasn't any filler and the anime didn't feel rushed at all, even though it's only 11 episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Nothing much to really say here. The art was pretty average and nowadays it's pretty hard to mess up on the art of an anime. Nothing too spectacular and nothing that was bad. Then again don't watch this anime for its art style, watch it for its excellent story-line.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The opening theme and ending theme fits very well with the overall feel of this anime. I really liked it, its a very soft and smooth song which is very refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The characters in this anime definitely unique. My favorite character would have to be menma though. She has a very childish attitude which i think is cute and it suites her well. All the characters are fairly different from each other and yet they all get along for the most part. This anime just goes to show you that just because you got hardly anything in common with someone doesn't mean that you can't be friends. I got a couple like that as a matter of fact. We're friends just because we're friends. There are quite a few \"main characters\" i saw it like that because they're not really the main characters, but they all are in every episode and all have a huge impact on the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- This anime had me laughing pretty hard at times, and at other times it had me really emotional. The ending had me cry 3 separate times to be honest. Any anime that can change your mood that drastically and still have the same feel to it, and not feel out of place has to be doing something right. I could tell from the first episode that this was going to be something great, instead it turned into something legendary. I always give every anime i review a 10 because i can't never make up my mind as how to rate it, but this anime is definitely something that should be dismissed. If it's on your list then you should definitely start watching it as soon as possible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- As i have stated plenty of times in this review this anime is something special. In my book it's something that is legendary. It goes in the same category as clannad, death note, and elfen lied. It's just one of those animes that are special. Animes that are coming out now are just too much fan-service, or they can't make up their mind on whether or not the be funny or serious. Very few animes know what they are, and what message they're trying to get across. I HIGHLY recommend this anime to anyone that watched anime. It's definitely something that is just amazing and should be watched by everyone. I absolutely love everything about this anime.",

            "content": "(I already wrote this review last year, just so you know. I just wasn't able to post it back then.)\r\nDealing with the loss of a loved one isn\u2019t easy at all. We may not realize it at first, but there is this unquestionable beauty in death that in the long run would shape us into a better individual. Whether it is a friend or a family member, the death of the ones whom we hold most dear is just another steppingstone towards a new chapter. Their seeds become the fruit of those who come after them. However, there are some who look at death asan ordeal, a morbid perception. Everyone has his or her own ways of coping with their loss. Eventually, they change \u2013 sometimes for the better, but sometimes for the worse. We don\u2019t understand the concept of death until it comes knocking at our door.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one anime that shows how powerful the effect of death can have among the youth, it would be \u201cAno Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai\u201d or simply \u201cAnohana: The Flower We Saw That Day\u201d. It was written by Tatsuyuki Nagai.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is about 5 childhood friends who drifted apart after losing one of their playmates, Meiko Honma or better known as \u201cMenma\u201d. Because of this, they became the kind of people whom they never really imagined to be now that they\u2019re already teenagers. Jintan Yadomi, the de facto leader of the Super Peace Busters (the name of their group), decided to live his teenage life as a recluse. However, the spirit of an older-looking Menma came before him on a summer day, telling him that she wanted a wish granted. Thus, Jintan found the resolve to reunite the group once again.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit; Anohana is probably one of the most emotional animes out there. I was moved by how deep the message was and the bonds each character shares. I enjoyed watching every episode without getting bored. It was very riveting in its own unique way. The character development was consistent throughout the series. The animation is up to snuff, as well.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one thing that I really appreciated about this series, it would be the soundtrack. I love how the music was in tune with the emotions and situations in the episodes. It displays a certain vibrancy in which you\u2019ll find yourself at the edge of your seat. It was very powerful that it even brought tears to my eyes. The opening theme, \u201cAoi Shiori\u201d by Galileo Galilei is a perfect fit to the mood of the series; the same goes for the ending theme, \u201cSecret Base (10 Years Later)\u201d, which was performed by Ai Kayano, Haruka Tomatsu, and Saori Hayami. The way the next episode preview blended into the credits was exceptionally unique. I haven\u2019t seen other anime ending themes work that way.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, what struck me the most in the series are the characters \u2013 the tight bond each of them shares. When we examine them individually, they portray the typical teenagers nowadays. However, there are times when they would have this serious knack for annoying me \u2013 the way they express their emotions and feelings and the constant \u201clove polygon\u201d that never ceases to frustrate me until the end. But I was glad that they were able to move on. That\u2019s what this show is about anyway \u2013 being able to continue living your life to the fullest despite the obstacles that hinder your way. Being an original anime production, it somehow brought justice to the message. It made me think about the symbolic meaning behind it because, like I said, it has a very deep message.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Anohana was worth the watch. It is an epitome of an original anime with a solid plot line. I recommend it although I suggest you have a tissue paper by your side while watching.",

            "content": "There is a difference between \"favorite\" and \"best\" anime. Saying Anohana is the best anime would get me flamed by Death Note, FMA, big 3 fans from the community. Well, the anime is PERSONALLY my favorite and the best that I've seen. Reasons:\r\nlength: 11 episodes is concise with no room for filler content. Even the best anime that supposedly don't have filler (FMA B, hunter x hunter) had slow moments. There is not an episode I would skip in this anime. They all have meaning. Of course comparing 11 ep anime with 70-140 ep may not be fair but still. \r\nmature content: This part issomewhat hard to explain but I'll try. I loved the dialogue because usually, when I think of certain interactions in anime, I imagine \"it would be great if character said X or did Y\" but usually, the characters don't \"go there\" and stay safe within the norm. Anohana didn't. It was brutally honest about how each person felt, especially from Yukiatsu, Menma's mother and brother. When it did go the way I thought it would, it still packed an emotional punch. I also liked how it avoided usual cliches. (It's the 21st century and these anime charcters are still going to festivals, tsunderes wearing yukatas like it's their first time, ring toss, that stupid paper net fish thing...I mean doesn't anyone in Japan play with Xbox or something). \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I'd like to praise the studio for not relying on heavy fan service--it honestly would've been insulting to the main theme that it was trying to achieve. I also understand this series wouldn't do very well in merchandise due to lack of signature fashion or etc so that was probably a risk as well. This is an anime that I truly love and I would be more than happy to support this kind of project in the future. This is the kind of anime the Western community needs to see to change the perception of \"anime\" that is usually seen as \"weird.\"\\n",

            "content": "If you have read other reviews before mine, you are now under the impression that Anohana is the greatest thing ever created since sliced bread.However, if you would like to hear me out, I have a few gripes with this anime. It's not that I want to hate this anime to sound different. I don't hate Anohana at all, but the praise heaped over it always confuses me. So here are my unfettered thoughts about Anohana.\r\nStory-5. The story was, according to me, a so-so one. It mainly deals with the loss of an old friend, how the characters deal with it and how their livesare affected by it. Just one problem. How do you keep grieving over a death which occurred ages ago like it only happened yesterday? What I look in an anime is its storytelling.And whether you want to believe me or not Anohana sucked at story telling. I had to drag myself to see each episode. There was nothing stimulating that I could find or anything remotely exciting. What I mean to say it's boring.That's it.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8 Well I can't say anything bad about the animation if you forced me to. From background to the character models, everything is well made and sweetly animated.Moving on\\n\\n\r\nSound-6. Both the op and ed are hardly memorable. Next\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-3 My biggest complaint about this anime. I swear I never saw such deadbeat characters. Every freaking episode you have this unremarkable hero brooding and looking dull as fuck. It's like a massive vacuum popped out from his tatami mats and sucked out all of his soul. It's true that death does affect you badly. But I wonder why couldn't his retarded father take him to a psychologist or so. I pride myself on remembering all the characters even after a year of watching a show. But its only like 3 or 4 months after watching this anime and I see myself struggling to name all the characters. Menma is annoying. That it. She is your typical klutzy girl who gawks and apes at everything she sees and behaves as if she was born yesterday.Rest of the characters are hardly worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-3 None whatsoever. By now I would be put inside a shredder by the rest of the anime community. But I will speak my unreserved thoughts. Well to be honest Anohana isn't something which is meant to be enjoyed. It's a commentary of how death affects a person. But it felt completely flat if anything else. I didn't try Anohana for giving me thrills and chills, but I didn't ask for being bored either.\\n\\n\r\nEnding- Here's where a stone cold motherfucker like me wept like a poor child. The ending was really sad and poignant. The final moments of the anime were enough to make Kim Jong Un take a tissue and wipe his tears.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- By now I probably occur to you as a guy who wants to look cool by thrashing a popular anime. But before you hit the Not Helpful button with gusto, let me say this. An ending makes or breaks an anime. Anohana, having a beautiful ending managed to manipulate the viewer's emotions into thinking it's an amazing anime. But rewatch it and you might just get what I am trying to say.",

This isn't going to be an in-depth review, but I will say that you should watch it to decide if you like it on your own.\r\nI've lost a few people so far in my life, and I guess I can kind of understand a lot of the emotions in the story. I never really show my emotions too much, but this anime kept getting me so emotional and about to cry. The last episode really did it for me. I was trying to hold it all back, but tears started streaming down myface. I can't comprehend how still. Obviously, the story definitely had an impact on me and for that, I'll give it an 8/10. There were too many obvious ways that Menma could have communicated early on, and because she didn't take the obvious route, I took off 2 points. Sure, the story might have been a lot less interesting, but I don't like it when there's plot holes or overlooked common sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty well thought out as well. The whole anime was situated around people who all had feelings for each other, and then there was Poppo. It was pretty funny seeing their reactions to everything, and getting a picture of what actually happens when people grow up. People change, and this story showed that; but deep down inside, everyone is really the same. That last sentence didn't make as much sense as I would have liked it to, but that aside, the story and characters were great.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were similar to many other anime, I don't feel like anything really stuck out too much. Because of that, I labeled them similar to what I'd label other animes with the same style of art and sound. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'll give the anime a 7/10. It's not every day that something could make me shed tears, but this one did it. I enjoyed it, and hope all the people watching it in the future (or after reading my review!) do as well.",

            "content": "Perks: Honest story, relatable, good artwork, engaging, interesting characters\r\nQuirks: Slow pacing at times, certain unneeded elements, possibly more character distinction needed\r\nThis anime was 'the anime of summer' for me. I suppose that's appropriate, seeing as it came out around the start of summer, but that means more. Summer's a very ephemeral thing, and we see so many movies and hear so many songs about fantastic summers that eventually pass and are completely in the past, and yet, something draws us back to them, if only to the memories and how those made us feel.\r\nAno Hana was like this for me. It focused on the present,but was very much incorporated into the past. We got a good amount of flashbacks, to times before the death of a good friend, times that couldn't be repeated after her death. And yet, in a way, they were. A ghost brought back together what fell apart years ago, and made them remember. It made them live it again, and in turn learn to appreciate each other again. Whether these characters will try to stay close friends we aren't really shown, but that's not what's important. What's important, is for a very particular period of time, they were, again.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, the actual review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nAs far as the most original plot, is it? No, but it's a slice-of-life story, and I think it succeeds very well in this genre. A lot of times, I thought back to my group of high school friends and wondered, what if something like this happened to tear us apart? How would we react? It was very relatable in that way. At times, it wasn't exactly focused, and some elements seemed somewhat silly (such as the whole crossdressing plot...I never felt why that was necessary for the character it centered around). Although curious as to how Menma died, it didn't detract from the plot not to know; in fact, it emphasized that Menma's death shouldn't be the focus of the story: the story was on the friendship itself. Throughout it, I felt the essence of growing up, of losing yourself and not being happy with where you're going, but going anyway, and I think that's an important topic to address in shows about teenagers, or about anyone. I felt that a lot of the emotion just came from this situation, and its juxtaposition to the past. Remember being a kid and thinking how your hangout spot was the coolest thing ever? And now you're stuck at WcDonalds, clueless as to where your life is going, if you like the direction, if you even care sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe soft palette added to that summery/beachy feel. I think it fit into the mood of the story too, which, although it had serious issues to address, still maintained a level of childish beauty to it. The characters were designed softly too, and they blended in nicely to the backgrounds. The art could capture shifting mood well though; a particular favorite scene of mine showed a moth out in the streets; it later cuts back to it and we see the moth dead: clearly symbolic of the suddenness with which life, and childhood, passes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCloser to a 7.5. I really enjoyed the opening of the anime, but overall I can't remember the music too well, so I can't rate this too high. The voices fit the characters, I think, and everything seemed to tie into the tone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI thought the cast had a good range, and that they each had a fair amount of character development. We get to see some present issues with each of them, and so we get to know why they think as they do. For a short anime, it paced their development, but I still feel like we could have cracked down further past the surface. Quite a few of the characters seemed sad or otherwise unhappy with themselves and, like I said, we see why this may be, but I don't think enough to really understand why it permeates them so much and how that's different from character to character. For instance, Poppo provides a nice uplift to the melancholy experienced by the majority of the cast, and is instrumental in reuniting them, but his personality more so struck me as that happy-go-lucky character a lot of anime have. I mean, a lot of times people are happy and don't need a reason, and I'm not particularly looking for one, but he doesn't seem quite fulfilled in terms of character sketch. Maybe he's happy from the simple joys of traveling and that's enough, but I don't know if that means he's really okay. He still carries guilt over Menma's death, and we see that, but I still feel like some aspect of the spectrum between that and his happiness goes uncharted. The conflicts of Yukiatsu and Tsuruko were also somewhat blended together because of their similar 'antisocial' personalities. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nAlthough I didn't really meet with any plot twists or anything shocking or super compelling to make me want to continuously watch, I very much enjoyed this simple story. It was told rather well, and established its own identity while being natural and easy to identify with. If you really demand to see things that haven't been done before, or have to have high levels of drama or action, this probably isn't what you're looking for, but give it a chance. I can't say I've seen too many slice of life anime yet, but in general I enjoy the genre, and I think you'll find, at the least, some elements to enjoy as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I love the name...it's very much like something you'd attribute to childhood--something forgotten, something that can't be reclaimed. How often did you see something, like a flower or an animal or some random object, as a kid and wanted to tell someone on it, but can't because you don't know the name?",

Its story is tender and touching, pulling the most deeply buried strings in us with poignant vignettes of childhood friendship. You'll cry, long and hard and feel rotten for a week after watching this anime.\r\nDoes that mean you should steer clear? Does all this emotion mean that it's a soppy, romance, over-dramatised teenage drama? NO\r\nIt's light, refreshing, funny and quirky as well and most of the feels don't reallycome from heavily embellished romance drama. What does give rise to the emotions are friends being slowly pulled apart and then re-uniting to accept their feelings about why they broke apart.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is fragile. It's balanced very finely between slice of life and fantasy/supernatural. It's balanced between comedy and tragedy. It's balanced between romance and, well, non-romance. \\n\r\nIt's this quality that makes this anime so beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I'm not ashamed to admit, I CRIED after I watched it.

The way each character evolved throughout the series was indeed a masterpiece unto itself.\r\nEvery time I think about Menma a tear wells up in my eye. I can't think of anygreat way of explaining how that felt to practically have your emotions synced with the characters emotions without spoiling the ending.\\n\r\nBut to be honest what really made the show to me was the opening theme (Aoi Shiori by Galileo Galilei), my heart sinks every time I hear that song in my headphones. All in all I rate 10/10 for amazing music, perfect story execution and just plain beautiful! You haven't watched anime if you haven't watched this show. \\n",

This type of anime was quite new to me as I usually don't prefer anime with 'drama' in it since I tend to get frustrated while watching it. However, this story changed my view towards dramatic, slice of life anime.\r\nThe story revolves around a group of 6 childhood friends who gradually distance their friendship after the tragic death of one of the friends in the group. Years after theaccident, the girl who died, 'Menma' (Honma Meiko) suddenly appears in front of 'Jintan' (Yadomi Jinta)  asking for a wish of hers to be granted. No one knows what exactly the wish is, and so, their story begins... \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has great graphics and a creative, wonderful story-line that makes you smile, get angry, laugh and cry at times. One thing that made this anime enjoyable was how the story wasn't one of those cheap projects that has a cliche story, or a really predictable story. It was full of originality and the story ran very smoothly; not slow and not too fast. Character development is done extremely well in this anime and allows viewers to sympathize with each character and provoke so many different emotions from the viewers. Also, I am really picky and strict about Seiyuus. This anime didn't really have major, famous Seiyuus but still the voices suited the characters so I was fine with the voices :) I really loved Yukiatsu(Matsuyuki, Atsumu)'s voice, Sakura Takahiro is one of my favorites",

            "content": "Anohana follow the plot of the a group of teenagers that can't forget their childhood memories from long ago. \r\nMy very first impression of watching this anime is that it is very well animated compared to other animes of 2011. Anohana is the a remarkable achievement of modern day animation, the backgrounds are very colorful and detailed and every character face looks and feels real to the core. A-1 pictures did an excellent job with anohana and made it feel reminiscent of Welcome to the Space Show. It was interesting to hear the ending theme as 'Secret base' because ironically i hear the song beforei saw the anime and thought it fit perfectly in anohana.  \\n\\n\r\nThough Anohana seems to do well in the art & sound category, it really lacks in originality when it comes to plot. The plot of Anohana is nothing short of new. I mean come on, a story where a couple of teenagers, that are childhood friends that did something many summers ago that they still remember and whine about it now? Come on, we seen this scenario countless times in animes like Kanon, and Elfen lied and what not. Even the part of Jintan and Menma's relationship as a human boy and girl ghost, reminded me of a manga called My lovely ghost kana, where the girl's soul is trapped on earth trying to get to heaven and instead lives in a guys house. Anohana don't surprises in the plot much, and really it emits the idea of how the story will end. \\n\\n\r\nAnohana even the plot is a bit rigid in my opinion, but it doesn't hurt the show, and is still very enjoyable to  watch. Anohana has traces of comedy, romance, slice of life and lots a tragedy mix in. The plot if all is almost entirely character driven, nothing special happens in the story, but as the pllot progress, you get to see the characters revealed themselves, through constant (and necessary) flashbacks, and the conflicting problems with menma's ghost. Personally i think the show has a lot of potential to be a romance genre, with jintanXanjou exc, instead anohana primary focuses is all on menma and on many occassia gets a little annoying.",

            "content": "Before this season, A-1 pictures has done little worth noting for me, but when I saw the synopsis for this anime coupled with the fact that it landed a notamina block spot, I was certain that this was going to be a winner.\r\nThe first episode was emotionally riveting, and surely I knew we were in for something a little special this season.\r\nI've always enjoyed stories that manage to make connections to you personally. To me that's one of Ano Hana's greatest strength, its ability to pull on one's nostalgic chords. The whole story about old friends split apart (And in this case it's about somethingemotionally traumatic for the group) and managing to come back together and move on was a fairly straight forward, but effective means of drawing interest from the viewers. Most of if not all of us have probably gone through similar experiences where we split with old friends for one reason or another, and I'm sure many of us have thought about those so called \"glory days\" as well. In that regard, it managed to make an emotional connection with me from the synopsis alone.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this strength may also be Ano Hana's greatest weakness. Due the nature of having to follow the series intermittently week by week, and the fact that the series drives an emotional punch right from the start, there were many moments throughout the anime which failed to elicit the proper sympathetic response. No, one does not necessarily have to tear up or anything, as I never expected that sort of emotionally involving standard, but the anime still should be able to properly maintain the emotional involvement that it started with.\\n\\n\r\nThe series was weakest on this front during the middle portions of the story. However, I felt they managed to come full circle by the end, so Ano Hana gets points from me there. Though I will say that the last episode could have been a tad less melodramatic. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps not necessarily secondary to this strength/weakness though is Ano Hana's characters. Almost everyone in the group was developed extremely well, and each had their own little story, and each had their own problems and frustrations. Couple this with the fact that there's actually 3 guys and 3 girls in the Super Peace Busters instead of the usual harem or 4-5 girl ensemble, and it provided a much more interesting composition of characters in the main cast than you'd typically see in any other kind of show.\\n\\n\r\nReally, the first thing a story should always do after creating the premise to make sure you have characters worth caring about. None of these stock cardboard cut out archetype characters that can't stand up on their own when compared to all the other stock cardboard cut out archetype characters. There needs to be some sort of substance, something more to see that just their quirky personality traits.\\n\\n\r\nAnd no, it's not simply about giving them some sort of dramatic past like \"my parents died in an accident, or my family, or my friend,\" and then showing them to be sad or distraught. Sure you can throw details like that into any story, but if you don't manage to successfully detail each character's personality, their woes and likes, how they respond to different events, why they think a certain way, then it's hard to understand what these characters even really think about in the end.\\n\\n\r\nWhile melodrama and magical realism has been done to a certain extent before (See KEY animes), I feel like Ano Hana manages to separate itself and its narrative significantly. One large reason being the length of it, but also the type of story it wants to tell. Melodrama doesn't define a narrative, and people shouldn't try to pin Ano Hana as a story about cheap emotional involvement. I always felt it had a genuine and honest feeling to its story, something that shines true all the way to the end no matter how sappy it got.\\n\\n\r\nThat's probably the best word to describe Ano Hana, genuine.\\n\\n\r\nI fully recommend the story to anyone who can accept the premise as is and whose sole goal isn't to make themselves cry. Ano Hana is a story that is more about the journey than the destination.",

The premise is simple and the story plays out the scenario realistically and beautifully. \r\nThe beauty in this work is perhaps best seen in the way it keeps you on the edge of despair: with joy. It contrasts the despair of the living with the joy of the dead (strange though this may sound). The value of human life, the sorrow of things left un-finished, and the love of friends and family. All of these things make up the festival of feels that is AnoHana. An absolute must see for those who like a good cry - if you enjoyed anime by Key (Kanon, Clannad, Air!, etc...) you'll likely love this (that said, Ano Hana's story is significantly less bizarre than those made by Key).",

            "content": "AnoHana is definitely worthwhile to watch! Especially if your into the animes that leave you with some kind of heart felt emotion [and maybe a few tears]. My friend had recommended AnoHana to me and I am very glad that he did!\r\nStory :9:\r\nThe story of AnoHana is about a boy, named Jintan, who hallucinates about his friend Menma. But is Menma really a hallucination of his? Determined to grant her wish Jintan and his friends set off to do that. The story to AnoHana is at least no where close to boring in my opinion. The plot of the story might be to make Menma'swish come true, however, the focus of the story is about friendship. That even after separating for such a long time friends can come back to being friends, and even if they change it'll still feel like the old times. Also some of the dark side of friendships is displayed in this show as well. By dark side I mean secrets and emotions that friends keep from their other friends. There is struggle, tears, laughter, and frustration throughout the whole anime. You learn more about each character as the show goes on even if its only a little thing. The ending went off with a bang too! It was definitely not a disappointment at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt :8:\\n\r\nI found the art very pleasing. The backgrounds are beautiful and the anime style is one of my favorites. It kind of has a realistic aspect in the meaning that they don't have eyes taking up 2/3 of their face. The animation was pretty good as well. Most of the scenes kept moving and it wasn't like I was staring at someones face for 5 mins.\\n\\n\r\nSound :9:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the opening and ending songs. Normally I skip through them until the last episode, however, I found myself listening/watching the opening theme quite a few times. The voices for the characters suited them very well as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :10:\\n\r\nAnoHana doesn't just introduce side characters in the show because they aren't just side characters. You learn about each one and their personalities. I feel like I could see myself becoming friends with most of them. There isn't a character in AnoHana that I dislike [although I do think one of them is a little creepy].  Each personality is unique, and each person was thought out very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :10:\\n\r\nThis anime is very enjoyable. There are a lot of touching scenes and funny scenes as well. So funny that you would burst out laughing. After each episode I immediately clicked the next episode button. I even made sure I wasn't missing any little bits after the ending theme. I couldn't but laugh or cry because I was enjoying AnoHana to much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :10:\\n\r\nAnoHana is one of those rare animes these days. It has a unique and strong story without have harems or fan service. The show isn't at all dark or gloomy. Its a very enjoyable anime to sit down to watch. Would I recommend this anime to someone? Heck yeah! Before you know it you'll be finishing this anime in one sitting. That's what happened to me at least.",

Just before you read, you'll need to know that i am french but i wrote this review to share with all of you the love i have for this anime :) Enjoy!\r\nStory: the story for me was really touching, i think that everything in general, for this part, was exceptional. You don't have to go back on a part because you didn't understand something, the story of the anime was flawless and was perfectly explain. The only thing i didn't like was about certain flashback that i though wasn't useful, but it wasn't a big deal.\r\nArt: It wasa candy for my eyes. The colors were beautiful, the colors for the flashback were perfectly made  to let you understand that you were in the past ( even if it is evident that the characters are younger). The drawing was exceptional,   I really like how they draw this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music that they used to show a sad moment, or a funny moment was perfect. Seriously the music, by itself made me cry at certain part of the anime, and it help you to see that it is sad or happy. The voice acting was flawless i don't have anything to say about it !\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: the development for the characters was perfect except for certain thing. I mean for the main character the development was perfect. At the end of the anime you know the story of all the main character and you know how they are involved with their dead friend. the only thing that i found disappointing is that it lacks a little bit of precision on the other character like the family of men ma or even the father of Yadomi. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this anime a lot. I would place it on the top of all the anime that i watched in the past. I would not have any trouble to rematch it. Seriously this anime is a must!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: if you want an anime that will make you cry you should watch it ( ;P I am joking, even if you will cry I can guarantee you that) Seriously if you want an anime with a good story and with character that you'll fall in love with for their different personality I recommend you this anime that will leave you with the feeling of '' AWWW IT IS ALREADY FINISH !''  because unfortunately there is only 11 episode.\\n",

Even if they're a favorite.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nLoss will always be one of the only human conventions that we will never learn how to deal with properly. Because when it boils down to it, how do you deal with the loss of a loved one? Someone who has been in your life everyday, you love them, you trust them, and suddenly: they're gone. You still have the rest of your life ahead of you, but they don't. And whether you miss them for altruistic or egoistic reasons, you still miss them. And there's really nothing that can cure that feeling. And no matter how unconnected to the death you were, there's still that crushing guilt that you could have done something. You should have done something. \"What if I didn't let them walk home alone that night?\" or \"Why didn't I give them more money for the bus?\" When you're older, you tend to have a better grasp on the world and how it works. But when tragedy strikes when you're young, how do you add up what just happened in your brain? Such things are impossible for adults to do. Because death is so hard to deal with, we all deal with it in different ways. We might lock ourselves in our house, pretend it never happened, try to compensate by joining a group, returning to the place that it all happened, and any other way. That's what these characters do. Each one of them deal with the death of their friend Menma in very different ways. After Menma passed, they all faded apart. But when the topic of Menma comes up, they find themselves coming back together.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe attention to detail in this anime is superb. From the way that they walk, to the way that they react; it's lifelike. More than that, the backgrounds and scenery are wonderful. You truly feel like you're with them in that quiet Japanese city. The character designs are another plus. Jinta, although his demeanor is lifeless, he has plenty of light in his eyes. Menma is absolutely haunting. White hair, white clothes and icy blue eyes. All wrapped around in a touch of innocence. Although she is years older in stature, she still holds onto that girlish charm that she had so long ago. From what they wear, to how they wear things, the drapery was well thought out. All in all, the art was something to be satisfied -- overly satisfied -- with.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe in-anime score was spot on. The anime was riddled with soft piano themes, and realistic sounding background noise. The sound would either perk up, or take a turn for the gloomy when the anime changed its pace. If it weren't for the score, this anime would certainly not have as much of an emotional impact as it did. I find it to be an absolute gem when the anime has charming OP & ED's. There is only a handful of anime that I can literally say that I enjoyed the OP & ED from beginning to end (Lovely Complex, NANA, Death Note, Kimi Ni Todoke, Inuyasha). This anime has been added to the list of \"theme songs that I'll be YouTubing in due time\". It's not only the beautiful lyrics and vocals that make the OP and ED so great. I have to give it up to the  picture that shows alongside. Stunning. It really wets your lips, and braces yourself for what is in store. A bitter-sweet, beautiful story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nI can't remember the last time that I have watched a anime where the characters are so fulfilling. Maybe NANA. But as great as the characters were in NANA, they're still incomparable to these characters. Another anime that comes to mind is Lovely Complex, but those characters are fulfilling in a different light. Those characters delivered, but these characters take realism beyond the point of repair. This anime is an 11 episode series. I can seriously say that I don't think I've watched an anime this short (unless you count 5 cm per sec, but I watched that as a movie) in my anime-watching career. And somehow in that short period of time I was able to latch onto the characters. More so than some of the anime that I have watched with over 100 episodes. I think that that says something about the ability of the characters, and the genius of the creators. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nYou may be wondering, \"Hey MLF (my username abbreviated hah), if you think that AnoHana is worth a 10, why is your enjoyment at a 9?\" Let me start with saying that I really, really, thoroughly enjoyed this anime. The only downfall is that it took me a few episodes to completely get enveloped by the story. The first episode, I thought that this anime was going to end up being a 7, and then the next 2 or 3 I spent thinking that this anime was worth an 8. And then the anime really hit the goldmine. So I was weary towards the beginning, but the quality of the show shined through. And when this show got to the promise land, it was a steady progression. It didn't falter and fall from grace. I think that's pretty impressive. But because it took me a few episodes to get into, it was knocked from a 10 to a 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nThis anime is living (lol) proof that quality wins over quantity. I doubt that there are many (by many, I mean 1) anime that are over 300 episodes that compare to this one. I really hope future anime-makers look at this one as inspiration to see what can be done to make a nearly flawless anime. Don't overlook this anime because it has 11 episodes. Don't think that it's not worth the watch. Not into slice of life? That's alright, I'm sure that there's a chance that this anime can sway your opinion on the genre. And if not, well then that's too bad. If you haven't already, I hope that you give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Anohana is a conflicting experience. \r\nIt is able to make the audience resonate with its themes with pinpoint accuracy. The use of animation and sound is used to its fullest extent, something that is fully apparent in the op, where in less than a minute it made me both smile and shed a tear. \r\nThe problems arise when the characters are introduced.\r\nI know that is only one of 5 pillars needed to rate an anime; however, this show is a character-driven drama. So even if in the sound, themes and art department Anohana succeeds, it disastrously fails in the character one. \r\nLet's go down thelist, from least to most annoying.\\n\\n\r\nPoppo doesn't do much and he should because he brings the energy and cheerfulness this show desperately needs. Things are sad because we are able to experience happiness, and without this character I don't know how we'd scrape by.\\n\\n\r\nMenma is a weird case. She is extremely childish and even though sometimes it can be seen as charming, it mostly falls into frustrating levels of ditziness. This wouldn't be such a problem if she bounced off well with Jintan but she doesn't. It's not much her fault as his though.\\n\\n\r\nJintan's very bland. He is our snide, emotionless husk of a human being we have all grown to recognize as most of our MCs in anime. We are told and promised he is extremely cool and totally worthy of so much admiration in his group of friends but I'm still waiting for the reasons. \\n\\n\r\nI get what they were trying to do with Anuro. Geeky girl turned into a gyaru but they don't fully commit to either of these roles so she's just left as a unstable individual with radical mood swings that mostly end up with her in tears. Mixing her with other people though, makes her devolve into a tsundere (I mean, she has those pigtails for something) that in turn creates those clich\u00e9s we all see coming.\\n\\n\r\nTsuruko made me roll my eyes each time she did because god was tsuruko an uptight bitch. She is unable to form any kind of decision unless Yukiatsu has given his OK and then proceeds to stare everyone down as if she is superior. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't have an extremely dependable character be bored and cool and making me suffer when she tries to put people in places she thinks they belong by cutting them off or staring them down as if they were mere insects. I understand characters shouldn't be perfect, but don't make them into nuisances.\\n\\n\r\nAnd talking about nuisances.\\n\\n\r\nFirst place for worst character has to go to good old yukiatsu. \\n\\n\r\nEach time the story needed to move on and seeing we are left with bland Jintan who just lets the story happen to him instead of making an impact himself, the creators go and make Yukiatsu a bit crazy. \\n\\n\r\nThis boy makes some decisions that made me pause the video, take a deep breath and will myself to continue. I have seen characters like him, but they are normally not this central to the plot, so we can admire their trainwreck from a safe distance. He just barrels through it all with bitter comments and hateful energy. Whenever you are thinking \"wow, this character is getting so much more likeable\" or \"well, that's a neat idea, maybe arcs can be resolved\" or when you are just enjoying the story and its character interactions, worry not my friend, Yukiatsu will descend upon us and ruin it all. \\n\\n\r\nI understand drama needs, well, drama to fully be successful. But stirring up shit that happened when you guys were 5 is not a great way to do that. There is a scene where the characters are all bursting into tears by this and I couldn't help but laugh at how ridiculous it looked. \\n\\n\r\nNot to say this anime didn't bring me to tears, because it sure did. The last episode did its job wonderfully, but this was achieved despite its characters and not because of them. Themes about loneliness, growing up, moving on, and death will always be relatable to any of us because these are feelings we will encounter as we live, and the anime fully takes advantage of this in order to make us empathize with their situation. \\n\\n\r\nI think too many people adore Anohana because of how effective it is to make you cry, while ignoring the frustration it made you carry to reach that point. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Kept walking, kept crying, kept missing. I don't remember and could not find who said it, but the quote goes: No one is a complete adult, that's the bitter secret of this world. Personally, AnoHana gave me such a deep impression because a lot of close friends I grew up with dashed off in different, sometimes bad directions in the last couple of years. So I was moved by the way the \"Busters\" became wordless when they gathered again ten years later. \r\nLife, particularly life that has been through a great change or a great disaster, is like walking down an eternal tunnel alone. Thereis light but you still feel dark, nothing but yourself lasts forever beside you. Well, your knowledge also does. But beside that, there really isn't much accompanies you from the start to the end. So it was really satisfying to see the five friends' disclosure at the end in the temple. \\n\r\nOnce there was light, once upon a time. Just like the six friends in AnoHana, the light shines on every part of every children's heart. However, the light went down and the Garden of Eden crashed--not because of the snake, but because of how humans simply are. So there comes the real sadness in AnoHana, the eternal innocent angel Menma. Well, one can argue there are selfish and evil parts in her, but all her behaviors were innocent. Think: if anybody else among the six children died accidentally, would the whole group broke apart badly like that? Menma is the heart of the group not only because boys liked her. Everybody knew at that moment the light went out.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the point I finished watching, I physically felt the pain every time I look at Menma's picture, especially her smile. There are beautiful moments in our lives that worth remembering forever: Some happens before our adulthood, some happens on the last day of our lives. \\n\\n\r\nSomehow, AnoHana kept reminding me of the movie Rent, especially the two songs in it: Seasons of Love and Without You. (AnoHana's ending Secret Base is just as moving.)",

            "content": "Very rarely does an anime bring me close to man-tears, but in this case, Anohana wins that award.\r\nAnohana is a brilliant, very moving, very emotional story about a group of young teenagers and how they cope with the loss of one of their own, ten years after the incident occurs. Anyone who has dealt with loss can relate to how powerful and emotionally challenging it can be to move on from that. \r\nAnohana is story about six friends who, at a young age, formed a close bond with one another and formed a group they called the Peace Busters. One day, one of their ownpasses away in a tragic accident, which eventually drives them apart as they each blame each other for the loss of their friend. The ghost of their friend, Meiko Menma however, appears to one of their group members, the \"Leader\", Yadomi Jinta, and he is the only one who can see her. Her re-appearance as a ghost brings the group back together ten years later as they make it their mission to fulfill Menma's last wish in the hopes that they will grant her peace so she is able to move on into the afterlife. Throughout the series the group of friends come to learn more about each other, and discover that each and every one of them are struggling to deal with the past, and all of them are having trouble letting it go. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY 10/10\\n\r\nAlthough the series is short, comprising of 11 episodes, it is the perfect length for the show, not too drawn out and not too long-winded. The plot is in no way confusing to the viewer, and it allows you to connect with each character on a very emotional level, understanding how each and every one of them feels. \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC 8/10\\n\r\nI normally don't pay a lot of attention to the music, but this show had a great OP and a good ED. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 10/10\\n\r\nAs the series progresses, you discover how each of the characters grow and evolve, making them very relatable characters. Each of their stories tell something different, my favourite being Naruko Anjo, and her attachment to the main character, Yadomi Jinta. Her love for him reminded me a lot of relationships I've had in my own life, where you fall in love with someone who you know doesn't love you back the same way. Poppo was also one of my favourite characters, his upbeat personality and drive to ensure that all his friends remain friends forever is something that I would strive to do in many situations. Ultimately, all of the characters' connection to Menma is what makes the show intense and full of emotion.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 9/10\\n\r\nOverall, Anohana was one of the best drama series I've seen in a long time, it's bound to strike you at the heart and make cry. It's not too long and not too short either making it a great show to enjoy during your free time. If you love shows that hit you in the feels, then you'll really enjoy Anohana. \\n\\n",

            "content": "(This is an edited version of the review I originally posted on Instantgram on August 18, 2015.)\r\nThis is definitely one anime that lives up to it's reputation of being a \"Tear Jerker\"\r\nSTR #43: Anohana\r\nStory-\r\nI know you probably already have read the synopsis for this series, but if you haven't yet this is actually one series that going in not knowing anything is something I actually recommend. Besides that the story here is pretty great with a good amount of focus on \"Show don't tell\"...but sometimes they never really explain enough but thankfully they do later on into the series. But if I did have onecomplaint it is that this show starts off really well, but the middle section just feels like build up to the ending. Sure the show needs those episodes because they have the important character moments, but just kind of felt like watching nothing most of the time. However though for what the story is, it's perfectly fine for the 11 episodes, with the exception of the few problems I mentioned.\\n\r\nAlso, the drama here is really great because of the character being great as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, the characters here are \"those character roles\" like there is the \"Funny guy character\", the \"Serious Guy and Girl character\", the \"Headstrong male lead\", etc. But they were characterized to be a bit more Dynamic which means they aren't entirely said stereotypes and can actually have great character moments of realization, but they never go through any kind of character development. Sure for a simple show like this the characters do not really need to develop and the character moments are good enough of a substitute for developing, but that just does not feel right to me in my own opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is nice and so is the animation, but nothing really impressive. But I can at least say that animation is definitely one of better aspects of this show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic-\\n\\n\r\nIt's actually pretty absent which is strange, but also strangely fitting. When they do play  background music I'm so focused on what is happening...that I kind of forget it is there sometimes. Which is okay because the music does perfectly fit with this show; I just don't know if I'm going to be able to remember it well like I can with some other anime. But, the ending song is something I will remember, it perfectly portrays the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is something I highly recommend so go watch it when you can.\\n",

            "content": "As generic as the Slice of Life anime genre can get with the boring everyday life repetitions as its name implies, Ano Hana is truly a series that oversteps these mundane boundaries as a Slice of Life anime series with its dual Supernatural genre.\r\nTo put it simply, this show is about loss, grieving, and moving on. Yet, the anime itself is much more than that. From the beginning of episode one, there was something extremely different about this show excluding the obvious stunning animation by A-1 Pictures and the riveting music by Remedios. Although the story stars the generic ghost coming back because it cannotmove on as seen in multiple Supernatural animes, this anime focuses mainly on friendship which is different from the Supernatural norm. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout all 11 episodes, this show keeps your interest with not only its aesthetic appeal, but also through the enthralling storytelling and character development. There was not a single moment I wasn't on the edge of my seat, eagerly awaiting the next episode. The characters were real. They had their own voices and their own problems and were extremely easy to relate to. The show worked hard to achieve a sense of realism with its time and characters and it did such, weaving a story that truly resonated with the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the series was only barely over 10 episodes long, the pacing is perfect and production-wise, it was pretty flawless. The voice actors were seamless in their delivery and I was overcome with a train wreck of emotions as the last episode came to a close.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is perfect for those looking for something to fully engage yourself in emotionally. There were many tears shed throughout the series and the final episode in itself is a real heart-breaker.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, sounds, and characters were absolutely done to perfection. Although the plot was its only handicap due to its generality, it only barely affected the anime as a whole for it still told the story brilliantly. The story was still amazing although the ghost theme was unoriginal. Overall, this anime is by far one of my favorites and ranks as one of my top three Shoujos for a good reason.\\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend Ano Hana to anyone solely because it is a beautiful story intertwined with equally moving animation, music, and characters. I hope whoever watches it will also enjoy it as much as I did. To finally conclude,\\n\\n\r\n\"Super Peace Busters are friends forever!\"",

            "content": "I assume u have read the whole summary so ill just get straight to the point\r\nStory 9.5/10\r\nThe story construction was brilliantly done and well executed to get its point of view, 6 friends who parted ways after losing of their friends, Honma Meiko(Menma). Each episode starts to build up connection between the friends and as they get closer and closer. It also shows bit pieces of clues as to show what exactly happened on that tragic day. Though it didn't state how Menma passed away, the director and studio did a great job as it was never needed to state.\r\nSound 8.9/10\r\nThe soundtrack/background music gives thatvery peaceful kind of vibe. It goes really well as to each scenario is played. There's also soundtrack which gives that very cheerful,happy melody when the friends starts to remember their childhood memories, which to me honestly does reminds of my childhood. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though there were just 12 episodes total, the character build up went well then i entirely expected. Each character was fully explained and their personality like. They behaved and react like really normal person at this era especially the choices they make. It wasn't like that one character had that very special personality and everyone would only watch that because of that one character only. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is my personal view. I hadn't had this much feels and i cried... since Honey and Clover. Nagai, Tatsuyuki, if u guys aren't familiar with him, his the director of both of this shows so props to him again. All episodes were enjoyable and makes me curios as how it happen, why... etc. Though this show is a bit different as there less comedy on it compare to Honey and Clover. But is still fun to watch nonetheless and I'm glad to watch this beautiful story\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.3/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst, I wouldn't entirely recommend this anime to those who aren't really into slice of life genre with less comedy. I did some experiment and show it a friend of mine who has just started watching slice of genre and we watched the entire episodes, he said, it wasn't that Masterpiece but i never regret watching it, thx for recommending it. Nevertheless, AnoHana shows how good of an original animation can be without relying entirely on manga, light novels..etc\\n\\n\r\nAnyway this is my first review and if you have read it, thx and gladly appreciate it",

            "content": "AnoHana was the anime which made me smile, laugh, think, cry, and appreciate life.\r\nThe story itself is about the Super Peace Busters who were a group of friends in the past, but they went their seperate ways after Menma died. Now Jintan is a slacker who refuses to go to school, Anaru goes to Jinta's school and is rather popular, Tsuruko and Yukiatsu are in a private school and don't really talk to the others, and Poppo is travelling around to different places, while Menma's ghost suddenly appears around Jinta.\r\nThe only other anime which has made me feel the same way as AnoHana is probablyAngel Beats because of the way that also looks at life. At first, it makes you smile and you enjoy it, and at the end it makes you cry so much and you still enjoy it fully.\\n\\n\r\nThe way Menma came back and brought all her friends together was, for lack of a better word, kinda beautiful... it gave me hope to see how friends who had drifted back could come together again and be as close as they had before. It shows the problems within friendships, the way they argue, the way they can betray, as well as the way they can reconcile, the way they can support each other...\\n\\n\r\nIt's also quite nostalgic in the sense that it brings you back to the days when you were maybe about 8-10 years old and you found the world just fascinating, when you wanted to climb trees and ride bikes and run around all day (okay so we still like doing that stuff but it was different back then). It reminds you of the times when you were a child who wanted to be an adventurer, an explorer, a traveler, an astronaut... it brings you back to your childhood dreams and hopes and outlooks on life.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe this anime in one word it would be beautiful. In all honesty, I think everyone should watch this anime because it really is beautiful, not just because of it's amazing animation but because it lets you appreciate life for what it's worth. Personally, I think Menma's messages at the end especially, it made me appreciate my friends more than I already did, it let me see the beauty surrounding them all. I guess it sort of helped change my outlook on some things... it made me realise what some things are worth...\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for an anime that will change your life, AnoHana is what you need.",

            "content": "It's very rare to watch an anime that evoked such real emotions with the story telling and the way each of the characters developed in the series. Even though the anime was 11 episodes, the way that each episode complemented each other in such a concise manner didn't fall short of the quality. \r\nIf there's anything you should know about it me, it's that I don't cry easily in films, but however this one was like hurling a brick of feelings towards my face. Usually, shows which are dubbed to be \"sad\" and \"it will make you cry I promise\" always have me quickly assumingthat someone was going to die.\\n\r\nHowever, having the death been already presented to you from episode one, really leaves your wondering how else the show can leave you in an emotional wrath towards the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe story that plays out focuses on a group of childhood friends, once separated manage to reunite together with their different current selves because of a single tie that was cut loose too early. Showing how it affected each one of them individually. The story was real, raw and definitely emotional (especially the last few episodes *whew*) \\n\\n\r\nThe ability to deliver a story so delicately well-written, and able to pin-point the exact emotions of the death of a loved one hits so well on a personal level which makes me wonder about the ties the writer may have with this anime. Any-one who has seen this anime can relate to the sense of vulnerability of the characters, which makes the film much more enticing and wonderful. The ending to the anime was neatly tied into a little bow, beautifully written and still accomplishing all the aspects that needed to be addressed, leaving nothing untold or left behind.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the film played well with each other, and were meticulously well written into the film. After the death of their beloved friend, it hit them immensely to the point that it still lingers around them several years later. Certain characters feign acceptance and unresolved issues or answers that hinders them from moving onwards in their lives, being stuck in the past or pretending the past never affected them really goes to show how the crucial the impact was to each and every one of them - not just the main characters - but the people around them was also shown to be affected. The friendship between the characters from then to now, showing the shift between them and overcoming obstacles together is an element of the film which was completely sweet and endearing to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe music played really well within the film, I say the music did manage to evoke more tears than I should. It was sweet, light and really complemented it situation that it prefaced. Art of the film was nothing out of the ordinary, although very nice it wasn't something extraordinarily different. \\n\\n\r\nI sincerely enjoyed this anime very much, I high encourage others to watch this anime. Simply and bitter-sweet.\\n",

            "content": "I just finished watching this show (I know I'm soooo late but I don't careee) and trying to stop tears flowing out of my eyes. Feels~~\r\nIf only anime is real.. if only the idea in this anime is real.. \r\nI recently lost my father. My mom, my sister and me were very sad and devastated, which is why I can really relate with this anime. \r\nSimply put, Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai is an anime about death of the loved one (a really close friend, in this anime), and how they deal with it. People say 'time will heal'but in some cases, if you still have guilt, regrets or 'unfinished matter' you won't really move on, which is the theme this anime is taking on. I won't say further or I will spoil... so... let's go to the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime has very good idea. It is very relatable, for teenager growing up, and especially for those who have lost someone important in their lives.. However, as the story develops there are several things that makes me go 'ehh??' (read: awkward) and some rather unnecessary lines / dialogues. I'm pretty sure there are some other reviewer who wrote in detail these small flaws that prevent this anime from being perfect. But overall, it is above average. It is very good.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art, I always like A-1 Pictures productions because often the shows they produce are very good, the same applies to Anohana (too tired to wrote the entire longgg title ahaha). It is smooth and color palettes are pretty and suitable with the theme. Background are beautifully drawn as well. Being an original anime without any source from manga / light novel, I find the character designs good as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nSeiyuus are perfect!! I'm sure you notice there are notable and renown seiyuus in the cast. Their voice acting here is very good, surely making you feel. The OSTs are good, although I don't particularly remember any tunes, but matches the show. I mean, it supports the scene, doesn't feel out of place. Opening song is catchy but just okay.. (that's preventing me from giving 10/10) but the ending song.. mannn it just gives me feels. Instant favorite. And I cried really badly in episode 10 because of this song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThere are different characters to represent different ways people deal with loss.. from friend's side and family's side. There are various characters: character who is totally 'gone' - becoming hikikomori (although I'm curious whether Jintan started it recently or already longg ago, it's one plot hole that I didn't really catch), some cannot forgive themselves, some are trying to move on by focusing on different things and make new friends (but not necessarily good and true friends), etc. You will know when you watch, it is very clear. They have sides that are appealing and will earn spot in your heart, and relatable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall 9/10\\n\r\nI like this anime. I watch this to pass time and because people say is good, and I totally agree, it is VERY GOOD ANIME. It also makes me reflect on myself and my family. Besides the character interactions and plot, I keep watching because I want to know and learn how in the end they can deal with this loss and truly move on. Another good slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a short yet very good anime about friendship, teenage love and loss / death that gives you feels, I highly recommend Anohana to you.\\n",

            "content": "Today we're going to be looking at a series written by Okada Mari, known for her screenwriting work in such series as Black Butler, Basilisk, Simoun and Black Rock Shooter, and produced by A-1 Pictures, who worked with her on the Black Butler projects as well. This is an anime I've heard about several times both from friends and from my youngest sister, who likes to cite it as an example of yet another anime where \"Cloud\" (Sakurai Takahiro) cross-dresses and chases a childhood love interest. Those seem like pretty specific character traits considering how often they reoccur in characters he voices. This is AnoHi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai, which I'm just going to call Anohana.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple. We have our protagonist, Jintan, being visited by the ghost of a dead childhood friend, Menma. I promise that isn't a spoiler. Anyway, he has to reunite with his old group in order to find a way to send her spirit on to the afterlife. This is one of those rare stories that manages to have a really good blend of heart-warming, comedic, light-hearted and serious moments. Most pieces of media that attempt that kind of emotional range just end up falling flat, or having scenes that drastically clash with one another. Another aspect that I really liked about Ano Hana is the ending. I won't spoil it, so let's just say that it was a crowning moment of heartwarming and leave it at that. Now, before anyone thinks I'm getting soft in my old age, let me go into a pretty serious problem with the anime. The love trian... pentagon. Seriously, the amount of \"she likes him but he likes her and blah blah blah\" among the six major characters, including Menma, is both idiotic and contrived. Here's the thing. A lot of it is working off of childhood crushes, when the characters are at an age where most crushes last all of a week in reality. I know, an unrealistic ghost story, who would have guessed? The whole love pentagon is still really (x 10 to the 9001st power) stupid, not to mention annoying. What makes it worse is that the entire purpose seems to be to give them a reason to come back together as a group, in spite of Jintan being the only one who can see Menma. That was the best they could come up with? Childhood crushes that have managed to subsist because the plot said so? Honestly, I can let the lingering feelings over Menma pass, since the tragedy with her might very well result in a fixation, but when five of the six characters are all romantically linked, it just gets absurd. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are actually really strong. Even the minor characters have verisimilitude and dimensions. The character dynamics also work pretty well, with the exception of the aforementioned love pentagram. Which, is a big character issue as well as being a problem with the story. When Ano Hana does something badly, they do it badly. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is really good. The characters, backgrounds and assorted objects all have really nice, dynamic looks. \\n\\n\r\nThis has some great voice actors. Irino Miyu, Hayami Saori, Sakurai Takahiro, Kayano Ai, Toyosaki Aki, and Tomatsu Haruka are all fine actors and they give good performances. The music is also really good. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. This has no yuri. \\n\\n\r\nSo, how does Ano Hana hold up? Pretty well. the biggest problem it has is the ludicrous love pentagon, which is really annoying. That aside, it has some great moments, a lot of goofy fun and some really good characters. My final rating is going to be a 7.7/10. I do recommend checking it out.",

            "content": "I found out about this anime through some of my twitter fans and they particularly were saying that they were crying/full of tears after watching this anime. I guess this was part of the motivation for me to see if i would cry lol. \r\nStory: 9/10 The storyline is relatively simple but really is one you want to follow and want to see the progression of the characters's development and how they all reunite again as the super peace busters xD. The story itself isn't a totally unique idea as it focuses on how the group split up after Memma's death and how her spirithelps reunite them again, but the character development makes up for that easily. There were a few loopholes/questionable aspects in the story like why Jinta didn't think earlier to show that Memma's spirit/ghost does exist to others aka like her making the muffins/writing stuff down/etc. Idk why it took so many episodes for him/rest of group to think that before Memma ultimately hints that.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, you never find out how exactly Memma died, but it's somewhat implied and I kinda liked how they approached that instead of just showing the incident. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 Very cleanly drawn, but nothing that wows you. it does a little charm to it though and fits the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 The voice-acting was pretty good, except for Jinta's father kept saying the word \"cute\"- that honestly got annoying and they coulda toned that down a bit. The intro song is ok, but I feel the credit/ending song is much more emotional and fitting. Again, nothing to wow ya.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 This is where the anime shines as you see character development and progression as more of the story is told you find out more about the characters and their guilt/sadness. The characters each have their own coping mechanism, like Memma's father wants to try his best to forget Memma and goes out of his way to pack up all her stuff/put in the closet and move on, while her mother is totally stuck in the past and cannot stop grieving, even to the point where she doesn't see change in her son. Popo even has guilt and tries to hide it by always trying to act happy/goofish, but he suffers just as much. Jintan for the most part doesn't want Memma's spirit to leave and has acts/thoughts of selfishness and also becomes secluded/stays at home for most of the day and skips school(withdrawn). Lol you even get crossdressing as Matsuyuki dresses up as Memma to help cope with his lost love/guilt.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: I give this anime a 9/10 as it really has a well put story and great character development! You could even write a paper on the coping mechanisms present and its acceptance in society and our right to judge those coping mechanisms. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. I did not cry, but my chest did tighten up(that happens when i'm sad)",

            "content": "Anohana, as an anime original coming-of-age story, could have turned out to be a disaster. Especially with a short, 11 episode length, I was initially worried that there wouldn\u2019t be enough time for to flesh out the characters too well. Instead, the characters ended up turning out to be absolutely captivating, and very well written right up until the end. This series wastes no moment in fleshing out all of the characters and pushing the plot, always moving forward and using the most of the limited time available for this series. And the resulting series turned out to be one of the most memorable seriesI\u2019ve seen in recent times.\\n\\n\r\nFrom start to finish, this show has always been fully focused on building the characters, resulting in a realistic and well thought out main cast. It\u2019s truly the characters that shine here, always building upon the complex character dynamics between everybody, and exploiting the character relationships for an emotional, powerful story. Certain characters did need more screentime and development (Poppo and Tsurumi), but even then this series gave us a decent feel for their emotional scars and issues. They were acting a bit out of character towards the end though, which could have been fixed if the duo had gotten more in depth development.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this series really emphasizes well is just how powerful of an impact Menma has had on all of members of the main cast, and their unresolved issues and problems associated with her. It leaves no stone unturned, fully exploring the depth and complexity to a lot of the characters and their relationship with Menma, and not to mention does a good job with developing Menma herself.\\n\\n\r\nNow the only real issue I had with this series is how at times the series was just way too overdramatic. The characters may have been excellently built up, but some of their interactions were a bit too unnatural. Especially during certain key episodes, the drama was almost nauseating at times. Even so, the story for the most part was excellent at setting up the situation, as well as delicately pushing forward everybody\u2019s eventual confrontation with their emotional scars.\\n\\n\r\nAs for animation, there are no reused frames, fluid animation, and consistently drawn scenery and characters. And not to mention, quite a bit of the animation was easy on the eyes and enjoyable to look at. Nothing fancy, but definitely above average. Music was solid throughout the series, especially the noteworthy ending theme, which was a perfect fit for a lot of the scenes in this series.\\n\\n\r\nAs a coming of age story, Anohana was great at forming an admirable story with a believable and compelling cast. All the characters really brought out the best (and worst) in each other, and everybody\u2019s gradually progression in this series is done at a natural, yet well-executed, pace. This is especially notable considering how, with only 11 episodes, this series didn\u2019t waste even a single precious moment of time, managing to show that a series doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be long to be good. The series did kind of wind down a bit towards the end, with some plot holes and predictability (and some ridiculous drama), but for the most part it was a very enjoyable ride.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nSetting: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.0/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 8.4/10 (rounded down to a 8 on MAL)",

I think this anime could havebeen better if it had a darker aspect, or at least a more serious and adult tone. \\n\r\nMaybe I wasn't simply the target, but for example I largely prefer Angel Beats in the way it treats death, friendship and the way it deals with sadness/humour.\\n\\n\r\nI'm realizing I'm maybe a bit tough, and I shouldn't since it's a quite good anime with good issues (and I think I would recommend it to people).

            "content": "This is a story about a group of of friends who grow up and find themselves slowly growing more and more distant from each other. The plot in this story is rather unusual, yet pretty simple. Its a slice of life at the core, but not as you might expect. The mood of the show is sad, depressed, and sometimes lonesome, but can be heartwarming too. The art is rather simple, animation is average. Voice acting has its ups and downs, there are great moments and not so great ones. Characters are also hit or miss, some are very good some seem plain. If Ihad to say something bad about this show it would be the lines and dialogue. Sometimes lines don't fit character's personalities that well, as if characters suddenly act out of character. Lines sometimes disappoint in key scenes where impact is expected. The art in backgrounds (mainly) as well as characters has a slight lack of detail, its definitely not bad, but it could be better. If I had to name something good about this show it would be the music. Soundtracks and BGM really have a heavy feeling to it. The flow of the story has a way of being believable, events are lined up in a neat order of events. I give it a 8.9/10\\n\\n\r\nTLDR Version: Depressing show. Weak lines sometimes. Fitting music. Buy tissues.",

            "content": "In short; I enjoyed this anime and I can see how many others did as well. It's actually no wonder why it has many good reviews, but I wouldn't watch this again - at least not until I've forgotten about what happens in this story. \r\nAnd with that, let's get into it.\r\nThe story is actually very deep, at least if you look at just the story and ignore everything else. Loss of a friend is a heartbreaking thing, especially when you're a child - which is probably why I did cry in the first few episodes. Like the main characters of Anohana, I too havelost a childhood friend when I was just a small child and carried the grief well into my teenage years. While I understand completely that people deal with grief in many different ways, I wasn't the biggest fan of the way they made the characters deal with it. It had been 10 years since Menma died, but still the characters carried the hurt as if she had died only few years ago. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Menma, she is annoying. Sure, she is sweet and kind of funny, but to me the reason why it took me so long to finish this anime is because of her personality. Menma is portrayed as that childish, na\u00efve young girl (I've seen many use the word \"moe\" but since I don't 100% understand that words meaning, I won't use it) that too many animes and mangas use. Not to mention even though they said that \"she had grown with them\", meaning that her body wasn't a child's body, it really didn't look like that. It's as if her physical appearance and most of her personality were catered to the fans of loli, which to me (and for what I've seen, to many others as well) is very off putting.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the other main characters were okay; they had surprisingly good character arcs and while they all do fit in the basic anime character tropes, I didn't hate it. But I do need to touch on Jinta Yadomi. His story line - with not going to school - was touching and entertaining, but his relationship with Menma kind of creeped me out. The way he was still in love with her (in the way that he wants to marry her) was disturbing; she had been dead for years and he still has the same feelings for her, even when she came back as a ghost? I only really started to like his character after episode 6; the first episodes just rubbed me off in the wrong way. \\n\\n\r\nTo the other things: the music was amazing. I've listened the opening and ending many times on youtube, and played the OST while I study. Art style I loved a lot, it really fit with the story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime. The ending really got to me - I didn't expect myself to cry so much; it was touching and heartbreaking, really coming through for this anime. I was originally going to give this a 7, but the way they tied everyone's story in the end was great and I had to give it a 8. Sure there were things that I didn't like (things that annoyed me and actually stopped me from watching this every now and then), but those things weren't really that big of things. \\n\\n\r\nAnohana is a great anime and I do think that if you want to get into anime, this is what you should watch, even if this slice-of-life genre isn't your thing.",

This anime deals a lot with the negative consequences of the death of Menma, who died in an accident, affecting his five closest friends. \r\nI thought that the anime leads to a happy ending, Menma lives happily with his companions, especially with Jintan. However, as the chapters pass, there are depressing and heartrending memories that make my fantasy fall apart little by little.\r\nIt teaches us that death is always present, even when you are a child or an elder, death always waits.Hey, but that's not seen in most animes? Maybe, but Anohana is special simply because he describes Menma's accident in such a crude and realistic way, and how this catastrophic event affected his friends and even his relatives, something that is not often played on animes with sad deaths ( Correct me if I express myself in the wrong way)\\n\\n\r\nHarmonious music and environmental sadness to each of the depressive events of Menma and Jintan's group, especially when it says goodbye to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are going to see this anime, prepare your handkerchiefs just in case, is it never bad to prevent, right?\\n\\n",

            "content": "To start off, AnoHana is the only anime that has literally caused tears to flow freely from my eyes.\r\nAnoHana deals mainly with the themes of friendship and the consequences of the loss of someone dear. It handles these themes masterfully.\r\nEvery character is pleasingly unique, with their own personalities, motives, and secrets. AnoHana expertly manipulates the characters to weave a story that, in the end, will leave a deep impression.\r\nThe anime takes complete control over your emotions, with a sense of looming sadness more than two or three episodes from the finale. And finally, all your pent-up nervousness and sadness culminates in one tearjerking moment.\r\nCrisp andclean, the anime ends with a pleasantly salty, but pure taste in your mouth. No dragged-out sadness or pompous endings in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: I was listening to Nanairo Symphony, the second OP for Shigatsu  wa Kimi no Uso, when I realized I should re-review AnoHana and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso.\\n\\n\r\nSo, everything above stays true, but here's a more thoughtful, less fanboyish review.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana is known in the anime community as a tearjerker anime, joining the ranks of other highly popular animes with the same classification such as Clannad: After Story and Angel Beats!. However, I believe sad animes speak to the psyche in three different places: your sympathy, your attachment, and your heart. Animes that speak to your heart have the greatest effect. With this idea in mind, AnoHana speaks to your heart, making it a powerful, moving anime.\\n\\n\r\nAt one point, people have struggled with loss, shattered friendships, and unrequited love. AnoHana not only deals heavily with these themes, but it also goes the next mile and executes it almost seamlessly. This makes the sorrow of AnoHana intensely personal, and it pierces your heart mercilessly. In comparison, sad animes that speak to sympathy (i.e. Kousei in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso) and to attachment (i.e. your favorite characters in Angel Beats!) cannot pierce as deep--their greatness is determined by their execution. In other words, animes that rely on affecting your sympathy or attachment to characters can be good, but they're much more dependent on execution in order to be able to effectively create \"feels\" (on this note, Angel Beats! has poor execution when it comes to creating feels for all the characters--sorry, Angel Beats! fans). Speaking to the heart, on the other hand, is by essence personal and hits on a much more deeper level; these types of animes are much less reliant on execution, and they have the highest possible potential in terms of anime greatness because of their inherent advantage.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana, in my opinion, transcends the other popular \"feels\" animes (Angel Beats!, Clannad After Story, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, etc.) because it not only targets your heart strings (already giving it a leg up) but it also has great execution--the only possible flaw I can note in this anime in terms of execution is Menma's rather static, simple personality.\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to drop a message or something if you see flaws in this re-review. I feel like it gets a bit convoluted, but trust me, it sounded a lot better in my head when I thought about it. If you point out a mistake, I'll go fix it. This review is intended to be as analytical and informative as possible, but I can already see flaws that I can't quite place my finger on.",

Personally I find the synopsis a little deceiving. I felt like the series was more like a haunting than simply regretting the past.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story itself is pretty straight forward. The series is not really plot driven, but for what it was I think it was executed very well. Something I find with a lot of these sad anime's is that the plot will try to force sad back stories onto you and I feel that in real lifeno one would suddenly give you their life story like that. But in Anohana, the times the characters talked about themselves and when they chose to be silent seemed more realistic and I appreciate the work put into doing that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good. The art style of the characters made them quite attractive, but there wasn't anything that really blew my mind.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nNothing extremely special with the sound, it was just good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI really like how the characters were designed in this anime. They were attractive on the outside, but really ugly and despicable once you got to know them. I find that this is kind of rare for a lot of shows, and it was actually very refreshing to see that the creators had made realistic characters. This show does not candy-coat people's vices, and they make it pretty clear that they are not at all good people. Despite the fact that they are pretty disgusting, I still grew to like most of the characters a lot. This kind of bitter-sweet relationship with the characters was really interesting and well done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed Anohana a lot, and I feel that probably 8 out of 10 people would agree because it was really relatable. I found enjoyment in watching the characters break down and seeing them expose their selfish intentions. I'll emphasize this again: this is a pretty sad show so if you enjoy watching people cry you will have fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nYou know that voice you ignore when you find pleasure in someone's pain? Well this show exposes that voice, and I found it great. It's rare to find an anime that's as truthful as this one and I feel that the creators did a pretty damn good job with it.",

Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai,We Still Don't Know the Name of the Flower We Saw That Day, an emotional anime that works it's way into the viewer's heart, i don't think i can count the amount of times i've shed tears during this show, especially nearing and at the end.\\n\\n\r\nSummary (Some spoilers involved):\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a grown Jinta who is faced with living with the ghost of Meiko, who passed away during their childhood after a dispute involving friends in the Super Peace Busters. Jinta finds out that the reason Meiko hasn't passed on to heaven is because she had a wish while alive that she wanted to fulfill but sadly couldn't. Jinta then tries to fulfill this wish which meiko could not remember, so along with the rest of friends (who had all fallen out since the tragic accident and lost of their friend) they all try to help fulfill this wish but along the way they find themselves realizing the truth of their childhood and the truth about each other along the way. \\n\\n\r\nMy Review: \\n\\n\r\nThe story was amazing, it had all the stuff that makes an anime great, the comedy, the heartwarming times, the relationships between characters, and more that all meshed into an amazing show that had me hooked from the very beginning. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were great, i loved the art which was similar to Ano Natsu de Matteru, another personal favorite. The Voices all went great with the characters, meaning that they sound just right for which characters that they are. Each character had their own great impact towards the story, and towards the building up of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime, i laughed, and cried a little throughout watching the show. Without any exception i would recommend this anime to anyone who loves a good story and a heartwarming experience. \\n\\n\r\nP.s The OP and ED also played a significant part in my love for this anime, a great plus.",

            "content": "Deaths have always been a tool used in anime to get the viewer to feel emotions without even trying. However, a way to prolong that sensation is to show how people cope with it. This in itself is not just sad, but very realistic.The trauma that goes with losing a loved one or friend is very tough to get rid of, and if you believe you have, you are either in denial or lying to yourself. With this concept in mind, here is my review of Anohana. \r\nAnohana is about a group of six friends called the Super Peace Busters who lost one of therememebers as children, Menma. As the remaining five grown older, they still struggle to forget the past and move on, ultimately splitting up. However, for the former leader of this group, Jintan, he can't seem to escape the pain of losing his childhood crush, especially being stockpiled on the fact his mother died around the same time causing Jintan to lock in his emotions and shut himself in from the outside world. The only problem is Menma materialized in his house and only he can see her...wait, what? Yes, she appears in his house as she would look if she grew up with everyone else, and has come back for a reason. Menma tell him she has one last wish, but can't remember. In his struggle to help her find it, he is forced to reunite with old friends and fights to get the others to believe his case. Just this scenario alone can have so many troubles, and I mean this in the best way possible. It is very dramatic, has no loose ends, and is a perfect story for this kind of show that is not only going for a tragic sense of loss, but for the heartwarming feeling when friends reunite. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very nice, and very reminiscent or Toradora. The scenery is breathtaking, while the characters are less, but still very well designed. The characters are all very normal looking, but still have a style that sets them apart.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is kind of like a movie soundtrack. You don't really notice it, but it doesn't mean its not there. It blends so well, its quite remarkable how it moves with the story. Aside from that, the OP and ED is brilliant, and go with the show like chocolate and peanut butter. Other than that, the soundtrack is very nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have quite the personality, and each can be a favorite in their own way. They are all very lovable, and it adds a warmth to the show, but in the same breath they all have a desperation that adds intensity. Every character shows a different side you don't see coming, which is a breath of fresh air from so many one sided characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show brilliant, but had one major problem that kept me from giving it a 10. It was a bit mello-dramatic. Lots of crying and yelling. In moderation this could've worked, but at some points it was a bit much. However, besides that the series is marvelous, and is a must see for drama seekers searching for a new way to be moved.",

            "content": "I'm a frequenter of /a/, so I've always heard that Clannad is one of the sadder series on that end of the spectrum, but I can't really be sure as I've never seen it. I've also heard both Clannad and Ano Hana referred to as \"forced drama shit\". I don't know about Clannad, but I can vouch for Ano Hana when I say if you actually watch it until the end, it is particularly heart-wrenching and nothing to me felt forced at all. In fact, Ano Hana hit me particularly hard. It is a tangle of (innocently enough) childhood love triangles hidden beneath a tragedythat everyone carries with them for years.\\n\\n\r\nThe best (and I guess worst, in it's own right) part about Ano Hana is that it has a really human feel to it at a lot of points. It's hard not to sympathize and relate when just about everyone has lost someone dear to them and wished that they could go back and and appreciate that time a little more, wished they could say something important to them. I don't know about you, but I know that feel pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all there was not a lot I can really complain about, there was a lot I really liked about it. For instance, I absolutely loved that though it wasn't apparent from the beginning, the answer they needed for her wish was in the opening theme but it wasn't obvious until the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI also felt that most of the characters were very fleshed out and had their flaws. After Menma's death, Jinta became a hikkikimori, Yukiatsu found some... eccentric ways to mourn, Poppo traveled the world, Tsuruko clung onto Yukiatsu but felt contempt over the fact that he could not get over Menma. And I dunno, Anaru became a conceited bitch trying to take Menma's place?? To each his own I guess.\\n\\n\r\nI loved guessing throughout the show what Menma's wish was, but also dreaded them finding out, as they would ultimately lose her for a second time and make it even more painful. I also liked that they avoided something anime can be very guilty of-- everyone believing something at the tip of a hat. Everyone but Poppo really doubted that Menma was back and following Jinta around, Yukiatsu denied it almost until the very end! While it was frustrating sometimes to see his ignorance towards it after just about everyone else believed Jinta but him, I felt that it really kept his character intact, unwavering from what he believed and unable to forgive or believe Jinta after Menma's death.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can't say much about \"enjoyment' because, well, I don't think I'd watch it again knowing I'll bawl for an hour during the last two episodes, I thought it was a very engrossing series and I liked that it sent me through a whirlwind of emotions--once. I made the mistake of watching the last episode and cried and cried just like I had months before when I'd watched it originally. I don't think I could watch it again-- my heart can't take it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved the show, the characters were mostly well fleshed out, I paid no attention to the soundtrack unfortunately aside from the op, the art was nice (but what kinda kid has white hair?? whatever, she was adorable and pure) and I would try to avoid watching it again myself but it at least deserves one watch--hopefully one you won't soon forget!",

But a sudden loss of a dear friend, Menma, made them distant. After growing up, that groups leader , Yadomi nicknamed Jintan, started seeing  Menma's (who he lost) ghost. This story follows to fulfill the dead friends wish which would help her to go to heaven. \r\nI really liked the main theme of the story. It\u2019s certainly one to be liked by everyone. This story also emphasizes on how a premature death canaffect other lives. The story is Obviously an emotional and enjoyable one much more to my liking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 10/10\\n\r\nAnohana's characters developments are spot on. The anime really described the nature of the characters in only 11 episodes & quite nicely. This is an anime where you get to see like all kinds of people. The characters are different from each other & this is a strong part of this anime. I think some of the script writing seemed obvious but overall it was good.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is quite nice and neat. It didn\u2019t have anything exceptional. I kinda like this typical animation. The faces are quite the innocent types. Characters had different expressions and it was better  than the usual. But Menma's appearance didn\u2019t change that much though she was old. That seemed kinda odd.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtracks were awesome for this anime. I really liked the ending especially when they made the song appear in different scenes. It really was appropriate for this kind of anime. You get the emotional kind of feeling which is really good. I\u2019m actually a metal fan. But sometimes hearing soft-core songs is really enjoyable & I\u2019ll give a credit to the Sony Music for choosing these soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is a strong side of this anime because from my point of view, this anime is really enjoyable. You don\u2019t really find Slice of life combined with supernatural. This combination is worth mentioning and I felt that it made the anime much more interesting. Sometimes you get emotional & sometimes you get a good feeling-that is much praiseworthy. Every once in a while, we must watch this kind of anime to refresh our minds.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime deserves a 9/10 rating. We should learn a thing or two (of course the good ones) from this anime. This anime has a great part, which is you will find realism in it as well as supernaturalism. I think It\u2019s really peculiar to get these two combined. Frankly speaking this anime made my day.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend everyone who hasn\u2019t seen this anime to watch it. It was quite good for me because I\u2019m a fan of Slice Of Life Genre. If you aren\u2019t a fan of this genre, don\u2019t worry, this anime won\u2019t disappoint you.\\n",

            "content": "Growing up and coming of age. A familiar term used to describe what feels like almost too many shows in this day and age. It's often a blank term placed over slice of life shows that attempt to carry a little more meaning to their characters other than them enjoying life (not that it's a bad thing at all). But just how many anime can you truly say capture the idea of growing up and coming of an age? Before I go on let me say one thing to start: AnoHana truly does capture that feeling in one of the best ways I have everhad the joy of experiencing.\\n\\n\r\nWhile AnoHana only clocks in with eleven episodes under its belt, I think what it does with those eleven episodes says volumes about the show itself. Not often does an anime with this many episodes inflict such a tornado of emotions on its viewer, that alone deserves praise on its own. I won't bore you with a summary of the plot, but its main focus is a group of teenagers who were once best friends as kids, were torn apart due to tragedy and now years later are still trying to overcome their grief. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the actual story is more supernatural than that, in all honesty that is how it can be said. With the use of Menma's actual ghost trying to go to heaven and move on herself, we see how her death affected all of the \"Super Peace Busters\" in eerily realistic ways. The way the characters act does often come off as childish and at first, as the series progresses everyone learns and matures and in the final episode final coming to terms with her death and beginning to move on. \\n\\n\r\nI have to praise the story on its merits of how closely personal it can get to the viewer without someone realizing it. While not everyone has experienced a death of a friend at a young age, the struggles of growing up, discovering who you are and accepting feelings your own heart hides is something everyone can relate to. I don't mind to spend so much time on these aspects alone but I believe these facts are what really set the series apart. It's emotional and raw and knows how to dig at it's viewers hearts to make this journey fulfilling by it's end.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much special to be said about the character designs or the animation, they all look good and feel just right in the world they take place in. There's nothing special in that as a whole but AnoHana is not a show built on visual spectacle. The OST also does it's job well and the only music that truly shines are the melancholic OP and the oddly fitting ED. They make an enjoyable start and end to every episode and fit right into the anime they were placed on.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole AnoHana is a short but wild journey and a small look into the lives of the Super Peace Busters. It doesn't strike anything new to anime or dazzle viewers with amazing visuals, but what it does is convey emotions extremely well and leaves the viewer satisfied (albeit in tears) and content by the end of it's eleven episode run. If you have the time to watch the series in it's short length I absolutely recommend it.",

            "content": "Art (7/10)\r\nWith much of the Toradora! staff returning to make Ano Hana, the art felt very familiar. Watching Ano Hana made me feel like watching Toradora! again as the scenery and characters have a unique style to them that I first noticed in Toradora! However, with this being made about three years after Toradora!, the lack of detail in some scenes disappointed me. I felt that, in some scenes, the faces of some of the characters looked very sloppy; like the job was rushed. The art for the OP and ED were well done though. Overall,  decent artwork and definitely watchable. \r\nCharacters (9/10)\r\nHaving extremelywell developed characters in only 11 episodes is tough to accomplish but Ano Hana stood up to this daunting task and delivered beautifully. From the first episode to the last, the main  protagonist, Jinta, goes through some major personality changes - from a shut-in with an \"I don't care about life\" attitude to someone who goes out of his way to help his friends in any way he's able to. The other characters also start developing later in the show, demonstrating how the death of a close friend can change one's way of life. Furthermore, the interactions between the characters show how different each of them are. From the fashionable Anaru to the intelligent Tsuruko, each of them are unique in their own way, increasing the viewers' chances of being able to relate to one character. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nStarting with the OP, I thought it was a catchy and slightly upbeat song after listening to it for the first time. It fit in well as the introduction to each episode whether the mood was happy or sad. As for the ED, I found it better than the OP because it blended in perfectly with the dramatic mood set at the end of every episode. The way it starts off soft and builds up helps to emphasize the dramatic significance of the ending scenes of each episode. Moving on to the BGM, although it wasn't really noticeable as I was too enticed by the story to focus on it, I found that it fit in well with each one of the scenes. The BGM helped set the mood on several occasions, adding to my already excellent experience. Finally, the voice acting was quite good considering the difficulty of faking tears and sadness. I thought the aforementioned cases were voiced masterfully, with each one of the VAs doing their job extremely well (though some obviously better than others). \\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10)\\n\r\nI'll try to keep this spoiler free but I'll apologize in advance in case I do spoil some things. So this is the story of five (actually six) childhood friends who reunite with one another after around ten years away from each other. During these ten years, each one of them had to cope with the death of their friend Honma \"Menma\" Meiko. And now, the one who was supposedly closest to Menma, Yadomi Jinta, has world turned upside down by the reappearance of Menma. As the story continues, all of the childhood friends, collectively known as the \"Super Peace Busters\", eventually come to learn of Menma's reappearance through Jinta and once again struggle with the guilt of feeling responsible for Menma's death. Through Menma, the five of them grow closer and closer together once again, relying on one another for support through this time of struggle. No matter the circumstances, these friends, at the end of the day, realize that their friendship with one another is the most important thing in the world to them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nIf you ever had to go through the death of a very good friend while you were still a child, this anime will definitely make you remember everything - both pleasant and unpleasant. From tears of joy to tears of sorrow, Ano Hana has it all. Every episode builds upon the previous one, easily captivating the viewer. Ano Hana is an anime that will remind you to value your life and friendships because you never know what will happen at the next moment. Definitely a must-see for drama lovers out there as this masterpiece will tug at your emotions and make you think more about your relationship with others. Give Ano Hana a try and I'm confident that you will enjoy it.",

            "content": "Going into Ano Hana, I was a little hesitant. When I heard it's about the spirit of a dead girl bringing her estranged friends back together, I was afraid this was going to be a happy-go-lucky, \"isn't this adorable?\" sort of anime. It turned out to be anything but.\r\nThis anime does an incredible job of showing the human emotion. That might be a strange thing to say, but the separation of these friends came in a very painful way and their uniting brings forth painful feelings and memories. I feel this series does a great job of drawing you into each character and show youthe personal pain that each one is feeling.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was excellent in my opinion. The premise of these former friends gathering together again to try and help the spirit of their dead friend move on was extremely moving. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was also certainly one of the strengths of this anime. It matched the tone for this anime perfectly and the ending theme is perhaps one of my all-time favs.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, the characters were the strongest part of this series. None of them felt fake or contrived. Each one had their own unique personality and what I loved most was that this anime showed that each character had their own personal demon to deal with. This was a difficult experience for each and every one of the characters, and you could feel that through this anime's flowing narrative. While each character had their imperfections, the finale has a payoff that makes you look past those imperfections. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to point out one or two small flaws with this series, it was I thought the animation was so-so. It was still very good, but not great. It's a very nit picky flaw and with an anime like this, it could be drawn in crayon by a 2nd grader and it would still be moving. My other nitpick was it did sort of drag out a little bit by the last few episodes. The buildup toward the final act wasn't the strongest, but the final scenes more than made up for it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was one of the most moving animes I have ever seen. The narrative the chemistry between the characters was top notch. In my opinion, this was one of the best animes from 2011 without a doubt. You'll be hard-pressed to find a drama/slice of life anime that's better than this one.",

            "content": "AnoHana for short, is one of those unforgettable animes, where once you watch it once it stays with you, bad points about this anime? \r\n1) Makes you cry\r\n2) Sleep deprived\r\n3) Leaves a hole in your heart after you finish it\r\nStory 10\r\nAnohana tells of a story of friends trying to cope with the death of their dear friend, but really to make it short its just a bunch of friends making up and learning to forgive each other after something tragic has happened. This anime is pretty impressive, they can basically tell each characters perspective of the day menma died quite detailed in just 11 episodes,like it'll be hard to actually find something that you didn't understand. I can guarantee you, that you will cry at least once or at least get very emotional, oh and i mean VERY emotional. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\\n\r\nFor an Anime released in 2011, it was expected to have art that good, it will be surprising if it didn't. I did however liked how they sometimes used a blue outline on the characters during the scenes about the past, i thought that was a pretty nice touch and a unique way to do things.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8 \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty well made, for instance the overlapping of the ending song with the last 1-2 mins of the episode created that cliff hanger feeling at the end of each episode, hence why i said you will be sleep deprived you basically forced to finish the anime in 1 day =P. The opening and ending of Anohana is pretty well done with the video not spoiling much about the anime, the OP and ED songs is one those songs where you find yourself going on youtube and listening to it loads. Well that was the case for me anyway.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9 \\n\\n\r\nEach member of the \"Super peach buster\" had their own difficulties while coping with the death of Menma's death which generally caused conflict between the main characters. What made this anime truly amazing was the relationship between the characters, it had everything, jealously? check, romance? check, fights? check. But what made it great was despite the disputes, they always end up making up with each other, even if they witness something as weird as someone cross dressing as Menma.... that was truly a \"What the fuck\" moment.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\n\\n\r\nAno Hana will do 3 things to you, it'll made you laugh, cry and very pissed off. Examples of where your going to be pissed off? When the characters ignorance or naivety reaches to the point that made you think that they were retarded for acting that way. I'm not even going to bother and say when your going to cry that list is way to long. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Anohana is an anime that fans of Slice of life, Drama genre much watch. It leaves an impression on you that after you finish watching it, you will remember it for a while and even rewatching some scenes would continue to make you just as emotional.",

            "content": "It is at times difficult to forget the blissful memories of the past when the present seems so distorted. AnoHana is about theses feelings which revolve around several friends as they face the past.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nAnoHana is a captivating story of several distant friends which slowly start to grow close again when Menma, a small girl as well as their friend, appears. She can only be seen by Jintan, one of her friends, as he embarks on trying to fulfill his friend\u2019s wish she had made so many years ago. Conflict arises between the friends as they start to doubt the existence of Menma\u2019s spirit andlater their true feelings are exposed. \\n\r\nA truly heart warming story about five friends who try to fulfill the wish of their close friend, Menma.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana has an appealing art style, with beautiful colours and scenery. If the story does not appeal to you the art may, for each character has a style unique to him or her. The scenery gave this anime a slightly different edge which just made it worth the watch even more.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music matched AnoHana\u2019s theme perfectly and you may easily find yourself listening the opening and closing song repeatedly. It caused many emotions to arise within myself and I constantly found myself pondering about the past while listening to the music within this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEach character within AnoHana has a different personality with different feelings and thoughts. Each character was developed well throughout the anime and the theme of the whole anime is portrayed through each one. You may find yourself understanding their feelings greatly. I found the characters relatable and enjoyed the slight humour which they gave the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime greatly, because it contained a great amount of emotion with an excellent theme. It will have points where you will find yourself weeping, but at the end of this anime warm feelings did arise.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana had a beautiful story with relatable characters and a strong plot. Many emotions were awoken while I watched this anime and I\u2019ll probably find myself watching it again someday soon.         \\n",

            "content": "Well... I never! I may as well just change my name to \"never\" cause this just took me by surprise. I could very well only recommend the first episode of AnoHana, because any fully equipped and functional human being would automatically feel like they owe it to themselves to watch the rest. I'll try breaking down this review as I've seen others do it this way:\r\nStory\r\nSo unique man... it's as if the creators studied the depths of human psychology and put together something that would really capture the hearts of men, and not only capture it but lock it in an underground prison under acastle of stone surrounded by a moat filled with alligators and like 2 kindra's. Menma the ghost girl who only our protagonist Jinta can see seems to me like the perfect plot (what's the opposite of hole?) \"pile of dirt\" allowing the viewer some intuition on the whole childhood trauma on which this is based on. Not to mention it adds this sense of creepiness like the silent phone calls thing or her communicating via the diary.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n+Flashbacks are so pretty and nostalgic\\n\r\n+Just look at those clouds\\n\\n\r\n-Nothing really gets exaggerated or break the barrier\\n\r\n-No ecchi at all (go ahead and click Not Helpful)\\n\r\n-Menma looks like she came out of a pool of flour\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n+Cicadas, my favorite thing to hear in any anime\\n\r\n+Awesome ending theme, which works very well as makes its way in a touching scene\\n\\n\r\n-Lame opening theme song, sounds like Kicell (hurray for knowing obscure Japanese bands)\\n\r\n-Piano can get overused *sometimes*\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n- Character development? lol the heck's that\\n\r\n- Manma is literally the best. As a matter of fact, I went out of my way in finding out how to add a favorite character on this site just for her. And I love those shots of her when she's looking into the camera and smiling full of life. \\n\r\n-Jinta's my homeboy. Favorite moment of his is when he walks to school on a hot day before Naruko's friends make fun of him.\\n\r\n-Yukiatsu reminds me of Norman from Psycho\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThe thing that swept me was not only the amount of sacrifice the characters are willing to go through for others, but them finding out the extent of their kindness, then they become happy so they sacrifice a little something in return like making egg  soup and they appreciate it which in turn makes them happier and its just one gigantic whirlpool of happiness. Then suddenly the whirlpool turns into a roller coaster and everything shifts downward in gusts of sadness revolving around death, love, guilt, etc. Aside from the magnificent conclusion, I'd say episode 8 was my favorite. The dinner I had around ep 9 was disgusting (my mother just had to add broccoli in the meat), but the kitcat ice cream made up for that, so I'm not complaining. I know my mind's definitely going to be immersed in thinking about this one when I go to bed. Goodnight reader, and goodbye Manma... I told you I'd find you!",

            "content": "Ano Hana is a tale of love and loss that I will never forget. I have a case of prosopagnosia which causes a headache when you experience hundreds and hundreds of faces in anime not to mention real life. However, Ano Hana is one of the few shows where I can clearly remember and recall the name of each character. Regardless of my own feelings, Ano Hana decided it wanted to grab a spot in my heart and stay there for a while: Two years and running at the moment. \r\nWhy has Ano Hana reached so many people and caught them like they have me?Well folks that is because this show knows how to link you to the characters. As mainly a drama, grabbing sympathy from the viewers is very important, and Ano Hana makes sure your tear ducts are ready to run at any moment. You are so deeply invested in the feelings of the characters that every individual action makes your heart ache.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, on the reverse side it is obviously possible that you are very apathetic. Well, you might enjoy the suffering the characters experience, but there isn't much to look forward to in terms of plot. To be completely honest Ano Hana is extremely simple in terms of plot. After many years of trauma, Menma's ghost returns to haunt her group of childhood friends; although to be specific only really Jintan. The super peace busters disbanded after experiencing the lose of such a close friend, and the members all split up and lead their own separate lives. Of course, due to Memna's persuasion Jintan is slowly forced to reassemble the gang together, in addition to trying to put her to rest.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has their certain regret about 'that day' that causes them to transform themselves into different people, and through reforging their bonds only will they heal themselves. In reality the idea is quite simple, but excellently executed. The characters feel like they could be real living people by acting like normal rational people. Jintan who once lead their group becomes a shut in after feeling extremely responsible for Menma's death. Anjou whom was insecure about her appearance starts hanging around with the pretty, although extremely rude, girls. Poppo escapes the town where Menma died by traveling around the world using work funds. He seems to hold a strange regret about that day, and sympathizes the most with Jintan seeing a ghost only he can see.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ano Hana is a story of growing up with your past haunting you. At some time funny, at other times cute, but at most times sad Ano Hana is a roller coaster ride of emotions. Although I think most people should be able to relate Ano Hana it is after all a romantic, slice of life drama. I am pretty opinionated since I only give a 10 to my favorite 10 shows, but I believe that reviews are nothing but ones opinion in the end, yes? If anything I hope I have displayed what you should expect to get out of this show, and why many others like me love Ano Hana.",

            "content": "Hands down, AnoHana has been my favorite anime of the Spring 2011 season, but like the members of the Super Peace Busters, I'm ready to move on with my life. At least ready to move on to the Summer 2011 season. This final post will be spoiler free, I promise!\r\nFirst some thoughts about the final episode, without any specifics. I thought it was remarkably well done overall. The show could only end in a limited number of ways. We've all seen a number of \"ghosts\" or \"spirits moving on\" type of movies and TV shows, so viewers know Menma's fate pretty much up front.\r\nBut thelarger question for me was, what would happen to the rest of the gang? Fairly early in this season finale we get the first part of the answer. The characters that make up the main group of friends have all dealt with their issues this season, but it's in this episode they come clean with how those issues connect to a certain ghost girl, and to each other.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the season, by way of this wonderful episode, it's clear the whole group is connected through a web that at one point had Menma as its center. While Menma of course is featured in much of this episode, for me, each character got more than enough screen time, including the brief poignant moments that Jintan's parents appear in.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing I thought was handled pretty well, was the overwhelming drama as the season wrapped up. I'm not completely against adding some melodrama, I  just don't like plots and dialogue to be too forced and twisted, just to  elicit specific emotions, aka my endless tears and fist slamming the ground all the while screaming, \"WHY?! WHY?!\"\\n\\n\r\nHeh. I did say 'pretty well' however, as I do have to admit that, at one point towards the end, I laughed at an inappropriate time, lol.  Although it wasn't as bad as that piece of crap Angel Beats. When Kanade  disappears and Otanashi gropes the air, I laughed uncontrollably. That  show was horrible. In contrast with that show, AnoHana set up a premise from the very first episode and stuck with it for the entire season. If the idea of AnoHana sounded good to you in April, it's hard for me to imagine you didn't love it this week.\\n\\n\r\nNot much else to harp on with Episode 11, without naming certain events, but I'll say that the finale delivered in much of the way the whole series as a whole did.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's all there is to say but I'll say more anyway. From the pre-season description, to the first couple opening scenes where Jintan and Menma are in his house, and right to the very end, it was a quality show that seemed to keep its promise to the viewers. The characters at times were obvious, as are real people, and times the characters were complex. But as showcased in the final episode, what was important in AnoHana was how the characters were with each other.\\n\\n\r\nCross dressing was important also and I know that I had said no spoilers, but after the credits, during the \"after\" montage, Tsuruko and Yukiatsu are wearing matching outfits. Ok, I made that up.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one thing I think people could be critical of, although I am not, could be the inconsistency of the \"Menma Rules.\" If you think they handled Menma's poltergeist abilities poorly (writing stuff, moving stuff), this final episode or perhaps even the last few could have pushed your faith.\\n\\n\r\nI could see that argument, but honestly, the show is about a ghost girl coming back to haunt her friends to fulfill a fated wish and over the course of the season, the show was wonderfully consistent in my opinion. I feel like a bigger person for having watched it. Bigger in that lately I've been exercising less and watching too much fucking anime.\\n\\n\r\nProduction wise, it was pretty flawless. The voice actors were seamless throughout the series and each week AnoHana gave an anime fan a nice respite not only from the fan service infestation, but all the stereotypical characters and character performances. People sounded like real people with real voices. The show looked beautiful and over the course of series fans got a real sense of space in the town. From the bland names (Rocky, Nokemon), to characters having to work hard for money, the show strove for realism, and for me, it succeeded.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I would remark on, is the short 11 episode run the show had, which seemed not too short and definitely not too long. If you haven't watched the show (you probably have if you're reading this) you should. At 11 episodes it's a quick watch, maybe even one of those marathon 1 day watches. Just be sure to have plenty of candy and tissues.\\n\\n\r\nI've just finished the show and wouldn't be able to give an accurate rating (something we've decided not to do here anyway), but there's no doubt this will go somewhere in my favorites list. While not what I would call an instant classic, AnoHana was by far, my favorite show of the season and will undoubtedly be one of my favorites this year.",

            "content": "I can best describe AnoHana as... angsty.  That's not to say it's bad, but that would certainly be the word for it.  It reaches for \"tragic\" or \"moving\" but it falls just a little bit short in a few places.  The product we've got can still be moving at times, but at other times it can fall flat thanks to melodrama, or be moving in the wrong way rather than how it wanted to be.\r\nThe story, as you'll get in the first episode, is that the ghost of our main character's dead friend has shown up and wants to get the bandback together to grant her wish.  The problems?  None of her other old friends can see her, and she doesn't actually remember what her wish is.  Now, that sounds like a decent setup, though one that does present a few challenges.  A story could go multiple ways from that.\\n\\n\r\nSo, how about the story?  Well, it's 11 episodes and it feels a little stretched out.  Throughout the episodes, there are at least three different wishes that we think Menma wants granted, and two major struggles to attempt to do so.  That's not bad, but I feel like there was about an episode of unneeded material in each of those two arcs.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to that, there are a few things that bug me in the main plot.  For instance, the rules of how ghosts function in this universe.  They're not bad rules, per say, but they're not well-presented, necessarily consistent, or addressed logically by the characters.  For instance, Menma can manipulate physical objects, a fact that we see fairly early on.  She can, for instance, do all the lifting, pouring, and detailed work necessary to make bread!  So it should be fairly trivial to prove her existence to someone who can't see her, because while there may be some barrier to noticing ghostly behavior, a patently hovering object would break it.  I'm so very glad that this isn't brought up or utilized until long after my patience for the \"Everyone thinks the character seeing the ghost is insane\" routine had worn out.  When we finally do get some spectral communication, we find out that she can write text in the diary she had while alive, but not anywhere else... because the pen doesn't work.  Why?  No reason.  Couldn't they use (or have used earlier) a Kokkuri-san style setup to divine ghostly presence or will?  She can bake, could she write text in spilled flour with her finger?  This wouldn't bother me so much if the drama for a big chunk of the show didn't hinge on it.  To draw comparison to another show, in Dusk Maiden of Amnesia the basic rules of ghost-hood are set down fairly early, and though things can change or be discovered over the course of the show, whenever a discovery is made, it's addressed and/or used as needs be.  In AnoHana, they just sort of ignore this to give the main character a harder time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the other point where the show has significant weaknesses.  Not that these are bad characters -- far from it.  I won't be cursing the names of Jintan and his friends the way I would characters that were really insulting in their thinly sketched or inconsistent natures, but the show leaves everything riding on these characters and they come just a little short of pulling that massive weight.  Their personal arcs can also suffer from the stretching.  By just a couple episodes in you get the basic dynamic that Anaru is in love with Jintan who couldn't get over Menma, and until the first time the show really tries to work out that arc, it plays pretty well.  The problem is that it's the first time of somewhere between three and five potentially game-ending moves, and the resolution we FINALLY get is a sort of \"maybe ever after\" that, while intellectually honest, doesn't seem like it's a good payoff for all the screen time we spent up to that point.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem character, though, is Menma.  Not who she is, really, but how she's used by the show.  Now, in her screen time (and there is a lot of it) she is fairly charming and likable, but she is the absolute center of this show's world, and it doesn't feel deserved.  Almost every facet of every other character comes back to Menma, which while not technically a wrong approach given the topic of the show does weaken all the other characters. All their desires and actions tie into Menma, both who she was and the fact that she died.  To draw another comparison, in Mekakucity Actors, Ayano Tateyama is a deceased character who is (or was) very important to the vast majority of the cast.  However, all those characters have their own lives, goals, and personas outside of their tie to Ayano, even if her life and death did leave a huge mark on them.  Further, we get flashbacks to see the building and dynamics of their relationships with each other and with her in a very natural fashion, that doesn't really rely on exposition.  In AnoHana, not only is Menma the center of the universe, but we don't exactly see why.  True, as I said she has a presence in the show and is a fairly charming and likable character, but the show relies on telling us, rather than showing us, how she connected with the other characters, utilizing one flashback to the day of her death in which she (most runs through at least) doesn't even get any meaningful lines.  If the past of the characters, and the construction of their bonds with Menma, had been as well done as at least the present setup of their bonds with each other and reactions to her demise, the show would have been much stronger for it.  More Super Peace Busters scenes, less Yukiatsu needlessly and slightly creepily coming on to Anaru, please.  This is especially troublesome because whether or not the characters have changed since \"back then\", and how, is a major theme of the show.  We're told sometimes \"Everybody is different\" and sometimes \"Nobody has changed at all\", and it's impossible to see or decide for ourselves if we don't actually know one of those two reference points.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, while I wish we'd known the child characters, I do like at least elements of each of the adult characters, and the fact that all five of them have different (though pretty much all maladaptive) reactions to their grief and loss: Isolation, Acting, Indulgence, Stoicism, or Reminiscence.  While it doesn't feel entirely justified just how much their lives have been lensed by Menma and her death, especially with their young starting age and the long time gap between her dying and rising as a ghost, if we take the show at its word the depiction is actually really good, and they do feel like a bunch of friends who really need some magical events to set them back on the right path, and start them healing.\\n\\n\r\nBriefly, the art is nice.  It's nothing spectacular, but AnoHana is a very low-key story that doesn't lend itself to astounding visuals, so I'll take it that the characters and scenes are all nice to look at.  The sound is more of a mixed bag.  The music is forgettable (but that's no real crime) while the voice acting is pretty darn good.  These are a set of voice actors who can, for the large part, really pull off the large number and variety of screaming and/or crying scenes the script needs them to indulge in, so even if said script doesn't lead you to understand the characters' pain, at least the voice actors can properly convey it... most of the time.  There are one or two scenes where things get just a little too melodramatic, especially at the (otherwise very good, to the point of redeeming some parts of the show I was less sure about) ending, but that's not too much nor too bad so I'd probably call it good overall.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: While AnoHana is by no means a bad show, it has some pointed weaknesses and, worse than that, not much if anything that stands out as noteworthy or spectacular.  I think I'd rather a more deeply flawed show that also had more powerful high points, rather than one that's a little on either side of average all around, and while I don't regret watching it, I won't be going back for another pass any time soon.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nWhenever anime focuses on characters who have to deal with the death of someone close or related to them, it's always focused on one or two specific individuals. We never really get to see a whole group of friends affected by something like this, until Anohana came along.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nThe story focuses on a group of kids who called themselves the Super Peace Busters, until one of their members Menma accidentally died. Now as teenagers Menma's ghost wishes for the team to come together once more.\r\nAnohana's story is incredible in some way, it's a story of redemption and getting past the guilt and regretfrom the loss of a friend. Seeing these group of characters coming miraculously together again even after they had all gone their own ways was a sight to behold and shows that a bond between friends never truly dies out.\\n\r\nEach character had some kind of regret from the event that happened, seeing them work this out and overcome it was emotionally enjoyable, it got even more interesting when the whole situation suddenly had their separate regrets connect together to form one big pentagon.\\n\r\nThe development of the characters was also impressive, they started out angrily repressing the issue and just letting it float by hoping that it'll go away. But as more members slowly came together to try and grant Menma's wish you can see the old spark reappear amongst them as new found determination started to kick in. I also liked how it kicked it up a notch at a certain point when most of the characters were really doing this for themselves and they eventually noticed what they had done was wrong, leading them to reveal their true feelings.\\n\r\nI think my only downside with the story is, I feel like 11 episodes just isn't enough for a story like this. After watching it the second time I realised just how quickly the show went and I was a little sad it didn't last longer, however the whole journey despite being short was definitely an emotional hurdle.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were done really well, they each stood out and had their own problems with the situation and the chemistry between them was handled brilliantly.\\n\r\nMeiko \"Menma\" Honma is the main female protagonist and the character that the story revolves around. Possibly one of the cutest female characters I've seen in anime, she can be childishly adorable yet childishly mature at the same time. She tends to be the key for Jinta to do anything as she mainly forces him to do stuff that he hasn't done for a long while. Most of the time she has a smile on her face and it rarely goes away, unless it's a really big tear jerk scene. With her being a ghost she tends to go on random adventures sometimes leading her to discover certain things that she probably shouldn't have discovered.\\n\r\nJinta is the main male protagonist, in some ways he is the most affected by Menma's death as he was the closet to her and is the only one who can see and interact with her ghost. He has hugely changed from being the leader of the group and has become a moody shut in who doesn't really want to do anything. However as he tries to grant Menma's wish alongside the others, he starts to become more determined and open with the others as he tries to put in all of his effort to make sure her wish is granted.\\n\r\nNaruko is another member of the group, who sparked the question that lead to the terrible events. Despite having a bit of an attitude towards Jinta, she is more concerned for the way he is living and how Menma's death has affected his personality. She has a crush on Jinta and always admired Menma because she was the closet to Jinta, she is also greatly concerned about the others too when it comes to Menma's death.\\n\r\nTetsudou is pretty much the joker of the group, definitely a funny character whenever Tetsudou is on screen everytime he makes a joke it's pretty damn hilarious making him standout from the other characters pretty well. Despite being a big guy he is actually very friendly, energetic and loyal especially towards Jinta. He blames himself the most for Menma's death mainly due to the fact he actually saw her death happen.\\n\r\nChiriko was the shy member of the group, now at an elite school she has become a serious, stoic yet cocky person making her a bit of an asshole sometimes as she tends to comment on some of the other characters actions. Despite being this way she still cared for her friends and was really devastated by Menma's death.\\n\r\nAtsumu is another member who has been greatly affected by Menma's death. He is a pretty big asshole as he always looks down upon Jinta and the way he has become, but he secretly loved Menma and has gone so far to look like her just to satisfy himself, so he is a bit of a creep really.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching this a second time and looking at the character designs I noticed it had a similar look to Toradora, which is no surprise since this had the same production staff as Toradora. The location being set in a fairly small town was pretty nice especially the wooded area where the groups base was which had some good attention to detail on the vegetation. Comparing the character designs in this to Toradora was quite surprising as the characters in Anohana had a certain roughness to them which kinda goes with the way they are feeling. I also liked the way Menma was designed, her dress despite being something she wears often felt like it was the presence of a ghost.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe op was actually very nice for an anime like this, the calm soft music showing each of the characters seeing their younger selves nicely fitted the scene and as we see them all come together the music really picks up as they get ready for action to grant Menma's wish.\\n\r\nThe ed was alright too, it had a tenderly, sweet feeling as we see the characters present and younger selves surrounded by flowers, hence the name of the show.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was done really well too, it always kicked in at the right moments for when an emotional scene appeared especially when it got to the climatic ending during the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nThere was a ton of drama in this show that really hit all the right marks. Each of the characters had some kind of guilt or regret eating at them and most of it was to do with the characters having certain feelings for each other, making this turn into a pretty big love pentagon while excluding Tetsudou because apparently nobody felt that way towards him. However I thought the whole love drama between everyone was handled really well and to me Anohana restored my faith in the use of Love triangles or shapes after the stupid, ridiculous one I saw in Your Lie in April.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was short, but sweet anime showing that even when you lose someone close to you, the spark of friendship never disappears fully.",

            "content": "This anime had so much potential but the net result was a bit disappointing. It's an original, rather than a manga adaptation, with the plot touching upon childhood grief, loss, friendships. \r\nVisuals:\r\nThe artwork is pretty and the animation, such as it is, is fluid. Character designs are great for the most part. Menma was extremely stylized moe, but that fits the plot, I suppose.\r\nAudio:\r\nThe music is OK. Doesn't kill the mood, doesn't blow you away. Didn't particularly notice the sound, ambient or otherwise. The voice acting, while great for the adolescents, was not good for the kids.\r\nThe meat:\r\nThe pacing was hit or miss, the dialogue,again, is a bit hit or miss, and character development, while it does happen, is a bit bash-or-block. Nothing happens and then they change suddenly. The anime does touch upon some fairly unique themes, which was welcome but wasn't necessarily perfectly executed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe central theme is definitely not a happy one. Nevertheless, I did *appreciate* large bits of the show. The issues (more on that later), however, detracted from that appreciation as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat it does well:\\n\r\n- Original story\\n\r\n- Relatively unique focus on friendships that wither with time, on loss and how children (and parents) deal with that\\n\r\n- Artwork\\n\r\n- A relatively smooth plot (with some bumps) flow towards an obvious end\\n\\n\r\nWhere it falls short:\\n\r\n- Menma, we are told, is a paragon of all virtues. She sees no development and either smiles or bawls (more on that later)\\n\r\n- The emotion on display, with *everyone* (and these are kids, the ones I know sure don't do that) leaking bucketful of tears and screaming pretty much every episode, was way too forced. Contrast this with a major death and how people deal with that in LotGH. A bit of subtlety would've gone a long way! Rather than tug at my heartstrings, these scenes only annoyed me\\n\r\n- I didn't buy the idea of a bunch of what 5 year olds yearning for unrequited love - they all do - and pining for their loved ones years down the line\\n\r\n- Menma can clearly interact with physical objects and she wants to communicate with her old gang. Yet it somehow takes her literally 2/3 of the show to stop wishing for it in their presence and do it!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a relatively original anime that could've been much more with a lighter and more careful touch",

            "content": "This is definitely one of those anime that everyone should see. The way Anohana shows the journey of pain, emotion, and healing that comes from losing a loved one at such a young age, makes it one the most unforgettable anime I have ever watched.  I\u2019ll start with an overall review and then go into detail (always spoiler free).\r\nOverall (9/10):\r\nAnohana is about a group of childhood friends who have long since grown apart after one of them, named Menma, dies as a child in an accident. For these characters, they couldn\u2019t attain a sense of closure from her death and each feels partially guiltyfor her loss. The main character, Jintan, starts seeing Menma, who has appeared from the dead to grant her final wish. The journey that results follows the characters as they cope with Menma\u2019s death, their regrets and emotions, and her return. What I really liked about this anime is that the characters were so real. It showed them as any other humans, who aren\u2019t perfect, but who just couldn\u2019t cope with the loss of their close friend. They can be selfish, hurt others, and hate the world because they feel they were wronged by it, but in the end, this anime is about these same characters finding peace and acceptance in their grief. All in all, this anime is one for the ages and definitely one to add to your watch list immediately. But keep a box of tissues handy you\u2019ll cry from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow for specifics:\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say the idea of someone coming back from the dead for unfinished business is an original idea, but the way Anohana incorporates Menma\u2019s return into the lives of her friends, and how it explores the individual traumas each character has had to live with since her loss is a fresh take on a familiar concept. In addition, the way the concept is presented is kept very simplistic and focuses entirely on the characters and their emotional journeys without too much emphasis on the supernatural aspect. This allowed us to really delve into the character development without having to worry about understanding the supernatural phenomena. Overall, the way the plot progresses and how the story unravels from start to finish, are amazing and I would recommend this anime to anyone who asked. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nEven though a lot of time has passed, and all the characters have grown up since the death of their friend, and even though they\u2019ve all drifted apart as a result of her loss, they\u2019re still stuck in the same day of her death, unable to move on, unable to reach any kind of closure, and unable to forgive themselves. In addition, they\u2019ve all changed to become very different people but the journey they take is about them coping with her death and facing their regrets and guilt when she returns. The character development is also handled very well in that the characters can\u2019t just face their traumas head on, just as any normal person couldn\u2019t, and the return of Menma causes them to relive their past regrets. They take baby steps to get the emotional closure they need and of course tensions rise and arguments ensue. In the end, the characters showed that healing from any kind of emotional trauma isn\u2019t a straight and easy path. The road curves and twists and you feel lost a lot without a sense of who you are or where you\u2019re going, but if you keep walking, and open up to the people who can share your trauma, then you\u2019ll get to the end of that road.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty simplistic and portrayed the atmosphere that the plot was trying to express. The character designs were indeed unique and added to the characters themselves and the scenery was beautiful and well-constructed to fit the themes of the story, but in general, the art wasn\u2019t too detailed or exemplary, nothing too impressive, so it has to be a solid 7.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were great and really fit the theme of the show. I personally really enjoyed both songs as they were calming but cute and still maintained the feel of the anime. The soundtrack during the episodes was also well done and complemented each scene appropriately. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Notes:\\n\\n\r\nI must admit this anime was really refreshing to watch. Anime nowadays have become overrun with the spunky, morally correct protag who everyone loves and alway saves the day, so it was nice to watch an anime that explored the characters as real people, with their moral flaws, insecurities, and regrets. A must-watch!",

            "content": "After watching some high scoring reviews for this anime, I thought i'd give it a try. I saw it fresh off of seeing Ano Natsu De Matteru, which I believe is by the same studio that made Anohana. If that is the case, then there is no need to discuss the animation for the show, which I think is on the same level as Ano Natsu, which is a good thing. The music here is also really nice too, with a catchy japanese indie rock opening reminiscent of the Pillows ,but way more mellow and a melodic piano-centric ending song that will definitelygive you the \"feels\" after hearing it used multiple times in the show's more dramatic scenes.\\n\\n\r\n  While Anohana fairs well in the animation and music departments, I found the plot to not be all that satisfying. While the concept of having these 5 friends who have grown up and become different from each other unite to fufill the wish of their dead friend sounds like a good storyline for a supernatural slice of life ala Kanon, I think the idea was ruined with the romance. And to be fair, there isn't really romance in Anohana ,but instead, drama surrounding the characters' desires to be in a relationship with someone else in the group. I think this is worse because you get all the drama surrounding romance, without any payoff, and its also out of place with the type of show Anohana established itself as in the beginning. It really deters from the character development and the bonding of the group, which is kind of the point of the show. \\n\\n\r\n  Speaking of character development, only 3 of the 6 characters are really all that likeable. You have the main protagonist who is the only one who can see Menma (the dead friend), who you root for because of his determination to fufill her wish. You have the tsundere character who has some feelings toward the main protagonist. You have the obsessive douchebag who just couldn't get over Menma dying. You have the obnoxious girl who is friends with the obsessive douchebag, and you have the comic relief character who fails to do his job in relieving the tension of the show and doesn't do much. I just found the show hard to enjoy when I only liked half the cast, and I kind of wished they'd just part ways because they had absolutely nothing in common besides their relationship with Menma. The relationships between the group (except for Anjou and Yadomi, and Yadomi and Menma) were so forced and overly-dramatized that I found myself hating nearly everyone until the last half of the last episode.\\n\\n\r\n  While this show definetly isn't the worth slice of life i've ever seen, I think that i'm giving it a pass due to my bias for moe characters and I actually found Yadomi's character relatable. But the show failed to fufill its major purpose, which was to have these five characters become friends at the end in a believable way. Instead, it uses flashbacks and nostalgia pills to give you a boring history lesson about these peoples' lives. The ending is one of those \"everything is fixed\" endings, and while it did manage to get a tear out of my eye (I hate myself for that), it was only because the show forces the emotion out of you, instead of naturally letting the viewer decide how to feel. I can't really go in depth with it, but it is definetly one of those \"love it\" or \"hate\" endings. DEFINETLY stay away from this show if you don't like slice of lives or melodramas in general, and only watch it if you're recommended it by a friend who just won't shut up about it, because at the very least it is tolerable and the first few episodes/ending are well done. \\n\\n",

The sound was good, story could be better. I feel that it was about a Menma's wish being granted, but I feel if they expanded on it, instead of 11 episodes, it would be better. There really isn't any character development whatsoever, because the main character and Yukiatsu are in love with the same character. But, nothing changes. It was okay, I feel it could have been much better is the story was elaborated on more sothen what it was, character development could have been better, but it was good, I guess.",

An overly saccharine show focusing on emotionally unstable teenagers that have apparently been wallowing in teen angst since elementary school. Yeah, it\u2019s sad, you\u2019re perfect little loli friend died in a tragic accident, but jesus christ, it\u2019s been years. You\u2019re high schoolers now. It wasn\u2019t even anyone\u2019s fault. Not to mention the loli ghost girl is the most annoying moe blog to date. She has absolutely no personality aside from \u201ccute\u201d and supposedly she\u2019s grown from when she was in elementary school but she still looks like a prepubescent child. like,it\u2019s totally gross seeing the main character crushing on this flat-chested little kid,who gets her jollies rubbin\u2019 her butt on said protagonist\u2019s junk. At the worst, shes a self-absorbed little chit who \u201cwants to make her friends happy\u201d by torturing them even further by her sudden ghostly appearance and making them fulfill her \u201clast wish\u201d, or at best, shes totally dense and doesn\u2019t realize the reason everyone is suffering is because of her. People say the finale was the most heart wrenching emotional moment, but in all honesty I\u2019ve felt more emotional in crack anime like Baka and Test than this forced out over dramatized piece of crap. If you want to watch something really heart-wrenching, I suggest you try something more like ToraDora or if you need something in the same vein as this, Kanon.",

            "content": "A.k.a = Anohana\r\nI'm going to get straight to the point here. This anime is absolute amazing, when I watched it back a couple months back, I had no idea what I was in for, all I knew was that it was about a group of friends, which I wrongly assumed revolved around stereotypical 'high school' romance sort of genre. The  story is much deeper than it may seem and it is definitely not your typical 'high school' romance.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI cannot go into details without simply spoiling the main plot so, I will make it brief. The story is simply about a group of teenagerstrying to forget and move on from a mysteriously, tragic event of their childhood summer vacation which has torn their friendship apart. The characters are quite ambiguous and only through watching the series will you find out the reason for it. The story has good pacing and will keep you wanting more. The events slowly catches up to the characters and they are force to make many hard decisions, the story does incredibly well in piecing everything together at the end.\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is great, all the characters are beautifully drawn. The characters are uniquely drawn, everything in the anime is very detailed and well drawn from their different hairstyles to their very facial expressions.The art is also very vibrant and colourful making the series especially enjoyable to watch.\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nVoice actors: All the voices were amazingly expressed, I can't imagine the talent and effort it would take to make the characters sound so sincere and realistic, from the crying to laughing, everything sounded so real, it made me feel like I was there in the anime. I especially loved the voice of Menma who sounded really kind and extremely cute.\\n\r\nSoundtrack: Anohana does not have a huge variety of soundtracks like many other shows of its genre, however the few that it has, it does well in accompanying the scenario, overall the music is lovely.\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters of this show is so incredibly made. Each and everyone stay true to their character until the end, their personalities are very unique. Even though they stay true to their character, you will find that they open up more as the series go on. The characters themselves are quite ambiguous at the start of the series but as the story progresses, the character's past is slowly revealed making them more relate-able and you will understand why they're the way they are. The character's dialogue is very well written as well, many of them have their own unique dialogue that they use throughout the series to express their feelings making them quite unique; One example would be Menma who frequently expresses her loves for everyone.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI absolutely loved this series, Anohana has to be among some of the top 'feels' anime which is probably true given the sheer amount of reviews stating how it will make you cry as their first sentence. There is nothing not to love about this series, the characters are great, voice acting is incredible and very unique, setting is beautifully set out, plot is well put together and it is definitely one of the most tear-jerking shows out there. This was one of the closest shows to making me cry, I had watery eyes....don't judge me...This may not sound like much for someone like me but I will say that I did not cry once or felt feel as emotional as I did in Clannad: Afterstory, Angel Beats, Kanon etc (I can go on foreverrr). I still get sad thinking about certain scenes in this anime. Personally the main thing that I find most tragic is the idea of 'never can be', things that can happen again no matter how much you try to change things. Better to have loved someone than to have never loved at all. Agree?\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nYou're probably getting tired of me saying how much I love this show so I'll say it again, I loved this show so much!! Must watch even if you're not particularly interested in 'romance/tragedy'. I would've loved to have gone in the details of different scenes which I found to be absolutely 'menmarable', I will refrain from doing so for the sake of no spoilers. I think it's safe to say that 'yes', I do highly recommend this anime. Go watch it! ^\\n\\n",

So damn sad that after you are done watching it you look at your blank screen, try to process what just happened, jump into your bed, just to think about everything that occured in the course of the last night because you could not go to sleep, as the story was just so damn ...gripping. \r\nThat's right, I watched Ano Hana in one go without actually planing it. People told me stuff like \"get ready for the feels\" or \"tears will be shed\" so I was prepared... Well so ithought. I won't have to go over the story so here my rating + thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nNot going to summaries as it is against the guidelines. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWas really,really well fitting. I loved it and it was just wonderful to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI am listening to the OST \"Last train home\" right now as I like to listen to them while I am writing reviews. Every musical piece in Ano Hana was just perfect. Ending and Opening and all the OSTs that were made to fit for each character. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThey were all individuals. What I mean by it is, that they seemed as if they were real, as if they would have really lived through all these struggles with their friend gone. That's something that not all Anime Characters do. You don't often find such real individuals that you can believe. This realness is something that Ano Hana is able to make the Viewers feel. And that's why it is so outstanding. You get emotionaly attached because you can belive in all these single events that take place because they seem so real. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nAno Hana was beautiful. The story, the characters, how they developed. I was completely gone after the Ending. That was something completely new to me. My emotions were playing roller-coaster that time and I did not know how to handle it. And all this was part of the enjoyment. It made me realize how I \"connected\" to this story. I certainly did enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nAs I said, it was an emotional roller-coaster. In a mere five hours I went from happieness to abysmal sadness up and down. It gripped me and did not let go until the very end. \\n\r\n\"\\n",

Maybe I was saving it because it looked to be too far out of my comfort zone, maybe I didn't want something emotional, I don't know but it sure hit home when I watched it. I had just had a lifelong friend I called brother sent to the hospital for heart failure...in another country. Then I watched Anohana. I could only take 2 or 3 episodes at a time tops. I never outright sobbed but I was filled with both joy and agony in a way Iwill never forget. I am sure that the influence of this show inspired me to chose to tough it out when I wen't to go buy pizza and rootbeer \"for him\" because its what we would have done if we were together. I wanted to ball my eyes out but I didn't, he wasn't gone after all, I shouldn't act like he was. Why is all of this in my view? Because this is what Anime is, this is what shows like Anohana are. They are shows that make you look at your life and want to be a better person, they help you understand whats happening and give you hope when your alone. Now, I am a person of a particularly strong faith so I don't want you to think I'm replacing God with Japanese morality. I simply want to assert the kind of beautiful impact such well crafted media can have on someone who already had so much to hope on. Please watch this show, just for you, not because reviews told you so. Watch it to reflect on who you are and what you have become, watch it to grow and to look on a bright future with a smile, regardless of what is waiting for you.",

If you like a tear-jerking drama, this is your best bet. \r\nThe basic premise of the show : Girl named Menma suffers tragic death, 5 of her friends distance themselves as time goes on, Menma comes back as a ghost that can only be seen by the protagonist Jinta, Menma reminds Jinta of a childhood wish she wanted to be fulfilled and Jinta sets off to try and fullfill that wish bringing the other 4 childhood friends with him. \r\nThe story is amazing - it's so realistic and dramatic that you can literally feel the pain and grievanceseach character is going through. The constant flashbacks are very touching and provide a deeper look into each others lives. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I love most about this anime are the characters : they are so unique in their own way and as you watch episode by episode you can see how drastically Menma's death has affected each and everyone one of them. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty good also. If you watch each episode you'll notice how amazing the opening and ending songs fit the situation especially episode 8, one of the most touching endings I've ever seen in any episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverally, I'm really enjoying this anime and I can't wait for the next episode (1 week is too long >.",

But now, he and all of his childhood friends has changed. They're not same as before, when they still playing together, grief together, smile and laugh together. Jintan try to unite his friends and together make their friendship back .\r\nThe story itself is pretty usual, nothing really special about the plot but I really like the way they present it. It's really unique the story is really naturaland  represent the meaning of life is, there's no forced conflicts and that what I like in here. The story is flows, but it grows in you. And watching this makes you feel that you have become the \"actor\" in the story than the viewer, and it just makes you feeling like back to your childhood life.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, I love that lighting. And also, the OP and ED is nice. Overall, the art and sound is good and fit to the story.\\n\\n\r\nAh, now characters, part that I really like in here. When everyone is developed and well.. changed. Jintan become more \"open\" and have more brighten view of the future. Yukiatsu become more straightforward to himself and others, and from what I see, he is the character who changed more than other. He seems to be more happier. Anjou has throw away her jealously and more admiring others. Poppo has become more straightforward. He can more \"open\" to his feelings to others and of course.. Menma.\\n\\n\r\nAno Hana is of course, not an ordinary anime. It's a true masterpiece. It's not easy to find a slice of life anime that has a beautiful drama in it. It gives you hearwarming feels, but gives you sad story as well.",

            "content": "Coming to terms with the past is never easy. Somethings still manage to influence you even years after they happened and, no matter how much you try, it stays with you for a while. Naturally, it is possible to come to terms with the past and that is what Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai., AnoHana for short, is about.\r\nAno Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai. (We Still Don't Know the Name of the Flower We Saw That Day.) was released in 2011 and produced by A-1 Pictures. It is an original slice-of-life drama with supernaturalelements anime directed by Tatsuyuki Nagai, who most notably directed Toradora!.\\n\\n\r\nAnoHana has a strange premise. While at first glance it seems perfectly happy, further analysis reveals just how unusually depressive it really is. There is a tone of nostalgia and melancholy that surrounds the story and dominates it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is further explored as the story develops. Every decision made and progress realized reinforces the idea that the past defines the present and future, until, much like the message conveyed, this theme is broken by the end.\\n\\n\r\nThat is the beauty of it. There is a complete synergy between the story and the way its themes are developed. A lot of people, including some of the people who recommended this anime to me, said that they cried during the last episode, and the way its theme is developed is a big part of that. The theme by itself would have been terribly said, but the way the story explores it makes it even more special.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more unusual elements of AnoHana is the heavy presence of flashbacks and the way they are developed. Much like real life, thewse flashbacks seem more like memories, heavily romanticised and part of a past half-forgotten. This is noe of the many hints of realism the series present.\\n\\n\r\nI do have one criticism to it, sadly. The mystery part of it din't entice me just as much. The whole mystery is a promise, but that wasn't a very enticing mistery. It was needed, however, for the story to move. One of the reasons for my lack of appreciation for the mystery was that the character interactions eclipsed it completely.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters physically grow up, they still thinks of themselves as kids that haven't really changed that much during the years. And that is, to me, a great representation of the way teenagers actually think. Also, some of them even have various \"personas\" depending on where they are, which also is something quite common during teenage years and life as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nBut more than just the realism, the 6 main characters of AnoHana are vastly different from most of other characters in slice-of-life. Their personalities are (mostly) devoid of clich\u00e9s, take for instance Poppo, a very unusual drop-out. After dropping out, he didn't just stay shut in his home, he started working and saved up the money to explore the world. The reason for that is beautifully explored, by the way.\\n\\n\r\nThey have a surprising amount of depth explored during the eleven-episodes-long anime, which is a feat in itself. The way this was accomplished was by keeping the filler to a minimum and elevating the meaningful interactions to a maximum. But do not mistake this for character development. They hardly change during the course of the story. Following this line of thought, a more fitting term for it is character reveal. Rather than evolving, the characters, with time, start showing what they have been thinking all along.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design and its changes between early childhood and the teenage years is something of note. More often than not, the kid version of the characters is just a mini-version of their older design, but in AnoHana this is different. There is a huge amount of attention of detail that is evident by the changes between the designs. The artists considered not only the growth of the characters, but also their situation. Jintan became socially anxious and, as such, stopped bothering to cut his hair. Poppo is always doing manual work, which means he is tan. The list goes one.\\n\\n\r\nThe general art is not as impressive. It is fairly good, just not jaw dropping.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is heavily melodic and nostalgic, which is a perfect fit for the story. Both the OP and the ED are works of art. The first is pop-ish and evokes the nostalgia of the days already past, while the second is much calmer, but much more tragic.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is brilliant. It realizes what every voice acting should strive for: complementing the story and enhancing by giving more layers. All of the 6 main actors do spectacular jobs.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who lost friends (it wasn't nearly as tragic as this though, he just had to move), I immediately related to the characters and their worries of how they could change the past. I wouldn't say I enjoyed AnoHana, but I loved it for what it was.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend it to people who regret parts of the past and want to change it, it will give you something to think about. Lovers of dramatic slice-of-life will find a lot to like in it, also. For anyone else, just keep in mind what it is and you will probably be immersed by its realism.\\n\\n",

I watched thesub and i feel like all the voice actors played there characters fantastically. I cant say much more about the art style bar that it is 100% beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was very well paced, i know i said it could have been done in like 3 or 4 episodes instead of 11. The only reason i say this, is because if you missed the hook and you didn't really care about the characters and how the show developed them, id understand if you found it boring. The show itself isnt made to be full of action but the story is almost inspiring, and really draws on the viewers emotional attachment to the characters, i mean its really hard not to find yourself caring about this little group of friends. I feel if you look into this group of 5 friends you will find yourself and really be able to relate to them and what there going though. Also just to highlight it, this type of story is unique (maybe just to me) i havnt seen anything like it before but if i am honest i normally steer away from the slice of life drama shows. \\n\\n\r\nId like to give special mention to the main male character, Yadomi, Jinta without giving to much away, he is relate-able to really all people, he really highlights how weak people can be when faced with the big decisions he is faced with. \\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it up, Should you watch this show? before i answer that i will say that i am guy i normally would run a mile from a show that was so based on emotions and drama but once the hook was there i simply had to finish the show. So i would 100% recommend you give this show a try to just relax and get sucked in.\\n\\n\r\nHope my review was helpful \\n\r\n~ Murphy  \\n",

When he was younger, he had five friends: Poppo, Yukiatsu, Anaru, Tsurumi, and Menma, togetherthey were The Super Peace Busters and Jintan was their awesome leader. Until Menma died. As time progressed, they grew apart, each blaming themselves for the death of Menma, whom they all loved. They changed, and now don't even talk to each other. Except for Jintan, who is the only on who can see Menma's ghost. Menma came back to have her wish granted, except she doesn't know what it is. The only thing she knows is that everyone has to be together for it to come true. Jintan, annoyed by Menma, must get the group back together. Jintan faces many trials and bumps on the road trying to get his friends back together. He learns not only the true feelings of all his friends, but what Menma actually means to him. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is a very touching one and while it does take the ocassional dark turn, it is ripe with comedy, romance, emotion and makes for a very good romcom.",

            "content": "(Warning: may contain spoilers)\r\nThe reason I started watching AnoHana is simple - I wanted to see what the hype was all about. I had seen all over the internet how it had made people cry and it was oh-so-awesome but I was doubtful of it being that good. \r\nBut I did watch it and, I\u2019ll be honest, I cried. It was really sad but a great anime. In the end, I\u2019m glad I watched it. If you like a good tear-jerker with a splash of comedy, then you should definitely try this one.\r\nStory \u2013 This anime is about a group of friends who grow apartafter their friend dies in tragic accident. Years later you see Jinta \u201cJintan\u201d Yadomi, the former leader of their group, has become a recluse who doesn\u2019t go to school and is only interested in playing video games all day. When he starts seeing his old friend Meiko \u201cMenma\u201d Honma, he believes the summer heat has got to him - Menma died on that day many years ago. With others being unable to see her, he convinces himself that it\u2019s just his imagination and attempts to move on. But Menma is persistent about having her wish fulfilled. So Jintan must reconcile with all his old friends and together find out what Menma\u2019s wish was. \\n\r\nI quite enjoyed how as kids they gave each other nicknames. So there was Jinta \u201cJintan\u201d Yadomi, Meiko \u201cMenma\u201d Honma, Naruko \u201cAnaru\u201d Anjou, Tetsudo \u201cPoppo\u201d Hisakawa, Atsumu \u201cYukiatsu\u201d Matsuyuki and Chiriko \u201cTsuruko\u201d Tsurumi. For the most part, their nicknames were made by taking a part of their first name and a part of their last name and joining them together, something I thought was rather adorable.\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Ano Hana shows you the different ways in which people try to deal with the loss of a loved one.\\n\r\nThe story, in my opinion was dealt with tactfully and was well developed. It was easy to follow and as the series progressed, I found myself being drawn more and more into it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 You were able to see the characters evolve throughout the story, despite there being only 11 episodes to this anime. The characters had diverse and varied personalities and so the viewer has a lot of chances to relate to a character. As the show progressed, you saw how Menma\u2019s death affected each of them and how they dealt with it.\\n\r\nAt first I liked some characters more than others and thought some, like Yukiatsu, were horrible. But by the end I saw him in a different light and, though he wasn\u2019t my favourite character, I felt like I could understand him.\\n\r\nMenma herself was interesting. Before I watched Ano Hana I had heard she was a really annoying character but personally, I disagree. Since she died when she was very young, it made sense that she would still be rather childish despite having an older body.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 The artwork in Ano Hana was well done, with lots of scenery shots and each character having unique characteristics. Occasionally the animation would look a bit \u201coff\u201d, but nothing too noticeable that would take you out of the show. The animation was amazing in both the opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\nMusic \u2013 The music for this show was one of the best I\u2019ve heard so far. The opening and ending songs both are fantastic, so much so that I actually listen to them both through when usually I would skip them in most shows. They really give the right feel for the show.\\n\r\nThe background music was great too, and even sound effects were well executed (like with the use of chirping cicadas).\\n\\n\r\nConclusion \u2013 Overall, I loved this anime! It made me laugh and made me cry \u2013 especially at the end. And I mean real crying, not just sniffles. It is definitely worth watching all the way through as it only gets better as it goes on. \\n",

            "content": "This anime is a small miracle. Nothing short of it.\r\nHow comes?\r\nThe perfect balance.\r\nThe art is simply outstanding: from the blue colors of Menma's eyes to the last brick of the bridge, everything is just perfect. There's a grace in the composition I haven't found anywhere else.\r\nThe music would well be worth a cd on its own: both the opening and ending fit the mood of every episode like a glove. It's exactly as it should be: bittersweet, but with a positive outlook.\r\nHowever, the strong point of this anime is not really either art or music, but rather the narration and the story.\r\nA handbook guide forevery future anime, in my opinion: not only fillerless (that might sound obvious with 11 episodes, but trust me, it isn't), but as paced as a carefully calibrated engine. From the light moments to the most touching ones, not once you're estranged from the narrating pace. Not once could I think of a better way of telling the same events, not once.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is also a work of art in itself, probably an even better one than the narration: touching, but not melodramatic; happy, but not careless. It was truly touching, and I stress the \"truly\".\\n\r\nI feel extremely satisfied from learning of it: I wish more people would know it.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: AnoHana it's one the many small yet huge accomplishments of humanity; those achievements that do not roar at the passing of time, but inexorably change everyone that comes in contact with it. \\n\r\nAnd I feel it changes for the better.",

            "content": "Oh my god... Ano Hi Mata Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai... Quite a long name isn't it? But that's beside the point. In my opinion, this show is one of the best animes in the entire existence of all anime. This show is one of the few shows that can really move one from extreme sadness to extreme happiness to extreme anger to extreme sympathy all within the course of twenty minutes. If you haven't seen this show you need to immediately... Right now, go; I\u2019ll wait... stop reading this unless you don't believe me and go watch it..............Still here? FINE! I'lljust have to prove to you that this show is absolutely amazing. HERE WE GO!\\n\r\nStory-9/10\\n\r\n\tThe story of this anime is absolutely spectacular and if you have even part of a heart you will cry like a baby by the end of it. The story begins with Yadomi Jinta, a teenage boy who has built up reclusive tendencies over his teenage life. One day, an old friend from his childhood, Honma Meiko, appears before his eyes and acts as if they had never left each other. There one problem with this however, Honma Meiko died in an accident years ago. Jinta is the only one who can see the \u201cghost\u201d of Meiko so he can\u2019t help but think he is hallucinating or that Meiko has come to haunt him.  Over the course of 11 episodes Jinta and his other friends from his childhood bond back together to face the tragedy that had happened years ago and to figure out why Honma Meiko has appeared before Jinta after so many years. The story, although not super original is still very interesting and nearly perfect in its presentation. Everything about the presentation of this story is fantastic; the comedy, the feeling, the plot twists, the people, the pacing, everything. Even for such a small season size of 11 episodes it somehow creates a magical story that makes you laugh, cry, smile, grit your teeth, and throw pillows at walls(or maybe the pillow thing was just me). The dialogue is absolutely stellar and I can\u2019t think of any animes off the top of my head that have better and more meaningful dialogue. The story even adds some imagery/metaphors with some of the items presented in story. One example of this is Honma\u2019s bare feet and the sandals shown in scenes referring to her death. Try and look for this if you choose to watch it as I\u2019m sure you will appreciate it. The story is very connectable to as well because it really shows off the realistic trauma and guilt one might feel after a tragedy. The gradual estrangement of Jinta and his other childhood friends is also perfectly realistic and I felt for them every step of the way. It really makes you think of the friends or family you may have become distant with and any anime that can connect to your own situations in such a way really has something good about its story. If there was anything that I had an issue with in the story it was something small like a lack of realism in a situation between characters (one being minor and another being kind of big) or a question about a detail of the story that wasn\u2019t very important whatsoever. These were extremely minor setbacks and didn\u2019t hinder my judgment of the story until after I had finished watching; overall fantastic story.\\n\r\nArt- 10/10\\n\r\n\tHoly mother of god the art; there really isn\u2019t anything to critique about the animation and images here. The drawings and style are just spectacular with plenty of colors that really please the eyes, just like how soothing, warm, hot chocolate during winter time pleases the body. The animations themselves are spectacularly done and so fluid that it\u2019s exactly like real body movements. There are also plenty of chances for animations and they take all those chances and play with them and just make them awesome. The only extremely minor thing that I can critique is that since this isn\u2019t an action anime or anything, there is no intense fighting scene that requires extreme amounts of experience and time to make look good. Of course this isn\u2019t really a problem because an anime like this doesn\u2019t need a scene like that but I\u2019m simply saying that they never had to do something so difficult so it\u2019s not as impressive as it could be (although still impressive). If this is a stupid critique whatever, sue me; you may be right anyway. Since this is such a silly critique it will not affect the score, just know that there isn\u2019t anything in the animation that is ridiculously intense and difficult. Who knows, maybe the fights scenes aren\u2019t even as hard as I think they are and I\u2019m just stupid.\\n\r\nSound- 9.5/10\\n\r\n\tLike in my Beck Review I will split the sound section into 2 parts: Voice Acting and Music\\n\r\nVoice Acting -10/10\\n\r\n\tOh my god. Please if anyone can find better voice actors I want you to link me because it must be quite a performance. All of the Japanese voice actors perfectly fit all of the characters and it just works so perfectly. If a character is feeling upset then the voice actor is able to perfectly portray this and the same goes for all the emotions. It\u2019s just so good I have nothing more to say about it other than it being perfect.\\n\r\nMusic -9/10\\n\r\n\tThe music of this show is great as well. The OP of the show is pretty good and although not my favorite song or anything fits the series perfectly. The ED also fits the show perfectly but I just personally wouldn\u2019t listen to it outside of watching the series. The soundtrack during the show itself is spectacularly written and really helps some of the emotions in the scenes. It\u2019s a very calming and emotional soundtrack overall. There are also plenty of times where music is playing so there is never a long string of just dialogue. My only complaints are that I don\u2019t really like the ending song that much and that the music used in the show itself is typically the two or three songs used over and over. There is more than two or three songs used of course but they do use two or three of them a lot. Even then, the two or three songs used a lot are good with very nice piano and string work but other than that there isn\u2019t a lot of instrumentation. Either way all of the music in the show is very good and works perfectly fine for what the show calls for. No big complaints from me.\\n\r\nCharacters- 9.5/10\\n\r\n\tI kind of fear I will get a lot of flak for giving the characters such a high score because I can see why people might hate the characters in this anime. There are many times in the anime where I believe some of the characters are perfectly dislikable. However, it is my belief that the reason for this is not because they are bad characters but rather that they are meant to be hated. One of the characters that this is particularly apparent in is the smart but pompous friend Matsuyuki. There will be a point in the series where you could arguably hate almost every main character but that is not because they are bad characters per se. The reasons for hating the characters are simply because of the actions that these characters take. All of the main characters not including Meiko herself are plagued with the guilt of Meiko\u2019s death as well as the events that took place leading up to her death. These feelings of guilt and confliction are the real reasons why the characters of the story sometimes make some stupid or intense decisions that might make someone watching just go \u201cOH SHIT!\u201d If you ever hate a character in the course of watching this anime, it\u2019s not because they are a bad character, it is simply because their mental state is so messed up that they are a dislikable character; in essence they are meant to be hated according to their situation and the story progression(kind of like how I thought the characters in School Days were meant to be hated..... but I probably shouldn\u2019t mention School Days because...... you know......ya....) This is rather realistic from my view because people with this guilt when such a tragedy happens are bound to make some stupid decisions and for this reason, I sympathized with all the characters (While also throwing pillows at my wall and shouting the F word at the top of my lungs). The fact that these characters have all of this guilt and shame is also a great outlet for character development which works very nicely even for an 11 episode series. On the bright side, by the end the characters are all redeemed to be positive, however this is one of my issues with the characters because the way they are redeemed feels a little sudden and I\u2019m not sure they would suddenly act all chivalrous if they were really all so rotten if this were a real life situation (excluding the whole supernatural part, the situation is totally realistic). The whole \u201csuddenly unhateable characters\u201d thing applies to the unrealistic situations between characters section that I mentioned in the story section. Other than this and one more unrealistic situation of characters including Jinta\u2019s friend Anjou and some rumors that get spread around about her(you\u2019ll know it when you see it) the characters are perfectly realistic and awesome. You can really feel and connect with all of the main and side characters and they really are just awesome.\\n\r\nEnjoyment -10/10\\n\r\n\tClearly I enjoyed this series a lot. This series took me on a huge roller coaster ride of feelings that just never seemed to end. All within the course of 11 episodes I learned to connect with all the characters in many ways and just enjoyed all the humor and all of the drama that took place throughout the series. This just has to be one of my personal favorites of all time.\\n\r\nOverall -9.5/10\\n\r\n\tThis show is absolutely amazing. I probably seem like a broken record by now with my praise but it really is and everyone with even a speck of an interest for these types of anime should watch this ASAP. From the beautiful dialogue to the beautiful art to the beautiful music to the beautiful everything about this series, you will go on quite an emotional rollercoaster if you watch this. I give Anohana an amazing 9.5 out of 10. Now that I\u2019m done freaking out about how awesome it is, GO WATCH IT!\\n",

            "content": "Many dramatic animes fail to keep me interested because they are slow paced or uneventful, but this jem turned out to be an engaging surprise. I found it to be so well executed that it was a real pleasure to watch all along. \u201cWe Still Don\u2019t Know the Name of the Flower We Saw That Day\u201d tells the poignant story of a group a teenagers who deal with the death of a dear friend.\r\nStory 8/10\r\n+ It is a very touching tale, which let me crying my eyes out, yet it is also soothing, because you learn to grow up and let go along with thecharacters. The strength of the series really lies in the way the story unfolds pieces by pieces, revealing what happened, what\u2019s happening and what will happen in the future. They are many questions raised and the process of answering them takes the viewer on board the character\u2019s healing process.\\n\r\n- I thought there were a few plot flaws, although it did not alter the strong feelings channeled by the story. Here\u2019s a little exercise: raise your hand if you met the love of your life at age 6. You might say it happens to some lucky people, but in this case, it happened to every single character! Also, I feel bad for the poor kids only getting closure 10 years after the death of their friend. It would have made more sense to me if the death was a relatively recent incident.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\n+ The art is easy on the eyes, with pretty character design, colors that properly set the mood and overall smooth animation. It feels like a beautifully illustrated children book, which perfectly suits the theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\n+ The characters are lovable, and they ring true. There is a refreshing diversity of characters, coming from different places in their lives, due to the fact that they all went their separate ways after Menma\u2019s death. They go (or don\u2019t go) to different high schools and have different lifestyles reflecting what they found to be their own way of coping with Menma\u2019s death. The series also does a great job in exposing each character\u2019s motives. You really get them.\\n\r\n- The ghost girl is the only one who suffers from poor characterisation. She is an annoying stereotypical anime girl, and she still looks/acts like she\u2019s 6 years old, even though she is said to be the grown-up version of herself. But then again, she is a ghost, so it is unclear in what parts she is memories, imagination or her real would-be 16 year-old self. Still, the result is a rather unimaginative character whom everyone ought to be madly in love with.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line:\\n\r\n+ The pacing is excellent, the series benefiting from the fact that the story was created as an original anime project. \\n\r\n+ The relationships between the characters are well fleshed out, and through reconnecting with their old friends, they manage to find their old selves.\\n\r\n+ Beautiful anime, both visually and emotionally.\\n\r\n- Annoying ghost character sporting true romantic feelings at the age of 6.\\n\r\n(I give this series an 8. It would definitely be a nine if it wasn\u2019t for this tiny negative point.)\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea, from my review you might think that I saw a lot of negative in this series, but whatever shortcomings this anime has, it more than makes up for it by successfully conveying powerful conflicts as well as raw emotions. If you\u2019re in the mood for some heart wrenching, I urge you to watch this series. In the end, you\u2019ll be screaming along the members of the Super Peace Busters.",

            "content": "AnoHana - that flower... But is it really a flower between good tearjerkers? Is it enough to be given a name of one of the best tearjerkers ever created? In this review... But when I'll throw bad words at this one will it still be a review? Neverthless, soon, you'll have an opportunity to read why AnoHana isn't actually a flower (or maybe it is, but just a withered one?) - don't even make yourself a cup of your favourite tea, because it's not going to be long. \r\nDon't even think I can describe this without spoilers. As the flower tries to be widely open,I have to show you every petal of it.\\n\\n\r\nPetal #1: Story - 2 (Dreadful)\\n\\n\r\nSo, story is just about a bunch of friends that after years got to know each other once more. As their old friend died a long time ago, they're really sad over it and they're still reminding themselves of her - that's completely fine. Keep in mind though, that it's not normal to dress and act as a dead friend just to get attention of your friends. And it's getting worse so on. Also, it gets painfully complicated. As the story tries to be awfully ambitious, it gets 2 from me. If it were completely bad, I'd probably give it a decent 1. \\n\r\nThis petal is probably quite much withered.\\n\\n\r\nPetal #2: Art - 3 (Poor)\\n\\n\r\nArt is probably the best thing in this anime. I think that \"Poor\" is a bad word to describe it, yet I don't think like it deserves a higher score, lower neither. The worst thing about it it doesn't fit the whole idea of the series. As it's a drama, the artstyle should've been at least more serious. Yet, it's a very good artstyle when it comes to comedy and slice of life. The best thing about the way how it's actually drawn is that it's quite nice and it fits some comedy/slice of life scenes.\\n\r\nThis petal isn't that withered, but it's not a OK one.\\n\\n\r\nPetal #3: Sound - 2 (Dreadful)\\n\\n\r\nIts opening and ending were actually good, they fit AnoHana quite well. And that's the best thing about that. Due to that this petal is way more beautiful than the other ones.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack made it way worse though. As it had some nice songs (e.g. the song which played when they were next to the tree in the end), none of them besides this one was actually unforgettable - what's more - they were forgettable as hell, as they didn't fit the whole series. \\n\r\nThe fact the soundtrack was quite bad definetely made the petal uglier.\\n\\n\r\nPetal #4: Character - 1 (Pathetic)\\n\\n\r\nThe worst characters I've seen. We've got:\\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3cJinta, who's in love with a ghost\\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3cMenma, the ghost, the dead friend that acts like she's alive\\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3cAnjou, for a while seen as a prostitute, no wonder...\\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3cTetsudou, the childish dude\\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3cChiriko, probably the only normal person from the series...\\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3cMatsuyuki, the guy that wants your attention so much that he's going to dress up as your dead friend just to get it\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to make friends with one of them irl, I'd rather kill myself. Seriously, they were all so weird I had no chance to be focused on what it's actually on the screen. Of course, I was just kidding, yet I think none of them deserves attention, even if they'd try to dress up as a dead friends of mine...\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't even a petal.\\n\\n\r\nPetal #4: Enjoyment - 1 (Pathetic)\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy it. Awfully ambitious story, average art, easily forgettable soundtrack, the worst characters I could've imagined. If you haven't watched any tearjerkers before, you may think it's good. But it's not. As the Clannad After Story had the best story ever, good art, the one of the most unforgettable soundtracks ever, great and well-fitting to the genres characters, great enjoyment and a big overall in general, it can't be compared to it (but many people still make that mistake...). Look, AnoHana studio. You've done it so badly. If the story wasn't that childish, the art was more serious, the soundtrack was more serious than it actually is, the characters weren't that childish in their behaviours, the enjoyment could've been much higher, and so the rest of the ratings. Yet, you made a rubbish bin when it comes to a comparision to another tearjerkers.\\n\\n\r\nHow can this be a petal?\\n\\n\r\nThat flower: Overall - 1 (COMPLETELY PATHETIC)\\n\\n\r\nThe series were awful, yet if you haven't watched real masterpiece tearjerkers such as Clannad After Story or Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, you may think it's actually good. I didn't like it while watching, yet the final events made me cry a bit and I thought it's amazing and it's a goddamn masterpiece. No, it's not. Don't even attempt to watch it if you think it's comparable to Clannad After Story, Little Busters Refrain or mentioned Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. No. Please. Don't do it to yourself. You'll just hurt yourself. If you really want to watch a good tearjerker similar to AnoHana, go for Little Busters. The first season isn't too promising, yet Refrain is the most underrated tearjerker ever. I wonder how it isn't higher in the overall ranking than AnoHana. It's probably the most underrated anime from Key. Truust me, it's a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for your attention. Hope I caught it because\\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3cit was a good review\\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3cyou wanted a honest look at the series\\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3cI wasn't a cosplayer of Menma\\n\r\n\ud83c\udf3cyou just wanted to read a review that is similar to opinion of yours.",

Whether its grief, pain, guilt or depression to name a few, death is such a foreign and distant concept that you'll only feel the profoundness after you experienced it. AnoHana managed to emotionally portray this very theme.\r\nWithin the summer heat, a wish was asked to be granted by the ghost of a girl, a childhood friend of the main characters. This marks the start of anunfolding story between these friends who joined up once more to rest the girl's spirit in peace. Keep in mind that the dead girl does interact in her ghost form, packed in a bundle of cheerfulness. That and the premise itself hooked me from the get-go. As the story progressed, I'm surprised by the amount of depth revealed in the characters. The only thing that slightly altered my score was some awkward dialogue and pacing scattered here and there. But let's talk about the positive parts. Remember how before I said that death affects us in differing manners? Well, contrasts and similarity was well used to highlight this aspect. Particularly, we see their childhood flashbacks and comparing it to their now allows us to see how they have changed since that tragic day. Their change all connects in some form to the childhood friend they have lost. You could relate to some aspect of their characterization as most of us have undergone the teenager stage, harboring secrets and having our own issues. It's a rough ride but this anime taught us that we can move on, cherishing the fun times we've had in the past. I'm getting a bit too dramatic here so I'll say AnoHana is also riddled with its own share of comedy which I've enjoyed. It's an anime that changes how you feel quite drastically, laughing at one moment then getting emotional at another.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, it does look good and fluid. I won't say it's anything special but the style fits the slice of life aspect. Character expressions succeeded at getting their emotions across and intensifying the atmosphere. It does get a bit exaggerated at some parts, but it's not up to the point of melodrama. About the opening song, I have to admit that it became one of my favorite song very quickly. Perfect for the mood that the anime lays for us. And to add more scores for sound, the voice-acting was superb and you can feel all the emotions pouring out. I'm also more drawn to piano scores so hearing the beautiful notes in the background as I watched was a nice touch that builds on the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic nature of the anime worked well with the story driven by the characters. The loss of their childhood friend affected them and changed the way they behave around each other. I enjoyed seeing their development and history being revealed gradually, creating moments full of feels. Watching AnoHana was definitely worth it.",

The themes of saying goodbye to the departed hit so very close to home with me, so perhaps it had a greater impact for me than others. However, Clannad, the poster-anime for tearjerking plot I found somewhat lacking.\r\nFor the person looking for a heartwarming bittersweet story of genuine love, selfdescovery and character development, this show is once i could not reccommend enough.\\n\\n\r\nmerely judging the content, perhaps the story itself relies upon a few clich\u00e9s and the artwork, though beautiful, is no Violet Evergarden or Made in Abyss. However, Anohana is going to take a perfect 10 from me and will remain so in my heart. \\n\\n\r\nI adore the heartfelt and earnest nature of each character. the isolation each experience as a result of their guilt. \\n\\n\r\nPlease, go watch this show.",

It\u2019s a life lesson, as cliche as it sounds.\r\nThe story. Throughout the anime, we shortly get into the lives of a group of friends. Or as it\u2019s presented to us - ex-friends. The reasons of the distance that now exists between them is shown bit by bit, as well as everyone\u2019s feelings.\r\nThe lost of a mutual friend can bound or destroy a relationship.\r\nIn Ano Hana\u2019s case, the grief was portrayed as something they wanted to hide, a weakness, a taboo due to theincident that lead to the death. The sadness, shame and guiltiness (within themselves or towards each other) were the main focus. It\u2019s deeper than what the surface shows, and they do a good job showing that on the characters\u2019 personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe art. In this aspect, i have zero complaints. The drawing style matches perfectly the genre, it\u2019s flooded with emotions but not flooded with lines. The expressions on the characters have intensity enough to add to the feelings, specially on the crying parts of it. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds, be it in openings, endings or theme songs during the episodes were definitely a 10 for me. The sum of sentimental lyrics, sweet vocals and songs playing and overlapping at the exact needed moment complements the power of the narration.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. There was, for sure, an awesome mix of personalities in here. The backgroud story with Menma was shown for every one of them, some happy, romantic and some with a antagony feel to it. But all of them very intimate, serving for the purpose of demonstrating how, no matter the relations between, all of the friends were extremely hurt and traumatized for life after losing such a dear friend. And we have to remember they were very young at the time. The author did a good job exhibiting how it marked them in that stage and how the feelings continued affecting as they grow up. Due to their age, it was just obvious they had no conditions of dealing with something as deep as death, as deep as grief. Only later on, after Menma\u2019s appearance, they are capable of knowing why it happened, and realizing how they still had hate, blame and sadness in their hearts. \\n\r\nAs for Menma, such a sweet character, but i still had some problems accepting her personality. She\u2019s still a child, but sometimes her behaviour was quite annoying in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nI would grade my \u201cenjoyment\u201d and \u201coverall\u201d as an 8. It was a outstanding work and a very reflective and learning process for me. As said in the beginning, it\u2019s deeper than the surface and you can see how the author tried his best to touch us with the story.",

            "content": "An adolescent is a person who experiences changes caused by hormones and puberty. This is something to think about when going into this series. Anhora is a show which resonated with me at many points in its run. Being an adolescent just help me understand the plot and reasoning behind each action. That said here is my opinion on Anohara\r\nAnohara is a story focused on showcasing several different emotions and developing the characters through these emotions and their reactions to them. The story revolves around a group of kids who lived average lives. The six of them always played together and formed their own personalgroup. Everything was fine until the death of one caused a falling out of the group. Several years after that what can be perceived as the spirit of the dead member arises and stays with the protagonist to find fulfill whatever wish is keeping her tied to this world.\\n\\n\r\nMany complaints about this series correlate to the obnoxious moves displayed by the cast.  This claim is valid if the person watching does not keep in mind the age of the characters. Each is around the age where they experience puberty. Puberty in many cases is known to cause people to act in an eccentric manner or do things out of hand. Keeping this in mind and enjoying how well the author portrayed this realistic take on their raging hormones will benefit you when watching this show. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, there were not many flaws with Anohara but the flaws I did find were jarring enough to keep it from receiving a 10. At many times the story felt standstill. During the period that they focused on character development, it felt like the main plot was not progressing at all. To put it simply half the time it didn't seem related to Menmas wish. Another gripe with the show has to be JIntan's inability to do the obvious at times. Up until episode 8 or so everyone in their group did not believe the protagonist about their dead friend's spirit. It took the spirit giving as many signs as possible to convince them, but why? The spirit seemed to be able to make physical contact with others even though they couldn't see or hear her. So why did the protagonist not tell the spirit to hug a group member tight in front of everyone? This in itself would have progressed the plot quicker. If anyone knows an actual reason why let me know.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the show was pretty damn good. Aside from the ending of Assassination Classroom and Your lie in April, it is one of the only shows to make me cry. Considering I haven't watched much anime like this with sadder ending I might not be the best judge of that. Hopefully, this review helped you in some way.\\n",

            "content": "Many an anime often deal, whether as a core theme or as a struggle, with a character needs to overcome, with the concept of pain or loss of someone dear. Who am I kidding, this is a common element in FICTION in general. Seriously, it's such an overused trope that the joke of making fun of the trope is as old as the actual trope. \r\nDepending on its execution, it can either be an endearing scene that can pull at a viewer's heartstrings, a scene that comes off as generic and uninspired or worse yet, a cringey, edgy scene that accomplishes absolutely nothing except makethe viewer stare in boredom...or in extreme cases, have the opposite affect and make them laugh their heads off.\\n\\n\r\nAno Hana generally is viewed as the former by most people...and the latter by myself.\\n\\n\r\nLet's not drag this out and get to the meat of this review, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nThe story is exactly what the premise says it is; a girl died 10 years ago, friends are now separated and now she returns as a ghost. While not necessary specifically like this, if you've been exposed to fiction in general then you've probably heard something similar to this premise.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I jump and bash it too hard...to its credit it does flesh out certain aspects that add to the overall narrative. For example, we get an idea of what it would be like if the ghost, say, grew up, or a limited (but still in my opinion rather shallow) view on how people would grow further from one another if a common tragic event happens.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very pleasant and clearly fits the tone of the show, portraying a nostalgic, sad yet hopeful tone. In fact, I frequently listen to several tracks from the soundtrack from time to time even now. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot say the same about the abysmal voice-acting, none of which sounds human and all of which sounds extremely forced. The yelling in particular that occurs over the course of the show sounds irritating and over-the-top, and not a single shred of drama in this show comes off as well-acted.\\n\\n\r\nHave I mentioned just how bad the yelling is? Seriously, did the voice actors take drugs before recording?\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is relatively decent, though nothing particularly special from usual A-1 Pictures fare. It's impressive if this show is one of your first anime ever, but if you've seen at least 2 other A-1 Pictures shows, then this show is nothing special in terms of character designs especially, which look exactly the same as almost every other recent A-1 Pictures show. Backgrounds look visually impressive, bringing life to the show; a lot of the scenery shots are clearly influenced by real life locations, which is always a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation quality is standard fare from A-1 Pictures; pleasant to look at, has its fare share of sakuga moments, but otherwise is nothing special. It's decent and it never really drops to a level where it's intolerable to look at, but it's not a mind-blowingly great looking show either.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's get to the meat of the show; the story and characters. For convenience's sake, I'm fusing both parts into one for this, since this is supposed to be a character-driven show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, quite frankly, plot devices. None of them feel like they behave like real people would actually behave, they're irritating and annoying; people in my eyes simply do NOT act like this. I cannot relate nor do I feel connected to any of the characters, and their behavior as well as reasons for their behavior are either incredibly basic or make little to no sense.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of that, that's ultimately my main issue with the characters; they're basic. They all feel like the worst versions of their respective archetypes, never advancing past that into becoming \"people\". Yes, I'm fully aware this is fiction; characters do not strictly need to act like people, but the fact this show masquerades as a character-driven show means that I do need to take that into consideration. And, in my eyes, it fails.\\n\\n\r\nI do need to point out, however, that the entire show only works on a superficial level; the more I think back on this show, the worse it gets. It doesn't have any particular complex themes, resolves itself in the most basic way imaginable and ultimately bets everything on pulling in the viewers heartstrings (or, for those of us who like to use meme terms, \"feels\").\\n\\n\r\nThe issue is, it has no real merit in case that doesn't work, and this is where my views on the show and most people diverge. The show feels...empty. I didn't feel invested in it, the characters are mundane and uninteresting, the interactions feel like fluff to get to the dramatic parts without taking into consideration how to make either the interactions or the drama actually work and the story and themes are too basically presented for me to care for.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this show in the slightest, and I hold no real issue against you if you did.\\n\r\nYou can take my opinion with the smallest pinch of salt possible.\\n\\n\r\nThank you very much for reading my review; any and all feedback would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n",

I cried a river of tears through out the entirety of this anime. And thats exactly why I hate it. >;( \r\nAnoHana is just so damn bitter sweet... Im personally not a fan of sad stories such as this one, so therefore Im giving it a lower review than others out there. \r\nThe story is filled with a few plotholes that bothered me ever since the beggining, but other than that it is still quite enjoyable (if you are down to cry and fill oceanswith your tears that is). The art and the soundtrack on the other hand are beautiful! I loved both the OP and ED, and for the entirety of the anime I had an eargasm and eyegasm. On the other side, the characters pissed me off making me feel feelings and shit, I had to go outside of my weebcave and punch a child right in the face and kick a Pug just like a football to make myself feel like the manchild that I am. \\n\r\nOverall giving this anime a solid 5/10. Makes the manliest men like me cry and feel sadness during the entirety of the anime, and that aint a good thing, so be warned! <3",

One of my closest friends committed suicide earlier this year and it fucked me up pretty bad (I watched Devilman Crybaby the day I found out not knowing what it was fucking RIP me). I have had a hard time processing his death, I haven't been able to let him go. My friends sudden death, as well as ongoing problems with my own mental health made this a very long year. This wasn't a perfect show by any means,but it came into my life at the right time, and I'm really grateful for it. It's still too early to say for sure, but I think Ano Hana may have helped get past the death of my friend. I hope that it can help bring closure to others who have gone through similar tragedies.",

            "content": "Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (We Still Don\u2019t Know the Name of the Flower we Saw that Day) [from here forwards we\u2019ll refer to it as Anohana] is a series that undoubtedly conveys the strong feelings of friendship, loss, grief, anger and love in a powerful manner. Personally I chose the series on the assumption that it would give me the same level of emotions that I got from series such as Angel Beats and Clannad, both of which have had an impact on the way I view things and this series does not disappoint when it comes toleaving a mark on the viewer. If you\u2019re only reading this to see if you want to watch the series or not, then all I have to say is give it a go. Chances are you won\u2019t be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s cut straight to the chase and look at the story and concept of the anime. The concept of ghosts hanging onto something isn\u2019t new, in fact the series manages to play around with the thought and it creates something much more powerful. The most memorable scene for most is the ending, and I have to agree there. Without going into spoilers (even though it\u2019s pretty blatantly obvious what happens) the ending leaves the viewer feeling sad but not disappointed. In fact the whole final episode builds to a climax almost perfectly, and that\u2019s why the series has gained such acclaim.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is probably at a perfect length, whilst I would have liked to see a bit more character interaction I think that the way it was executed in 11 episodes made it extremely memorable as you never really find a space to get bored. Honestly, the first episode almost threw me off the series until I first saw the complexity of the relationships between the characters. However from then on it just moved at a perfect pace to engage the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe backstory is also interestingly crafted. There is no real mystery of what happened, but the complexity of what happened on that day unfolds at the perfect rate for the viewer to be curious but never fully understand the entire picture. In fact the last reveal of what happened threw me completely off but looking back it made quite a bit of sense. That\u2019s another thing in this series. There are no real unexplainable things; everything just pieces itself together with logic, which is something quite rare in an eleven episode anime series.\\n\\n\r\nAnohana as a story is enough to keep the viewer engaged and if that\u2019s all you care about then go watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is reasonably good, especially in the concluding few episodes. The use of colours and tones were quite excellent and the character design was almost perfect, aside from my small dislike for Jintan\u2019s father. The climax scene, in fact the entire last episode, was animated wonderfully and I definitely liked that.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and voice acting for this series is quite good. Firstly the soundtrack used in the emotional scenes just amplified the feelings of the characters, and that was done so beautifully. The OP and ED were both quite decent (I\u2019m actually listening to the full OP as I type this) but you\u2019ll remember the songs more due to their roles in the final episode.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was done so beautifully. It\u2019s hard to find a flaw in the cast, they were all suited well for their roles and none of them felt out of place, and the result of that was impressive. However the reason they were memorable were their emotional performances and the like. Their emotional cries were quite powerful, and it impacts the viewer beyond belief.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the characters, and particularly their interactions with each other. The main group (The Super Peace Busters) are all interesting in their own way but it\u2019s the relationships and their individual emotions that make them so fascinating. The way they all change is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the series along with their respective relationships with Menma.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character of the series is Jintan, and he\u2019s the only one who can see Menma. He was once the clich\u00e9 leader who led by his actions (basically a classic Shounen style hero). However once Menma dies and everyone in the Super Peace Busters split apart he becomes much more complex. He basically locks himself in his house and refuses to come to school, that of course changes as the series progresses. As the group are forced to interact with each other again his personality is put in the questions, who he wants to become is also put into the question of the viewer. I personally found his character development the most interesting, and his feelings for Menma and Anaru are also placed into the spotlight (which provides a strong focal point for the drama). Ultimately his personality shines through as that of a Leader, and that\u2019s something quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe girl in focus on this series is Menma. She died before the series began and returns hoping to fulfil her dream (which she conveniently forgot). To my surprise she was voiced by Ai Kayano (Mayaka from Hyouka and Mashiro from Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo), her voice just seemed different. Her dream is the ultimate driving point of the story, and is what brings together the old group of friends. Her personality is the classic innocent girl who wants everyone to get along. Ultimately the way she acts in the final episodes is what people will remember, and her impact on everyone\u2019s life is monumentally instrumental.\\n\\n\r\nAnaru is an interesting character. She was once the more quiet girl with a large collection of video games and manga but she grew up to be much more of a \u2018bad\u2019 girl. She admits to imitating those around her, and ultimately it\u2019s her growth (and her evidently soft side) which is highlighted. Her feelings for Jintan are highlighted from almost the beginning, and the viewer is left to feel sorry for her as she is pushed aside in Jintan\u2019s quest to fulfil Menma\u2019s wish. Her emotional importance to the story was quite memorable and was definitely a key factor to the enjoyment of the series.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, my favourite character was probably Yukiatsu, only due to the raw emotions that he emitted during the story. He was in love with Menma as a child, but he knew that she only saw Jintan, causing him to hold a bitter feeling towards the \u2018Leader\u2019 as someone that was always better than him. His obsession over Menma was frighteningly powerful, and his pain was a key reason as to my liking of the character. His inferiority complex leads him to pursue Menma even if she is dead, which leads to some of the more creepy moments of the story. Ultimately he is one of the key characters and my favourite.\\n\\n\r\nTsuruko and Poppo were both probably the least important characters in the story. Whilst they undoubtedly held an important role in the progression of the story, I found the four above characters to be far more powerful in their stories. I found certain parts of their story sad and I never felt like they were irrelivent, but I didn\u2019t find them completely useful either.\\n\\n\r\nAnohana is one of those series that leaves you thinking, and I left thinking of the importance of friends, the pain of loss and just a general load of feels. In conclusion (this is basically a TL;DR) I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who was willing to watch a serious drama.\\n",

Why the fuck all of them blame themselves for Menma's accident ??? \r\nand why the fuck Menma run away when Jinta insult her..\r\nit just didn't make sense lol.\r\nAnd the only one who can see Menma in the beginning is only Jinta....\r\nJinta didn't even want to go to school and his father is okay with that, what the hell is wrong with his father brains??\r\nOr, when someone in their circle of friends cosplaying asmenma because of his love to menma is overwhelming and he can't get over menma's death.\\n\r\nThe story is out of place, scattering everywhere. When Jinta can see Menma, Menma ask him to reconnect with their childhood friend.. They can't even find out what is Menma's Final wish. so stupid.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nThe art is good though, as expected from studio A-1 Pictures.\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nThe OP and ED songs is good.\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\r\nCharacter is pretty stupid.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nI didn't really enjoy AnoHana.\\n\r\nOverall 5.2/10\\n",
