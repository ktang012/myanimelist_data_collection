            "content": "As a fan of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, I won't hesitate to watch or read (or at least plan to) anything related to that series. Of course, that includes this spin-off, The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan. I read a few volumes of the manga and loved it, so when this anime was announced, my excitement was only doubled! However, I admit that I also had my concerns, as Kyoto Animation, the studio that worked on the original anime, didn't work on the spin-off. As it aired, I found that it wasn't received that well, either. However, that doesn't change the fact that I stillreally enjoyed The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so does anyone remember The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya? This anime takes place in the alternate world from that movie, where everything is normal and there is no aliens, time travelers, or espers whatsoever. Yuki Nagato is a shy girl who is nothing like the Yuki Nagato we all know and love. This Yuki is a member of the Literature Club, along with Ryoko Asakura and Kyon. Yuki also happens to have a crush on Kyon. Basically, the anime follows Yuki as she goes through her everyday life with the Literature Club and her feelings for Kyon develops.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, a majority of the characters have changed. As I've said before, Yuki is now a really shy girl, and Kyon is kinder in comparison to the original. Ryoko Asakura is also different from the original; she acts as more of a motherly or a sisterly figure to Yuki. I wasn't really a fan of her in the original anime, and I'm guessing other Haruhi fans can understand why. However, that's not to say everyone's completely different. Mikuru still retains her character from the original series (which is a good thing, as I LOVED her in the original series), and Haruhi is still as fun of a character as ever. Even so, even the characters whose personalities have changed were still fun to watch, although I can't deny that they're still not the same as the ones we know and love.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a good one, with lots of comedy and drama. The story is especially great in episodes 10-13, where the Yuki Nagato we all know and love is shown to us. The animation, I admit, is not as good as in the original series. What do you expect, though? It wasn't Kyoto Animation that did the animation this time; instead, it was Satelight. As a result, the animation is more bright and more cutesy, and it takes a while to get used to. It's not bad animation at all, though; in fact, Satelight did a good job with the animation. The voice actors also did a great job at reprising their roles, as expected. The OP and ED are great, too; I could listen to them on repeat without getting bored!\\n\\n\r\nLet's face it, everyone; The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is NOT a Haruhi Season 3. However, it's still a really, really, REALLY enjoyable anime. If anyone liked Yuki Nagato from The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya and want to see more of her, this anime is PERFECT for you. It's given me even the tiniest of hopes that The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya will get an actual third season!",

            "content": "While I've never been much of a fan of the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise, I can still say, at the very least, that I admired the off-kilter charm it had and understood the appeal that others would find in its self-aware meta-humor. It was quirky, upbeat and had a trademark style of doing things that were uniquely its own. By itself, that might not seem like much of an accomplishment, but when placed through a filter with the countless other school slice-of-life titles produced after its inception, it becomes more apparent why it gained its popularity. Despite the anime industry being saturated with these dime-a-dozen titlesevery year, the Haruhi franchise still manages to stay relevant by being one of the few to tinker with the formula in inventive ways. And like most things tend to, it had its fair share of detestable moments as well (8 x \u221e), but regardless of that, it still had a distinct identity that couldn't be found elsewhere. It's something you don't necessarily have to like, but you can still appreciate it for what it did. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't offer the same accolades to its spin-off Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu ( The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan). A \"Spin\"-off is supposed to take elements of its predecessor and add a new \"spin\" to it. In other words, it's supposed to do things differently from the status quo of the original series but still maintain aspects of it that connect it back to the parent story. While it was certainly \"different\" and a departure from the usual hijinks of the SOS Brigade, it had none of the charm or inherent value found in the parent story. In fact, The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is the exact opposite of what I saw admirable about the main story in the first place. It's a spin-off indistinguishable from the mass produced yearly offerings that I thought Haruhi never fell victim to. It's a title that got caught in the trappings of its genre's tropes, which automatically makes it a title that many would not speak of or forget altogether in the long run. The premise that it had wasn't bad, but the actual product that we were given was far from satisfactory. \\n\\n\r\nSwapping the supernatural shenanigans and one-off adventures with a rom-com narrative, the story of Nagato Yuki-chan sees the titular character Nagato try to confess her love to Kyon, only for her attempts to end without fruition, and then they repeat the cycle by the next episode. There you go, that's literally it. For the 1st 10-episodes, what we're essentially given is your typical \"would they or wouldn't they\" scenario where every moment is ruined by the love interest in question or by a side character popping up at the most inconvenient time. In between these moments, they insert a lot of padding and fluff in the form of slice-of-life segments. This includes everything from your cliched bathhouse/hot spring episode, to your group field trips. If you've seen enough school SoL anime titles before, this is just a patch job of all the overused setups, with the only difference being that the characters are from the Haruhi universe. I feel like there isn't a need to spell out the obvious here but just in case it isn't already clear enough, this is G-E-N-E-R-I-C. But like I said, it was the 1st 10 episodes that followed this monotonous cycle, after that point, the show took an unexpected turn and introduced a plot twist that brought with it much needed character drama, but I'll save that information for the spoiler section for those who haven't seen the spin-off yet. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Nagato Yuki-chan may have had good intentions, but the humdrum way it went about presenting it topped with the overused scenarios made it a tedious watch very quickly. It tossed in an unexpected twist for good measure, but by then, the damage was already done. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of Nagato Yuki-chan were, for the lack of a better word, basic. This can also mark the 1st real point of contention for fans of the franchise as they altered all the original character designs that helped to distinguish the cast into moe ladened ones that make them appear painfully generic. Change isn't a bad thing per say, but when the change is a downgrade from unique character design to xerox copies, that change can be very jarring. Their \"spunk\" was gone. The quality downsizing didn't stop there, as there was also a lack of detail placed in any given background. Even the unique shot compositions were no longer present. This may have been the result of another studio handling the show, as Satelight took the reins from Kyoani in its inception; a choice that might have been the first big mistake. With no proper use of lighting, no attempts at unique camera angles, inept understanding of color theory and no real distinguishable atmosphere developed, the switch in studios was one that really put a damper on a show that was already holding on at the end of the proverbial rope. The only credit I can offer is that they were able to capture the right tone for the latter half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs if to add insult to injury, a majority of the cast felt alienated from the prior installments. Not only did they look generic but now even their personality is bleached. They were either rewritten or regressed in dimension, and some were also reduced to being used as nothing more than background decoration. Thankfully, some maintained their personality, like Haruhi and Asahina, but even then, they were all watered down versions of their former self. Nagato and Kyon took the lead roles in the story, and while Kyon still had his sharp whit about him, it was toned down quite a bit. His personality was altered to fit a more optimistic portrayal, which in turn erased the \"person of reason\" that he was always known for into a character that didn't quite fit the mold. It's okay if they wanted his personality to reflect better the more lighthearted tone the show was going for but his pessimistic outlook is as much of a signature of the franchise as is the yellow ribbons as much of a trademark style of Haruhi. Getting rid of it is like getting rid of a big chunk of what makes the character stand out. \\n\\n\r\nKoizumi isn't even given any screen time and felt like he was only being placed the show as a carryover and nothing more. Same can be said about Asahina's involvement. They were both there to fill in their roles but was never given any time dedicated to them. A majority of the cast was underutilized or not even relevant at all. Perhaps the most significant change is that of Nagato's, and quite frank, it's the most grating. While the intention was for her to be an alternative story-line version to that of the movie, her personality makes a complete 180 if compared to the original and his grossly exaggerated if compared to the movie version. She's no longer the stoic, calculating Nagato but a shy hyperactive moe-blob with a pension for food and video games. It's a huge juxtaposition from who she was and one I couldn't buy into. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast as a whole was quite unappealing, and none of them was endearing or fleshed out. They were all husks of their former selves.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was forgettable. None of it ever grips you and remained as background noise. I can't recall anything special about it, as none of it stood out. The only time there was any visible effort came with the piano ballads towards the latter half, but even that was run-of-the-mill for what it was intended to do. The opening and ending themes were skippable, with the opening being a typical J-pop song and the ending a somber downtempo one. The voice actors were all fine, the only standout that comes to mind was that of Tomokazu Sugita's, who played Kyon. His monologs were always a nice touch and through it, provided insight into the situations the characters found themselves in.\\n\\n\r\n***Spoiler Section****\\n\r\n(skip to the enjoyment and overall section to avoid spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nSo the big reveal that the show hits you with is that the old stoic Nagato from the main series randomly commandeered the body of the new Nagato of this spin-off, and while it was indeed an interesting twist..., HOW and WHY does this happen? \\n\\n\r\nThe plot twist had no buildup, no foreshadowing but just came out of nowhere with no explanation and then it went away just as quickly with no proper reasoning behind it. Honestly, it felt like it was a cheap ploy only there to break the monotony of the basic rom-com and in a desperate attempt to salvage viewer interest. The character drama that arose from it was nice, as it spiced things up, but with it simply popping up and then going away without consequence or reason, it just brought more questions than it helped with the overall show. Not to mention that even the stoic Nagato was reduced to acting silly and \"kawaii\" after the reveal, which defeated the whole purpose of her being introduced in the plot twist, to begin with. I don't know if they meant to use this as a chance to leave the story open-ended for a continuation or not, but it happened far too late into the story to matter, and everything was only brought back to the status quo by the time the series ended.\\n\\n\r\n***End of Spoilers*****\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to mince my words here; I hated this spin-off. Every bit of me wanted to drop it, and the only reason I didn't is my OCD-like mentality towards finishing titles. It was bland, overly sentimental and a waste of effort.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nNagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu is not only a stain on the Haruhi's name but one that manages to lose all the charm and wit the franchise is known for. It's a cash grab nobody wanted nor needed, and the only thing it honestly shares with Haruhi is the characters and familiar namesake. With that said, if you're an avid fan of the franchise, then I suggest keeping your expectations low, as it doesn't contain the same trademarks you'd expect from the series. And if you've been impartial towards the series thus far, then stay clear from this one or prepare yourself for a cringe-inducing experience.",

            "content": "Its amazing how slight changes in perspective can cause something that on the surface seemed initially disjointed and disappointing, into an emotional experience that brings a surprising amount of satisfaction. \r\nLike most, I went into the series expecting the enjoyably discordant storyline, animation, and voice acting that the original series and movie had. I was consequently confused by Kyon's noticeably different appearance and a number of other slight visual changes that I shamefully explained away by learning the original studio hadn't worked on it. The first few episodes made it abundantly clear that it was not \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\", and finding that outannoyed me immensely. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, as I continued to watch the series, I began to recollect parts of the \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\" in particular Nagato's role in it. As part of that recollection, I finally realized, \"Ah... this is Yuki-chan's dream reality\" and afterwards everything clicked into place. The visual aberrations weren't unintentional, there was meaning behind the almost cliche variants of this series' characters' personas, and even the series' romcom style, and use of aged animations, was used to create a traditionalized perspective reminiscent of Nagato's preferences that contrasts really well against the unreal and jolting, or Haruhi-like, characteristics of the previous series. With this new perspective, even apparently superficial references to the previous series begin to question which of the two realities (i.e. Haruhi's or Yuki's) is the \"truest\" one or had the most merit for existing. This issue could only have been seen from the original Yuki's perspective, and was briefly discussed in the movie; bringing it up in this manner in Yuki's reality neatly explains the logic of her actions in the movie while allowing Yuki's own personal wishes and motivations to remain at the forefront.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you watch this series because you wanted a 3rd season of \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\", you'll be disappointed. However if you watch this series because you want to know more about why Nagato did what she did in the \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\" then I think you'll be pleasantly satisfied, and glad that this series made it to air. Personally speaking, the groundhog hell that Nagato went through in the movie still prevents me from watching it again; watching this series softens that angst and brings even more meaning to the series as whole.",

            "content": "I don\u2019t envy anyone who sits down and tries to come up with a spin-off story. Picture it: Here you are with a bunch of fun, memorable characters who each have a purpose but you want to change those around to create something new. If that wasn\u2019t hard enough already, strip away one of the major genres that underpinned the original. Hand someone some paper and a pen and tell them to come up with something new with that added rule. It would certainly leave them scratching their head for a while. I\u2019ve found the anime that shows why that\u2019s not a simple task. \r\nNagatoYuki-chan no Shoushitsu is an attempted creation along that line, a romantic comedy created from the Suzumiya Haruhi series, with studio Satelight putting it to screen. In place of the supernatural we have a focus on romance. In place of Haruhi as the lead we have Yuki. The pieces were all rearranged on the board ready to start the game but then this anime didn\u2019t know how to move them. It\u2019s a show that relies too heavily on referencing the original series as opposed to crafting its own meaningful story. It\u2019s all a big bunch of fanservice and if that\u2019s all you\u2019re after then there\u2019s a few things you might enjoy spotting. But if you wanted to see some more creative spark or interesting developments in the story department you might walk away feel a bit sour.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll also end up doing something in this review I normally like to avoid, and that\u2019s compare it to another show. Given the franchise this anime is inspired from into I feel it\u2019s only fair I draw upon Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu as a reference. Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu show fails to stand up on its own merits as a spin-off and there\u2019s no better way to show that than by making this comparison. Note that this review contains minor spoilers for the original Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu series.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nNagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu is a story packed with few surprises. Yuki wants to tell Kyon how she feels about him but every time she comes close to doing so she falters in some manner. Rinse, repeat. You get to watch episode after episode of it. The presentation can be fun and light hearted at least. It\u2019s not as if the show is ever terrible, but it\u2019s never memorable. As I watched on I couldn\u2019t help but notice there was a serious imbalance between comedy and drama. It opts for laughs over love on too many occasions, and there\u2019s little to no complication in the romance area. If there\u2019s little external forces to come between our pair then what\u2019s there to keep it interesting? There\u2019s the odd curveball though that saves the show from being a complete flop, which I\u2019ll come to.\\n\\n\r\nMore than the characters involved, nothing annoying me in Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu more than its boring episode structure. It tells you \u201cHere\u2019s your Valentine\u2019s episode\u201d, \u201cHere\u2019s your beach episode\u201d, \u201cHere\u2019s your summer trip\u201d and the list went on. It was sleep-inducing. While there\u2019s a share of Easter eggs to be found in these episodes that pay homage to the original series, sometimes clever and subtle, often that\u2019s all they are: references. They serve little purpose and it\u2019s like the writer was saying \u201cHey remember this scene guys? This was in the original series!\u201d You have a laugh, nod in agreement, and then go back to watching droll rom-com nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nThese generic episode set ups were still made to be exciting in the original series because romance was not at the forefront \u2013 it was a product of the mysteries and adventures the cast found themselves in. At least when Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu resorted to these stereotypical anime scenarios they came with that added spice of having to appease Haruhi. Even when the SOS Club were thrown into seemingly mundane situations you always had to expect the unexpected. It was a show that knew how to have fun because of that kicker. Here these same situations are used for nothing more than cheap laughs and with little to no romantic progression. When love is the theme, and you strip away the supernatural, things all come crumbling down.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time that Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu decided to start being serious and start exploring the mind of its lead character I had lost interest. \\n\r\nThere was a serious imbalance in the way the show built up to its major complication. I was falling asleep. When the psychological drama came around it was like an alarm clock taped to my ear. I really wasn\u2019t ready for it. Talk about a jarring tone shift. As jarring as it was though, I must say it was welcome. Here we are with not only some complication of substance, but also comes with one of the more clever throwbacks to the original series. It was the first sign of meaningful development for Yuki. It also changes up the dynamic between Yuki and Kyon a great deal. Dare I say the show even became somewhat interesting? It saves the anime in its run home but all I kept asking myself was \u201cwhy didn\u2019t this happen earlier on?\u201d If you\u2019re able to overcome how sudden \u2013 and maybe a bit ridiculously \u2013 things take a turn then you might get more out of this series than what I did. The ending is charming enough and I actually got a lot more out of it than I expected. While not entirely satisfying or complete, the presentation and references this time around were fun and felt useful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nYuki obviously gets the big turnaround in behaviour when compared to the rest of the cast. Instead of the alien of few words, she is now driven a lot more by emotion. This gave her much more potential to express herself but watching her felt like a chore. How could they have made Yuki more interesting? Putting her character on a greater offensive would have been a great start. Don\u2019t get me wrong, she really wants to make things change. She tries to express herself but you can guess how it always ends. It\u2019s normally something along the lines of\u2026 awkward situation, exasperated overreaction then back to square one. You can find that one in the first chapter of \u201cWriting Generic Romantic Comedies 101\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t be mad if Yuki followed the start of those guidelines but then actually took something away from her experiences, and learn to fend for herself. Instead it\u2019s always mother Asakura to the rescue and Yuki herself doesn\u2019t seem to take anything on board. It\u2019s like every episode restores the status quo.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the devil, that\u2019s all Asakura\u2019s role in this series is. She\u2019s there to pick up the pieces Yuki leaves behind and do everything for her. She\u2019s more of a parent than a friend. I understand that this is another interesting tie-in to the original Haruhi series (in particular the film) given the \u2018protective\u2019 nature she had there, but watching it here is tedious. She had the potential here to play a much more active role in this love story but content to hang back to provide annoying comedy (hey look she\u2019s pulling a scary face again) and repetitive relationship advice to Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nThis may sound a little mean, but Kyon is just too happy and untroubled in this show. His best asset was his frustration as a result of the situations he found himself thrown into with Haruhi. He becomes just another generic anime high school male character this time around when left alone to his own devices. While we get the odd look at the old Kyon we know and love, it sadly isn\u2019t the one taking centre stage. It\u2019s unsurprising that some of my favourite moments in this anime came from his dialogue with Haruhi. It\u2019s not a good sign when your main female lead can\u2019t bring out the same level of engagement. All Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu will do is make you miss Kyon\u2019s non-stop stream of amusing thoughts and inner monologues.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else in the show just feels like they\u2019re there to advance the story and take the group to somewhere new. They don\u2019t feel like active players in character relationships, again just there most of the time to remind everyone what series\u2019 spin-off you\u2019re watching. Haruhi manages to steal the show away from Nagato quite often. I thought she was going to add a bit of conflict this story but I was let down with that idea. Everyone else isn\u2019t even worth touching on.\\n\\n\r\nThank goodness the original cast returned for this and helped to correct that somewhat. Tomozaku Sugita, while limited with his capabilities in this show, still gives Kyon that snarky edge through all his rom-com suffering. Minori Chihara actually gets the chance to put some sentences together as Yuki and does a fair job in a new role as the blubbering, timid female lead. You also don\u2019t need me to tell you that Aya Hirano, as Haruhi, was excellent. I have to say that people have ragged on the character designs a bit too much. I actually like that Satelight tried to distance themselves away from KyoAni\u2019s designs and make something unique on their end. Are they memorable? Not really, but they\u2019re far removed from the worst I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s fair that you compare the roles of characters between this and the original series, but it\u2019s unfair to do the same for the art style. \\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s the big problem with a spin-off that changes up the dynamics and personality of its characters: The original series is crafted around the interactions and clashes of those personalities. Changing this up is asking for trouble. Now in Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu the roles of these characters have become uninteresting and out of place. All the drama in this show is boring and everyone outside of Kyon, Yuki and Asakura don\u2019t seem to have anything to contribute. I\u2019d struggle to recommend Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu even to a fan of the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nIf you could sum up the show you could call it \u201cReferences: The Anime\u201d. All it does is serve as a reminder that you could be watching its more superior reference anime. Granted, Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu never tries to emulate Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu. It knows it\u2019s only a spin-off. It goes for a completely different theme in its story but its execution was iffy. Pointless, meandering slice-of-life antics took up too much of the show. When it finally ditched them I\u2019d come too far through the 16-episode count. It tries its hardest to look back of those SoL previous experiences and make them feel significant but it falls flat on its face.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 4/10 (Poor)",

            "content": "If you come into The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan with expectations that this will be on the level of the original Haruhi series, you will be in for severe disappointment. To watch this anime, you must be a fan of the Haruhi Suzumiya universe, but you must also leave any such expectations at the door. When you do that, then, and only then, will you be able to enjoy this anime. Somewhat. Sometimes. Maybe?\r\nNagato Yuki-chan is essentially a \u201cwhat-if\u201d story. What if, in Disappearance, that world became canon? Or, better to say, what-if the world from The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya was the true world?How would things be different? While the titular Yuki Nagato was more fragile in the movie, the anime draws upon that material (as well as Nagato playing games from The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya) to deliver a character that\u2019s different (for the most part, she's in love with Kyon) but not new. Despite being a different entity altogether (and even being written/drawn by someone else), Nagato fits in with the universe for being silly. Although it never reaches an intelligent level of parody like its mother series, Nagato Yuki-chan can be refreshing in how light-hearted it is. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully the performances of the cast are great. The Haruhi series is famous for having a great sub and dub, and even though the original Japanese version has finished, in this age of simul-dubbing, we get to experience the original dub voices once again. The shoutouts here have to go to Minori Chihara and Michelle Ruff, the voice actresses of Nagato in both languages. Chihara does a great job of making Nagato meek and cute. Ruff takes it in a slightly different direction (since it would be unnatural sounding if she did that much high-pitched cuteness) and she focuses on the shy aspect of Nagato, with equally great results. All the other principal voices return and they perform with the same level of confidence and ability.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s unfortunately, however, that all of the good aspects of the Nagato Yuki-chan anime can be described as superficial or dependent on the love of the original series, because the spinoff itself doesn\u2019t have enough strength on its own.\\n\\n\r\nEasily, the weakest part of the presentation aspect of the show is its animation. Admittedly, however, it is tough to tell if this is because the animation is actually below average or if it just is worse than previous entries. Taken by itself, the animation done by Satelight isn\u2019t bad. The only thing that jumps out at me is the fact that there seems to be a lot of white used, and all the scenes look brighter to an uncomfortable degree. Any other complaint, however, comes from a comparison to Kyoto Animation, the typical animator of the Haruhi series. This season, for whatever reason (probably because this is a relatively unimportant spinoff of the main series, or the cynical reason that KyoAni has no reason to promote Haruhi anymore), KyoAni decided not to animate this entry in the Haruhi universe. And while Satelight generally tries their hardest, KyoAni and their animation of the original series is often too hard to live up to. Anything good that Satelight does feels merely serviceable looking at KyoAni, and this is augmented by the sheer whiteness everywhere and the fact Kyon looks like a goddamn middle schooler.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, Nagato Yuki-chan is generally alright, but the implementation of Haruhi can get dicey at times. You can\u2019t have the series without Haruhi, that\u2019s practically a given. But Nagato Yuki-chan struggles to find the right balance of Haruhi in the show. Haruhi is the same person she\u2019s practically always been: obsessed with the supernatural, eccentric as hell, and bossy to a fault. If she didn\u2019t take charge, it would be strange. Often, however, the show puts the spotlight on Haruhi and her antics, when they need to take a definitive backseat. This isn\u2019t the show for Haruhi to do weird things; that\u2019s literally all the other Haruhi series (well, except for Nyoron Churuya-san). The show shines when Haruhi does something weird and it\u2019s left in the background or used as an impetus for the principal characters (Nagato, Kyon, and Asakura) to do something; on the other hand, if there\u2019s even a little more Haruhi antics, the show feels like a discount version of the main series. Even at the end of the day, Haruhi is just a hyperactive person, without many of the nuances that made her interesting in the original series.\\n\\n\r\nWith the exception of Nagato and Asakura, who are rather interesting in their own right, all of the other characters are very watered down versions of themselves. Since Koizumi, Mikuru, and Tsuruya don't play as much of a central role in the plot, it's not a huge deal, but Kyon plays a strangely odd role on the sidelines, reduced to an occasional straight man gag. In fact, Kyon, the romantic interest, is thoroughly uninteresting in this incarnation of the series, which is a huge drawback.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, despite it being Haruhi characters you know and love, despite the voice actors coming back, and despite the cuteness of it all, The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is an extremely generic, and often boring, slice of life anime. In fact, outside of love for the original cast of characters and voice actors, there is no reason to partake in it for the actual plot. Episode after episode is a slow clich\u00e9 slice of life borefest that just makes you want a third season of Haruhi adapting Rampage. Beach? Check. How about a trip to Kyoto? Check. Tanabata episode? Sure, let\u2019s forget the original series and give that a check. To this end, Nagato Yuki-chan becomes a discount Haruhi Suzumiya, often filled with annoying nods to the parent series without any of the edge, and even those who do their best to ignore this find it progressively harder to do so as the series continues.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, the smiles from the cuteness of the show just can\u2019t outweigh the fact that the series is boring, generic, and derivative. The fact that these are well-established characters only goes so far, and ultimately, this would have worked better as a short OVA or ONA series rather than a 1.5 cour deal. Nagato being super cute, while extremely pleasing, isn\u2019t enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3 (Cliche, boring, generic Slice of Life and discount Haruhi)\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6 (Bias for KyoAni may exist, but still only adequate)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8 (Good voice acting but only Nagato is amazing; this is because of the blandness of the characters)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4 (Nagato is cute, Asakura is elder sister like. All other characters are one-dimensional or lose some traits, like Kyon's inability to become the straight man in a good fashion)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5.2 (rounded down to 5)",

            "content": "It\u2019s like something born out of a fairy tale story. Nagato Yuki-Chan no Shoushitsu (The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan) is no Haruhi Season 3. In fact, it\u2019s more a spinoff taking place in an alternate universe where aliens don\u2019t exist, Kyon seems normal, and Nagato Yuki is almost nothing like what fans remember her from the original series. As far that goes, this spinoff is more or less of a slice of life story that mixes in elements of drama, romance, and some SOS shenanigans. \r\nBased on the manga of the same name, the series consists of 16 episodes that depicts the life of NagatoYuki. Unlike the stoic girl that many fans remember her as, she is rather timid and shows much more human emotions than her Haruhi counterpart. Make no mistake though, she still retains some characteristics such as her love of reading books. \\n\\n\r\nAs of the story itself, Nagato Yuki-Chan no Shoushitsu is very straightforward. We meet Nagato Yuki, the titular character of the show as she has an encounter with Kyon. Because Kyon isn\u2019t like the cyclical self that we remember him as, he is able to easily make friends with her. Then enter Haruhi, the girl that made herself famous from the original series. And in this show, she is also shown to be kinder yet still full of energy. The first few episodes easily establishes the primary character cast. They compose of Nagato, Kyon, Haruhi, and joining them includes Mikuru, Itsuki, and Asakura. A good amount of investment comes from the relationship building. In particular, Kyon and Nagato shares some similarities and the two seems to be able to get along quite well. There\u2019s also some very obvious attraction that Nagato shows towards Kyon. While the show isn\u2019t entirely structured as a rom-com, it does highlight such moments from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nDrama also does come to play at some pivotal moments in the show. This is shown early on in the series as Haruhi gets into a controversial love angle between her, Nagato, and Kyon. What started as a misunderstanding degenerated into tears and sorrow. Unfortunately, there\u2019s really not much to expand on the story development beyond that. It\u2019s too simple and formalistic with a predictable outcome that anyone could of seen coming. What\u2019s more is that Nagato shows her vulnerability that fans might not be able to adapt with well. After all, she was always supposed to be a stoic girl with almost a lack of human emotions. Here, she shows more human emotions than she ever did. In retrospect, the series isn\u2019t very good at dealing with drama. It fits more as a slice of life series and attempting to craft drama doesn\u2019t make the series distinguishing. On the bright side, the chemistry between Kyon and Nagato can be genuinely heartwarming to watch. It not only brings out the honesty of their characters but also shows how they can co-exist to tackle almost any problem. On the other hand, the show is sometimes overshadowed by Haruhi. She is like a bright and shining energy ball that just never seems to stop glowing. While the main protagonist is Nagato in this spinoff, it\u2019s really hard to ignore Haruhi\u2019s presence when she makes herself stand out above others. The plus side is that she isn\u2019t a jerk that some of us remembers.\\n\\n\r\nAt some point in this series, it will seem like a chore to watch. I had this sort of feeling early on when comedy on top of comedy is thrown towards the audience. While it seems fun at first, it just seems like dead humor. The jokes quickly become stale while doesn\u2019t really add anything new for the audience to experience with. Characters also shows little change to their personalities until a certain episode. However, if you get to over half the show with patience, then you may be surprised. In one of the later episodes, the story brings out a side of Nagato Yuki that we may be familiar with. The tone of the show changes drastically for several episodes as we see this complex side of herself. Perhaps this will refresh your memory of the original Nagato as well based on her behavior. What\u2019s more is that it also brings out the best from other characters such as Kyon and Asakura. It shows their care for a friend when they need it the most. Furthermore, I have to say that the show adds a bit of suspense that invites anticipation. While the show at that point still retains some comedy with slice of life elements, it\u2019s almost like a 180 degree shift from the first half of the season. Sometimes, a shift like this may seem risky. But for a series that already foreshadowed some of the events, it effectively delivers. In retrospect, the short yet melancholic arc (episodes 10-13) will be an emotional ride.\\n\\n\r\nSatelight is the studio in charge to deliver art visuals. And for that reason, don\u2019t expect the artwork or visual quality to be top stellar. In fact, the show\u2019s character designs and setting looks only moderate with generic characteristics. Nagato Yuki also looks different from her original self although still retains similar clothes and her trademark glasses. Then, there\u2019s Kyon. Some fans may barely recognize him at first until he begins speaking on-screen. On the other hand, Haruhi still looks the same while other characters such as Mikuru gives off the Ms. Fan-service vibe. In fact, fan service is no stranger in show. From the curious camera angle shots, bouncing boobs, and classic onsen episode, it\u2019s safe to say that the show really wants to service the fans. And in terms of comedy, the facial expressions of the characters are almost endless. The highlight part of the series is the deeper development such as the symbolism of the rain and OP/ED song adjustments. When carefully examined, it really brings out a meaning for this show\u2019s title.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the soundtrack is an important part of the show along with the voice mannerisms. In order to capture the new refreshing feeling of this spinoff, the characters needs to connect with the audience. In the beginning, it seems that they can do just that. Despite some annoying antics such as Haruhi\u2019s overwhelming personality, the characters are able to carry the show and not bore the audience. Similarly, the soundtrack has a nice balance that changes from the casual and humorous tone in the first half, to a very melancholic and atmospheric feeling in the second. The OP and ED theme songs also reflects a good amount of this change. And in general, the music is something that can easily be enjoyed whether you\u2019re a fan of the story or not.\\n\\n\r\nA show like this seems like a blast from the past on first glance. But in the end, it\u2019s not much like so despite some similarities with the original Haruhi series. If you\u2019re a fan of humor, drama, and lots of slice of life, then this show will no doubt be something you can tolerate. While the series does attempt to emphasize the romance context as well, it doesn\u2019t work out right in the end. Let\u2019s face the facts. Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu isn\u2019t really a rom-com. While the relationship connections are evident and the chemistry is charming, the drama itself is polarizing. On the other hand, the series does craft melancholy quite well. The shift from a certain mood from one to another of the complete opposite will seem like a surprise and keep you at the edge of your seat. And for a show like this, it\u2019s what\u2019s needed to keep it somewhat interesting.",

            "content": "I'm honestly not against spin-off series, after all my lovely Illya Prisma is just a spin-off of Fate, and so I wasn't against a spin-off focusing on Nagato either. After all practically everyone loved Nagato in the original, almost as much as they hated Haruhi (aka a lot). There are just 2 major problems. 1)The audience came to sympathise with the tortured lonely Nagato of Haruhi's universe, remaking her into a girl whose only characteristic is being clumsy was stupid to begin with. 2)Haruhi didn't have a \"just bad\" response from the audiences, she practically got kicked out of her own show and the moviehad no relation to her other than the name. So tell me dear animators, WHY does the b\u00a3$%&  with Lucy's voice need to come back?! I thought it was clear by now, we HATE her. And of course unlike Nagato who got a total personality liftover Haruhi remains the same annoying overenergetic little f$%& that desperately tries to grab attention but ends up pissing everyone off. Actually make that 3 problems: 3) What the hell is wrong with the blue-hair's eyebrows?!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway as usual the (unbelievably boring) Kyon joins the literature club, with Nagato as a president and her friend Eyebrows as the second member. They practically do nothing all day and it's just Nagato playing games, while slowly (very very slowly) developing a romance... Which is about as interesting as reading the Terms of Agreement in non-EA games, considering Ky-on has zero personality and Nagato is unbearable while Eyebrows is just the onee-chan character. It was tollerable though! Without the b$%^h everything felt much more relaxed than the original and despite this Nagato not being the one we loved it was still watchable... And then of course the b\u00a3$%h arrived and everything returned to the original level of s%\u00a3t that we were this close to forgetting.\\n\\n\r\nAbout halfway through, the anime did manage to catch our interest. Haruhi was mysteriously gone for mysterious reasons shrouded in mystery that I suspect were described by \"ratings plummeting to the ground\" and Nagato returned temporarily to the personality we all loved from the original. Granted Kyon was still as interesting as watching a cabbage grow, and ms Eyebrows was still taking too much screentime for her own good, but the anime became enjoyable at least. The emotionless loli is back biatches! Of course that couldn't last forever and eventually we returned to our beloved swamp of stupid.\\n\\n\r\nOh and before I forget: 4)What point is there to Asahina's existence? I mean, seriously, it was more common for the characters to mention that \"she has work to do\" than actually talking to her. 5)Kyon's voice acting... Plain awful, Asahina's voice acting... Unbearable (having to hear her in Wakaba girl is a challenge), Haruhis voice acting... You don't deserve to be Lucy you b\u00a3$%h! 6)Graphics were mediocre at best.",

            "content": "I had some serious mixed feelings about the disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan after re-watching the series, I decided to do yet another review. To begin, for starters and obviously, the show itself was unique. To see the Yuki I knew from the OG series turn into a klutzy, nervous wreck was a bit strange and somewhat amusing. What I did not like about that though is she reminded me too much of Mikuru. This was something I noticed a lot by Nagato's action while re-watching. It was like having a second slightly more annoying yet tolerable Mikuru around and it just didn't appeal to me.Something else that bothered me a little was that there were too many characters used in this show. It took away some of my focus on Yuki for the most part along with her development as the main character. This opinion of mine changed during the later half of the program though. At first I  didn't really think the amount of characters was necessary until I made it to the middle, no close to the end of the series. That's when it hit me that Haruhi, Ryouko, Mikuru, etc all have a bigger purpose (Kinda sort of.)\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the story is actually quite simple, However the way things occurred, why things were happening the way they were, and the other events that were explained by Nagato (The real one) were a bit difficult for me to understand. I felt like I wasn't left with much of a backstory on why things were happening during the entire time watching Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu. That aside, the pacing of the shows events was great. It was as if they saved the best for last. The show starts off a bit ridiculous however it slowly but surely develops into something greater in time. Honestly, I thought it was much worth the wait. The ending, I must say was a bit cliche. In fact the characters say it a lot about how certain things that are happening in an episode seem like they are straight out of a love or romance manga. So I'm going to agree on that. But overall The ending didn't bother me too much, it was still sweet and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and soundtrack in Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu where pretty good, I (as I am writing this) cannot remember if they used the same original soundtrack in the Haruhi series but it still sounds great. There where a few tracks that I'm assuming they added especially towards the end of the series which sounded pretty damn good if I do say so myself. Moving on, the voice actors are still pretty great. I watched the Japanese dub with English subtitles and it was pretty interesting hearing Chihara Minori \"Voice of Yuki Nagato\" change her voice from clumsy and nervous to serious and monotone in a few episodes of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic aside, the artwork and animation done on this series is always great. Some scenes are of course done so well that I could really tell when they were going all out. I believe it's in episode 9 where our characters are at a summer festival,  the scenery and animation seemed like it was improved just to enhance the atmosphere. There are lots of moments like this during the series however this moment stood out a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say whether or not I would recommend this series to anyone. Personally I think it's both a great... no, decent tear-jerker and comedy anime. However in the end, it's just a little too out of place for me to actually say whether or it's any good or just so bad it's good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave this show a solid 7 because it was in fact a unique concept with great visuals and audio along  with a decent story however it's too out of place in terms of story and timeline even if it's supposed to be about another character.",

            "content": "The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan.\r\nFuck this show. I hate it from the bottom of my heart. It was a disappointment in every regard.\r\nI'm not going to pretend like the original series was a masterpiece, because it isn't. But it was entertaining and charming (exept for Haruhi being a bully sometimes)\r\nEverything that made the original series fun is missing here.\r\nI find Nagato the most interesting in the original series. She's so mysterious and kicks ass when it needs to be kicked. Her usual self and the version in the alternatetimeline of the movie are both endearing. So when i heard that a Spin-off with Nagato asthe central character was coming up, I was soooo hyped. Exept for the movie, Nagato didn't get much screentime which i found particularly unfourtunate.\\n\\n\r\nWhen i heard it was going to be a romance, taking place in the alternative timeline and saw the new characterdesigns I was less hyped but still excited. I am completly open to the idea of making a lovestory with that version of Nagato.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just that the character called Nagato in this series isn't Nagato, it is a hollow shell of a character. The Nagato from the movie isn't that fleshed out, but she was depicted as a really shy, bookish, unsocial and lonley person. Instead we get a gluttonous, lazy, airheaded idiot we're supposed to find cute.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that the romantic elements are handeld so poorly that I wonder why they even bothered. So the rest of the show is just SoL, Great! The original series was just SoL with some supernatural elements mixed in so this should be fun aswell right? No, this is the most boring, generic and unimaginative SoL I have seen yet, on the level of bad fanfiction. It's like they where checking things of a checklist, in order to include every chlich\u00e9d scenario.\\n\\n\r\nBut if that wasn't enough it just doesn't make sense in context of the original Series. This wouldn't be really a problem if it didn't try to connect the two with forced, stupid references we're supposed to look at and yell:\\n\\n\r\n    \"Hey! I rembember that from the series\"\\n\\n\r\nPlus the animation and soundtrack is ten times worse.\\n\\n\r\nThere is absolutly no reason for anyone to watch this series. If SoL is the sand on the metaphysical anime Beach, then this show is a turd someone used to rip off a sandcastle.\\n",

            "content": "After hearing that the Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan Manga will be turned into an anime, I was very excited to say the least. After the last episode aired, I watched the whole anime over the course of the weekend - After initially having somewhat mixed feelings, especially because of the art, I ended up enjoying the series as a whole. Please note that this is my first review, so it will most likely be far from perfect.\r\nStory:\r\nSatelight took the first five volumes of this spinoff-manga (which is set in the alternate universe established in \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\") as work material. It is basicallyabout \"how would everything look like if Kyon chose differently\" - Which is a world without any aliens, time travelers, ESPs and the SOS Brigade. The story mainly revolves around Yuki and follows her through her life as a shy girl who fell in love. Nothing overly special, but still enjoyable. As consequence, you won't find anything supernatural in this series and there won't be any crazy happenings like you've got to see them in the main series. However, long-time fans who read the novels/watched the original anime series will notice a lot of nods towards it, among them the notorious \"Kyon-kun, denwa!\" which will probably strike terror into everyone who has seen Season 2. Those small nods were something I really appreciated, but still nothing to get extremely excited for.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is arguably the weakest point of this adaption. They switched the art style (which probably was to be expected, given a different studio was working on it) and the whole thing feels like a downgrade from the main series. Especially Kyon often looks way younger than he should and faces, especially Kyon's, look slightly weird at times. Once you get used to it it's not as bad anymore, but regardless of that, they could've put more effort into it; Though the different style does suit the spinoff well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe original cast has taken over their roles, as it should be. The result of this is some superb voice acting with the VAs doing their best to make the characters sound convincing, which more often than not succeeds. Emotions are carried across well and it rarely feels out of place or badly acted. Especially Minori Chihara did a great job playing the shy, clumsy Yuki Nagato which is a 180\u00b0 turn from the main series Yuki.\\n\r\nThe OP song \"Fure Fure Mirai\" (which is a play on \"Hare Hare Yukai\", the ending of the 1st season of the main series) is a typical J-Pop song, rather fast-paced, happy-go-lucky style. Enjoyable, but nothing special.\\n\r\nThe ED \"Arigatou, Daisuki\" on the other hand sounded great, being a slow paced song sung by Minori Chihara. I found myself listening to it every time due to how well it was made.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are very distinct, each of them having their own, vastly different personalities. The character development is mainly focused on Yuki and Kyon, however Ryoko and Haruhi also \"expand\" a bit over time. The other side characters are pretty much stagnant; that being said, there isn't all too much development over the course of the series, but it does exist.\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are quite enjoyable as it still feels like they have personality and aren't just bland.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDespite lacking some more depth, the mediocre art and other flaws, this is still an enjoyable series with a lot of funny & cute moments. If you are a fan of the main series however, you need to make sure to realize that this is merely a spinoff and you won't find more of the \"classic\" Haruhi here. No aliens, no supernatural happenings, no sci-fi. Once you can accept this and start watching this with an open mind, it will be much easier for you to enjoy. If you don't, you're most likely going to dislike it. On the same side, people who want an overly convoluted love story with a lot of twists and extremely deep character development, this might not be for you either. Everyone else can give this a shot and will most likely get at least some enjoyment out of it.",

            "content": "This show is basically a high school AU of a series that was already set in high school. It's also a giant middle finger to everyone who wanted a 3rd \"real\" season of Haruhi.\r\n[POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS FOR THE HARUHI SERIES, BUT NOT THIS SHOW (though I can't imagine why you'd even be here if you haven't seen the original)]\r\nWhere to begin? Let's star with our main charater, Yuki Nagato. I'll do my best to refrain from making this whole review just a comparison to the original, but the stark contrast in characterization between this show and the original in the character of Yuki Nagato isjust astounding. Originally, Yuki was a direct homage/shout-out to Neon Genesis Evangelion's Rei Ayanami, being a very quiet, passive bookworm emotionless-girl character. She did occasionally display hints of emotion however (much like Rei), which is what made her interesting. However, the main character of this show (whom I'll be referring to as Yuki-chan) is a completely different character. Yuki-chan is some kind of hopeless romantic who has barely any depth and doesn't even read books (preferring video games instead). Let me repeat that, SHE DOESN'T EVEN READ BOOKS.\\n\\n\r\nLet me back up a bit. Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu (or NYcnS) is loosely based on an alternate universe which was a major plot point in the Disappearance arc of Haruhi canon. In it, everyone is \"normal.\" A notable feature of it is that Yuki is no longer \"emotionless\" but rather acts more like a human being should, and the rest of her personality (being an extremely quiet and reclusive bookworm) is left in tact. She still reads books! NYcnS more or less uses this universe as its setting, with the main difference being that the main character Kyon doesn't realize anything is wrong (and is also no longer the main character... more on him later).\\n\\n\r\nBut the thing is, NYcnS's version of Yuki doesn't even use the canon Disappearance-arc AU Yuki. As I said, she doesn't even read books. Instead, she's more of just a generic mo\u00e9 blob who has an obvious crush on a classmate, and happens to share Yuki's general appearance. All subtlety and depth to her character are gone. Her defining character traits are gone. Actually, why was she even in the literature club in the first place? I don't recall the show ever explaining this.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough about Yuki-chan, there's plenty more wrong with this show.\\n\\n\r\nI won't pretend that the original series was perfect, or that its characters were especially well developed, but NYcnS somehow makes them all even more bland and forgettable than before. This is reflected rather well in the equally generic and bland art style. Art-wise, ex-main character Kyon might be the biggest victim, looking almost nothing like he did and instead looking like a bland anime boy (more so than normal). Where before, Kyon was the viewpoint-character of the series, whose deadpan-snarker personality and inner-monologue quips added a lot of humor to the show and made him a fun audience surrogate character that stands out from most. But now, with him being merely a supporting character, whose thoughts we can't hear, he's become pretty pointless, generic, and bland. Kyon's only function in the story now is to be the object of Yuki-chan's desires. I know I've been using words like \"bland\" and \"generic\" a lot, but those words pretty much sum up this whole show.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show, there are numerous references and shout-outs to the original series, but the problem is that they all just make me wish I was watching that instead. The most egregious example is when someone says something like \"someone I know threw a murder-mystery event last year as a joke.\" (referencing a mini-arc from the original) Wow, that sounds fun! Much more fun than whatever we're doing right now. Gee, I wish we could be watching that instead.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big glaring problem with this show is how much it relies on bad anime tropes and cliches. The original at least had the \"well, Haruhi wishes it to be that way\" justification hand-wave, but this show has no excuse. I know I've been comparing it to the original a lot, but I would like to stress that I do not think this show works on its own either. The comedy is weak and the story is so forgettable I barely even remember there being one.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, I really don't have a problem with this *type* of show, in that a light-hearted rom-com set in high school can be, and sometimes is, a lot of fun, even without much depth. The problem is that there just isn't anything interesting here. Really, what's the point of this show existing? Who sat down and said \"lets make a more boring version of Haruhi\" ? There are plenty more canon Haruhi light novels that haven't been adapted, why did they instead go with this? Imagine if there was an X-Files spinoff, where Mulder and Scully weren't FBI agents and nothing supernatural ever happened, and also Scully had a vastly different personality and Mulder didn't care about supernatural stuff at all. You'd say \"but wait, why are the characters even called Mulder and Skully? There's nothing X-Files about this.\" That's basically this show.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, not worth you time, whether you're a fan of the Haruhi series or not. I've seen worse, but there are so many better shows in this genre. I just hope that if we ever see Haruhi again, she'll be the leader of the SOS Brigade once more.",

            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nIf you're a person like me who shipped Kyon and Yuki since The Disappearance movie (it's even in my nickname), then don't expect that much from this adaption, because you will only get a pretty clich\u00e9 romcom. Why? Well, it has everything that would define something like it: ruined love confessions (check), misunderstandings (check), fluffy scenes between the main characters (check), an ending that doesn't round up anything thanks to some freaking fireworks (check).\r\nI expected a good resolution from this, something that would only be read or seen in fanfictions, something that would make my \"dreams come true\", but the series took the easyway, wasting 13 episodes with absolutely nothing and 3 amazing ones to end with a \"you didn't hear what I said because of the fireworks, right?\" For an ending like that, I would prefer Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.\\n\\n\r\nWith my hope at 100%, I started loving the series because it gave me what I wanted: more from the world of Haruhi and a genuine love story between Nagato and Kyon. I didn't even care for those 13 episodes of nothing because I thought that at least at the end, the series would give me a kiss  or a solid confession or something that would make me spend 50 dollars for the release. Hell, I was so wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAt least, these series gave me one of my favorite songs im Japanese (i.e. Arigatou, daisuki, the ED song beautifully sung by Minori Chihara), more from the original dub cast, and 3 interesting episodes (with some little touches of Serial Experimes Lain) where we could see the Nagato from the original series.\\n\\n\r\nYes, these series was a real disappointment. There are few things to save from this adaption. It was good at the beginning, interesting development at final part of the series, an amazing ending song. It even reunited the old cast from the original series. But no, I won't waste my money on something that ended in such a mediocre point. As I said before, I prefer Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun because it at least have some of the best comedy out there that would make me rewatch it again and again, without any care of the final.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I know, the manga isn't finished yet, so it might give me that ending that I expected since the moment I discover this spinoff. Maybe it will give me that ending that I wanted from this series.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The absurdity of the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimiya franchise is without a doubt it's most endearing quality. The use of outlandish and bizarre science-fiction characters to create what an ultimately rather mundane high school comedy has a rather cunning, almost satirical bent to it which has allowed the series to endure far longer than most other work in the genre. But more than just being funny, the set-up also provides the opportunity to explore more philosophical matters from time to time.\r\nIn Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu, or \"The Disappearance of Yuki Nagato\" in English the balance between the mundane and the philosophical is tipped slightly inthe former's favour. That's not to say the science fiction elements are absent completely, but it's far more like a traditional high school harem series than the original was: far more time is spent on typical activities than before. That's not all: some of the cast members have had their personalities tweaked slightly for this series.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Nagato herself has a similar composure to the character from earlier series, being quiet and reserved, but now more closely resembles the behaviour of a real person. Her tendency to be quiet is no longer the result of a robotic mind but of shyness. She's also now a bit clumsy, no doubt in order to better cater to a certain kind of individual. Another character who has been changed is Ryouko Asakura, the murderous class representative of the first series. Her confident and slightly intimidating personality is retained, but is now concentrated on looking after Nagato. Her role is much larger than before too, in fact after Yuki and Kyon, she is the most important character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nTsuruya, the green haired ball of energy is also more important this time around, while Mikuru, Koizumi and Haruhi have been relegated to the sidelines. This shift has changed the direction of the series dramatically and even though these characters have not been altered their limited presence has had an effect on the series which is even greater than the more conventional approach. If you feel sentimental about the original series then there is a good chance you won't find this series as appealing as the others. The same goes for those who dislike the cutesy, mixed signals kind of romance that you find in other high school anime. This is a recurring theme, particularly in the earlier episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBut do not think that the series has become completely saccharine. On the contrary, this series raises far deeper philosophical questions than either the first or the second series do. Events conspire such that one character may be killed inadvertently to save another, a moral dilemma similar to the famous problem about an out of control trolley running down a hill. Though the set-up which prompted this dilemma are fictional, the ramifications of them are significant. The presentation of it is rather stirring too, and you may find yourself feeling rather melancholic about the whole affair when it's through.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of presentation, you may have noticed that the art style is radically different from the series which were produced by Kyoto Animation, and more closely resemble the artwork in the original light novels. The change is slightly distracting at first but the relative simplicity of it is ultimately rather charming. Though the colouring could be better: embarrassment is signalled with a change of skin tone rather than facial expression, and it feels lazy.\\n\\n\r\nMercifully, the original voice actors have been retained for this series, so no-one need worry about adjusting to a new Haruhi unless you watched the original series dubbed. The background music is pretty catchy too, but if you were expecting themes capable of rivalling the Hare Hare Yukai or Bouken Desho Desho you are going to be very disappointed, as both the OP and ED for this series are dreadful low-tier pop songs that have none of the excitement or fun that the original series themes did.\\n\\n\r\nBut music isn't everything, and unless you are the kind of person that can't stand the idea of your favourite characters being meddled with, then overall this series does rather well. And fortunately for us, those two legacies actually can co-exist with one another simultaneously.",

            "content": "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, an anime that when it was aired, has regard to be one of the most well known anime since its release on account of its overall wackiness and parodying of everything, it's odd set of characters including a time traveling moe girl, a kuudere alien, and an esper, and the one character to bring it all together, Haruhi, the hyperactive god character.  So, with Satelight taking over the Haruhi franchise by producing us this spin-off, what are we as the audience to expect?\r\nStory (6.22/10): The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki, contrary to the rest of the Haruhi series, is verydifferent in its setting.  Taking place in the Disappearance world of the Haruhi universe, where Haruhi and Koizumi go to a different school, Asakura isn't a homicidal alien, and Nagato is a moe creature rather than a cool kuudere, the story follows our main protagonist Kyon as he basically...does what he did in the original Haruhi series, which is spending time with the title girl in the series.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of differences to the original Haruhi series, this Spin-off bears only some resemblance to the flow and plot points.  For the most part, the series focuses mainly on Kyon and the rest of the Haruhi cast in their disappearance roles, getting into various wacky situations without all of the supernatural business that goes on.  The thing that irks me though is the fact that the show plays out like a generic rom-com with many cliche romcom scenes that don't really provoke much feeling.  It's so reliant on this way of storytelling, that it really doesn't make the story all too entertaining and rather bland.  One of the reasons for this perception is because this show is connected to the Haruhi series, where that show is known for being out there in terms of...well basically everything.  Contrasting that with a platonic romantic comedy just sort of clashed.  \\n\\n\r\nThe actual content of the show has a couple ups and downs.  Because Nagato is now a shy, moe creature, the show uses that to create a lot of moe moments that admittedly are cute, but are used quite often and overturn the flow of the story.  But my biggest complaint about this show is towards the end where they create the \"disappearance\".  I'll be honest, that didn't really make a whole lot of sense.  The issue is the fact that they just throw it right in front of you and expect things to fall into place without really a proper explanation as to why what happened was happening.  When introduced, it was just kind of confusing, and when it ended, things just didn't make any sense, and when plot points don't really make any sense, that's considered a flaw in my book.\\n\\n\r\nThere is still the upside of this show being part of the Haruhi series.  Throughout the show, the show references the original Haruhi in a vast amount of ways, even creating several plot points that have parallel settings; so if you're a hardcore Haruhi fan, you'll appreciate what they throw at you there.  (That goddamn endless 8 reference at the end...)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nagato Yuki had its ups and downs in terms of story.  Without any ties to the Haruhi series, I don't think it would've done as well as it could've just on the simple fact that it was a rom-com story that had no resolution.  (Seriously though, don't expect any ships to sail here.  They all sunk.)  It was a bit of boring because it just simply didn't try and go beyond what it was and it never attempted to create a resolution to the story.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Haruhi references\\n\r\n-  Platonic Rom-com story \\n\r\n-  No proper resolution\\n\r\n-  Some confusing plot points\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.01/10): Because this is a Haruhi series, the characters in Yuki Nagato are basically the same people that you see in the original show, just made to be slightly different. \\n\\n\r\nUp first, our main protagonist, Kyon.  (Cause apparently, no one knows his actual name and resorts to calling this guy by a nickname.)  Contrary to his original counterpart, Kyon isn't the fish-eyed bored person that he was back in the original series.  Rather, he's a bit more cheerful, a little more willing to have some fun with people rather than be reluctant as all hell on whatever heinous thing they're doing.  (He still keeps his wit, so that's a plus.)  While the show is based around his perspective with Kyon doing the narrative and all, his development appears only later on in the series when it takes a different turn, which is ok, but even with it, the show just sort of returns back to the status quo that it had at the beginning of the series, which didn't bode well for it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Yuki Nagato, the title character of the series.  As I have mentioned before, this spin-off takes place in the disappearance world, meaning that Yuki is no longer the cool kuudere who sits in the corner of the room reading books, but rather is a little moe creature who drools at the word Turkey, and appreciates vita games more than books.  Throughout the series, the show focuses on Yuki and her relationship with Kyon, as virtually almost every character knows about her \"little crush\" with Yuki failing (unsurprisingly) to take a step in the right direction to make her love a reality.  The thing about Yuki that I find interesting is what happens towards the end of the series where the show takes a dramatic tone change.  There, we have a plot point that makes sense in a Haruhi setting, but the show just doesn't pull through with it, leading up to the aforementioned half-assed conclusion.  It's not as if this development of her character is bad, because it put interest back into the series for me, it's just that it doesn't explore it deep enough to get a proper explanation, resulting in some plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, since I've been saying her name an awful lot, we have Haruhi, who, because she is no longer the title character, is now part of the supporting role.  Compared to her other world self, Haruhi doesn't bear any difference in character, as she is still the hyperactive UMA searching, Kyon enslaving girl who just now has longer hair.  While the show doesn't specifically focus on her as much, she still plays a very vital role in the series, as she is the one who once again, drags everyone into her schemes and forces everyone to follow what she does.  For Haruhi, this is fine for her character.  What I didn't like was how they attempted to shove in a love triangle aspect to the series, making some very obvious implications that Haruhi sees Kyon as more than a manservant.  It's bad because there really is nothing else that the series did for that plot point aside from a few silent moments form her, so it made me question the point of it since they never went through with it.  \\n\\n\r\nLikewise, most of the other Haruhi characters make appearances in this story.  Those characters most prominently being Koizumi, Mikuru, Tsuruya, and Asakura, who, like I mentioned before, is no longer a homicidal alien, but rather more like a \"mother\" towards Nagato, cooking her food, taking care of her, and the occasional scolding.  In terms of development or importance, everyone apart from Asakura doesn't get ample screentime.  They for the most part stay with what you would expect from these characters' personalities, minus the supernatural stuff that Haruhi imparted onto them.  Because they're virtually the same, there's not really much to talk about since Mikuru is still Mikuru, Koizumi is still Koizumi, and Tsuruya is still Tsuruya.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent Main characters\\n\r\n+ Side characters are the same (basically)\\n\r\n+ Haruhi is still Haruhi\\n\r\n-  Some unnecessary characteristics associated with unfinished plot points\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.00/10): The art for Nagato Yuki was not created by KyoAni like the rest of the Haruhi series, but rather by Satelight, who created an all new style of animation that makes the majority of the characters (noticeably Kyon), a hell of a lot different looking than their original look.  The animation itself doesn't really stand out all too much, since it's just standard fare, but it's the characters themselves that have such a big impact since we, the anime community, are familiar with seeing these characters a certain way. \\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you're a fan of this style of animation is up to you, so I can't say anything else beyond the fact that there's ups and downs with the new look of them all.  All I can say is, get used to seeing life in Kyon's eyes.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, the show has an OP that bears in some resemblance to the style of music that the original Haruhi series had.  With a bright and wacky song to compliment its mother series, it's a decent listen, but it to me, it doesn't resonate with me all that well and I don't find it to be as enjoyable as other people may do.  (Thats my personal opinion.)  On the other hand, the ED is a more melancholy sound.  (Ah...)  Contrary to the more bubbly songs of the mother series, there is no signature dance, there is no happy go lucky song, but rather a track that pertains to what happens on in the second half of the series.  Personally, I felt like it didn't really fit with the series considering that the majority of the show was a very slice-of-life/rom-com style of story, and it sort of clashed that feeling with the ED.  \\n\\n\r\nSide Note: The original cast of the Haruhi series voice all of their respective characters, so you don't have to worry about anyone sounding weird or anything.  Except maybe Nagato, because Minori Chihara uses the moe voice of Nagato over the kuudere version in this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Art is standard fare\\n\r\n+/- Different animation (positive or negative depending on whether you're a fan of the new designs.)\\n\r\n+/- Decent tracks, but not memorable for me\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (5.44/10): While I am personally a fan of the Haruhi series, Yuki Nagato never truly gave me that sense of entertainment when watching this.  I had expected the show to be different, seeing as how Haruhi wasn't the title character of the series, but I never expected the show to be so bland and in some scenes, uninteresting.  As a result, the score itself is quite low.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this show?\\n\\n\r\nWhile I do have many problems with this spin-off, it wasn't always completely bad.  There were the moments where the show at times was rather entertaining.  The only issue is the fact that those moments only appeared when Haruhi was around to cause havoc.  When she wasn't in the frame in some sense or another, the show didn't really have much to stand on beyond being a boring rom-com plot.  A bit of this is partly due to the fact that I'm more of a Haruhi fan than a Nagato fan, but even then, there should be moments in the show that should be able to stand on its own two legs.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like the show?\\n\\n\r\nApart form the obvious generic plotline, the ending really gritted my teeth because there simply wasn't any resolution to the series.  It went back to the status quo, which basically got rid of almost every bit of progress this show tried to make when progressing episode to episode.  In addition, they put in the whole love triangle thing which really didn't do anything for the series because it was never used and wasn't just implied, it was heavily implied with several scenes devoted to imply it even further.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen any part of the Haruhi series, most importantly, The \"Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\" movie, then I would say you have enough background to understand what is going on in this series.  (I recommend that because you will be lost otherwise.)  Also, if you're a Nagato fan, you may enjoy this as well.  While I may not have personally enjoyed the direction that it went, it's not completely terrible, as there are some aspects that I did actually find enjoyable.  However, because it plays out like a rom-com, expect it to be a rom-com because that's the main plot point of the show, and the direction that it goes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.48/10",

            "content": "The spring 2015 anime Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu also known as the disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan this is the 2nd just not appealing boring anime ive seen in the spring season next to triage x but at least triage had the fan service going for it.\r\nStory- You can read the synopsis on it but to sum it up anime wise a shy girl named Nagato Yuki is the president of a club consisting of 3 members herself and a male and female who basically do club activities and stuff along those lines and also the love story that is on going throughout the series ofNagato having a crush on the male member of her club before the expansion of more members. the name doesn't fit the series until about episode 10 or 11 when the dramatic scene actually happens the \"disappearance\" part but to be honest the story was bland and boring the characters didn't help the story much either but its not mediocre but its not good at all. The most interesting thing about the series was like 2 characters and the \"disappearance\" part which was not executed the way id would've hoped it to be.\\n\\n\r\nArt- This is where the anime lacks the most the art isnt appealing at all it just looks meh not terrible but it isnt something that you would be interested in upon first glance with whatever looking characters and backgrounds that just look not so good it isnt something i would call good and also the animation also hinders it alot as well with certain walking scenes when another character is afar the background scene just makes it look bad and when the character is walking or running in this specific type of scene it shows the quality of the animation which isn't good but again i have seen worse.\\n\\n\r\nSound- honestly its a weak ost didn't notice anything special or good but i did enjoy the ed theme that was ok but it wasn't enough and the voice actors for Nagato,Asakura and Suzumiya i absolutely enjoyed other than that its just average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- ima give this a 7 just because i liked Nagatos character although it wasn't anything new i still enjoy a quite female protagonist whos shy and cute but that's my personal liking other than that nothing amazing but its good for what it is and Asakura also was a plus her character was more so like a mother figure to Nagato giving her advice cooking for her and bending over backwards basically everything she does in the series is for Nagato at least 80% of the time and the voice actor fit the character which i appreciate. and Suzumiya which she is probably if not the best character on the entire span of the show when she appeared on the earlier episodes her character comes off as super energetic and some other traits that easily make her the most enjoyable character also you get some other characters not worth mentioning but they are whatever for most of the series nothing new and nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-  5/10 i wasn't looking forward to this series but i kept watching till the end i don't ever drop any anime that i choose to watch because you'll never know until you experience it yourself instead of hearing peoples opinions. I do not regret watching this because i was not hyped for it and in return i got what i expected a kinda below average slice of life series with other themes that honestly could have been executed better but wasn't and that ending didn't help the series in the least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 6/10 just a meh series but that's what i think if you watch and like alot of slice of life watch this. There is a manga that is currently ongoing if you are looking forward to this series just read it if you are not in that mood just watch it. \\n\\n",

            "content": "For those who have never taken the time or have not been with anime long enough to have given the parent series of Yuki-chan a thorough viewing then what you are provided with when watching this series is a story of comical romance surrounding the the character of Yuki Nagato, hence the name.  However is you are approaching this series because you are indeed a fan of the parent series then what you get is just a little bit more from the characters that you have likely come to love. Both are particularly good reasons to give the show a chance, even if thisparticular spin-off can be somewhat misleading with what the parent series actually provides. I present this review of Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu (The Disappearance of Yuki Nagato-chan) so you can decide if this show is for you. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the story of Yuki-chan is hard to hate seeing how it is written by the same beloved author of the show's parent series even if it resembles more of a stereotypical romantic comedy anime, but even so some of that eccentricity that a loyal viewer of Haruhi can relate to. As the story of Yuki Nagato-chan progresses this eccentricity that I speak of pulls this spin-off away from what is truly just a generic series, and provides a lovely perspective of 'Kyon's' life should a certain Haruhi have never existed. The art, surprisingly, is also worth mentioning seeing how a different studio has taken up the series after so many Haruhi-less years. The new art, although relatively close to that of the parent series, provides a much needed uniqueness to the show that reminds new and old fans alike that this series is not dead and we will hopefully see more of it in the future. A per usual of most high production anime the story and art are the better part of the pie and thus I reward an 8 and a 9 to them respectively. \\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department we see the return of every voice actress and actor that the parent series was completed with and it is hopeful that any English dub (none when written) will also provide the same English dub and actors as both dubs in the Parent series have proven spectacular and this series is no different. Yuki Nagato-chan is great successor to what many would call an excellent series and should find a permanent place to any fan's collection. I reward an 8 out of ten. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise the show has some limits however, this is a spin-off series and as result our main protagonist is a shy emotionally filled Yuki Nagato that was first introduced to old fans in the fourth book of the light novel series or in the franchise movie, \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya.\" This is a character that is worth loving but at the same time has some issues keeping up as the protagonist of her own show, as a result it seemed the author and studio reintroduced some initially not introduced characters. Otherwise this show would have lost a lot of watching value as the character of Yuki Nagato requires a lot of supporting roles in order to keep an average or casual audience interested. This of course probably wouldn't have been a problem assuming that the only ones that would've been watching this series were dedicated fans of the parent series and such a thing should not be assumed in the world of show production. With a lot of strong supporting roles Yuki Nagato gets a C on her test of being a good protagonist and thus is rewarded a generous 7 put of ten. Without prior knowledge of who the main protagonist is from the parent series (Yuki Nagato), then a casual viewer would not see anything particularly interesting about this Yuki which is just a shy girl with a crush. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally I could only call my enjoyment of this show as fair, being a loyal fan of the Haruhi series it seemed as thought this was just a little bit more of the characters I have come to love with no actual story progression of what we have already seen. Of course this is a spin-off and I knew this before jumping into the manga and show and so I can only speak personally when saying these things, but as an added note I do find it to be a well deserved addition to the Haruhi series and would recommend it to anyone that has seen the parent series and would recommend any newcomers to Haruhi to watch the parent series first. So for my enjoyment of the series I reward a 6 and give this spin-off the overall score of 7. This is generic romantic comedy, but it is an average anime with many reasons to dislike and just as many to reasons to like it.",

            "content": "If you've watched the Haruhi Suzumiya series, I'm pretty sure, that at least once you asked yourself the question, \"What if?\" If you haven't watched it, stop reading this, there are spoilers in this, or go ahead, I don't care! \r\nMany people will tell you what their fanficton-material stories would be, and somewhere you'll find someone asking, \"What if Haruhi wasn't a god, and what if nobody had their powers?\" And while I could just take that one scene from the Disappearance movie, and type out a thesis on Kyon's amazing monologue, I'll just throw this in your face: The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan...\r\nIt isa spin-off series that perfectly answers the above question. But before you jump off of your seat and start looking for the anime on the Internet, (yes, I'm talking to you, avid fans of the franchise!) keep in mind that this IS NOT A SEQUEL TO THE MOVIE. Instead, what we have, is a pleasant slice-of-life romance, involving the main duo, Yuki and Kyon. Yes, I know that those of you who despise that genre will be sickened by this, but as a big fan of the original franchise, I think that this is a good thing to put in. I mean, if we ignore all the fanfictions and doujinshi material, we can see that in the original anime, there was never any romance between any of the characters. Well okay, you could include Episode 6 from the \"first season\" as something between Kyon and Haruhi, but that wouldn't end up anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nFrom what I've said already, there isn't much to add. The slice of life genre may be a turn-off to some people, but if you sit through it you'll get used to it soon enough...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nLet's be honest, the characters are the main reason why anybody would watch this show... From all of the characters, the only one to change is Yuki. In the original series she was an emotionless robot who hardly spoke, in the movie, she was extremely shy, and hardly spoke, and in this anime, she is also quite shy, but talks more. She also prefers to play video games rather than read books as we are used to. \\n\r\nThe other characters haven't seen much change in terms of their personalities. Haruhi is still loud and energetic, Koizumi is still her theoretical assistant, Asakura is the mother-like figure, Mikuru is still the same klutz as she was, and Kyon is just as much of a sarcastic joker as he was in the original...luckily. Honestly, he's in my top 10 anime characters for a reason!\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & SOUND\\n\r\nIf you weren't turned off by the fact that this is a slice of life anime, you'll get turned off by the animation. Maybe. \\n\r\nThe anime was made in April 2015, by Satelight Inc., (Log Horizon, AKB0048) and to be honest, it's not that great. Yeah, it isn't the same animation style from Kyoto Animation that we're used to, but even so, the animation is quite average for the most part. The characters are still recognisable, the only difference being Mikuru having dyed her hair slightly, and Kyon looking like he's twelve years old. The best parts of when the animation kicks into overdrive, are later on in the show, when the story becomes......interesting...\\n\r\nMy favourite part of the whole anime is the dub. Why? They got the old cast back!!! Yes yes yes, more Crispin Freeman, more Michelle Ruff, and more hilarity from the cast that has made one of the best English dubs in existence. The fact that the show has the entire old cast of voice actors back gives it an almost nostalgic feeling, like you can spend more time with these amazing characters... And although it is true that the first episode is a bit \"unstable\" in terms of the dub, it gets better very quickly.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, is OK. It mainly consists of soft piano music, but there are a few tracks that stand out... The opening and ending themes aren't bad, depending on your tastes....\\n\\n\r\nFINAL EVALUATION\\n\r\nLong story short, you'll most likely enjoy this show if you enjoyed the original for the characters and comedy. What will also greatly add to your enjoyment of it are references to the original series, those that will make you smile when you see them, although they are not that easy to spot. And also, for those of you who watched the original for the sci-fi, or for the dark and slow moments from the movie, there is one story arc in this show for you, which is absolutely brilliant, and it feels like it should belong in the original too.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nIt's not season three, as I have already said, but it's a good spin-off series, that just gives us an excuse to spend more time watching our favourite characters... Sure, it doesn't have ALL of the Haruhi-ness we are used to, but there's a good amount for anyone to enjoy. \\n\r\nIf only KyoAni could make Season 3....COME ON !",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nIn the school of thought, there are two areas that are often compared and contrasted: the conscious and the subconscious. The former is what we are aware of, the actions we take that we knowingly carry out, whereas the latter is what happens \u201cwithout our knowledge,\u201d the actions we take that we unknowingly carry out. We often say that \u201cI subconsciously did this\u201d in response to doing something that we are unable to explain. But what is interesting is that we accept this \u201chidden\u201d part of ourselves. That is, despite having a main and understood self,we still believe there is a second, similar self within us. The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is connected to this notion of two selves, generating an anime that somewhat subconsciously loses itself along the way.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nSomething that not everyone learns is the notion of perspective. Having the ability to displace one\u2019s self, move outside of one\u2019s current view and look at a particular situation from a different vantage point, is valuable not only for the one shifting his or her perspective \u2013 since it reveals previously unknown ideas \u2013 but also for those being looked at differently \u2013 complete bias gives way to further understanding. The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan targets this same theme with mixed results.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s sign that its overall perspective is about perspective is in the way that it structures its narrative, and more specifically who is doing the narrating. Essentially, the plot shifts its perspective between three separate characters throughout the season: the regular Nagato, the \u201cnew\u201d Nagato, and finally Kyon. The majority of the anime follows regular Nagato (about the first ten episodes or so), with her segment more slice-of-life and romantic-comedy in nature. One moment she is sharing a drink with her crush while the next has her on vacation with all of her friends to enjoy life\u2019s small offerings. During her events, the anime is generally fun, upbeat, and lighthearted, as a simple foray into the Haruhi Suzumiya world that this spinoff comes from. Feelings of this kind are felt because the audience is viewing the anime from Nagato\u2019s perspective which coincidentally has these same emotions. Therefore the viewer comes to understand Nagato\u2019s thoughts directly from her, laying down the foundation for how the remainder of the season proceeds.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the emotions subsequently change when the perspective does, most notably when the show moves from regular Nagato\u2019s point of view to new Nagato\u2019s. No longer are the feelings related to elation but instead loneliness, depression, and sadness because that is how new Nagato perceives the environment around her. As a result, the anime also goes from being slice-of-life oriented to being dramatic in its presentation. Gone are the small talk and romps, replaced instead with trips to quiet libraries and nighttime park benches that encapsulate the plot\u2019s new focus. Haruhi\u2019s exclusion during this arc makes the switch even more apparent \u2013 the biggest ball of energy is purposefully missing to keep the show\u2019s current tone bogged down. Such a tonal shift contrasts harshly with the beginning, giving it higher impact on the viewer and therefore higher power since the effects are both immediate and palpable. But even more powerful is how the change in perspective allows for the audience, for the first time, to see regular Nagato from a new angle. Before it had always been through her eyes, through her own introspection. Now, she is seen from a point that is paradoxically inside and outside of herself due to new Nagato\u2019s special status. Consequently, the narrative showcases regular Nagato\u2019s thoughts and feelings through new Nagato, providing (coincidentally) a new angle to view the characters in question and thus the relationships involved.\\n\\n\r\nFor its final angle, the anime changes its perspective to Kyon, the character who has been the target of the girls\u2019 affections the entire time. Like new Nagato, the change in perspective can be seen in the reassembly of the anime\u2019s elements: Kyon\u2019s little sister is around more than ever, evident references to \u201cEndless Eight\u201d are included, and his previous connection to Haruhi is elaborated on. Perhaps obviously, the trend of morphing feelings continues, with this last iteration mirroring Kyon\u2019s awkwardness and unsureness. Again, these emotions are present not only because of the conflicting personalities and actions between the regular and new Nagato but also because the narrative is now from his point of view. This results in a similar investigation of the characters and relationships; the audience is now able to see both Nagatos from a perspective that is completely separate from them. Kyon wrestles with himself on what to do, he interacts with the characters in more meaningful ways \u2013 less joking and more personal \u2013 and his ultimate decision reflects the sort of middle ground that was necessary to succinctly conclude the problem at hand. The anime certainly could have flipped its perspective back to the regular Nagato but that would have reduced Kyon\u2019s plight and would not have meshed well with the newfound mood since regular Nagato was always about having a happy time.\\n\\n\r\nBut no matter how elated or melancholy the narrative gets, that does not immediately reveal what this perspective-shifting creates. In the case of The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan there is good news and bad news.\\n\\n\r\nThe good news is that the constant shifts in perspective allow the anime to escape from self-imposed narrow-mindedness. The situation between Nagato and Kyon is not relayed through a singular outlet but many outlets, altogether crafting a dynamic, rounded, and interesting tale that is open and explored since the multitude of perspectives prevents the anime from restricting its mindset. Since each main player\u2019s direction is elaborated on, the narrative is empowered because it is no longer streamlined and instead given the opportunity to reach the same destination \u2013 a satisfying resolution between the three characters \u2013 but from multiple paths at once.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the bad news is hefty and almost ruins the narrative entirely. In essence and inherently, the tactic of shifting perspectives has a major problem: losing itself along the way. Initially the anime is about regular Nagato\u2019s feelings toward Kyon but by the end it is about Kyon\u2019s feelings toward new Nagato. In other words, the show\u2019s original goals are never accomplished because the change in perspective brings with it a change in the conclusion. Using the multiple paths analogy once more, while the destination is reached, the anime chose to not look back or at least place markers along the roads it took. The implication, then, is that when the finale is over and it does see where it came from, it has no idea how it got to where it is at because there are too many paths to choose from without any sort of indication for which were taken when. Putting it differently, the conclusion makes it clear just how lost the anime is.\\n\\n\r\nWhen done right \u2013 which happens here \u2013 shifting the perspective illuminates new ways in which to view the narrative. When done wrong \u2013 which happens here \u2013 shifting the perspective conceals how the narrative got from start to finish. Collectively, the mixed concoction is neither wanted nor discarded but simply tolerated.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan chooses to employ a soft art style. Both the backgrounds and the character designs adopt this look as a means to make the anime more inviting; like a kind person, a show that is shown to be \u201ccaring\u201d is easier to approach. Along these same lines, the locations visited are familiar to both newcomers and veterans of the series. The clubroom, the school grounds, the library, Nagato\u2019s apartment, and the various areas within the city are visited, giving the anime a new yet nostalgic feel that further adds to the invitingness. Simultaneously, the show often makes use of a \u201cchibi\u201d art style, where characters and their faces become squatter and more exaggerated than normal to emphasize the comedy of the situation.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also worth highlighting the anime\u2019s expert representation of new Nagato\u2019s perspective. Where regular Nagato and Kyon have bright lighting and colors, new Nagato\u2019s arc is mired in darkness, with low lighting and more somber hues \u2013 mainly purples, blacks, and blues \u2013 that work together to make her perspective that much more sad.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 designs are actually rather plain, mostly as a result of the soft art style. Besides Haruhi\u2019s yellow ribbons and long, brown hair, the remainder of the designs all sort of blend together. The boring school uniforms, the weird hair colors, and the lack of extra detail (accessories or similar additions) keep the characters grounded in realism at the expense of interesting or memorable designs. Granted, the characters do fit their roles: Asahina\u2019s peach hair coincides with her girly behavior, Asakura\u2019s long blue hair and mature face matches her motherly instincts, and Yuki\u2019s short, purple hair and round glasses fit her shy attitude, to name a few examples. Meaning, the character designs, while uninspired, manage to be purposeful within the context of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation tends to sit somewhere in the average area due to the laidback dealings of the anime. In general, the show is never flashy or dull, instead showcasing the everyday dealings of high school teenagers. Characters interact with each other using typical body and facial movements, with a lot of the downtime regulated to them standing or sitting around having a conversation about themselves, each other, or the occurrence at hand.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan\u2019s approach to its characters is two-fold in more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, the characters embody a smorgasbord of personalities. Nagato is the clumsy girl, Kyon is the wisecracker, Asakura is the competitor, Haruhi is the hyperactive one, Koizumi is the quiet sage, and so on. The anime portrays them as such because that is who they are; of course, how could they be anybody else? Interestingly, besides Nagato\u2019s increased reactions and Asakura\u2019s more prominent role, the characters act much like they have been known to behave. That is to say, the traits that have defined them in the past \u2013 within the original series \u2013 have carried over into their present manifestations, providing the same sense of nostalgia that the art did. Indeed, people experience development over the course of their life but who they are and how they act is something that is persistent. Someone who is a partier remains a partier, someone who is a nerd remains a nerd. So, the cast of the show are the same: Nagato usually fumbles with common happenings, Kyon has a witty comment or two to share, and Haruhi is the one that designs the ridiculous activities. Characterizations like these are not just readily perceivable but also immediately attributable based on what the viewer learns and possibly has learned.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not that the partier cannot become the nerd and vice versa, but that people who portray themselves one way rarely lose that side of himself or herself. Geometrically, features are lines that connect a definition to the person in question. When someone is described as funny, that word strings the ideas of funniness with the one being described \u2013 he or she tells jokes, makes weird faces, uses overzealous motions, and so on. The same train of thought applies to the cast; calling Kyon sarcastic or Haruhi rambunctious causes the brain to start making connections.\\n\\n\r\nBut people are not one line, but many. Continuing to think with geometry, people are shapes, complex structures that weave and loop in intricate patterns. People are made up of a large amount of lines at once that, collectively, make someone who they are. In other words, people do not have just one side but several; people are multiple \u201cpersons\u201d at once. The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan showcases this mathematical premise with each of its characters. Kyon\u2019s wittiness and outward smartness sits alongside the worrywart and kind person that he is. Asakura might be a competitor at heart, but she is extremely motherly, treating Nagato like her own child. Haruhi is selfish and slightly crazy but she can be envious and sane when she wants to be. Even Koizumi, in all his infinite wisdom, would much rather flow like water, be a follower instead of the leader he seems destined for. Now, the majority of these are contradictions, where each person\u2019s \u201csecond person\u201d goes against their regular self, but this pronounces the type of shapeshifting people experience. People can, and often are, polar opposites of themselves, both because they are allowed to be and because it is simply another side to the shape.\\n\\n\r\nA potential problem arises when the most important character, Nagato Yuki, is used in conjunction with this line of thinking. As is shown, the anime depicts the regular and the new Nagato as different people entirely. Not the same person with two distinct halves but rather two distinct people. That is, it appears as if the Nagatos do not follow this train of thought since the anime goes out of its way to say, \u201cThis is one Nagato and this is another,\u201d that it is not one Nagato with multiple sides but instead two separate women. But they do. Regular Nagato is surely shy but hidden beneath her hiding exterior is a girl looking for and wanting love. New Nagato is a bit more reserved yet sure of herself. While she was not looking for love, it found her, with the understanding she had of her person encouraging her to press on where the other Nagato never could.\\n\\n\r\nThe Nagatos being two separate people, with their own set of traits, features, and quirks that make them composed of several \u201cpeople,\u201d is ultimately the anime\u2019s message: a person is composed of a mishmash of shapes that make him or her a completely unique one. In a way, the show is alluding to the original series, with its characters having identities separate of their \u201cnormal\u201d selves that made them special individuals. Kyon\u2019s final talk goes down the way it does because he understands this notion, how people are made up of multiple facets that make them who they are, make them stand-out from everyone else. He sees that it was not the regular Nagato he started to have feelings for but the new Nagato, with her books, quietness, and confidence that allured him. It was new Nagato\u2019s shape, not regular Nagato\u2019s, that seemed so appealing. Kyon\u2019s words do not have romance flourish between any of the couplings, but it highlights the importance of differentiation. Differentiating not only between people but also between ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nAs it stands, the entire cast lacks major development despite the drama instilled, which would seem to hamper their execution. However, due the characters\u2019 theme on multiplicity being as involved as it is, their purpose is not entirely folded into nothingness.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is very ecstatic, which is strange since this is an anime about Nagato and not an anime about Haruhi. Regardless, the upbeat nature of the piece comes from the quickness, multiple vocalists, and weird instrumental effects that make the track itself pretty crazy. A little too crazy, given the content of the anime during the latter portions of the series. It can be fun to listen to at times but is mostly forgettable. The ending theme is the opposite, in tempo, emotion, and memorability. The vocalist gives a strong performance, the sentimental tone is serene, and the backup choir supports the main singer well. It is a track filled with loneliness, longing, and love, each of which can be easily felt when listening to it both when and when not watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the soundtrack is two-fold like the characters. Since half of The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is a comedy, many of the tracks are similarly fun, with beach-like tunes, acoustic sounds, and faster beats to fit the occasion. The other half is dramatic, with accompanying flutes, pianos, and violins taking up much of the music. The dramatic pieces are better than the comedic ones mainly as a result of the passion they exude when compared to their silly brethren. Overall, the OST is a nice group of songs that are neither strong nor weak, used when needed but lacking power.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the show is somewhere above average. Many of the voice actors and actresses reprise their roles, such as Minori Chihara as Nagato, Tomokazu Sugita as Kyon, and Aya Hirano as Haruhi. Minori Chihara in particular gave a wonderful performance, providing a voice that is awkward, quiet, and straining, portraying Nagato as the pitiable yet hopeful lead. Alongside Tomokazu Sugita\u2019s sarcastic and overly-manly voice for Kyon, Aya Hirano\u2019s peppiness for Haruhi, and the remainder of the men and women giving nice performances, the cast as a whole gave the show some much-needed life.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI would not consider myself a fanatic (aka, a fan) when it comes to the Haruhi series. I think it is well-done \u2013 and yes that does include the second season that seems to literally define repetition \u2013 but I never find myself talking about the series to someone else or even suggesting it. Again, not that I hate the series or find it missing in execution, which are both untrue, it is simply always sitting somewhere slightly outside of my mind. The movie which, coincidentally enough, shares nearly the exact same name as this series, is a whole different beast that should be viewed by everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, as I was watching this one, I found myself liking it. It was because of the romance aspect; watching Nagato squirm, stutter, and smile her way towards the love she wanted was cute to watch, as was all of the blushing and courage she sporadically had. The references to the original were cool throwbacks, too. They were used sparingly and appropriately: not too much so that it became indistinguishable from the original series and not too little so that it forgot its origins. Comedy-wise, the show also had a foothold, with reaction faces, character interactions, and skits that would usually get a laugh out of me now and again.\\n\\n\r\nBut as the anime began switching its perspective, so did I. I started to find the show less and less entertaining the further along it progressed. New Nagato\u2019s segment is arguably the strongest part of the anime, but it was a section that was honestly quite boring. I wanted Nagato to continue fighting for Kyon\u2019s attention. I wanted Kyon and Haruhi\u2019s personalities to still be around. I wanted Asakura\u2019s overprotection. I wanted the fun, the romance, back. But I did not get what I wanted. What I got was a show that was not what it was before, making me, like Nagato, longing for that which I could not have.\\n\\n\r\nFor a final note, I want to say that, despite Minori Chihara\u2019s amazing performance, I hated Nagato\u2019s voice. Nagato acted cute but spoke in a way that was unfavorable. It was not deafening or unbearable, but it was grating and annoying. Each time she started to speak, I was wondering when she would stop because it sounded like she was struggling, drowning in a sea of her own vocal chords. To be fair, that is sort of the point \u2013 she is a super-shy girl that has difficulty socializing with others \u2013 but that did not prevent me from disliking her each time she opened her mouth.\\n\\n\r\nThe Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is an anime that has surprisingly strong themes on perspective and variability of the self, with mediocrity within its remaining parts unfortunately covering them. The story gets lost in some woods, the characters\u2019 development gets misplaced in a cabin, and the music gets abandoned on a mountainside, each with zero chance of recovery since the show never attempts to find them. At the minimum, the anime, like its lost items, will continue to exist in the subconscious of those that have seen it: always there but not quite remembered.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, the narrative\u2019s tendency to shift its perspective gives it new angles but simultaneously causes it to lose itself along the way\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, nice art style, adequate character designs, about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, while missing a lot of development, the cast demonstrates the idea of multiplicity in ourselves\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, fun and comedic in the beginning, reducing in entertainment the further along it proceeds, with Nagato\u2019s grating voice persistent from start to finish\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

Its genius philosophy, supernatural comedic charm, time traveling, kickass music and general random happenings?\r\nNow imagine if the Haruhi Suzumiya series had NONE of that at all.\r\nWell there you go, Disapparance of Nagato-Yuki in a nutshell.\r\nStory 2/10\r\nSo the premise is basically \"What if Kyon never tried to stop Nagato and just let her rewrite the universe where everyone is normal\" \r\nMy honest opinion: If you were like me and felt really sorry for Nagato at the ending of Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, well don't feel sorry anylonger! Cause this anime will help you come to the decision that Nagato is better off as an emotionless robot after all(This should be a f**king ad!)\\n\\n\r\nA series known for being unique and even greatly influenced anime culture is thrown out of context and replaced with a mediocre slice of life rom-com! And here's the best f**king part, there isn't even a gaddamn confession! Seriously the purpose a rom com is that you build up to a somewhat epic love confession at the last episode and they can't even f**king do that! (Yeah, I can feel all the slice of fans raging over this)\\n\\n\r\nThe whole shows feels like an insult to the Haruhi series. Filled with bad plot, recycled jokes from the main Haruhi series (Hell, at one point they tried to reenact Endless Eight) Just...dreadful to watch\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 2/10\\n\r\nI know a different studio handled this adaption so I won't point fingers on this part. But just know its still shit\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\r\nNow you may be wondering why I gave this a 3? Well that's cause the show's only saving grace was its side character. Who is this side character you ask? Well, its the f**king diva queen herself, Haruhi gaddamn Suzumiya. In the original series I may have hated her guts but in this one I welcomed it with open arms. I enjoyed every second she was on screen cause she actually advances the plot! (On the 5th episode she marched right in North High and started the uhm...Literature Brigade?)\\n\\n\r\nThe other saving grace would be Nagato Yuki herself, halfway through the series Nagato gets in a spontaneous car accident (for plot reasons) and wakes up as the emotionless Nagato we all know and love. When that happened I literally threw my arms in the air and shouted \"YES\" as loud as I could (Don't get your hopes up tho, it only last for 3 episodes, that was the only good point of the series.)\\n\\n\r\nBtw if you're some horny dude that enjoys all the fanservice Asahina gave in the main series? Forget it, the amount of screen time she got in this series can probably amount up to 1 and a half episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall 1/10\\n\r\nYou know how to tell when an anime is bad? Its when the mandatory beach/hotspring episode can't even save the series. Hell, they had BOTH beach and hotspring epsiodes back to back and it still sucked!\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I've never given such a low review before on a series. (Except maybe for Glasslips, now thats another shit stain I'll probably rage about later)\\n\\n\r\nIts so bad that if I had to choose between watching Endless Eight all over again over this series? I'll take my chances with Endless Eight.\\n\\n\r\nBut in general, don't watch this, whether you're a Haruhi fan or not just don't watch this garbage",

            "content": "As a fan of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, I won't hesitate to watch or read (or at least plan to) anything related to that series. Of course, that includes this spin-off, The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan. I read a few volumes of the manga and loved it, so when this anime was announced, my excitement was only doubled! However, I admit that I also had my concerns, as Kyoto Animation, the studio that worked on the original anime, didn't work on the spin-off. As it aired, I found that it wasn't received that well, either. However, that doesn't change the fact that I stillreally enjoyed The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so does anyone remember The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya? This anime takes place in the alternate world from that movie, where everything is normal and there is no aliens, time travelers, or espers whatsoever. Yuki Nagato is a shy girl who is nothing like the Yuki Nagato we all know and love. This Yuki is a member of the Literature Club, along with Ryoko Asakura and Kyon. Yuki also happens to have a crush on Kyon. Basically, the anime follows Yuki as she goes through her everyday life with the Literature Club and her feelings for Kyon develops.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, a majority of the characters have changed. As I've said before, Yuki is now a really shy girl, and Kyon is kinder in comparison to the original. Ryoko Asakura is also different from the original; she acts as more of a motherly or a sisterly figure to Yuki. I wasn't really a fan of her in the original anime, and I'm guessing other Haruhi fans can understand why. However, that's not to say everyone's completely different. Mikuru still retains her character from the original series (which is a good thing, as I LOVED her in the original series), and Haruhi is still as fun of a character as ever. Even so, even the characters whose personalities have changed were still fun to watch, although I can't deny that they're still not the same as the ones we know and love.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a good one, with lots of comedy and drama. The story is especially great in episodes 10-13, where the Yuki Nagato we all know and love is shown to us. The animation, I admit, is not as good as in the original series. What do you expect, though? It wasn't Kyoto Animation that did the animation this time; instead, it was Satelight. As a result, the animation is more bright and more cutesy, and it takes a while to get used to. It's not bad animation at all, though; in fact, Satelight did a good job with the animation. The voice actors also did a great job at reprising their roles, as expected. The OP and ED are great, too; I could listen to them on repeat without getting bored!\\n\\n\r\nLet's face it, everyone; The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is NOT a Haruhi Season 3. However, it's still a really, really, REALLY enjoyable anime. If anyone liked Yuki Nagato from The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya and want to see more of her, this anime is PERFECT for you. It's given me even the tiniest of hopes that The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya will get an actual third season!",

            "content": "While I've never been much of a fan of the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise, I can still say, at the very least, that I admired the off-kilter charm it had and understood the appeal that others would find in its self-aware meta-humor. It was quirky, upbeat and had a trademark style of doing things that were uniquely its own. By itself, that might not seem like much of an accomplishment, but when placed through a filter with the countless other school slice-of-life titles produced after its inception, it becomes more apparent why it gained its popularity. Despite the anime industry being saturated with these dime-a-dozen titlesevery year, the Haruhi franchise still manages to stay relevant by being one of the few to tinker with the formula in inventive ways. And like most things tend to, it had its fair share of detestable moments as well (8 x \u221e), but regardless of that, it still had a distinct identity that couldn't be found elsewhere. It's something you don't necessarily have to like, but you can still appreciate it for what it did. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't offer the same accolades to its spin-off Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu ( The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan). A \"Spin\"-off is supposed to take elements of its predecessor and add a new \"spin\" to it. In other words, it's supposed to do things differently from the status quo of the original series but still maintain aspects of it that connect it back to the parent story. While it was certainly \"different\" and a departure from the usual hijinks of the SOS Brigade, it had none of the charm or inherent value found in the parent story. In fact, The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is the exact opposite of what I saw admirable about the main story in the first place. It's a spin-off indistinguishable from the mass produced yearly offerings that I thought Haruhi never fell victim to. It's a title that got caught in the trappings of its genre's tropes, which automatically makes it a title that many would not speak of or forget altogether in the long run. The premise that it had wasn't bad, but the actual product that we were given was far from satisfactory. \\n\\n\r\nSwapping the supernatural shenanigans and one-off adventures with a rom-com narrative, the story of Nagato Yuki-chan sees the titular character Nagato try to confess her love to Kyon, only for her attempts to end without fruition, and then they repeat the cycle by the next episode. There you go, that's literally it. For the 1st 10-episodes, what we're essentially given is your typical \"would they or wouldn't they\" scenario where every moment is ruined by the love interest in question or by a side character popping up at the most inconvenient time. In between these moments, they insert a lot of padding and fluff in the form of slice-of-life segments. This includes everything from your cliched bathhouse/hot spring episode, to your group field trips. If you've seen enough school SoL anime titles before, this is just a patch job of all the overused setups, with the only difference being that the characters are from the Haruhi universe. I feel like there isn't a need to spell out the obvious here but just in case it isn't already clear enough, this is G-E-N-E-R-I-C. But like I said, it was the 1st 10 episodes that followed this monotonous cycle, after that point, the show took an unexpected turn and introduced a plot twist that brought with it much needed character drama, but I'll save that information for the spoiler section for those who haven't seen the spin-off yet. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Nagato Yuki-chan may have had good intentions, but the humdrum way it went about presenting it topped with the overused scenarios made it a tedious watch very quickly. It tossed in an unexpected twist for good measure, but by then, the damage was already done. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of Nagato Yuki-chan were, for the lack of a better word, basic. This can also mark the 1st real point of contention for fans of the franchise as they altered all the original character designs that helped to distinguish the cast into moe ladened ones that make them appear painfully generic. Change isn't a bad thing per say, but when the change is a downgrade from unique character design to xerox copies, that change can be very jarring. Their \"spunk\" was gone. The quality downsizing didn't stop there, as there was also a lack of detail placed in any given background. Even the unique shot compositions were no longer present. This may have been the result of another studio handling the show, as Satelight took the reins from Kyoani in its inception; a choice that might have been the first big mistake. With no proper use of lighting, no attempts at unique camera angles, inept understanding of color theory and no real distinguishable atmosphere developed, the switch in studios was one that really put a damper on a show that was already holding on at the end of the proverbial rope. The only credit I can offer is that they were able to capture the right tone for the latter half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs if to add insult to injury, a majority of the cast felt alienated from the prior installments. Not only did they look generic but now even their personality is bleached. They were either rewritten or regressed in dimension, and some were also reduced to being used as nothing more than background decoration. Thankfully, some maintained their personality, like Haruhi and Asahina, but even then, they were all watered down versions of their former self. Nagato and Kyon took the lead roles in the story, and while Kyon still had his sharp whit about him, it was toned down quite a bit. His personality was altered to fit a more optimistic portrayal, which in turn erased the \"person of reason\" that he was always known for into a character that didn't quite fit the mold. It's okay if they wanted his personality to reflect better the more lighthearted tone the show was going for but his pessimistic outlook is as much of a signature of the franchise as is the yellow ribbons as much of a trademark style of Haruhi. Getting rid of it is like getting rid of a big chunk of what makes the character stand out. \\n\\n\r\nKoizumi isn't even given any screen time and felt like he was only being placed the show as a carryover and nothing more. Same can be said about Asahina's involvement. They were both there to fill in their roles but was never given any time dedicated to them. A majority of the cast was underutilized or not even relevant at all. Perhaps the most significant change is that of Nagato's, and quite frank, it's the most grating. While the intention was for her to be an alternative story-line version to that of the movie, her personality makes a complete 180 if compared to the original and his grossly exaggerated if compared to the movie version. She's no longer the stoic, calculating Nagato but a shy hyperactive moe-blob with a pension for food and video games. It's a huge juxtaposition from who she was and one I couldn't buy into. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast as a whole was quite unappealing, and none of them was endearing or fleshed out. They were all husks of their former selves.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was forgettable. None of it ever grips you and remained as background noise. I can't recall anything special about it, as none of it stood out. The only time there was any visible effort came with the piano ballads towards the latter half, but even that was run-of-the-mill for what it was intended to do. The opening and ending themes were skippable, with the opening being a typical J-pop song and the ending a somber downtempo one. The voice actors were all fine, the only standout that comes to mind was that of Tomokazu Sugita's, who played Kyon. His monologs were always a nice touch and through it, provided insight into the situations the characters found themselves in.\\n\\n\r\n***Spoiler Section****\\n\r\n(skip to the enjoyment and overall section to avoid spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nSo the big reveal that the show hits you with is that the old stoic Nagato from the main series randomly commandeered the body of the new Nagato of this spin-off, and while it was indeed an interesting twist..., HOW and WHY does this happen? \\n\\n\r\nThe plot twist had no buildup, no foreshadowing but just came out of nowhere with no explanation and then it went away just as quickly with no proper reasoning behind it. Honestly, it felt like it was a cheap ploy only there to break the monotony of the basic rom-com and in a desperate attempt to salvage viewer interest. The character drama that arose from it was nice, as it spiced things up, but with it simply popping up and then going away without consequence or reason, it just brought more questions than it helped with the overall show. Not to mention that even the stoic Nagato was reduced to acting silly and \"kawaii\" after the reveal, which defeated the whole purpose of her being introduced in the plot twist, to begin with. I don't know if they meant to use this as a chance to leave the story open-ended for a continuation or not, but it happened far too late into the story to matter, and everything was only brought back to the status quo by the time the series ended.\\n\\n\r\n***End of Spoilers*****\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to mince my words here; I hated this spin-off. Every bit of me wanted to drop it, and the only reason I didn't is my OCD-like mentality towards finishing titles. It was bland, overly sentimental and a waste of effort.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nNagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu is not only a stain on the Haruhi's name but one that manages to lose all the charm and wit the franchise is known for. It's a cash grab nobody wanted nor needed, and the only thing it honestly shares with Haruhi is the characters and familiar namesake. With that said, if you're an avid fan of the franchise, then I suggest keeping your expectations low, as it doesn't contain the same trademarks you'd expect from the series. And if you've been impartial towards the series thus far, then stay clear from this one or prepare yourself for a cringe-inducing experience.",

            "content": "Its amazing how slight changes in perspective can cause something that on the surface seemed initially disjointed and disappointing, into an emotional experience that brings a surprising amount of satisfaction. \r\nLike most, I went into the series expecting the enjoyably discordant storyline, animation, and voice acting that the original series and movie had. I was consequently confused by Kyon's noticeably different appearance and a number of other slight visual changes that I shamefully explained away by learning the original studio hadn't worked on it. The first few episodes made it abundantly clear that it was not \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\", and finding that outannoyed me immensely. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, as I continued to watch the series, I began to recollect parts of the \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\" in particular Nagato's role in it. As part of that recollection, I finally realized, \"Ah... this is Yuki-chan's dream reality\" and afterwards everything clicked into place. The visual aberrations weren't unintentional, there was meaning behind the almost cliche variants of this series' characters' personas, and even the series' romcom style, and use of aged animations, was used to create a traditionalized perspective reminiscent of Nagato's preferences that contrasts really well against the unreal and jolting, or Haruhi-like, characteristics of the previous series. With this new perspective, even apparently superficial references to the previous series begin to question which of the two realities (i.e. Haruhi's or Yuki's) is the \"truest\" one or had the most merit for existing. This issue could only have been seen from the original Yuki's perspective, and was briefly discussed in the movie; bringing it up in this manner in Yuki's reality neatly explains the logic of her actions in the movie while allowing Yuki's own personal wishes and motivations to remain at the forefront.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you watch this series because you wanted a 3rd season of \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\", you'll be disappointed. However if you watch this series because you want to know more about why Nagato did what she did in the \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\" then I think you'll be pleasantly satisfied, and glad that this series made it to air. Personally speaking, the groundhog hell that Nagato went through in the movie still prevents me from watching it again; watching this series softens that angst and brings even more meaning to the series as whole.",

            "content": "I don\u2019t envy anyone who sits down and tries to come up with a spin-off story. Picture it: Here you are with a bunch of fun, memorable characters who each have a purpose but you want to change those around to create something new. If that wasn\u2019t hard enough already, strip away one of the major genres that underpinned the original. Hand someone some paper and a pen and tell them to come up with something new with that added rule. It would certainly leave them scratching their head for a while. I\u2019ve found the anime that shows why that\u2019s not a simple task. \r\nNagatoYuki-chan no Shoushitsu is an attempted creation along that line, a romantic comedy created from the Suzumiya Haruhi series, with studio Satelight putting it to screen. In place of the supernatural we have a focus on romance. In place of Haruhi as the lead we have Yuki. The pieces were all rearranged on the board ready to start the game but then this anime didn\u2019t know how to move them. It\u2019s a show that relies too heavily on referencing the original series as opposed to crafting its own meaningful story. It\u2019s all a big bunch of fanservice and if that\u2019s all you\u2019re after then there\u2019s a few things you might enjoy spotting. But if you wanted to see some more creative spark or interesting developments in the story department you might walk away feel a bit sour.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll also end up doing something in this review I normally like to avoid, and that\u2019s compare it to another show. Given the franchise this anime is inspired from into I feel it\u2019s only fair I draw upon Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu as a reference. Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu show fails to stand up on its own merits as a spin-off and there\u2019s no better way to show that than by making this comparison. Note that this review contains minor spoilers for the original Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu series.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nNagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu is a story packed with few surprises. Yuki wants to tell Kyon how she feels about him but every time she comes close to doing so she falters in some manner. Rinse, repeat. You get to watch episode after episode of it. The presentation can be fun and light hearted at least. It\u2019s not as if the show is ever terrible, but it\u2019s never memorable. As I watched on I couldn\u2019t help but notice there was a serious imbalance between comedy and drama. It opts for laughs over love on too many occasions, and there\u2019s little to no complication in the romance area. If there\u2019s little external forces to come between our pair then what\u2019s there to keep it interesting? There\u2019s the odd curveball though that saves the show from being a complete flop, which I\u2019ll come to.\\n\\n\r\nMore than the characters involved, nothing annoying me in Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu more than its boring episode structure. It tells you \u201cHere\u2019s your Valentine\u2019s episode\u201d, \u201cHere\u2019s your beach episode\u201d, \u201cHere\u2019s your summer trip\u201d and the list went on. It was sleep-inducing. While there\u2019s a share of Easter eggs to be found in these episodes that pay homage to the original series, sometimes clever and subtle, often that\u2019s all they are: references. They serve little purpose and it\u2019s like the writer was saying \u201cHey remember this scene guys? This was in the original series!\u201d You have a laugh, nod in agreement, and then go back to watching droll rom-com nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nThese generic episode set ups were still made to be exciting in the original series because romance was not at the forefront \u2013 it was a product of the mysteries and adventures the cast found themselves in. At least when Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu resorted to these stereotypical anime scenarios they came with that added spice of having to appease Haruhi. Even when the SOS Club were thrown into seemingly mundane situations you always had to expect the unexpected. It was a show that knew how to have fun because of that kicker. Here these same situations are used for nothing more than cheap laughs and with little to no romantic progression. When love is the theme, and you strip away the supernatural, things all come crumbling down.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time that Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu decided to start being serious and start exploring the mind of its lead character I had lost interest. \\n\r\nThere was a serious imbalance in the way the show built up to its major complication. I was falling asleep. When the psychological drama came around it was like an alarm clock taped to my ear. I really wasn\u2019t ready for it. Talk about a jarring tone shift. As jarring as it was though, I must say it was welcome. Here we are with not only some complication of substance, but also comes with one of the more clever throwbacks to the original series. It was the first sign of meaningful development for Yuki. It also changes up the dynamic between Yuki and Kyon a great deal. Dare I say the show even became somewhat interesting? It saves the anime in its run home but all I kept asking myself was \u201cwhy didn\u2019t this happen earlier on?\u201d If you\u2019re able to overcome how sudden \u2013 and maybe a bit ridiculously \u2013 things take a turn then you might get more out of this series than what I did. The ending is charming enough and I actually got a lot more out of it than I expected. While not entirely satisfying or complete, the presentation and references this time around were fun and felt useful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nYuki obviously gets the big turnaround in behaviour when compared to the rest of the cast. Instead of the alien of few words, she is now driven a lot more by emotion. This gave her much more potential to express herself but watching her felt like a chore. How could they have made Yuki more interesting? Putting her character on a greater offensive would have been a great start. Don\u2019t get me wrong, she really wants to make things change. She tries to express herself but you can guess how it always ends. It\u2019s normally something along the lines of\u2026 awkward situation, exasperated overreaction then back to square one. You can find that one in the first chapter of \u201cWriting Generic Romantic Comedies 101\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t be mad if Yuki followed the start of those guidelines but then actually took something away from her experiences, and learn to fend for herself. Instead it\u2019s always mother Asakura to the rescue and Yuki herself doesn\u2019t seem to take anything on board. It\u2019s like every episode restores the status quo.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the devil, that\u2019s all Asakura\u2019s role in this series is. She\u2019s there to pick up the pieces Yuki leaves behind and do everything for her. She\u2019s more of a parent than a friend. I understand that this is another interesting tie-in to the original Haruhi series (in particular the film) given the \u2018protective\u2019 nature she had there, but watching it here is tedious. She had the potential here to play a much more active role in this love story but content to hang back to provide annoying comedy (hey look she\u2019s pulling a scary face again) and repetitive relationship advice to Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nThis may sound a little mean, but Kyon is just too happy and untroubled in this show. His best asset was his frustration as a result of the situations he found himself thrown into with Haruhi. He becomes just another generic anime high school male character this time around when left alone to his own devices. While we get the odd look at the old Kyon we know and love, it sadly isn\u2019t the one taking centre stage. It\u2019s unsurprising that some of my favourite moments in this anime came from his dialogue with Haruhi. It\u2019s not a good sign when your main female lead can\u2019t bring out the same level of engagement. All Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu will do is make you miss Kyon\u2019s non-stop stream of amusing thoughts and inner monologues.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else in the show just feels like they\u2019re there to advance the story and take the group to somewhere new. They don\u2019t feel like active players in character relationships, again just there most of the time to remind everyone what series\u2019 spin-off you\u2019re watching. Haruhi manages to steal the show away from Nagato quite often. I thought she was going to add a bit of conflict this story but I was let down with that idea. Everyone else isn\u2019t even worth touching on.\\n\\n\r\nThank goodness the original cast returned for this and helped to correct that somewhat. Tomozaku Sugita, while limited with his capabilities in this show, still gives Kyon that snarky edge through all his rom-com suffering. Minori Chihara actually gets the chance to put some sentences together as Yuki and does a fair job in a new role as the blubbering, timid female lead. You also don\u2019t need me to tell you that Aya Hirano, as Haruhi, was excellent. I have to say that people have ragged on the character designs a bit too much. I actually like that Satelight tried to distance themselves away from KyoAni\u2019s designs and make something unique on their end. Are they memorable? Not really, but they\u2019re far removed from the worst I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s fair that you compare the roles of characters between this and the original series, but it\u2019s unfair to do the same for the art style. \\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s the big problem with a spin-off that changes up the dynamics and personality of its characters: The original series is crafted around the interactions and clashes of those personalities. Changing this up is asking for trouble. Now in Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu the roles of these characters have become uninteresting and out of place. All the drama in this show is boring and everyone outside of Kyon, Yuki and Asakura don\u2019t seem to have anything to contribute. I\u2019d struggle to recommend Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu even to a fan of the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nIf you could sum up the show you could call it \u201cReferences: The Anime\u201d. All it does is serve as a reminder that you could be watching its more superior reference anime. Granted, Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu never tries to emulate Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu. It knows it\u2019s only a spin-off. It goes for a completely different theme in its story but its execution was iffy. Pointless, meandering slice-of-life antics took up too much of the show. When it finally ditched them I\u2019d come too far through the 16-episode count. It tries its hardest to look back of those SoL previous experiences and make them feel significant but it falls flat on its face.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 4/10 (Poor)",

            "content": "If you come into The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan with expectations that this will be on the level of the original Haruhi series, you will be in for severe disappointment. To watch this anime, you must be a fan of the Haruhi Suzumiya universe, but you must also leave any such expectations at the door. When you do that, then, and only then, will you be able to enjoy this anime. Somewhat. Sometimes. Maybe?\r\nNagato Yuki-chan is essentially a \u201cwhat-if\u201d story. What if, in Disappearance, that world became canon? Or, better to say, what-if the world from The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya was the true world?How would things be different? While the titular Yuki Nagato was more fragile in the movie, the anime draws upon that material (as well as Nagato playing games from The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya) to deliver a character that\u2019s different (for the most part, she's in love with Kyon) but not new. Despite being a different entity altogether (and even being written/drawn by someone else), Nagato fits in with the universe for being silly. Although it never reaches an intelligent level of parody like its mother series, Nagato Yuki-chan can be refreshing in how light-hearted it is. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully the performances of the cast are great. The Haruhi series is famous for having a great sub and dub, and even though the original Japanese version has finished, in this age of simul-dubbing, we get to experience the original dub voices once again. The shoutouts here have to go to Minori Chihara and Michelle Ruff, the voice actresses of Nagato in both languages. Chihara does a great job of making Nagato meek and cute. Ruff takes it in a slightly different direction (since it would be unnatural sounding if she did that much high-pitched cuteness) and she focuses on the shy aspect of Nagato, with equally great results. All the other principal voices return and they perform with the same level of confidence and ability.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s unfortunately, however, that all of the good aspects of the Nagato Yuki-chan anime can be described as superficial or dependent on the love of the original series, because the spinoff itself doesn\u2019t have enough strength on its own.\\n\\n\r\nEasily, the weakest part of the presentation aspect of the show is its animation. Admittedly, however, it is tough to tell if this is because the animation is actually below average or if it just is worse than previous entries. Taken by itself, the animation done by Satelight isn\u2019t bad. The only thing that jumps out at me is the fact that there seems to be a lot of white used, and all the scenes look brighter to an uncomfortable degree. Any other complaint, however, comes from a comparison to Kyoto Animation, the typical animator of the Haruhi series. This season, for whatever reason (probably because this is a relatively unimportant spinoff of the main series, or the cynical reason that KyoAni has no reason to promote Haruhi anymore), KyoAni decided not to animate this entry in the Haruhi universe. And while Satelight generally tries their hardest, KyoAni and their animation of the original series is often too hard to live up to. Anything good that Satelight does feels merely serviceable looking at KyoAni, and this is augmented by the sheer whiteness everywhere and the fact Kyon looks like a goddamn middle schooler.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, Nagato Yuki-chan is generally alright, but the implementation of Haruhi can get dicey at times. You can\u2019t have the series without Haruhi, that\u2019s practically a given. But Nagato Yuki-chan struggles to find the right balance of Haruhi in the show. Haruhi is the same person she\u2019s practically always been: obsessed with the supernatural, eccentric as hell, and bossy to a fault. If she didn\u2019t take charge, it would be strange. Often, however, the show puts the spotlight on Haruhi and her antics, when they need to take a definitive backseat. This isn\u2019t the show for Haruhi to do weird things; that\u2019s literally all the other Haruhi series (well, except for Nyoron Churuya-san). The show shines when Haruhi does something weird and it\u2019s left in the background or used as an impetus for the principal characters (Nagato, Kyon, and Asakura) to do something; on the other hand, if there\u2019s even a little more Haruhi antics, the show feels like a discount version of the main series. Even at the end of the day, Haruhi is just a hyperactive person, without many of the nuances that made her interesting in the original series.\\n\\n\r\nWith the exception of Nagato and Asakura, who are rather interesting in their own right, all of the other characters are very watered down versions of themselves. Since Koizumi, Mikuru, and Tsuruya don't play as much of a central role in the plot, it's not a huge deal, but Kyon plays a strangely odd role on the sidelines, reduced to an occasional straight man gag. In fact, Kyon, the romantic interest, is thoroughly uninteresting in this incarnation of the series, which is a huge drawback.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, despite it being Haruhi characters you know and love, despite the voice actors coming back, and despite the cuteness of it all, The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is an extremely generic, and often boring, slice of life anime. In fact, outside of love for the original cast of characters and voice actors, there is no reason to partake in it for the actual plot. Episode after episode is a slow clich\u00e9 slice of life borefest that just makes you want a third season of Haruhi adapting Rampage. Beach? Check. How about a trip to Kyoto? Check. Tanabata episode? Sure, let\u2019s forget the original series and give that a check. To this end, Nagato Yuki-chan becomes a discount Haruhi Suzumiya, often filled with annoying nods to the parent series without any of the edge, and even those who do their best to ignore this find it progressively harder to do so as the series continues.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, the smiles from the cuteness of the show just can\u2019t outweigh the fact that the series is boring, generic, and derivative. The fact that these are well-established characters only goes so far, and ultimately, this would have worked better as a short OVA or ONA series rather than a 1.5 cour deal. Nagato being super cute, while extremely pleasing, isn\u2019t enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3 (Cliche, boring, generic Slice of Life and discount Haruhi)\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6 (Bias for KyoAni may exist, but still only adequate)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8 (Good voice acting but only Nagato is amazing; this is because of the blandness of the characters)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4 (Nagato is cute, Asakura is elder sister like. All other characters are one-dimensional or lose some traits, like Kyon's inability to become the straight man in a good fashion)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5.2 (rounded down to 5)",

            "content": "It\u2019s like something born out of a fairy tale story. Nagato Yuki-Chan no Shoushitsu (The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan) is no Haruhi Season 3. In fact, it\u2019s more a spinoff taking place in an alternate universe where aliens don\u2019t exist, Kyon seems normal, and Nagato Yuki is almost nothing like what fans remember her from the original series. As far that goes, this spinoff is more or less of a slice of life story that mixes in elements of drama, romance, and some SOS shenanigans. \r\nBased on the manga of the same name, the series consists of 16 episodes that depicts the life of NagatoYuki. Unlike the stoic girl that many fans remember her as, she is rather timid and shows much more human emotions than her Haruhi counterpart. Make no mistake though, she still retains some characteristics such as her love of reading books. \\n\\n\r\nAs of the story itself, Nagato Yuki-Chan no Shoushitsu is very straightforward. We meet Nagato Yuki, the titular character of the show as she has an encounter with Kyon. Because Kyon isn\u2019t like the cyclical self that we remember him as, he is able to easily make friends with her. Then enter Haruhi, the girl that made herself famous from the original series. And in this show, she is also shown to be kinder yet still full of energy. The first few episodes easily establishes the primary character cast. They compose of Nagato, Kyon, Haruhi, and joining them includes Mikuru, Itsuki, and Asakura. A good amount of investment comes from the relationship building. In particular, Kyon and Nagato shares some similarities and the two seems to be able to get along quite well. There\u2019s also some very obvious attraction that Nagato shows towards Kyon. While the show isn\u2019t entirely structured as a rom-com, it does highlight such moments from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nDrama also does come to play at some pivotal moments in the show. This is shown early on in the series as Haruhi gets into a controversial love angle between her, Nagato, and Kyon. What started as a misunderstanding degenerated into tears and sorrow. Unfortunately, there\u2019s really not much to expand on the story development beyond that. It\u2019s too simple and formalistic with a predictable outcome that anyone could of seen coming. What\u2019s more is that Nagato shows her vulnerability that fans might not be able to adapt with well. After all, she was always supposed to be a stoic girl with almost a lack of human emotions. Here, she shows more human emotions than she ever did. In retrospect, the series isn\u2019t very good at dealing with drama. It fits more as a slice of life series and attempting to craft drama doesn\u2019t make the series distinguishing. On the bright side, the chemistry between Kyon and Nagato can be genuinely heartwarming to watch. It not only brings out the honesty of their characters but also shows how they can co-exist to tackle almost any problem. On the other hand, the show is sometimes overshadowed by Haruhi. She is like a bright and shining energy ball that just never seems to stop glowing. While the main protagonist is Nagato in this spinoff, it\u2019s really hard to ignore Haruhi\u2019s presence when she makes herself stand out above others. The plus side is that she isn\u2019t a jerk that some of us remembers.\\n\\n\r\nAt some point in this series, it will seem like a chore to watch. I had this sort of feeling early on when comedy on top of comedy is thrown towards the audience. While it seems fun at first, it just seems like dead humor. The jokes quickly become stale while doesn\u2019t really add anything new for the audience to experience with. Characters also shows little change to their personalities until a certain episode. However, if you get to over half the show with patience, then you may be surprised. In one of the later episodes, the story brings out a side of Nagato Yuki that we may be familiar with. The tone of the show changes drastically for several episodes as we see this complex side of herself. Perhaps this will refresh your memory of the original Nagato as well based on her behavior. What\u2019s more is that it also brings out the best from other characters such as Kyon and Asakura. It shows their care for a friend when they need it the most. Furthermore, I have to say that the show adds a bit of suspense that invites anticipation. While the show at that point still retains some comedy with slice of life elements, it\u2019s almost like a 180 degree shift from the first half of the season. Sometimes, a shift like this may seem risky. But for a series that already foreshadowed some of the events, it effectively delivers. In retrospect, the short yet melancholic arc (episodes 10-13) will be an emotional ride.\\n\\n\r\nSatelight is the studio in charge to deliver art visuals. And for that reason, don\u2019t expect the artwork or visual quality to be top stellar. In fact, the show\u2019s character designs and setting looks only moderate with generic characteristics. Nagato Yuki also looks different from her original self although still retains similar clothes and her trademark glasses. Then, there\u2019s Kyon. Some fans may barely recognize him at first until he begins speaking on-screen. On the other hand, Haruhi still looks the same while other characters such as Mikuru gives off the Ms. Fan-service vibe. In fact, fan service is no stranger in show. From the curious camera angle shots, bouncing boobs, and classic onsen episode, it\u2019s safe to say that the show really wants to service the fans. And in terms of comedy, the facial expressions of the characters are almost endless. The highlight part of the series is the deeper development such as the symbolism of the rain and OP/ED song adjustments. When carefully examined, it really brings out a meaning for this show\u2019s title.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the soundtrack is an important part of the show along with the voice mannerisms. In order to capture the new refreshing feeling of this spinoff, the characters needs to connect with the audience. In the beginning, it seems that they can do just that. Despite some annoying antics such as Haruhi\u2019s overwhelming personality, the characters are able to carry the show and not bore the audience. Similarly, the soundtrack has a nice balance that changes from the casual and humorous tone in the first half, to a very melancholic and atmospheric feeling in the second. The OP and ED theme songs also reflects a good amount of this change. And in general, the music is something that can easily be enjoyed whether you\u2019re a fan of the story or not.\\n\\n\r\nA show like this seems like a blast from the past on first glance. But in the end, it\u2019s not much like so despite some similarities with the original Haruhi series. If you\u2019re a fan of humor, drama, and lots of slice of life, then this show will no doubt be something you can tolerate. While the series does attempt to emphasize the romance context as well, it doesn\u2019t work out right in the end. Let\u2019s face the facts. Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu isn\u2019t really a rom-com. While the relationship connections are evident and the chemistry is charming, the drama itself is polarizing. On the other hand, the series does craft melancholy quite well. The shift from a certain mood from one to another of the complete opposite will seem like a surprise and keep you at the edge of your seat. And for a show like this, it\u2019s what\u2019s needed to keep it somewhat interesting.",

            "content": "I'm honestly not against spin-off series, after all my lovely Illya Prisma is just a spin-off of Fate, and so I wasn't against a spin-off focusing on Nagato either. After all practically everyone loved Nagato in the original, almost as much as they hated Haruhi (aka a lot). There are just 2 major problems. 1)The audience came to sympathise with the tortured lonely Nagato of Haruhi's universe, remaking her into a girl whose only characteristic is being clumsy was stupid to begin with. 2)Haruhi didn't have a \"just bad\" response from the audiences, she practically got kicked out of her own show and the moviehad no relation to her other than the name. So tell me dear animators, WHY does the b\u00a3$%&  with Lucy's voice need to come back?! I thought it was clear by now, we HATE her. And of course unlike Nagato who got a total personality liftover Haruhi remains the same annoying overenergetic little f$%& that desperately tries to grab attention but ends up pissing everyone off. Actually make that 3 problems: 3) What the hell is wrong with the blue-hair's eyebrows?!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway as usual the (unbelievably boring) Kyon joins the literature club, with Nagato as a president and her friend Eyebrows as the second member. They practically do nothing all day and it's just Nagato playing games, while slowly (very very slowly) developing a romance... Which is about as interesting as reading the Terms of Agreement in non-EA games, considering Ky-on has zero personality and Nagato is unbearable while Eyebrows is just the onee-chan character. It was tollerable though! Without the b$%^h everything felt much more relaxed than the original and despite this Nagato not being the one we loved it was still watchable... And then of course the b\u00a3$%h arrived and everything returned to the original level of s%\u00a3t that we were this close to forgetting.\\n\\n\r\nAbout halfway through, the anime did manage to catch our interest. Haruhi was mysteriously gone for mysterious reasons shrouded in mystery that I suspect were described by \"ratings plummeting to the ground\" and Nagato returned temporarily to the personality we all loved from the original. Granted Kyon was still as interesting as watching a cabbage grow, and ms Eyebrows was still taking too much screentime for her own good, but the anime became enjoyable at least. The emotionless loli is back biatches! Of course that couldn't last forever and eventually we returned to our beloved swamp of stupid.\\n\\n\r\nOh and before I forget: 4)What point is there to Asahina's existence? I mean, seriously, it was more common for the characters to mention that \"she has work to do\" than actually talking to her. 5)Kyon's voice acting... Plain awful, Asahina's voice acting... Unbearable (having to hear her in Wakaba girl is a challenge), Haruhis voice acting... You don't deserve to be Lucy you b\u00a3$%h! 6)Graphics were mediocre at best.",

            "content": "I had some serious mixed feelings about the disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan after re-watching the series, I decided to do yet another review. To begin, for starters and obviously, the show itself was unique. To see the Yuki I knew from the OG series turn into a klutzy, nervous wreck was a bit strange and somewhat amusing. What I did not like about that though is she reminded me too much of Mikuru. This was something I noticed a lot by Nagato's action while re-watching. It was like having a second slightly more annoying yet tolerable Mikuru around and it just didn't appeal to me.Something else that bothered me a little was that there were too many characters used in this show. It took away some of my focus on Yuki for the most part along with her development as the main character. This opinion of mine changed during the later half of the program though. At first I  didn't really think the amount of characters was necessary until I made it to the middle, no close to the end of the series. That's when it hit me that Haruhi, Ryouko, Mikuru, etc all have a bigger purpose (Kinda sort of.)\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the story is actually quite simple, However the way things occurred, why things were happening the way they were, and the other events that were explained by Nagato (The real one) were a bit difficult for me to understand. I felt like I wasn't left with much of a backstory on why things were happening during the entire time watching Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu. That aside, the pacing of the shows events was great. It was as if they saved the best for last. The show starts off a bit ridiculous however it slowly but surely develops into something greater in time. Honestly, I thought it was much worth the wait. The ending, I must say was a bit cliche. In fact the characters say it a lot about how certain things that are happening in an episode seem like they are straight out of a love or romance manga. So I'm going to agree on that. But overall The ending didn't bother me too much, it was still sweet and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and soundtrack in Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu where pretty good, I (as I am writing this) cannot remember if they used the same original soundtrack in the Haruhi series but it still sounds great. There where a few tracks that I'm assuming they added especially towards the end of the series which sounded pretty damn good if I do say so myself. Moving on, the voice actors are still pretty great. I watched the Japanese dub with English subtitles and it was pretty interesting hearing Chihara Minori \"Voice of Yuki Nagato\" change her voice from clumsy and nervous to serious and monotone in a few episodes of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic aside, the artwork and animation done on this series is always great. Some scenes are of course done so well that I could really tell when they were going all out. I believe it's in episode 9 where our characters are at a summer festival,  the scenery and animation seemed like it was improved just to enhance the atmosphere. There are lots of moments like this during the series however this moment stood out a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say whether or not I would recommend this series to anyone. Personally I think it's both a great... no, decent tear-jerker and comedy anime. However in the end, it's just a little too out of place for me to actually say whether or it's any good or just so bad it's good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave this show a solid 7 because it was in fact a unique concept with great visuals and audio along  with a decent story however it's too out of place in terms of story and timeline even if it's supposed to be about another character.",

            "content": "The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan.\r\nFuck this show. I hate it from the bottom of my heart. It was a disappointment in every regard.\r\nI'm not going to pretend like the original series was a masterpiece, because it isn't. But it was entertaining and charming (exept for Haruhi being a bully sometimes)\r\nEverything that made the original series fun is missing here.\r\nI find Nagato the most interesting in the original series. She's so mysterious and kicks ass when it needs to be kicked. Her usual self and the version in the alternatetimeline of the movie are both endearing. So when i heard that a Spin-off with Nagato asthe central character was coming up, I was soooo hyped. Exept for the movie, Nagato didn't get much screentime which i found particularly unfourtunate.\\n\\n\r\nWhen i heard it was going to be a romance, taking place in the alternative timeline and saw the new characterdesigns I was less hyped but still excited. I am completly open to the idea of making a lovestory with that version of Nagato.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just that the character called Nagato in this series isn't Nagato, it is a hollow shell of a character. The Nagato from the movie isn't that fleshed out, but she was depicted as a really shy, bookish, unsocial and lonley person. Instead we get a gluttonous, lazy, airheaded idiot we're supposed to find cute.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that the romantic elements are handeld so poorly that I wonder why they even bothered. So the rest of the show is just SoL, Great! The original series was just SoL with some supernatural elements mixed in so this should be fun aswell right? No, this is the most boring, generic and unimaginative SoL I have seen yet, on the level of bad fanfiction. It's like they where checking things of a checklist, in order to include every chlich\u00e9d scenario.\\n\\n\r\nBut if that wasn't enough it just doesn't make sense in context of the original Series. This wouldn't be really a problem if it didn't try to connect the two with forced, stupid references we're supposed to look at and yell:\\n\\n\r\n    \"Hey! I rembember that from the series\"\\n\\n\r\nPlus the animation and soundtrack is ten times worse.\\n\\n\r\nThere is absolutly no reason for anyone to watch this series. If SoL is the sand on the metaphysical anime Beach, then this show is a turd someone used to rip off a sandcastle.\\n",

            "content": "After hearing that the Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan Manga will be turned into an anime, I was very excited to say the least. After the last episode aired, I watched the whole anime over the course of the weekend - After initially having somewhat mixed feelings, especially because of the art, I ended up enjoying the series as a whole. Please note that this is my first review, so it will most likely be far from perfect.\r\nStory:\r\nSatelight took the first five volumes of this spinoff-manga (which is set in the alternate universe established in \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\") as work material. It is basicallyabout \"how would everything look like if Kyon chose differently\" - Which is a world without any aliens, time travelers, ESPs and the SOS Brigade. The story mainly revolves around Yuki and follows her through her life as a shy girl who fell in love. Nothing overly special, but still enjoyable. As consequence, you won't find anything supernatural in this series and there won't be any crazy happenings like you've got to see them in the main series. However, long-time fans who read the novels/watched the original anime series will notice a lot of nods towards it, among them the notorious \"Kyon-kun, denwa!\" which will probably strike terror into everyone who has seen Season 2. Those small nods were something I really appreciated, but still nothing to get extremely excited for.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is arguably the weakest point of this adaption. They switched the art style (which probably was to be expected, given a different studio was working on it) and the whole thing feels like a downgrade from the main series. Especially Kyon often looks way younger than he should and faces, especially Kyon's, look slightly weird at times. Once you get used to it it's not as bad anymore, but regardless of that, they could've put more effort into it; Though the different style does suit the spinoff well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe original cast has taken over their roles, as it should be. The result of this is some superb voice acting with the VAs doing their best to make the characters sound convincing, which more often than not succeeds. Emotions are carried across well and it rarely feels out of place or badly acted. Especially Minori Chihara did a great job playing the shy, clumsy Yuki Nagato which is a 180\u00b0 turn from the main series Yuki.\\n\r\nThe OP song \"Fure Fure Mirai\" (which is a play on \"Hare Hare Yukai\", the ending of the 1st season of the main series) is a typical J-Pop song, rather fast-paced, happy-go-lucky style. Enjoyable, but nothing special.\\n\r\nThe ED \"Arigatou, Daisuki\" on the other hand sounded great, being a slow paced song sung by Minori Chihara. I found myself listening to it every time due to how well it was made.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are very distinct, each of them having their own, vastly different personalities. The character development is mainly focused on Yuki and Kyon, however Ryoko and Haruhi also \"expand\" a bit over time. The other side characters are pretty much stagnant; that being said, there isn't all too much development over the course of the series, but it does exist.\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are quite enjoyable as it still feels like they have personality and aren't just bland.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDespite lacking some more depth, the mediocre art and other flaws, this is still an enjoyable series with a lot of funny & cute moments. If you are a fan of the main series however, you need to make sure to realize that this is merely a spinoff and you won't find more of the \"classic\" Haruhi here. No aliens, no supernatural happenings, no sci-fi. Once you can accept this and start watching this with an open mind, it will be much easier for you to enjoy. If you don't, you're most likely going to dislike it. On the same side, people who want an overly convoluted love story with a lot of twists and extremely deep character development, this might not be for you either. Everyone else can give this a shot and will most likely get at least some enjoyment out of it.",

            "content": "This show is basically a high school AU of a series that was already set in high school. It's also a giant middle finger to everyone who wanted a 3rd \"real\" season of Haruhi.\r\n[POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS FOR THE HARUHI SERIES, BUT NOT THIS SHOW (though I can't imagine why you'd even be here if you haven't seen the original)]\r\nWhere to begin? Let's star with our main charater, Yuki Nagato. I'll do my best to refrain from making this whole review just a comparison to the original, but the stark contrast in characterization between this show and the original in the character of Yuki Nagato isjust astounding. Originally, Yuki was a direct homage/shout-out to Neon Genesis Evangelion's Rei Ayanami, being a very quiet, passive bookworm emotionless-girl character. She did occasionally display hints of emotion however (much like Rei), which is what made her interesting. However, the main character of this show (whom I'll be referring to as Yuki-chan) is a completely different character. Yuki-chan is some kind of hopeless romantic who has barely any depth and doesn't even read books (preferring video games instead). Let me repeat that, SHE DOESN'T EVEN READ BOOKS.\\n\\n\r\nLet me back up a bit. Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu (or NYcnS) is loosely based on an alternate universe which was a major plot point in the Disappearance arc of Haruhi canon. In it, everyone is \"normal.\" A notable feature of it is that Yuki is no longer \"emotionless\" but rather acts more like a human being should, and the rest of her personality (being an extremely quiet and reclusive bookworm) is left in tact. She still reads books! NYcnS more or less uses this universe as its setting, with the main difference being that the main character Kyon doesn't realize anything is wrong (and is also no longer the main character... more on him later).\\n\\n\r\nBut the thing is, NYcnS's version of Yuki doesn't even use the canon Disappearance-arc AU Yuki. As I said, she doesn't even read books. Instead, she's more of just a generic mo\u00e9 blob who has an obvious crush on a classmate, and happens to share Yuki's general appearance. All subtlety and depth to her character are gone. Her defining character traits are gone. Actually, why was she even in the literature club in the first place? I don't recall the show ever explaining this.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough about Yuki-chan, there's plenty more wrong with this show.\\n\\n\r\nI won't pretend that the original series was perfect, or that its characters were especially well developed, but NYcnS somehow makes them all even more bland and forgettable than before. This is reflected rather well in the equally generic and bland art style. Art-wise, ex-main character Kyon might be the biggest victim, looking almost nothing like he did and instead looking like a bland anime boy (more so than normal). Where before, Kyon was the viewpoint-character of the series, whose deadpan-snarker personality and inner-monologue quips added a lot of humor to the show and made him a fun audience surrogate character that stands out from most. But now, with him being merely a supporting character, whose thoughts we can't hear, he's become pretty pointless, generic, and bland. Kyon's only function in the story now is to be the object of Yuki-chan's desires. I know I've been using words like \"bland\" and \"generic\" a lot, but those words pretty much sum up this whole show.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show, there are numerous references and shout-outs to the original series, but the problem is that they all just make me wish I was watching that instead. The most egregious example is when someone says something like \"someone I know threw a murder-mystery event last year as a joke.\" (referencing a mini-arc from the original) Wow, that sounds fun! Much more fun than whatever we're doing right now. Gee, I wish we could be watching that instead.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big glaring problem with this show is how much it relies on bad anime tropes and cliches. The original at least had the \"well, Haruhi wishes it to be that way\" justification hand-wave, but this show has no excuse. I know I've been comparing it to the original a lot, but I would like to stress that I do not think this show works on its own either. The comedy is weak and the story is so forgettable I barely even remember there being one.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, I really don't have a problem with this *type* of show, in that a light-hearted rom-com set in high school can be, and sometimes is, a lot of fun, even without much depth. The problem is that there just isn't anything interesting here. Really, what's the point of this show existing? Who sat down and said \"lets make a more boring version of Haruhi\" ? There are plenty more canon Haruhi light novels that haven't been adapted, why did they instead go with this? Imagine if there was an X-Files spinoff, where Mulder and Scully weren't FBI agents and nothing supernatural ever happened, and also Scully had a vastly different personality and Mulder didn't care about supernatural stuff at all. You'd say \"but wait, why are the characters even called Mulder and Skully? There's nothing X-Files about this.\" That's basically this show.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, not worth you time, whether you're a fan of the Haruhi series or not. I've seen worse, but there are so many better shows in this genre. I just hope that if we ever see Haruhi again, she'll be the leader of the SOS Brigade once more.",

            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nIf you're a person like me who shipped Kyon and Yuki since The Disappearance movie (it's even in my nickname), then don't expect that much from this adaption, because you will only get a pretty clich\u00e9 romcom. Why? Well, it has everything that would define something like it: ruined love confessions (check), misunderstandings (check), fluffy scenes between the main characters (check), an ending that doesn't round up anything thanks to some freaking fireworks (check).\r\nI expected a good resolution from this, something that would only be read or seen in fanfictions, something that would make my \"dreams come true\", but the series took the easyway, wasting 13 episodes with absolutely nothing and 3 amazing ones to end with a \"you didn't hear what I said because of the fireworks, right?\" For an ending like that, I would prefer Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.\\n\\n\r\nWith my hope at 100%, I started loving the series because it gave me what I wanted: more from the world of Haruhi and a genuine love story between Nagato and Kyon. I didn't even care for those 13 episodes of nothing because I thought that at least at the end, the series would give me a kiss  or a solid confession or something that would make me spend 50 dollars for the release. Hell, I was so wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAt least, these series gave me one of my favorite songs im Japanese (i.e. Arigatou, daisuki, the ED song beautifully sung by Minori Chihara), more from the original dub cast, and 3 interesting episodes (with some little touches of Serial Experimes Lain) where we could see the Nagato from the original series.\\n\\n\r\nYes, these series was a real disappointment. There are few things to save from this adaption. It was good at the beginning, interesting development at final part of the series, an amazing ending song. It even reunited the old cast from the original series. But no, I won't waste my money on something that ended in such a mediocre point. As I said before, I prefer Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun because it at least have some of the best comedy out there that would make me rewatch it again and again, without any care of the final.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I know, the manga isn't finished yet, so it might give me that ending that I expected since the moment I discover this spinoff. Maybe it will give me that ending that I wanted from this series.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The absurdity of the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimiya franchise is without a doubt it's most endearing quality. The use of outlandish and bizarre science-fiction characters to create what an ultimately rather mundane high school comedy has a rather cunning, almost satirical bent to it which has allowed the series to endure far longer than most other work in the genre. But more than just being funny, the set-up also provides the opportunity to explore more philosophical matters from time to time.\r\nIn Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu, or \"The Disappearance of Yuki Nagato\" in English the balance between the mundane and the philosophical is tipped slightly inthe former's favour. That's not to say the science fiction elements are absent completely, but it's far more like a traditional high school harem series than the original was: far more time is spent on typical activities than before. That's not all: some of the cast members have had their personalities tweaked slightly for this series.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Nagato herself has a similar composure to the character from earlier series, being quiet and reserved, but now more closely resembles the behaviour of a real person. Her tendency to be quiet is no longer the result of a robotic mind but of shyness. She's also now a bit clumsy, no doubt in order to better cater to a certain kind of individual. Another character who has been changed is Ryouko Asakura, the murderous class representative of the first series. Her confident and slightly intimidating personality is retained, but is now concentrated on looking after Nagato. Her role is much larger than before too, in fact after Yuki and Kyon, she is the most important character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nTsuruya, the green haired ball of energy is also more important this time around, while Mikuru, Koizumi and Haruhi have been relegated to the sidelines. This shift has changed the direction of the series dramatically and even though these characters have not been altered their limited presence has had an effect on the series which is even greater than the more conventional approach. If you feel sentimental about the original series then there is a good chance you won't find this series as appealing as the others. The same goes for those who dislike the cutesy, mixed signals kind of romance that you find in other high school anime. This is a recurring theme, particularly in the earlier episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBut do not think that the series has become completely saccharine. On the contrary, this series raises far deeper philosophical questions than either the first or the second series do. Events conspire such that one character may be killed inadvertently to save another, a moral dilemma similar to the famous problem about an out of control trolley running down a hill. Though the set-up which prompted this dilemma are fictional, the ramifications of them are significant. The presentation of it is rather stirring too, and you may find yourself feeling rather melancholic about the whole affair when it's through.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of presentation, you may have noticed that the art style is radically different from the series which were produced by Kyoto Animation, and more closely resemble the artwork in the original light novels. The change is slightly distracting at first but the relative simplicity of it is ultimately rather charming. Though the colouring could be better: embarrassment is signalled with a change of skin tone rather than facial expression, and it feels lazy.\\n\\n\r\nMercifully, the original voice actors have been retained for this series, so no-one need worry about adjusting to a new Haruhi unless you watched the original series dubbed. The background music is pretty catchy too, but if you were expecting themes capable of rivalling the Hare Hare Yukai or Bouken Desho Desho you are going to be very disappointed, as both the OP and ED for this series are dreadful low-tier pop songs that have none of the excitement or fun that the original series themes did.\\n\\n\r\nBut music isn't everything, and unless you are the kind of person that can't stand the idea of your favourite characters being meddled with, then overall this series does rather well. And fortunately for us, those two legacies actually can co-exist with one another simultaneously.",

            "content": "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, an anime that when it was aired, has regard to be one of the most well known anime since its release on account of its overall wackiness and parodying of everything, it's odd set of characters including a time traveling moe girl, a kuudere alien, and an esper, and the one character to bring it all together, Haruhi, the hyperactive god character.  So, with Satelight taking over the Haruhi franchise by producing us this spin-off, what are we as the audience to expect?\r\nStory (6.22/10): The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki, contrary to the rest of the Haruhi series, is verydifferent in its setting.  Taking place in the Disappearance world of the Haruhi universe, where Haruhi and Koizumi go to a different school, Asakura isn't a homicidal alien, and Nagato is a moe creature rather than a cool kuudere, the story follows our main protagonist Kyon as he basically...does what he did in the original Haruhi series, which is spending time with the title girl in the series.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of differences to the original Haruhi series, this Spin-off bears only some resemblance to the flow and plot points.  For the most part, the series focuses mainly on Kyon and the rest of the Haruhi cast in their disappearance roles, getting into various wacky situations without all of the supernatural business that goes on.  The thing that irks me though is the fact that the show plays out like a generic rom-com with many cliche romcom scenes that don't really provoke much feeling.  It's so reliant on this way of storytelling, that it really doesn't make the story all too entertaining and rather bland.  One of the reasons for this perception is because this show is connected to the Haruhi series, where that show is known for being out there in terms of...well basically everything.  Contrasting that with a platonic romantic comedy just sort of clashed.  \\n\\n\r\nThe actual content of the show has a couple ups and downs.  Because Nagato is now a shy, moe creature, the show uses that to create a lot of moe moments that admittedly are cute, but are used quite often and overturn the flow of the story.  But my biggest complaint about this show is towards the end where they create the \"disappearance\".  I'll be honest, that didn't really make a whole lot of sense.  The issue is the fact that they just throw it right in front of you and expect things to fall into place without really a proper explanation as to why what happened was happening.  When introduced, it was just kind of confusing, and when it ended, things just didn't make any sense, and when plot points don't really make any sense, that's considered a flaw in my book.\\n\\n\r\nThere is still the upside of this show being part of the Haruhi series.  Throughout the show, the show references the original Haruhi in a vast amount of ways, even creating several plot points that have parallel settings; so if you're a hardcore Haruhi fan, you'll appreciate what they throw at you there.  (That goddamn endless 8 reference at the end...)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nagato Yuki had its ups and downs in terms of story.  Without any ties to the Haruhi series, I don't think it would've done as well as it could've just on the simple fact that it was a rom-com story that had no resolution.  (Seriously though, don't expect any ships to sail here.  They all sunk.)  It was a bit of boring because it just simply didn't try and go beyond what it was and it never attempted to create a resolution to the story.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Haruhi references\\n\r\n-  Platonic Rom-com story \\n\r\n-  No proper resolution\\n\r\n-  Some confusing plot points\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.01/10): Because this is a Haruhi series, the characters in Yuki Nagato are basically the same people that you see in the original show, just made to be slightly different. \\n\\n\r\nUp first, our main protagonist, Kyon.  (Cause apparently, no one knows his actual name and resorts to calling this guy by a nickname.)  Contrary to his original counterpart, Kyon isn't the fish-eyed bored person that he was back in the original series.  Rather, he's a bit more cheerful, a little more willing to have some fun with people rather than be reluctant as all hell on whatever heinous thing they're doing.  (He still keeps his wit, so that's a plus.)  While the show is based around his perspective with Kyon doing the narrative and all, his development appears only later on in the series when it takes a different turn, which is ok, but even with it, the show just sort of returns back to the status quo that it had at the beginning of the series, which didn't bode well for it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Yuki Nagato, the title character of the series.  As I have mentioned before, this spin-off takes place in the disappearance world, meaning that Yuki is no longer the cool kuudere who sits in the corner of the room reading books, but rather is a little moe creature who drools at the word Turkey, and appreciates vita games more than books.  Throughout the series, the show focuses on Yuki and her relationship with Kyon, as virtually almost every character knows about her \"little crush\" with Yuki failing (unsurprisingly) to take a step in the right direction to make her love a reality.  The thing about Yuki that I find interesting is what happens towards the end of the series where the show takes a dramatic tone change.  There, we have a plot point that makes sense in a Haruhi setting, but the show just doesn't pull through with it, leading up to the aforementioned half-assed conclusion.  It's not as if this development of her character is bad, because it put interest back into the series for me, it's just that it doesn't explore it deep enough to get a proper explanation, resulting in some plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, since I've been saying her name an awful lot, we have Haruhi, who, because she is no longer the title character, is now part of the supporting role.  Compared to her other world self, Haruhi doesn't bear any difference in character, as she is still the hyperactive UMA searching, Kyon enslaving girl who just now has longer hair.  While the show doesn't specifically focus on her as much, she still plays a very vital role in the series, as she is the one who once again, drags everyone into her schemes and forces everyone to follow what she does.  For Haruhi, this is fine for her character.  What I didn't like was how they attempted to shove in a love triangle aspect to the series, making some very obvious implications that Haruhi sees Kyon as more than a manservant.  It's bad because there really is nothing else that the series did for that plot point aside from a few silent moments form her, so it made me question the point of it since they never went through with it.  \\n\\n\r\nLikewise, most of the other Haruhi characters make appearances in this story.  Those characters most prominently being Koizumi, Mikuru, Tsuruya, and Asakura, who, like I mentioned before, is no longer a homicidal alien, but rather more like a \"mother\" towards Nagato, cooking her food, taking care of her, and the occasional scolding.  In terms of development or importance, everyone apart from Asakura doesn't get ample screentime.  They for the most part stay with what you would expect from these characters' personalities, minus the supernatural stuff that Haruhi imparted onto them.  Because they're virtually the same, there's not really much to talk about since Mikuru is still Mikuru, Koizumi is still Koizumi, and Tsuruya is still Tsuruya.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent Main characters\\n\r\n+ Side characters are the same (basically)\\n\r\n+ Haruhi is still Haruhi\\n\r\n-  Some unnecessary characteristics associated with unfinished plot points\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.00/10): The art for Nagato Yuki was not created by KyoAni like the rest of the Haruhi series, but rather by Satelight, who created an all new style of animation that makes the majority of the characters (noticeably Kyon), a hell of a lot different looking than their original look.  The animation itself doesn't really stand out all too much, since it's just standard fare, but it's the characters themselves that have such a big impact since we, the anime community, are familiar with seeing these characters a certain way. \\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you're a fan of this style of animation is up to you, so I can't say anything else beyond the fact that there's ups and downs with the new look of them all.  All I can say is, get used to seeing life in Kyon's eyes.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, the show has an OP that bears in some resemblance to the style of music that the original Haruhi series had.  With a bright and wacky song to compliment its mother series, it's a decent listen, but it to me, it doesn't resonate with me all that well and I don't find it to be as enjoyable as other people may do.  (Thats my personal opinion.)  On the other hand, the ED is a more melancholy sound.  (Ah...)  Contrary to the more bubbly songs of the mother series, there is no signature dance, there is no happy go lucky song, but rather a track that pertains to what happens on in the second half of the series.  Personally, I felt like it didn't really fit with the series considering that the majority of the show was a very slice-of-life/rom-com style of story, and it sort of clashed that feeling with the ED.  \\n\\n\r\nSide Note: The original cast of the Haruhi series voice all of their respective characters, so you don't have to worry about anyone sounding weird or anything.  Except maybe Nagato, because Minori Chihara uses the moe voice of Nagato over the kuudere version in this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Art is standard fare\\n\r\n+/- Different animation (positive or negative depending on whether you're a fan of the new designs.)\\n\r\n+/- Decent tracks, but not memorable for me\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (5.44/10): While I am personally a fan of the Haruhi series, Yuki Nagato never truly gave me that sense of entertainment when watching this.  I had expected the show to be different, seeing as how Haruhi wasn't the title character of the series, but I never expected the show to be so bland and in some scenes, uninteresting.  As a result, the score itself is quite low.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this show?\\n\\n\r\nWhile I do have many problems with this spin-off, it wasn't always completely bad.  There were the moments where the show at times was rather entertaining.  The only issue is the fact that those moments only appeared when Haruhi was around to cause havoc.  When she wasn't in the frame in some sense or another, the show didn't really have much to stand on beyond being a boring rom-com plot.  A bit of this is partly due to the fact that I'm more of a Haruhi fan than a Nagato fan, but even then, there should be moments in the show that should be able to stand on its own two legs.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like the show?\\n\\n\r\nApart form the obvious generic plotline, the ending really gritted my teeth because there simply wasn't any resolution to the series.  It went back to the status quo, which basically got rid of almost every bit of progress this show tried to make when progressing episode to episode.  In addition, they put in the whole love triangle thing which really didn't do anything for the series because it was never used and wasn't just implied, it was heavily implied with several scenes devoted to imply it even further.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen any part of the Haruhi series, most importantly, The \"Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\" movie, then I would say you have enough background to understand what is going on in this series.  (I recommend that because you will be lost otherwise.)  Also, if you're a Nagato fan, you may enjoy this as well.  While I may not have personally enjoyed the direction that it went, it's not completely terrible, as there are some aspects that I did actually find enjoyable.  However, because it plays out like a rom-com, expect it to be a rom-com because that's the main plot point of the show, and the direction that it goes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.48/10",

            "content": "The spring 2015 anime Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu also known as the disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan this is the 2nd just not appealing boring anime ive seen in the spring season next to triage x but at least triage had the fan service going for it.\r\nStory- You can read the synopsis on it but to sum it up anime wise a shy girl named Nagato Yuki is the president of a club consisting of 3 members herself and a male and female who basically do club activities and stuff along those lines and also the love story that is on going throughout the series ofNagato having a crush on the male member of her club before the expansion of more members. the name doesn't fit the series until about episode 10 or 11 when the dramatic scene actually happens the \"disappearance\" part but to be honest the story was bland and boring the characters didn't help the story much either but its not mediocre but its not good at all. The most interesting thing about the series was like 2 characters and the \"disappearance\" part which was not executed the way id would've hoped it to be.\\n\\n\r\nArt- This is where the anime lacks the most the art isnt appealing at all it just looks meh not terrible but it isnt something that you would be interested in upon first glance with whatever looking characters and backgrounds that just look not so good it isnt something i would call good and also the animation also hinders it alot as well with certain walking scenes when another character is afar the background scene just makes it look bad and when the character is walking or running in this specific type of scene it shows the quality of the animation which isn't good but again i have seen worse.\\n\\n\r\nSound- honestly its a weak ost didn't notice anything special or good but i did enjoy the ed theme that was ok but it wasn't enough and the voice actors for Nagato,Asakura and Suzumiya i absolutely enjoyed other than that its just average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- ima give this a 7 just because i liked Nagatos character although it wasn't anything new i still enjoy a quite female protagonist whos shy and cute but that's my personal liking other than that nothing amazing but its good for what it is and Asakura also was a plus her character was more so like a mother figure to Nagato giving her advice cooking for her and bending over backwards basically everything she does in the series is for Nagato at least 80% of the time and the voice actor fit the character which i appreciate. and Suzumiya which she is probably if not the best character on the entire span of the show when she appeared on the earlier episodes her character comes off as super energetic and some other traits that easily make her the most enjoyable character also you get some other characters not worth mentioning but they are whatever for most of the series nothing new and nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-  5/10 i wasn't looking forward to this series but i kept watching till the end i don't ever drop any anime that i choose to watch because you'll never know until you experience it yourself instead of hearing peoples opinions. I do not regret watching this because i was not hyped for it and in return i got what i expected a kinda below average slice of life series with other themes that honestly could have been executed better but wasn't and that ending didn't help the series in the least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 6/10 just a meh series but that's what i think if you watch and like alot of slice of life watch this. There is a manga that is currently ongoing if you are looking forward to this series just read it if you are not in that mood just watch it. \\n\\n",

            "content": "For those who have never taken the time or have not been with anime long enough to have given the parent series of Yuki-chan a thorough viewing then what you are provided with when watching this series is a story of comical romance surrounding the the character of Yuki Nagato, hence the name.  However is you are approaching this series because you are indeed a fan of the parent series then what you get is just a little bit more from the characters that you have likely come to love. Both are particularly good reasons to give the show a chance, even if thisparticular spin-off can be somewhat misleading with what the parent series actually provides. I present this review of Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu (The Disappearance of Yuki Nagato-chan) so you can decide if this show is for you. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the story of Yuki-chan is hard to hate seeing how it is written by the same beloved author of the show's parent series even if it resembles more of a stereotypical romantic comedy anime, but even so some of that eccentricity that a loyal viewer of Haruhi can relate to. As the story of Yuki Nagato-chan progresses this eccentricity that I speak of pulls this spin-off away from what is truly just a generic series, and provides a lovely perspective of 'Kyon's' life should a certain Haruhi have never existed. The art, surprisingly, is also worth mentioning seeing how a different studio has taken up the series after so many Haruhi-less years. The new art, although relatively close to that of the parent series, provides a much needed uniqueness to the show that reminds new and old fans alike that this series is not dead and we will hopefully see more of it in the future. A per usual of most high production anime the story and art are the better part of the pie and thus I reward an 8 and a 9 to them respectively. \\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department we see the return of every voice actress and actor that the parent series was completed with and it is hopeful that any English dub (none when written) will also provide the same English dub and actors as both dubs in the Parent series have proven spectacular and this series is no different. Yuki Nagato-chan is great successor to what many would call an excellent series and should find a permanent place to any fan's collection. I reward an 8 out of ten. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise the show has some limits however, this is a spin-off series and as result our main protagonist is a shy emotionally filled Yuki Nagato that was first introduced to old fans in the fourth book of the light novel series or in the franchise movie, \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya.\" This is a character that is worth loving but at the same time has some issues keeping up as the protagonist of her own show, as a result it seemed the author and studio reintroduced some initially not introduced characters. Otherwise this show would have lost a lot of watching value as the character of Yuki Nagato requires a lot of supporting roles in order to keep an average or casual audience interested. This of course probably wouldn't have been a problem assuming that the only ones that would've been watching this series were dedicated fans of the parent series and such a thing should not be assumed in the world of show production. With a lot of strong supporting roles Yuki Nagato gets a C on her test of being a good protagonist and thus is rewarded a generous 7 put of ten. Without prior knowledge of who the main protagonist is from the parent series (Yuki Nagato), then a casual viewer would not see anything particularly interesting about this Yuki which is just a shy girl with a crush. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally I could only call my enjoyment of this show as fair, being a loyal fan of the Haruhi series it seemed as thought this was just a little bit more of the characters I have come to love with no actual story progression of what we have already seen. Of course this is a spin-off and I knew this before jumping into the manga and show and so I can only speak personally when saying these things, but as an added note I do find it to be a well deserved addition to the Haruhi series and would recommend it to anyone that has seen the parent series and would recommend any newcomers to Haruhi to watch the parent series first. So for my enjoyment of the series I reward a 6 and give this spin-off the overall score of 7. This is generic romantic comedy, but it is an average anime with many reasons to dislike and just as many to reasons to like it.",

            "content": "If you've watched the Haruhi Suzumiya series, I'm pretty sure, that at least once you asked yourself the question, \"What if?\" If you haven't watched it, stop reading this, there are spoilers in this, or go ahead, I don't care! \r\nMany people will tell you what their fanficton-material stories would be, and somewhere you'll find someone asking, \"What if Haruhi wasn't a god, and what if nobody had their powers?\" And while I could just take that one scene from the Disappearance movie, and type out a thesis on Kyon's amazing monologue, I'll just throw this in your face: The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan...\r\nIt isa spin-off series that perfectly answers the above question. But before you jump off of your seat and start looking for the anime on the Internet, (yes, I'm talking to you, avid fans of the franchise!) keep in mind that this IS NOT A SEQUEL TO THE MOVIE. Instead, what we have, is a pleasant slice-of-life romance, involving the main duo, Yuki and Kyon. Yes, I know that those of you who despise that genre will be sickened by this, but as a big fan of the original franchise, I think that this is a good thing to put in. I mean, if we ignore all the fanfictions and doujinshi material, we can see that in the original anime, there was never any romance between any of the characters. Well okay, you could include Episode 6 from the \"first season\" as something between Kyon and Haruhi, but that wouldn't end up anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nFrom what I've said already, there isn't much to add. The slice of life genre may be a turn-off to some people, but if you sit through it you'll get used to it soon enough...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nLet's be honest, the characters are the main reason why anybody would watch this show... From all of the characters, the only one to change is Yuki. In the original series she was an emotionless robot who hardly spoke, in the movie, she was extremely shy, and hardly spoke, and in this anime, she is also quite shy, but talks more. She also prefers to play video games rather than read books as we are used to. \\n\r\nThe other characters haven't seen much change in terms of their personalities. Haruhi is still loud and energetic, Koizumi is still her theoretical assistant, Asakura is the mother-like figure, Mikuru is still the same klutz as she was, and Kyon is just as much of a sarcastic joker as he was in the original...luckily. Honestly, he's in my top 10 anime characters for a reason!\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & SOUND\\n\r\nIf you weren't turned off by the fact that this is a slice of life anime, you'll get turned off by the animation. Maybe. \\n\r\nThe anime was made in April 2015, by Satelight Inc., (Log Horizon, AKB0048) and to be honest, it's not that great. Yeah, it isn't the same animation style from Kyoto Animation that we're used to, but even so, the animation is quite average for the most part. The characters are still recognisable, the only difference being Mikuru having dyed her hair slightly, and Kyon looking like he's twelve years old. The best parts of when the animation kicks into overdrive, are later on in the show, when the story becomes......interesting...\\n\r\nMy favourite part of the whole anime is the dub. Why? They got the old cast back!!! Yes yes yes, more Crispin Freeman, more Michelle Ruff, and more hilarity from the cast that has made one of the best English dubs in existence. The fact that the show has the entire old cast of voice actors back gives it an almost nostalgic feeling, like you can spend more time with these amazing characters... And although it is true that the first episode is a bit \"unstable\" in terms of the dub, it gets better very quickly.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, is OK. It mainly consists of soft piano music, but there are a few tracks that stand out... The opening and ending themes aren't bad, depending on your tastes....\\n\\n\r\nFINAL EVALUATION\\n\r\nLong story short, you'll most likely enjoy this show if you enjoyed the original for the characters and comedy. What will also greatly add to your enjoyment of it are references to the original series, those that will make you smile when you see them, although they are not that easy to spot. And also, for those of you who watched the original for the sci-fi, or for the dark and slow moments from the movie, there is one story arc in this show for you, which is absolutely brilliant, and it feels like it should belong in the original too.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nIt's not season three, as I have already said, but it's a good spin-off series, that just gives us an excuse to spend more time watching our favourite characters... Sure, it doesn't have ALL of the Haruhi-ness we are used to, but there's a good amount for anyone to enjoy. \\n\r\nIf only KyoAni could make Season 3....COME ON !",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nIn the school of thought, there are two areas that are often compared and contrasted: the conscious and the subconscious. The former is what we are aware of, the actions we take that we knowingly carry out, whereas the latter is what happens \u201cwithout our knowledge,\u201d the actions we take that we unknowingly carry out. We often say that \u201cI subconsciously did this\u201d in response to doing something that we are unable to explain. But what is interesting is that we accept this \u201chidden\u201d part of ourselves. That is, despite having a main and understood self,we still believe there is a second, similar self within us. The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is connected to this notion of two selves, generating an anime that somewhat subconsciously loses itself along the way.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nSomething that not everyone learns is the notion of perspective. Having the ability to displace one\u2019s self, move outside of one\u2019s current view and look at a particular situation from a different vantage point, is valuable not only for the one shifting his or her perspective \u2013 since it reveals previously unknown ideas \u2013 but also for those being looked at differently \u2013 complete bias gives way to further understanding. The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan targets this same theme with mixed results.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s sign that its overall perspective is about perspective is in the way that it structures its narrative, and more specifically who is doing the narrating. Essentially, the plot shifts its perspective between three separate characters throughout the season: the regular Nagato, the \u201cnew\u201d Nagato, and finally Kyon. The majority of the anime follows regular Nagato (about the first ten episodes or so), with her segment more slice-of-life and romantic-comedy in nature. One moment she is sharing a drink with her crush while the next has her on vacation with all of her friends to enjoy life\u2019s small offerings. During her events, the anime is generally fun, upbeat, and lighthearted, as a simple foray into the Haruhi Suzumiya world that this spinoff comes from. Feelings of this kind are felt because the audience is viewing the anime from Nagato\u2019s perspective which coincidentally has these same emotions. Therefore the viewer comes to understand Nagato\u2019s thoughts directly from her, laying down the foundation for how the remainder of the season proceeds.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the emotions subsequently change when the perspective does, most notably when the show moves from regular Nagato\u2019s point of view to new Nagato\u2019s. No longer are the feelings related to elation but instead loneliness, depression, and sadness because that is how new Nagato perceives the environment around her. As a result, the anime also goes from being slice-of-life oriented to being dramatic in its presentation. Gone are the small talk and romps, replaced instead with trips to quiet libraries and nighttime park benches that encapsulate the plot\u2019s new focus. Haruhi\u2019s exclusion during this arc makes the switch even more apparent \u2013 the biggest ball of energy is purposefully missing to keep the show\u2019s current tone bogged down. Such a tonal shift contrasts harshly with the beginning, giving it higher impact on the viewer and therefore higher power since the effects are both immediate and palpable. But even more powerful is how the change in perspective allows for the audience, for the first time, to see regular Nagato from a new angle. Before it had always been through her eyes, through her own introspection. Now, she is seen from a point that is paradoxically inside and outside of herself due to new Nagato\u2019s special status. Consequently, the narrative showcases regular Nagato\u2019s thoughts and feelings through new Nagato, providing (coincidentally) a new angle to view the characters in question and thus the relationships involved.\\n\\n\r\nFor its final angle, the anime changes its perspective to Kyon, the character who has been the target of the girls\u2019 affections the entire time. Like new Nagato, the change in perspective can be seen in the reassembly of the anime\u2019s elements: Kyon\u2019s little sister is around more than ever, evident references to \u201cEndless Eight\u201d are included, and his previous connection to Haruhi is elaborated on. Perhaps obviously, the trend of morphing feelings continues, with this last iteration mirroring Kyon\u2019s awkwardness and unsureness. Again, these emotions are present not only because of the conflicting personalities and actions between the regular and new Nagato but also because the narrative is now from his point of view. This results in a similar investigation of the characters and relationships; the audience is now able to see both Nagatos from a perspective that is completely separate from them. Kyon wrestles with himself on what to do, he interacts with the characters in more meaningful ways \u2013 less joking and more personal \u2013 and his ultimate decision reflects the sort of middle ground that was necessary to succinctly conclude the problem at hand. The anime certainly could have flipped its perspective back to the regular Nagato but that would have reduced Kyon\u2019s plight and would not have meshed well with the newfound mood since regular Nagato was always about having a happy time.\\n\\n\r\nBut no matter how elated or melancholy the narrative gets, that does not immediately reveal what this perspective-shifting creates. In the case of The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan there is good news and bad news.\\n\\n\r\nThe good news is that the constant shifts in perspective allow the anime to escape from self-imposed narrow-mindedness. The situation between Nagato and Kyon is not relayed through a singular outlet but many outlets, altogether crafting a dynamic, rounded, and interesting tale that is open and explored since the multitude of perspectives prevents the anime from restricting its mindset. Since each main player\u2019s direction is elaborated on, the narrative is empowered because it is no longer streamlined and instead given the opportunity to reach the same destination \u2013 a satisfying resolution between the three characters \u2013 but from multiple paths at once.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the bad news is hefty and almost ruins the narrative entirely. In essence and inherently, the tactic of shifting perspectives has a major problem: losing itself along the way. Initially the anime is about regular Nagato\u2019s feelings toward Kyon but by the end it is about Kyon\u2019s feelings toward new Nagato. In other words, the show\u2019s original goals are never accomplished because the change in perspective brings with it a change in the conclusion. Using the multiple paths analogy once more, while the destination is reached, the anime chose to not look back or at least place markers along the roads it took. The implication, then, is that when the finale is over and it does see where it came from, it has no idea how it got to where it is at because there are too many paths to choose from without any sort of indication for which were taken when. Putting it differently, the conclusion makes it clear just how lost the anime is.\\n\\n\r\nWhen done right \u2013 which happens here \u2013 shifting the perspective illuminates new ways in which to view the narrative. When done wrong \u2013 which happens here \u2013 shifting the perspective conceals how the narrative got from start to finish. Collectively, the mixed concoction is neither wanted nor discarded but simply tolerated.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan chooses to employ a soft art style. Both the backgrounds and the character designs adopt this look as a means to make the anime more inviting; like a kind person, a show that is shown to be \u201ccaring\u201d is easier to approach. Along these same lines, the locations visited are familiar to both newcomers and veterans of the series. The clubroom, the school grounds, the library, Nagato\u2019s apartment, and the various areas within the city are visited, giving the anime a new yet nostalgic feel that further adds to the invitingness. Simultaneously, the show often makes use of a \u201cchibi\u201d art style, where characters and their faces become squatter and more exaggerated than normal to emphasize the comedy of the situation.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also worth highlighting the anime\u2019s expert representation of new Nagato\u2019s perspective. Where regular Nagato and Kyon have bright lighting and colors, new Nagato\u2019s arc is mired in darkness, with low lighting and more somber hues \u2013 mainly purples, blacks, and blues \u2013 that work together to make her perspective that much more sad.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 designs are actually rather plain, mostly as a result of the soft art style. Besides Haruhi\u2019s yellow ribbons and long, brown hair, the remainder of the designs all sort of blend together. The boring school uniforms, the weird hair colors, and the lack of extra detail (accessories or similar additions) keep the characters grounded in realism at the expense of interesting or memorable designs. Granted, the characters do fit their roles: Asahina\u2019s peach hair coincides with her girly behavior, Asakura\u2019s long blue hair and mature face matches her motherly instincts, and Yuki\u2019s short, purple hair and round glasses fit her shy attitude, to name a few examples. Meaning, the character designs, while uninspired, manage to be purposeful within the context of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation tends to sit somewhere in the average area due to the laidback dealings of the anime. In general, the show is never flashy or dull, instead showcasing the everyday dealings of high school teenagers. Characters interact with each other using typical body and facial movements, with a lot of the downtime regulated to them standing or sitting around having a conversation about themselves, each other, or the occurrence at hand.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan\u2019s approach to its characters is two-fold in more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, the characters embody a smorgasbord of personalities. Nagato is the clumsy girl, Kyon is the wisecracker, Asakura is the competitor, Haruhi is the hyperactive one, Koizumi is the quiet sage, and so on. The anime portrays them as such because that is who they are; of course, how could they be anybody else? Interestingly, besides Nagato\u2019s increased reactions and Asakura\u2019s more prominent role, the characters act much like they have been known to behave. That is to say, the traits that have defined them in the past \u2013 within the original series \u2013 have carried over into their present manifestations, providing the same sense of nostalgia that the art did. Indeed, people experience development over the course of their life but who they are and how they act is something that is persistent. Someone who is a partier remains a partier, someone who is a nerd remains a nerd. So, the cast of the show are the same: Nagato usually fumbles with common happenings, Kyon has a witty comment or two to share, and Haruhi is the one that designs the ridiculous activities. Characterizations like these are not just readily perceivable but also immediately attributable based on what the viewer learns and possibly has learned.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not that the partier cannot become the nerd and vice versa, but that people who portray themselves one way rarely lose that side of himself or herself. Geometrically, features are lines that connect a definition to the person in question. When someone is described as funny, that word strings the ideas of funniness with the one being described \u2013 he or she tells jokes, makes weird faces, uses overzealous motions, and so on. The same train of thought applies to the cast; calling Kyon sarcastic or Haruhi rambunctious causes the brain to start making connections.\\n\\n\r\nBut people are not one line, but many. Continuing to think with geometry, people are shapes, complex structures that weave and loop in intricate patterns. People are made up of a large amount of lines at once that, collectively, make someone who they are. In other words, people do not have just one side but several; people are multiple \u201cpersons\u201d at once. The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan showcases this mathematical premise with each of its characters. Kyon\u2019s wittiness and outward smartness sits alongside the worrywart and kind person that he is. Asakura might be a competitor at heart, but she is extremely motherly, treating Nagato like her own child. Haruhi is selfish and slightly crazy but she can be envious and sane when she wants to be. Even Koizumi, in all his infinite wisdom, would much rather flow like water, be a follower instead of the leader he seems destined for. Now, the majority of these are contradictions, where each person\u2019s \u201csecond person\u201d goes against their regular self, but this pronounces the type of shapeshifting people experience. People can, and often are, polar opposites of themselves, both because they are allowed to be and because it is simply another side to the shape.\\n\\n\r\nA potential problem arises when the most important character, Nagato Yuki, is used in conjunction with this line of thinking. As is shown, the anime depicts the regular and the new Nagato as different people entirely. Not the same person with two distinct halves but rather two distinct people. That is, it appears as if the Nagatos do not follow this train of thought since the anime goes out of its way to say, \u201cThis is one Nagato and this is another,\u201d that it is not one Nagato with multiple sides but instead two separate women. But they do. Regular Nagato is surely shy but hidden beneath her hiding exterior is a girl looking for and wanting love. New Nagato is a bit more reserved yet sure of herself. While she was not looking for love, it found her, with the understanding she had of her person encouraging her to press on where the other Nagato never could.\\n\\n\r\nThe Nagatos being two separate people, with their own set of traits, features, and quirks that make them composed of several \u201cpeople,\u201d is ultimately the anime\u2019s message: a person is composed of a mishmash of shapes that make him or her a completely unique one. In a way, the show is alluding to the original series, with its characters having identities separate of their \u201cnormal\u201d selves that made them special individuals. Kyon\u2019s final talk goes down the way it does because he understands this notion, how people are made up of multiple facets that make them who they are, make them stand-out from everyone else. He sees that it was not the regular Nagato he started to have feelings for but the new Nagato, with her books, quietness, and confidence that allured him. It was new Nagato\u2019s shape, not regular Nagato\u2019s, that seemed so appealing. Kyon\u2019s words do not have romance flourish between any of the couplings, but it highlights the importance of differentiation. Differentiating not only between people but also between ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nAs it stands, the entire cast lacks major development despite the drama instilled, which would seem to hamper their execution. However, due the characters\u2019 theme on multiplicity being as involved as it is, their purpose is not entirely folded into nothingness.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is very ecstatic, which is strange since this is an anime about Nagato and not an anime about Haruhi. Regardless, the upbeat nature of the piece comes from the quickness, multiple vocalists, and weird instrumental effects that make the track itself pretty crazy. A little too crazy, given the content of the anime during the latter portions of the series. It can be fun to listen to at times but is mostly forgettable. The ending theme is the opposite, in tempo, emotion, and memorability. The vocalist gives a strong performance, the sentimental tone is serene, and the backup choir supports the main singer well. It is a track filled with loneliness, longing, and love, each of which can be easily felt when listening to it both when and when not watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the soundtrack is two-fold like the characters. Since half of The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is a comedy, many of the tracks are similarly fun, with beach-like tunes, acoustic sounds, and faster beats to fit the occasion. The other half is dramatic, with accompanying flutes, pianos, and violins taking up much of the music. The dramatic pieces are better than the comedic ones mainly as a result of the passion they exude when compared to their silly brethren. Overall, the OST is a nice group of songs that are neither strong nor weak, used when needed but lacking power.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the show is somewhere above average. Many of the voice actors and actresses reprise their roles, such as Minori Chihara as Nagato, Tomokazu Sugita as Kyon, and Aya Hirano as Haruhi. Minori Chihara in particular gave a wonderful performance, providing a voice that is awkward, quiet, and straining, portraying Nagato as the pitiable yet hopeful lead. Alongside Tomokazu Sugita\u2019s sarcastic and overly-manly voice for Kyon, Aya Hirano\u2019s peppiness for Haruhi, and the remainder of the men and women giving nice performances, the cast as a whole gave the show some much-needed life.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI would not consider myself a fanatic (aka, a fan) when it comes to the Haruhi series. I think it is well-done \u2013 and yes that does include the second season that seems to literally define repetition \u2013 but I never find myself talking about the series to someone else or even suggesting it. Again, not that I hate the series or find it missing in execution, which are both untrue, it is simply always sitting somewhere slightly outside of my mind. The movie which, coincidentally enough, shares nearly the exact same name as this series, is a whole different beast that should be viewed by everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, as I was watching this one, I found myself liking it. It was because of the romance aspect; watching Nagato squirm, stutter, and smile her way towards the love she wanted was cute to watch, as was all of the blushing and courage she sporadically had. The references to the original were cool throwbacks, too. They were used sparingly and appropriately: not too much so that it became indistinguishable from the original series and not too little so that it forgot its origins. Comedy-wise, the show also had a foothold, with reaction faces, character interactions, and skits that would usually get a laugh out of me now and again.\\n\\n\r\nBut as the anime began switching its perspective, so did I. I started to find the show less and less entertaining the further along it progressed. New Nagato\u2019s segment is arguably the strongest part of the anime, but it was a section that was honestly quite boring. I wanted Nagato to continue fighting for Kyon\u2019s attention. I wanted Kyon and Haruhi\u2019s personalities to still be around. I wanted Asakura\u2019s overprotection. I wanted the fun, the romance, back. But I did not get what I wanted. What I got was a show that was not what it was before, making me, like Nagato, longing for that which I could not have.\\n\\n\r\nFor a final note, I want to say that, despite Minori Chihara\u2019s amazing performance, I hated Nagato\u2019s voice. Nagato acted cute but spoke in a way that was unfavorable. It was not deafening or unbearable, but it was grating and annoying. Each time she started to speak, I was wondering when she would stop because it sounded like she was struggling, drowning in a sea of her own vocal chords. To be fair, that is sort of the point \u2013 she is a super-shy girl that has difficulty socializing with others \u2013 but that did not prevent me from disliking her each time she opened her mouth.\\n\\n\r\nThe Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is an anime that has surprisingly strong themes on perspective and variability of the self, with mediocrity within its remaining parts unfortunately covering them. The story gets lost in some woods, the characters\u2019 development gets misplaced in a cabin, and the music gets abandoned on a mountainside, each with zero chance of recovery since the show never attempts to find them. At the minimum, the anime, like its lost items, will continue to exist in the subconscious of those that have seen it: always there but not quite remembered.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, the narrative\u2019s tendency to shift its perspective gives it new angles but simultaneously causes it to lose itself along the way\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, nice art style, adequate character designs, about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, while missing a lot of development, the cast demonstrates the idea of multiplicity in ourselves\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, fun and comedic in the beginning, reducing in entertainment the further along it proceeds, with Nagato\u2019s grating voice persistent from start to finish\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "Alright buckle up boys and girls, cause this reviewer is bout to rage!\r\nQuestion time: Do you like Haruhi Suzumiya? Its genius philosophy, supernatural comedic charm, time traveling, kickass music and general random happenings?\r\nNow imagine if the Haruhi Suzumiya series had NONE of that at all.\r\nWell there you go, Disapparance of Nagato-Yuki in a nutshell.\r\nStory 2/10\r\nSo the premise is basically \"What if Kyon never tried to stop Nagato and just let her rewrite the universe where everyone is normal\" \r\nMy honest opinion: If you were like me and felt really sorry for Nagato at the ending of Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, well don't feel sorry anylonger! Cause this anime will help you come to the decision that Nagato is better off as an emotionless robot after all(This should be a f**king ad!)\\n\\n\r\nA series known for being unique and even greatly influenced anime culture is thrown out of context and replaced with a mediocre slice of life rom-com! And here's the best f**king part, there isn't even a gaddamn confession! Seriously the purpose a rom com is that you build up to a somewhat epic love confession at the last episode and they can't even f**king do that! (Yeah, I can feel all the slice of fans raging over this)\\n\\n\r\nThe whole shows feels like an insult to the Haruhi series. Filled with bad plot, recycled jokes from the main Haruhi series (Hell, at one point they tried to reenact Endless Eight) Just...dreadful to watch\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 2/10\\n\r\nI know a different studio handled this adaption so I won't point fingers on this part. But just know its still shit\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\r\nNow you may be wondering why I gave this a 3? Well that's cause the show's only saving grace was its side character. Who is this side character you ask? Well, its the f**king diva queen herself, Haruhi gaddamn Suzumiya. In the original series I may have hated her guts but in this one I welcomed it with open arms. I enjoyed every second she was on screen cause she actually advances the plot! (On the 5th episode she marched right in North High and started the uhm...Literature Brigade?)\\n\\n\r\nThe other saving grace would be Nagato Yuki herself, halfway through the series Nagato gets in a spontaneous car accident (for plot reasons) and wakes up as the emotionless Nagato we all know and love. When that happened I literally threw my arms in the air and shouted \"YES\" as loud as I could (Don't get your hopes up tho, it only last for 3 episodes, that was the only good point of the series.)\\n\\n\r\nBtw if you're some horny dude that enjoys all the fanservice Asahina gave in the main series? Forget it, the amount of screen time she got in this series can probably amount up to 1 and a half episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall 1/10\\n\r\nYou know how to tell when an anime is bad? Its when the mandatory beach/hotspring episode can't even save the series. Hell, they had BOTH beach and hotspring epsiodes back to back and it still sucked!\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I've never given such a low review before on a series. (Except maybe for Glasslips, now thats another shit stain I'll probably rage about later)\\n\\n\r\nIts so bad that if I had to choose between watching Endless Eight all over again over this series? I'll take my chances with Endless Eight.\\n\\n\r\nBut in general, don't watch this, whether you're a Haruhi fan or not just don't watch this garbage",

            "content": "What do you get when you take away the S.O.S Brigade? The \"Godly\" Haruhi Suzumiya? The espers, the time travelers and Yuki the alien? Well, you get this... A pile of horsesh*t. To be honest though, I did enjoy the show quite a bit but not as much as the Haruhi series.  \r\n[Story]: (4/10) \r\nYuki Nagato, the shy president of the literature club, has never been very sure of herself around other people. But around Kyon, the only boy in the tiny, three-person club, Yuki finds herself faltering even more than usual. For Kyon, and for her precious club, Yuki must find her confidenceand let her true personality shine! \\n\\n\r\nWhen I found out there was a spin off to the Haruhi series called \"The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan\"..Man, was I hyped. I mean, the movie came out 5 years ago with no sight of the 3rd Season for the Haruhi series. A spin-off was pretty much good enough for me, as long as I can see Haruhi, Kyon and the gang again. Welp, my hyped quickly died down after seeing the first 3 episodes. Why? Because it didn't have the same feeling or vibe as the Haruhi series. Kyon was right, without the espers, the time travelers and the aliens, life is boring. The show just demonstrated that. The episodes are just your typical slice-of-life with no mysteries whatsoever. That's what made me love the Haruhi series in the first place. A slice-of-life with mysteries. Taking out the mystery part is like taking out the strawberry in your strawberry cake. It's just no fun. \\n\\n\r\nThe first 2 episodes re-introduced the characters but not so much because they already assumed that you have seen the Haruhi series and you know these characters very well. \\n\r\nThe first 10 episodes are just your typical slice-of-life/rom-com moments. In other words, eating, fooling around, main girl doing everything to catch the male's attention..that kind of stuff. \\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 11-13 is where it gets good...or so I thought. Ep. 11-13 is \"The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan\" arc. At this point, I thought the show was going to get better but instead, it became even more boring. She didn't really disappear like how Haruhi disappeared in the movie. Only her personality disappeared and it got replaced by her \"old/alien\" personality. Only temporarily though. I was very disappointed at this arc. Was I expected to cry when Yuki's old/alien personality was about to go? Because it's not even that sad. I was just too bored and I wanted the arc to be over with. \\n\\n\r\nThe last 3 episodes is again, your typical slice-of-life with no mystery plus some rom-com moments. In other words, it's the same as the first 10 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nSome people thought the ending was a disappointment but I didn't find it disappointing. I actually thought it was a decent ending. It felt somewhat similar to the \"Endless Eight\" arc but very different. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8/10)\\n\r\nNoo!! What happened with the animation?! If you compare this to the 2006 version of \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\", it looks like the main series' had a younger brother (which is this show) and he somehow had a birth defect. Yea, I was disappointed when I first saw the animations and I was also disappointed that the show is not made by Kyoto Animation this time around. The show is animated by Satelight so there's a reason why the animation is different than the 2006 version. To be honest though, if you look at this show without looking at the main series then the show's animation looks pretty good. The character designs also bugged the hell out of me when I first saw them because KyoAni's character designs looks a lot better but I got used to the show's character design in about 2 episodes. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (7/10)\\n\r\nIs it just me or does the soundtrack feel similar to the Haruhi series?....Nah, I'm not alone on this one. The soundtrack IS the exact same as the soundtracks played in the Haruhi series. There is some new ones but I'm glad most of them returned because I absolutely love the theme that plays during Haruhi's crazy missions in the Haruhi series. In here, it's used in a similar way. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Fure Fure Mirai\" by Kitakou Bungei-bu Joshikai and the ED theme song is \"Arigatou, Daisuki\" by Minori Chihara.. \\n\r\nIn my opinion, I was disappointed at the OP and ED theme song. I admit, the OP is catchy but it's a shitty OP theme song at the same time. The ED theme song is just downright annoying because the singer's voice didn't really fit with the sad and dramatic tone that the ED theme song is trying to play. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub so I'll be reviewing the English VAs. They all reprise their roles and they all did a great job with their characters. Yuki's English VA managed to have that \"cute, innocent, shy and moe\" voice. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Character]: (7/10)\\n\r\nAll the characters you know and love from the Haruhi series has been re-introduced in this show and this time, they have no special powers..How boring...\\n\r\nKyon is the same as always and thank god nothing changed about him because I love his monologues and his funny ass sarcasms. Yuki Nagato's personality has completely changed. She went from an alien with no personality to a normal somewhat-shy teenage girl who plays her PS Vita all day. Reading books is boring anyways right? Ms. Asahina is still the same old moe but doesn't cosplay anymore. My beloved Mikuru..wearing her maid outfit..gone.. Itsuki is still the same old cocky transfer student but this time, he has a crush on Haruhi. Lastly, Haruhi is not the god anymore. Meaning the world will not turn \"upside down\" if she gets bored. She's still the same old over-cheery girl though so if you found her annoying (I don't find her annoying) in the main series then expect Haruhi to be more annoying in this show.\\n\\n\r\n2 characters that didn't really get a lot of screentime in the Haruhi series finally gets more screentime in this show. That's Asakura and Tsuruya. In the main series, Asakura tried to kill Kyon and if I remember correctly, she too was an alien. Well, here..She's a normal girl who helps Yuki most of the time and she's part of the Literary Club with Yuki and Kyon. She doesn't have any intentions of killing Kyon and we are shown that when she gets on her \"angry\" side, she tends to be scary. Very scary.. Tsuruya is still the same old annoying rich girl. \\n\\n\r\nDo I like these characters? In a way, yes..They're pretty decent but they're definitely inferior when compared to their selves with special powers. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (7/10)\\n\r\nI'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy this anime because I did enjoy it. Except for the \"Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan\" arc which felt really boring. The comedy is still there but not as great as the Haruhi series.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (7/10)\\n\r\n\"The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan\" didn't really live up to the hype like the Melancholy and the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya did. It just doesn't feel the same as those 2 series. It felt like a generic rom-com with slice of life moments. It's still a quite enjoyable series to watch but don't expect it to feel almost the same as the 2 main series. However, if you look at the show on its own then you might enjoy it even more. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Animation looks pretty good\\n\r\n+Most of the soundtracks in the main series returned here, with some new ones. \\n\r\n+Nice change in the characters\\n\r\n+Yuki's personality is better than her old personality\\n\r\n+Show retained Kyon's monologues and funny sarcasms\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Flat Story\\n\r\n-Show doesn't feel the same when compared to the Haruhi series\\n\r\n-Generic Rom-Com/Slice of Life moments\\n\r\n-Inconclusive Ending",

            "content": "If you do watch this show as an independent production, meaning you haven't watched Suzumiya Haruhi,yet; let us know how you think about it. honestly.\r\nAs it is a spin-off, one has to assume there are elements that meet the original. There are.\r\nI have been able to gain some smirking and leisure smiling off of it.\r\nMy opinion in whole is based on the fact that i have finished the show in a streak with the original plus the movie, all in chronological order (as i always do; bingecore-coma-coming!). So i am biased as the emotions are fresh and i am able to see where it fitsnicely and where it is too vague. The latter is, i have to say it, too often the case.\\n\\n\r\nWhile i wonder how it would feel if watching it on its own, i must state that the story does make no sense in far too many scenes, independent of specific episodes, it is just 'absent' sometimes, without leaving an idea of 'hey-that-is-intended'; you are just left clueless. Whatever the heck and why? I dunno. There is always a: \"But how should one understand that, without watching the original show?\"- adding a \"Even if you watched its origins, wut da frag?\"- -impression.\\n\\n\r\nSo i have to say ..\\n\r\n .. that i seldom ( as in 'never' ... ) do express what i don't like, at least i don't leave it as a comment or review or whatever you may call it, because there's always a gang of haters doing that fine'nuff. Nevertheless i feel the need to point that out, as this 'alternative'-representation of Suzu-Haru could have been a perfect add-on to it's origin, by just doubling the num of episodes and leave some question marks in the in-between to bait you for watching the former series.\\n\\n\r\nAlso using a change in style (as very well done in the progress of the 'Endless Eight'-arc of Suzumiya Haruhi) to make clear that this is a show on its own, but there still are heavyweight-connections, would have been helpful; especially if used on Asakuri, who plays a tremendously important role in both series. Shamisen, could|should have been used as a 'bridger' too. Yet, they haven't done that ...\\n\\n\r\nAsides the visuals, everything else is simply dull, a good decent null, dull; in contrast to Suzu-Haru even the music, only playing along, neither used as a beneficiary factor to dote the storytelling, nor at least synced to the action to bend the impression, just dull, decent-null, dull.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the ( good, but dull .. decent-null .. -eye-catching .. dull ) artwork is more than fine for the whole show on an identical level as Suzu-Haru, giving that typical slice-of-life feel, retouching the CG almost all-over.\\n\\n\r\nBut it is dull, decent-null, dull. ( I am intrigued there's a pattern hidden ... Hmmmmmmm ?!? ... )\\n\\n\r\nWhereas most masses might be comfy by scoring based on visuals and story in forefront, there is also the ear in need of syntactical-sugar and asides the voice-acting on it self to transport what is happening, there is also writing needed to allow the actors to tongue-twist some audible candy.\\n\r\nIn Suzu-Haru that auditive ingredient was done vell .. very well .. vell. There the main-male-character isn't the usual somewhat-sturdy, quietly nifty nitpicker bathing in dry-humour; There is more to him. He has opinions on almost everything. And for me ( white | male | westerner | disabled | intelligent | sarcastic | parent ) these .. h-opinions .. are very likable and the comedic offspring lies in the voice-acting more than in the character-drawing.\\n\r\nThis vital point is audaciously missing in Naga-Yuki and therefore it seems to be showing off the same looks of him, but is in the end displaying a totally different person, at least i feel so; while that pin-point is needed and good enough done for Yuki, it definitely is not for Kyon.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it up:\\n\\n\r\nYes, i am abusing the possibility to write a 'Review' for a sort-out of pieces that don't meet the whole Suzu-Haru- | Naga-Yuki- -puzzle.\\n\\n\r\nI have absolutely no idea how to describe this show, which by the way i won't do ever, at least not like the most of MAL-Users.\\n\\n\r\nIf on its own or in contrast to its origin; there is none but that pressing 'something is missing'.\\n\\n\r\nI am eager to know how one would review Naga-yuki when it was watched first, not second in row with Suzu-Hara.\\n\\n\r\nNo anger is rising that this show doesn't fit into the Suzumiya-Haruhi-Universe as a Near-by-Galaxy, but a disappointment and that static-noise-of-feeling-wrong didn't decay for a while now.\\n\\n\r\nI think the artists could have done so much more with it, without working-to-death- or sunk-some-cash- -bombs;\\n\\n\r\nIt is sad. Simply said: I am sad.\\n\\n\r\nYou may watch it. Or you won't. Makes no difference. Just that it's there isn't reason enough to watch it. Although, it won't do you any harm; but that can obviously assumed, as it's just there.\\n\\n\r\nYou may watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOr you won't.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\n- No thievery done for this Review.\\n\r\n- No summary at all, in any way, as usual.\\n\r\n- I totally pointed out the WHY i disliked this show.\\n\r\n- This brainchild is not spoiled.\\n\r\n- Asides abusing hypothetical users as lead-in for a sentence, no MAL-member|-review was focused and|or harmed.\\n\r\n- Ain't no Barbie-code included.\\n\r\n- The public is reviewed.",

            "content": "First off,  The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is my favorite anime. That show has basically become my life as a whole. I love the show, the movie, and the Haruhi chan spinoff. I figured I would love the Disappearance of Nagato Yuki chan just as much, as I love all the characters, and couldn't wait to see all my children in action again. Long story short, I was thoroughly disappointed. \r\nFirst off, THERE IS NO WAY TO SUCCESSFULLY MAKE A HARUHI SUZUMIYA SERIES WITHOUT SCI FI STUFF! The sci fi stuff is the thing I love most about the series, which kinda turned meoff about the series. For another thing, making the series a cheesy romance was NOT ok. I get some people enjoy romance, and as much as romance is not my favorite genre, the romance isn't what I hate. Haruhi Suzumiya was not meant to be a romance. That's what I hate. \\n\\n\r\nNext, the characters. I love the characters in Haruhi Suzumiya. Now, I haven't finished the series yet, and probably won't, but from where I am, the characters seem totally different, and not the same children I adopted. Tsuruya and Haruhi basically just rape Mikuru all the time, which I get Haruhi kinda did in Melancholy, but Tsuruya didn't do that. Mikuru is too weak, and is just there to be raped and add sex appeal, which is NOT her role in the Melancholy. Yuki shows FAR too much emotion, which I get she's capable of that here, but she shouldn't show that much of it. Minor emotion, people. Give her some, but not too much. Small bits of it. Kyon is too oblivious to emotions, more so than in the Melancholy, and Itsuki's too much of a pushover. Only Asakura feels right.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the series on its own isn't that bad. Not my favorite animation in a show, but not terrible. However, it's too different from the animation in the Melancholy, and just feels wrong. Its not like the drawings are bad, the characters just don't look right.\\n\\n\r\nThe music actually isn't all bad, unlike the rest of the series. I mean, the ending song was kinda REALLY bad. Too slow, and didn't fit with the rest of the show. However, the opening was GREAT. Everything someone could want in an opening theme. Between the super upbeat music and the flashy pictures, someone can completely forget how much they feel like gouging their eyes out while watching and enjoy the music. The opening was the ONLY thing in the series that I actually enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short: I you're a fan of the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and hate cheesy romance stuff, DON'T watch this series. You'll regret it, and waste your life.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am not really a fan of the whole Haruhi Suzumiya franchise, however I will admit that I have enjoyed aspects of it and of course enjoyed the characters themselves. The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki -Chan evaded me for awhile so I was really curious as to what it was about. From what I saw it did not meet with rave reviews, but I still wanted to see it anyway, just in case Haruhi was not in it.\r\nI have always enjoyed Yuki as a character, she was always overshadowed by Haruhi and at times seemed to blend into the background noise, and the Yuki inthis show was very similar. A small timid, if somewhat clumsy girl who tries to find love amidst the usual high school rom-com atmosphere that seems to typify a lot of anime of this genre. Not a lot goes on during the first 10 episodes, in fact you could probably condense it into a third of that length because we have really seen it all before. Unfortunately Haruhi raises her head and that was where my hackles rose because that was the last thing I needed to see. I am not a fan of Haruhi as a character, but early in this series he does not seem to be that overbearing irritating main character that she was in everything else. \\n\\n\r\nArtwork is simple, soft lighting and simple designs, and at times I really liked it, but I did find the overly white faces a bit jarring; what were they trying to convey? I also felt that there was a lot of skipping over detail, and rehashing of scenes. At times the story is boring, but I did like the Yuki I was seeing here, she was shy and soft and just that little bit vulnerable, missing the efficient, machinelike Yuki from the original series. Kyon was like he always was. A likable guy who seems to spend the time trying to appease and get along with the girls who he is surrounded by, and being used as a handy punchbag/scapegoat/skivvy by everybody except Yuki and Miss Asahina. Oh yes, she is there, and her character is pretty similar to what we are used to, although she just makes a token appearance when required to. I was pleased that Kyon's sister also makes an appearance too, she was always good for a surprise moment.\\n\\n\r\nED is wonderful, although I did not really notice the OP. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there is episode 11-13: and these three episodes were really what it was about, everything else was just filler. I especially liked the poignant moments in 13. I think you could probably get away with watching 10-13 without missing any of the earlier episodes. Everything after 13 seems like a rehash of something we have seen before. \\n\\n\r\nThe big question is: Why? Why did they make this in the first place? It really does not lend anything to the franchise and frankly it pales in significance to the original Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and is nowhere as good as The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. My guess it is to cash in on the popularity of the former and latter (and trying to deflect criticism of the woeful Endless Eight). \\n\\n\r\nI rated it a 7 because I did enjoy it and I was feeling generous, but that was because I am a Yuki fan, but other than that? it was OK. Not great, just OK. There is a lot better out there, and I am afraid that any follow up will probably slip past my radar with nary a glimpse.\\n",

            "content": "The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is a controversial beast to tackle. On one hand, it was the first anime in the \"Haruhi Suzumiya\" universe in years, but on the other, it completely misrepresents what the original show stood for. If you're looking for a tl;dr - This show is an insult to everything Haruhi stood for and is absolutely not worth anyone's time or money. Now, let's figure out why.\r\n(As this show is a sequel, there will be some unavoidable spoilers for \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\" movie, and, likewise, the first two seasons of Haruhi. If you haven't watched any of those, please, doyourself a favor and pick those up)\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nThis is actually one of the most redeeming aspects of this show. After the whole universe changing shtick of the Disappearance movie, Kyon could have chosen to stay in the world that Nagato created. What would have happened if he did was a question on many Haruhi fans' minds, and this show aims to answer that question. On premise alone, this show has a decent story. The problem comes with its delivery. While some individual arcs are okay, as a whole, the show's story falls flat. The pacing is all over the place, entire arcs are only possible because of characters acting idiotically or because of major conveniences, many of the scenarios are recycled from the original Haruhi series, and it's very easily predictable. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 2/10\\n\r\nThis is one of the worst aspects of the show. Honestly, who approved these character designs? I don't understand how a show that was one of the first major 2000s anime breakout hits in the west could be reduced to what looks like bad fan art in its spin off series. The original studio, Kyoto Animation, did NOT create this series, and the studio that did, Satelight, didn't even ATTEMPT to make the characters look the same. Not only that, but the actual animation itself is lazy and inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nThis had the potential to be the best part of the series. Once again, however, it fell far short. All of the original voice actors in both English and Japanese reprised their roles for this spin off. (It should be said that, while, I watched the original two seasons and movie dubbed and subbed, I only completed this show in dub. I did, however, watch key scenes subbed and I believe my points are true across both). The most exciting aspect of this show, for me, was to see some of my favorite characters and hear them the way I always knew them to be. The problem is that the actors have seemingly been out of practice voicing their characters. The closest to the original sound came from Haruhi, Kyon and Mikuru, but there were some blunders from all of them. Koizumi, Tsuruya, and Asakura all were hit or miss. They sounded similar, but different enough for something to seem off. The biggest offender of mediocre acting, though, was Nagato. What happened? I'd think that she would sound SIMILAR to the way she did in the movie (the version of her that this Nagato is based on), but she just doesn't. Even in a specific arc about 3/4 of the way through this series, where she is supposed to sound the way she used to, it's still not even close to the original Nagato. I don't know how she messed up so royally, but Nagato sounded like a completely different person.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nThis is it. This is the worst aspect of the show by far and away. Every single interpretation of the characters is an insult to who they were in the original series. Kyon went from being snarky, witty, and an involuntary accessory to what was going on to having nothing interesting or funny to say at all. His key narration from the original series is gone and the absence is definitely felt. Koizumi went from a (mildly) shady supporting lead that was clearly always scheming to a pretty boy that simultaneously has a crush on both Haruhi and Kyon. Haruhi went from a wildly eccentric and charismatic leader to a side character that spends more time being the straight man and voice of reason than anyone else. Asakura went from yandere to tsundere. Mikuru went from bubbly moe girl to a literal brick. Her IQ has to be negative in this show. Once again, though, the worst is Nagato. Even when I compare this Nagato the one from the movie, she's still incredibly different. She's not a shy/bookish girl that's clearly lonely, she's bratty, obsessed with video games and painfully social inept. \\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nThis show was horrible. The only thing that made this show bearable were all of the callbacks and references to the original series. The actors and writers knew why people would watch this show, and they played on the audience's love for the original series until the last second of this show. If it wasn't for that, this show would be one of the worst I've ever seen. Do not waste your time watching this show. If you're a Haruhi fan looking for more of the series you love, read the Light Novels, read the Manga, or even read a fanfiction. It's legitimately impossible to get a worse representation of Haruhi than this show, so anything would be better.",

            "content": "Yuki Nagato's story is a spinoff of one of the most beloved anime satires, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. It takes the premise of the movie - using an alternate dimension where this show's protagonist is a normal girl - and gives her a somewhat normal life. It borrows some great characters, and puts a new, shoujo-ish rom-com spin on the show with a new story.\r\nMost of the characters are preserved nicely enough. Haruhi, strangely, translates even better than in the original show, showing a sense of humanity and being something other than a plot device. She's learned empathy. Koizumi is the strange, awkwardly smilingidiot from before. Mikuru is still a big blog of kawaii, if not even more kawaii with the new studio lending their trademark cutesy animation style (to a mixed reception). Unfortunately, screen time for our old club members is shot and they lose their half-episode monologues, so become firm members of the supporting cast. The various other members of the backline such as Tsuruya are basically the same and aren't worth writing about.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems come from the leads. Our old protagonist, our new protagonist and Ryouko.\\n\\n\r\nKyon is almost exactly the same. However, whereas before he was simultaneously the catalyst and the cure for the chaos, keeping a level head for the audience, he is now just a chill guy doing normal things with some sarcastic remarks. \\n\\n\r\nRyouko is very good side-lead-character material, and the show does develop her character. Unfortunately, her character is pretty much dominated by the few character-traits that we saw in the original show; her mothering quality and her psychotic qualities, and it ramps these up to annoying. It's nice to see a character so briefly seen given some new screentime, but I wished they were more daring and introduced a new side to her, and actually expanded upon the source material.\\n\\n\r\nBecause they didn't even do that with our protagonist, Yuki Nagato. If you watched the movie, you'll remember her alternate personality. It's the same, and no where near enough to be the leading persona.\\n\\n\r\nShe's dainty and wimpy and does nothing of her own accord. She's not very funny. She doesn't inspire change in the show's plotline. It's hard to care about her. The only thing going for her is her crush on Kyon, which is kinda generic for the genre.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, as far as the genre goes, it's bland and cliche. Every single club-anime trope makes an appearance, and unlike when the source material did it, no unique spin is added. The Disappearance of Yuki Nagato-chan aims for average and barely lands.\\n\\n\r\nThe story plods along for 6 or 7 episodes in the exact same territory you've been used to for years. When the old club members and Haruhi come into the show, it becomes a bit more interesting, though nothing above mediocre, decently charming trash.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it finally does something different, it goes the extra mile, taking a leaf out of the original show to write an arc using some of the trippy imagery that Kyon was forced to witness. It's so poorly written and repetitive that it becomes frustrating, and carries barely any interest. It's not like it's even an evolution of the narrative (I had to check I hadn't missed something like a post-credit scene), and relies solely on a random event outside of the character's control to even happen.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a misstep that could have been refreshing, we go back to normal, almost as if nothing's happened, for a generic firework's episode. I'm not sure what else I expected.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that made this watchable was the wink-wink nudges. The jokes referencing the 28, solid episodes. The returning musical hooks. The sounds I'd grown up with and hummed and repeated for years. \\n\\n\r\nBut they're layered on top of mediocrity and it sullies the name I loved. \\n\\n",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\nBefore specific comment I'll say how to think of this spin-off as in comparison to original Haruhi series. In a sense this is a pseudo alternate universe prequel of Yuki story. (but it isn't). It's a cute moeblob anime with blander art style of modern day anime. So think of it as reskined Haruhi anime into modern moeblob with nostalgia of Haruhi. Moving on now onto anime specific comments.\r\nStory\r\nHonestly, I was't too fond of it at the start, first 3 episodes or so felt like some reallymediocre moeblob Anime. But then I somehow grew onto it and at certain point it had quite dramatic \"arc\", that also gave nostalgia feel of old Haruhi series. So anyhow, it's mostly the usual thing. Cute girl and bunch of sidekicks doing their daily activities, club activities and so on. Then we get a piece of romance and drama.  I would say romance was quite the average part in here, but the dramatic part that came on really made me bump up the score. (moeblob part of the anime was between 5 and 6, while dramatic I loved, that would been 8. Thus the average of 7) Anyhow, story was enjoyable and satisfying enough finale.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nArt is something hate or love. Old Haruhi series had really nice art and on top of that movie was superb. Whilst this Anime is \"modern bland moeblob\". It just felt odd seeing Haruhi in such manner. Wasn't that fond of it, but the comedic value reactions and expressions made up for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\n2 parts here to mention. Voice acting and soundtrack/music. Voice acting is something that felt odd. First sentences that Kyon uttered made me instantly think \"Gintoki what are you doing here\" so I though \"maybe voice acting cast has changed\". And for my own surprise cast remained same as in the old Haruhi, which really confused me as I couldn't recognize any of the characters. Well it's been years since I watched Haruhi so maybe their voices changed, microphones somewhat affected voice and so on.. But yeah, voice acting was great for most part.\\n\\n\r\nOST/music, was actually quite okay and good. Did really love the piano tracks though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nI think most personalities remained pretty similar to old Haruhi, with only difference of Nagato being shy moeblob here. With a bit nostalgia trip later on. Haruhi is obnoxious as always in somewhat satisfying/enjoyable way. Kyon with usual \"slapstick straight man act\" and rest of characters weren't really to complain either about. Point being, characters were enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up, it was a more of odd enjoyment, that at start felt mediocre, but in the end was enjoyable experience. Did still love the odd humor in this show plus lot of great expressions and reactions. Did like old Haruhi more, but they aren't really the same thing. So for its part what it was. For a \"bland moeblob of modern day\" it was enjoyable.",

In the Suzumiya Haruhi original serie, things were changing and have a little drama (a lot in the movie) but here... the world is like a rainbow where nothing crucial happens. From the start at the end of the anime. Later, in episode 11, i thought that the history was just starting, and I really was excited, then everything just happen with a boring \"drama\" if i can call it like that (excepting the love confession). Finally, in episode 16 everythings just... nah, restart button and nothing happen.\r\nAbout characters... they were likein the original excepting Yuki, who now was more social, changes books for videogames, was naive and some moe. Very different from the movie. \\n\r\nFinally, i think this is a 4/10, not more, not less.",

She is too out going and I can't handle that. This anime is called Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu, so why does Haruhi play a big part in the series. I was enjoying the anime up until they met her.

I only recognized Haruhi because I saw a trailor or so but \"Nagato Yuki-Chan no Shoushitsu\" is closed in this 16 episodes. It's a nice Anime for a rainy day and you haven't something better but you shouldn't have high expectation.\r\nHere is my concrete rate:\r\nStory: 4\r\nI found it was really predictable and not something new. Every typical japanese attempt do the characters, start with valentines day till holiday on the beach. I like these kind of romantic storys buthere it was to much and I thought it's very clich\u00e9. Only in the middle was something new but I found this part out of place and I don't know why they put it in.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8+\\n\r\nThe Art is great. It's  really colorfull and dynamic. I got in a good mood by seeing it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI have nothing to say. It is in a good quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nI'm sorry but it was to stereo and not really nice. I also don't like the voice of Yuki. There are soo typical that it's really boring after a while.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nIn the end I saw it really fast till the end, so also it was for me to stereotype it wasn't so bad either. Sometimes they tried really hard to be funny also by adept music but it looked to stressed. Anyway there are funny and nice scenes so after all 5 points.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nIt's not really good but the Art is so great and the 16 episodes go quickly to watch. Don't have expectations and it's nice.",

            "content": "I didn't write a review for TMHS, but I felt like writing a review for this because it illustrates a problem that I have with spin-off type things pretty well. I'll try to keep the review in sections but they will undoubtedly overlap. It will contain some SPOILERS of both Yuki & Haruhi Series.\r\nArt 4/10: For fans of TMHS, it's hard to see how the art wouldn't be a disappointment. Clearly they were trying to go for something tonally different with the new show, but the bright, pastille like sheen that washes over everything only seems to have the effect of rendering the images completelyneutral. You might even say they lack tone altogether. There's really not much more to say about the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: The score was actually one of the shows' successes. I'll admit that I like my classical music, which helps a lot for this because it's clear that whoever did the score does too. Some of the uses of music at certain times in the show were really powerful and helped build scenes quite often. What's also clear at times is that the musical director was trying to say something with the music choices. This works against the show, particularly later on as I often felt the music trying too hard, if that makes any sense. Some of the later scenes lost impact because of an overbearing score and it was really unfortunate because the soundtrack was otherwise brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10: For me, this is where the show really falls apart. Whilst i try to view each work as it's own, it's always impossible not to compare this show with TMHS. In fact, in this case I think it's necessary. The main problem is that the yuki we know and love is gone and replaced with someone who's for all intents and purposes completely different. I must admit that when I read about the show first I was sceptical that a character like the original Yuki was interesting enough to hold a show as a main character. It seems the show runners had the same idea as Yuki's character is completely watered down and ironically, made much less interesting. They also included kyon as what is effectively a secondary main character, but this Kyon has been transformed into a generic, likeable romantic plot lead with nowhere near the comedy or cynicism of his predecessor. Asahina (Who was one of the funniest characters i've ever seen in TMHS) is reduced to being a pointless addition. Koizumi isn't funny anymore and doesn't provide exposition, so he's now also useless. The movement of minor characters the main light does little to improve interest and strangely enough the only character that retains some of her former class is Haruhi herself. Truth be told her new rendition is less overbearing than the original which actually makes her more appealing in a romantic setting. All of this resulted in a complete disconnect from my end, the only aspect i was invested in was the possibility of a shock Haruhi x Kyon coupling, which we all knew was unlikely from the start.  \\n\\n\r\nStory (4/10) : I remember when I watched the disappearance of Haruhi, Whilst watching Kyon in the alternate world I quickly found myself attached to the alternate characters, especially Yuki. So much so that i even thought I might like to watch a show just about Kyon and Yuki and their romance in the other world. You can imagine I was quite pleased to find out that this show existed. Unfortunately the story leaves much to be desired as it seems to be content in cashing in off the previous franchise without doing anything interesting. The plot of this show was so by the book it was painful, the only time something interesting was done it was far too late for me to start caring about anything that was going on. All of the standard cliches have been thrown in with the notable exception of an all round happy kiss conclusion. This is arguable the cliche MOST worth putting in, especially if the show sucks. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10: Whilst it's difficult to say anything in this show was done desperately poorly, it was all so uninspired that it felt impossible to get any real enjoyment out of it. By halfway through it felt like i was watching just to finish. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10: I am not predisposed against spin-off shows, but this is a great example of how NOT to do it. By all means show me a spin off that does something interesting with an existing plot or existing characters in a different context. The problem with this show is that when the parent show is TMHS, it's impossible for it not to be compared with it. This begs the question of why it's worth even making it as a spin off in the first place. Surely any fame it gets from name recognition is regained as infamy due to the fact it sits quietly in the shadow of something that is in every respect its superior. I think it's quite likely i would have enjoyed this show more had it had absolutely nothing to do with TMHS and been a new show with new characters etc. I certainly would have been more forgiving of it. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a chance you might get something out of this if you liked TMHS, but in my honest opinion instead of watching something that messes with something you know you should watch something that tries to interest you in something you don't. There are better romances out there by some way, and probably better spin off shows too.",

If they Haruhi is going to appear in 2 different series (yeah i get it is an alternate universe)  at-least give her the same color hair ribbon or explain why it has to be an alternate universe, like it was all a dream or something believable.  (Note: it says I need a longer review so the rest of thisis just filler space.  No idea why it cant be shorter if you express all you want to in 3 sentences)",

But man, this show was a pretty disappointment.\r\nDont get me wrong, i enjoy seeing my goddess on the scene again and actually i enjoyed this show. But how can you make a slice-of-life series out of one of the best slice-of-life show ever made and even for a slice-of-life mix with romance elements, it's not even that good.\r\nNow to the story, remember that scene where Kyon made a library card for Nagato, you remembered? Good, coz someone came up with an idea to create a sol show out of that situation and there we got The disapearance of Nagato Yuki, bravo. The show has many references to its original which i find very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the same except for Nagato of course, she turns into a really shy girl instead of holy cold and Asahina is bit quackier.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is normal, the colors are bright, fit with the show. The op and ed are pleasant to hear.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you wanna see Haruhi and Nagato again, you should watch the show, and somehow you will enjoy it",

            "content": "Here is the written review to my video review.\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nSet in an alternative time-line of the Haruhi universe, the Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-Chan premise is, what would happen if the world of Haruhi was missing the supernatural plot elements and becomes a normal slice of life? Well to put it to short Kyon would\u2019ve never met Haruhi, but instead gets closer to Nagato. The plot of the whole show is about the relationship between Nagato and Kyon, with the question during the series, can Nagato get Kyon to fall for her, and so for fourth they go and perform a huge range of normalactivities building their relationship. Pretty much everyone knows Nagato has a crush on Kyon, except Kyon himself, and everyone is playing wingman hoping to get the two together. Unfortunately for the story, nothing really happens, they go on do a various range of normal activities you find in a slice of life genre. The story does get interesting at episode 10 with the sudden shift in tone, turning it from a comedy to a drama. However this is short lived.\\n\\n\r\nSo unfortunately the story is nothing special, it\u2019s a simple romance story of can the girl get the guy. And the whole shot is like this for the majority of the time. Only at one part the story, it gets really interesting. At episode 10, things change up, because we get so used to this new world of Haruhi and get used the characters, but what happens when you take that away just for a bit. The show\u2019s pace and tone changes drastically from a silly slice of life comedy to a supernatural drama. And unfortunately it is just for a bit, as the show changes back to its generic slice of life format. The show does have a slow start and doesn\u2019t really get interesting until Haruhi arrives at episode 3, but it also has a rather underwhelming, unsatisfying ending. But seriously if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that these were Haruhi characters, there\u2019s not a lot going for this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nYuki Nagato is the main character this time around in this universe. Unlike her character in Haruhi, she is more awkward and shy this time around. She gets nervous a lot when she gets close to Kyon. And she is also a gluttoness gamer girl that has the personality traits of a little girl, and that is kind of annoying as she can\u2019t really do anything on her own. As the series progress, she gains more confidence in herself and she starts to become more opened to the people around her. Eventually wishing everything stays the same as it is, that is until episode 10, when she completely does a 180. For episode 10 to 13, Nagato personality changes to a more familiar appearance, resembling that of the mute, emotionless Nagato from Haruhi. And I love that the did this change to the plot up a bit, as we have gotten so use to the Nagato in this world, so it was very surprising to see her completely different suddenly.\\n\\n\r\nKyon is Nagato\u2019s primary love interest. And from a far we can tell, he is pretty much the same as he was in Haruhi, although he\u2019s probably has a more laid back attitude. But pushing him from the main character to the plot device was kind of a detrimental to him. His interactions with Nagato felt rather force, and it seems as if the relationship was going nowhere. However he does get some good development towards the series end, especially during the Disappearance Arc and the last couple of episodes, where he felt like the main character. But other than that, nothing really changes.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as supporting characters go, pretty much everyone from the original Haruhi are a part of it, with the addition of some others. Such as Ryouko Asakura who plays the role of a big sister and overbearing friend to Nagato. Maybe too supportive of Nagato, she doesn\u2019t really do anything for herself as she is just trying to make Nagato happy. Haruhi Suzumiya makes a return as supporting character this time around. Although I love her interactions with Kyon because it shows reminisce from the original and it\u2019s pretty comedic to watch, but it doesn\u2019t really add too much to the storyline, because it\u2019s seen from a different perspective, as we see her more of an annoyance. She\u2019s still the energetic eccentric girl we know from the original though. Asahina and Koizumi return as well, but they get very little screen time this time around and have no development in the story whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 5/10, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSeeing the characters that I\u2019ve known to love was kind of hard at first, I did get used to the art style eventually but I don\u2019t think the designs were that good to look at. The show was trying to be a very moe show, so the characters had a very cute design added towards them. Not that I mind them, but it was very distracting sometimes, especially during the disappearance arc. And Kyon\u2019s design really distracted from his personality, as I don\u2019t think it really fitted at all. The animation is rather standard it\u2019s nothing special, but it\u2019s not bad it runs smoothly, but at times the frame rates aren\u2019t right. It spots a very moe art style, but the colours and designs are rather basic, there is not a lot of attention to detail in the art, especially when most of the scenes contain a lot of white or either bright.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, it is neither memorable or forgettable as it does its job. There\u2019s a great variety of music to be heard which really compliments the more light hearted comedic scenes. And the soundtrack gets better between episodes 10 and 13 because of the shift in tone. The opening theme is not that great, it fits the light hearted moe theme, but during those 4 episodes of the disappearance arc, it didn\u2019t really belong. However the ending theme, although it didn\u2019t really fit the general show, it was perfect for the disappearance arc. One thing I did love that Satelite did was the casting, they got the original cast from the original Haruhi series to do the voices for their characters, which I love because we\u2019ve grown accustom to these characters and voices. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I look back at what was the most enjoyable part of this show it all comes back to the Disappearance Arc, episodes 10 to 13. The best parts of the show was 10 to 13, because of the sudden change in pace and tone. However if it weren\u2019t for the build-up pre episode 10, I didn\u2019t think I would be as surprise as how it turned out. Yes it does take a while to get interesting as it\u2019s really a generic romance slice of life to begin with, but those episodes, between 10 and 13 were the most heart-warming, intense and interesting  moments of the show. But that\u2019s all there is, it\u2019s a long build up and can get kind of boring with nothing happening at all for the most part. And the ending was kind of underwhelming as it kind of just ended. But if it wasn\u2019t for the Haruhi characters I probably wouldn\u2019t have had any interest in this show, simply I enjoyed this show because it contained Haruhi characters, that is it.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story I give it a 6, only because of the Disappearance Arc and how it completely surprised me, made was really interesting. But for the most part it plays a safe generic slice of life romance story. It does take a while to build up, but those 4 episodes were worth it. However the ending after it is underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound they get a 5 and a 7 from me. The art style is fine for the genre, but felt very unfitting to some of the characters, especially Kyon, and when the tone changed in the Disappearance Arc it was kind of hard to take everything to seriously. Also the fact the animation is nothing special, it is rather simple. The sound however did a good job fitting with the different scenarios. And it peaked during the Disappearance Arc. However the Opening the and Ending themes fitted only to a portion of the anime and they weren\u2019t really all that memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters get 6 from me because like everything else seeing Nagato and Kyon in the disappearance arc really made things interesting and the show really needed it. And I love the interactions between Kyon and Haruhi. However nothing really happened for the rest of the characters of show, even the interaction between Nagato and Kyon felt like it was going nowhere. \\n\r\nFor my enjoyment of the show, I give it a 6. This would\u2019ve been a 4 or lower if it didn\u2019t have Haruhi characters and if it didn\u2019t have the Disappearance Arc. Everything before the disappearance arc is fun to watch  for a bit, but it gets kind of repetitive. And honestly I just watched this show for the Haruhi characters, but I didn\u2019t find the show as enjoyable as I could\u2019ve had.\\n\\n\r\nSo after rounding the scores up I give The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-Chan a 6/10. If weren\u2019t for episodes 10 to 13, the show would\u2019ve been a generic slice of life romance show with Haruhi characters. The story even though, it starts off slow, the surprise factor of the disappearance arc made things really interesting and I was really hooked on to it. I recommend this show to fans of the slice of life genre and romance genre for a simple basic anime with a surprise factor. However if you\u2019ve never really enjoyed Haruhi, this would not change your opinion at all, so this is a fine skip able anime as well. And it was probably my most disappointing anime of Spring 2015, because I really wanted to enjoy Haruhi characters again.",

            "content": "Ahh the Disappearance of Yuki Nagato-chan; the latest literary warfare of the S.S. Yuki X Kyon. And let me tell you, it throws quite a punch. Much has been said about this series. Just go to its MAL page and the score says a lot. But why is that? Well, let\u2019s try to break down where does this series stand, shall we?\r\nThis is a SPIN-OFF (I\u2019ll be using caps \u2018cause I can\u2019t use underlines) of an existing story that was last updated by its author 4 years ago since the release of this anime adaptation. Spin-offs are usually an author playing with a what-if scenariofrom a story (in this case, Yuki X Kyon shipment) and trying to write a cohesive narrative out of it. And while true, the Haruhism community is still alive and kicking, basing from the people I\u2019ve talked to, they are a minority (at least, outside Japan). So basically this is a story that is pandering to only a specific people from an already miniscule community. And oh yeah, it has 16 episodes. This went on in my mind prior to the release, thinking \u201cit must be a pretty good story to be given this kind of luxury.\u201d But like Haruhi, the guys in the production have no idea about the term \u201cmoderation\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nRiding on the impression that this adaptation will carry the same spirit of the original series, I was greeted with a snore fest at the start more intense than a math teacher giving lectures in a monotone voice. The setting, as it is, is boring. But the thing about it is it\u2019s supposed to be boring. The setting was taken from the alternate universe in the Disappearance arc of the original series and the reason that it works so well on the original story was because of an X Factor: Kyon. Kyon was the reason living in such a peaceful world feels ironically uneasy. He was the reason that being in that place was a distress. This in turn gave a unique predicament and, of course, an interesting story. But this spin-off seemed to capitalize on the dependent variable of that setup (i.e. boring world) and tried to make it work. Our man (or in this case, maiden) of the hour is one Yuki Nagato: the super shy, game-playing version. The story revolves around her confessing her love for Kyon and 164 other shoujo romance clich\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully though, the story does pick up\u2026 by a mere TEN EPISODES LATER (good grief, that\u2019s worse than endless eight). And when it does pick up, the series can actually tell a good story. But now the question is: \u201cWhy did it take 10 episodes for the story to get interesting?\u201d because trust me, if those 10 episodes were at least entertaining, I wouldn\u2019t be asking that, and I'm a pretty lenient person. There was an introduction of characters who we\u2019ve already known and retelling of the adventures of the S.O.S. Brigade told, of course, differently \u2500But the changes they\u2019ve made weren\u2019t anything substantial or intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nWith how the story played out, we could\u2019ve immediately jumped from episode 4 to episode 10. Ignoring the obvious reason of cha-ching, the only defense I can say about the 10-episode thing is nostalgia. But it\u2019s hard to appreciate the gesture when it\u2019s not the same studio who did it (it\u2019s Studio Satelight who did this one). And as we all know, for legal reasons, they cannot use the original looks on KyoAni\u2019s adaptation. And don\u2019t give me the \u201cIt\u2019s to bring in a new crowd\u201d bullcrap because again, it\u2019s a SPIN-OFF and not one that represents the original series too well.\\n\\n\r\n(Edited:) AND SPEAKING ABOUT ORIGINAL LOOKS, art. Right, I forgot about this one. This is one factor that should also be an interesting subject. As said before, due to the series being handed to a different studio, the art of the characters have to be changed. And this metamorphosis was the brainchild of Ito Ikuko. So whether or not you liked her work, the responsibility of receiving your sentiment belongs to her. In my experience, the art did take some time to get used to, but it seems that Kyon's face was on hard mode as it was the one that took me the longest to, for lack of a better word, accept (actually if you look at it, there was a gradual elongation of Kyon's face throughout the series as the studio's response to the problem). But to Ms. Ito's credit, her rendition of the characters resembled closer to the one on the spin-off manga (this is based from the manga's cover that I've seen). Moving on, the overall art style had the saturation taken up a notch (as opposed to the original adaptation) as most of the scenes in the series are done with pop and bright colors fitting of a standard slice-of-life anime with the exception for some of the scenes in the disappearance arc in order to match the tone.\\n\\n\r\n(Not edited anymore, sorry about that:) Despite the many elements that makes this a bad successor on one of the most popular series in the late 2000\u2019s, let\u2019s give credit where credit\u2019s due. At least there was a tiny effort to make those 10 episodes worth enduring. I say tiny because unless you\u2019ve read the many iterations of the series and are super analytic about it, you\u2019ll never notice it, or be glad that you noticed it. There\u2019s also the effort of making the voice actors and actresses (even of the English dub) reprise their roles that was super cool. Add to that, some of the soundtracks from KyoAni\u2019s adaptation got to be played here (so KyoAni DOES care). Actually, when you have little-to-no care about the narrative of the story, you start to notice its technicalities and that brought about my appreciation of this series\u2019 OST which was a huge help on me finishing this. And lastly, the sequencing and direction on the \u201cDisappearance of Yuki-chan\u201d arc. There was a scene (which I\u2019m not gonna put effort to find which specific episode) where there\u2019s just sequences of imagery. You hear no dialogue, just the soundtrack but you can understand everything that\u2019s happening. Like I said, they\u2019ve made the effort of making it interesting and it\u2019s rare you see that in any visual medium, not excluding anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo it all comes down to my final verdict. Is it worth your time? That is a definite NO \u2500 with exceptions. If it wasn\u2019t clear already, this is for the fans of the YukiXKyon ship so if you\u2019re all aboard on that then you\u2019ll probably like this one. If not, then it would take a lot of your fandom energy to find this interesting. Probably the best way to enjoy this is watching up to episode 4 then skip to 10 onward like I said.",

It's really quite the achievement if you consider the fact that her alternate world self is supposed to be the emotionless and inexpressive character. Instead, for the brief 3 episodes where Yuki-chan acts more like her character from the main continuity, the show actually gets interesting! Unfortunately this actually only serves to underscore the fact that on her own, \"Yuki-chan\" is terrible.\r\nIt's pretty obvious that the writers even recognized this since most of the interaction inthis anime happens between Kyon and other cast members. In fact, the best interactions are, almost as expected, between Kyon and Haruhi. It's somewhat sad that considering this is supposed to be Yuki's show, that it's more fun to watch Kyon get annoyed at Haruhi than it is to see him interact with Yuki. This tells you pretty much everything you need to know about Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've never been a fan of the Suzumiya Haruhi series, nor of any of the characters. Moreover, Haruhi is one of those arrogant school kids who likes bossing people around and forcing her ways, so that you want to punch her in the face and tell her to get real. Actually, I could have become a fan of the series if it weren't for Haruhi - this girl pissed me off in every single episode. Unfortunately, following my principles, I had to watch the spin off, for I've already seen the main series.\r\nFrom the very beginning of its announcement, I knew Nagato Yuki-chan was goingto be a total disaster of a show. I don't usually like Slice of Life shows, except when they are good. Well, Nagato Yuki-chan is definitely not a good SoL. I knew I'll be bored watching it, I knew I'll stop every 2 episodes to get a snack, and I knew I'm gonna rate it low. This explains why I watched it in 1080p BD rip - I've been stalling it forever. But I had to see it, that is, I felt obliged because I had already seen the rest of the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the story, there is no trace of it. Really. Halfway into the series, I couldn't grasp the plot of it. One could claim that the plot is about Nagato's attempts to overcome her uncertainty and confess her feelings to Kyon. However, this happened to be a tiny part of this mess of a show and could be summed up in the three episodes bearing the name of the series. 3 out of 16. Moreover, the show contains at least one of each cliche episodes in the anime industry, namely a hot springs episode (a couple of them), a beach episode, and a summer festival episode. The series also rehashes some of the original one's episodes, which is plain plagiarism and shows a lack or originality. It is in the end of episode 9 when they finally decided to throw in some conflict which, however, was vague as hell and resolved ITSELF in 3 episodes. Pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they are as shallow as the story. As much as I wasn't a fan of the original series, I could still find charm in some of the characters, like Kyon and Nagato. This spin off, however, destroys the personalities of the characters and replaces them with cardboard ones (probably to suit the shallowness of the plot). No one in the main cast acts like \"themselves\", especially Kyon, Haruhi and Nagato. I liked Kyon in the original series, but I find him spineless here. And Haruhi was the bane of the original show, while here I don't care about her. Even in the episodes where she plays a major role, I still can't find her as annoying as I used to in the main series. The most ruined character, unfortunately, is Nagato. I understand that this series is supposed to be a parallel universe existing in the course of The Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi movie, but as far as I remember, the human Nagato from the movie wasn't the same person as the Nagato from this spin off - the movie Nagato was better. The rest of the cast is even worse, but at least they weren't that important in the main series either. Mikuru exists in the story only to swoon and to have her breasts fondled by the rest of the girls. Tsuruya is there to tease Mikuru and to provide an excuse for the characters to visit the beach and a hot springs resort (since her family owns them). Itsuki is reduced to the \"other guy\" with questionable orientation - a common archetype in stories with five main characters where two of them are boys, the one being the protagonist. Ryouko is the only character that had more appeal to me than she did in the main series, but even she was just the overused archetype of the \"onee-san\".\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and sound, I'm gonna sum them up in one paragraph, for I didn't find anything in them worthy of an own paragraph. All in all, they were mediocre. The art was plain compared to the original series and the character designs were kind of unsymmetrical. Overused, as well. The animation was cheap with nothing especially well animated. The sound was forgettable, the songs were annoying, especially the OP song. The ED was better, but still mediocre. I liked that they hired the original VAs, but that's all. Anyone, who knows what I value the most in an anime, will understand my rating based only on this paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nAs for my enjoyment, it was nonexistent as the plot. This show is not even some mindless watch. Shounen series with crisp animation and lots of fighting are that (at least to me). Nagato Yuki-chan was plain boring, so much that I have been stalling it for more than a year.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I knew the series was going to be bad and I went into it with low expectations, but it didn't help. If you are a fan of the original series, you may find some appeal in it, or you may feel cheated depending on your expectations. However, don't expect it to be even an ounce similar to the main series. Nagato Yuki-chan is a boring SoL compared to the mystery and fantasy of the original anime.",

            "content": "If you're considering watching \"Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu\" because you are a fan of the Suzumiya Haruhi series, pause now and reconsider. This anime is a blatant attempt to milk the viewership of its predecessors, tossing the cast into an utterly mediocre high-school anime and forgetting everything that made the original series good in the first place. Even the characters are changed to fit into this most mundane trope: Kyon is now a typical male love interest, Nagato a shy girl, and Haruhi a forgettable side character. Disposing of these key personalities as well as any supernatural underpinnings, Yuki-chan is a disappointment. I would recommendavoiding this anime!\\n\\n\r\nJust as a note, the series description implies that Yuki-chan takes place in the alternative world seen in the Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi film. That may have been the inspiration for this series, but that's as far as the connection goes.\\n\\n\r\nStory [3/10]: Shy female protagonist is attracted to the male lead, who starts to show reciprocated feelings, but random coincidences stop them from confessing to each other. Does this sound familiar? Yuki-chan takes this mediocre trope and works it to death. Only the final plot arc seems to have any forward momentum, but that is obliterated by the empty finale.\\n\\n\r\nPacing [4/10]: Yuki-chan is paced just a tad better than the Endless Eight arc. In fact, you might say that the development of Nagato's character proceeds at around the same rate.\\n\\n\r\nArt [7/10]: Nothing spectacular, the artwork in Yuki-chan certainly can't salvage this series.\\n\\n\r\nSound [6/10]: The soundtrack is standard fare for high school anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [4/10]: Not only are the characters plain and undistinguished, they also overwrite the fun personalities created in Melancholy. The show spends plenty of screen time on the relationship between the two main characters without forming a strong emotional connection between them. In fact, the single rooftop scene in Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi between Kyon and Nagato is more satisfying than the entirety of Yuki-chan.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [4/10]: I watched the entirety of Yuki-chan waiting for them to bring back the refreshing elements of Melancholy, to no avail. Even worse, Yuki-chan is unable to stand on its own merit. Avoid this series and consider it time saved.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [4/10]",

            "content": "The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is an elseworld, Earth-2 spin-off of the famous \"Haruhi Suzumiya\" series, meaning we return to the characters we know, but not the universe. \r\nThe spin-off works for those who have seen the original series and movie as it is a return to familiar faces but in a new environment, with new stories to tell. On the other side of that coin, it also works well as just a pleasant romance drama with none of the overly complicated religious tones, philosophy, pseudo-science and quantum string theory that were part of the majesty of the original series. So it\u2019s a good introductionto the characters that\u2019s more accessible to the casual viewer.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Nagato is a vast departure from the monotone android from the original series, Kyon feels and plays exactly the same: a cynical teenager who can always find something to complain about, but deep down has a heart of gold. Asakura plays the warm, motherly figure she was portrayed as at the beginning of the first series, and it\u2019s refreshing to see her character fleshed out, as opposed to the original where she . . . moved to Canada, by episode 3.\\n\\n\r\nOnce all the familiar faces are re-introduced, the show plays like a basic high school romantic comedy. It doesn't take a lot of chances in that regard, but because the series this is based off encompasses so very much, this is a welcome departure to something that plays a little easier on the psyche. Of course many of the other side characters return, as well as fan favorites and a few Easter eggs for those who have read the other spin-offs of this franchise. But at the same time, someone who's never seen the original could watch this show and fall in love with it without knowing it's based on something else. I said to myself that it reads like \"what if\" fanfiction, but in the best possible way. It allows fans to see what these people would be like in a more real-world scenario instead of getting caught up in complicated time travel paradoxes. Instead of discussing what Haruhi is, how important she is, or what she means, you\u2019ll see them have a Christmas party, go to the hot springs, or even just work up the courage to tell someone that they care. Here they\u2019re just people being teenagers and growing up. So if you loved the original, or just want something easy-going to watch, I recommend \"The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan.\"",

            "content": "I should preface this by saying I do enjoy the manga this is adapted from, the pacing is good and the story becomes quite warm and endearing as you get past what was adapted. I'm going to make a lot of references to the manga as well. \r\nThe Disappearance of Nagato Yuki's adaptation was a good attempt at trying to bring any symbolic  form of Haruhi Suzumiya back to audiences that want more but I feel the run of the show hit all the bad parts of the manga without touching upon anything that makes it a fun story. A predictable mess from startto finish that takes the huge buildup that the manga begins and just keeps building, and building, and building and oh...it ended. The story is built in such a way that an adaptation would need to be much longer than a typical seasonal run, mind you 16 episodes is off the norm, but only leaves you either disappointed or wanting more, but not craving more, it's more of an empty feeling that you need closure but you're not excited for it. I was dumbfounded when I saw the way they decided to end the story off, think of the most disappointing ending to a slice of life romance ever and its that. The art direction keeps with the style in the manga almost to a t. A faux-watercolor style makes the art warm and vibrant, a good style to keep with the happy-go-lucky style of the story direction. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters deviate enough from the original KyoAni style enough where Kyon in no way looks like the original, where every other character retains their original round faced, wide eyed fashion. I guess the original sharp chinned rough eyed Kyon stood out too much in a story about Yuki so they sanded him down and widened his eyes and actually made him smile this time around, I know crazy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I would recommend the story itself, but stay away from the anime. The manga hits when it really gets going but I hate to make that sort of a recommendation. I don't like being that guy that says \"Oh well it gets better around episode 29,\" or in this case \"It gets better around chapter 50, trust me.\" If you're looking for another slice of life rom-com then go right ahead, watch the anime, if you liked the alternate dimension the movie brought up and want that, go ahead read the manga, skip the anime. This isn't an anime geared towards fans of the original series, nothing happens that makes any sort of reference to Haruhi Suzumiya.Think of this as a new beginning for people who haven't watched any other form of the series and aren't in to supernatural mysterious comedies, but like a romance where both characters like each other but for god's sake won't say anything until the end.  It's a fun little story that while I can recommend it, I know a lot of people wouldn't enjoy it the way I do. In conclusion, watch the original series, then if you want something else in the multiverse that is Haruhi Suzumiya then give this a shot, but maybe pick up the manga instead, everything ties together and it's cure, I promise.",

            "content": "This isn\u2019t so much a show as an accessory.  Of course, the whole premise, as anyone watching this show likely knows, is a deeper exploration of the \u201cnormal high school anime world\u201d drawn up by Yuki Nagato in The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, so it makes perfect sense that The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan really feels like a tangent more than an actual series, but a show consciously supplicating itself to tropes does not necessitate its being mediocre.  The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya occasionally made a point of being \u201cordinary\u201d and managed to twist the concept into something original; The Disappearance of NagatoYuki-chan makes a point of being \u201cordinary,\u201d and that\u2019s the joke.\\n\\n\r\nThe Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is the Rogue One of Haruhi; it\u2019s Toast Rei Bizarro World; it\u2019s Haruhi Suzumiya: The Movie: The Alternate Universe: The Show.  It was a funny but resonant venture that worked very well in its intended circumstances, but it gets old faster than a chain-smoking bomb disposal technician once it gets stretched into an actual series.  Getting to see the SOS Brigade as a group of relatively innocuous, average teens was one of the best parts of The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, and Nagato\u2019s 180 into a self-conscious shy girl pining after Kyon was itself the most entertaining component of the scenario.  Yet removed from the all-important context of the film, warped into new character designs, robbed of Kyoto Animation\u2019s distinctive touch, and transformed into something much more generic and unremarkable than what we were originally promised by the film\u2019s definition of \u201cnormal life,\u201d this concept isn\u2019t half as appealing as it used to be.  \\n\\n\r\nEh.  It\u2019s a Mikuru Miracle that Yuki doesn\u2019t have an ahoge or get groped accidentally by Kyon.  Oh, except for when both of those things happen.  Given how silent and disinterested she is at all times in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, it might be easy to forget or misconstrue how much personality Nagato actually has until you see her here with *really* no personality.  This wannabe-moe-blob protagonist is absolutely not Shy Yuki from the movie; this blob is the kind of faceless stand-in who thinks about food all the time, stays up all night playing video games, trips over herself, gets scolded by her onee-san (the bowdlerized Ryoko Asakura), and then has to learn to believe in herself by the end of the episode or else something bad [read: nothing of any consequence] will happen.  Haruhi herself (who, for reasons that can be found underneath Jimmy Hoffa\u2019s bones, somehow manages to shoehorn herself into this show repeatedly) remains Haruhi, thankfully, although seeing as Haruhi Suzumiya is the poster child for strong personality, it would be a greater challenge to recreate her unsuccessfully.  Kyon doesn\u2019t fare as well.  Instead of the sardonic, lightning-fast cynic who dispiritedly narrated the misadventures of the SOS Brigade with his wonderful monologues, Kyon is just\u2026  some guy.  He has no face, his hair is different, half his screen time is devoted to smiling sheepishly, and I\u2019m pretty sure he even got shorter.  He never has anything remotely interesting to add, which might be a consequence of his abandoning the position of narrator (to no one in particular, though sometimes it\u2019s Asakura).  I think it\u2019s Kyon who did the most disappearing, not Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the cast is the same, but Minori Chihara approaches her performance in such a drastically different fashion that once more the novelty of Yuki Nagato being in this situation evaporates.  Many factors slowly chip away at the conceit that this is actually Yuki Nagato; her character design is quite dissimilar, her voice has been altered, her demeanor and personality have undergone a serious shift, and the very situation in which she exists is one irreconcilable with The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (which is why the movie ended the way it did).  You could argue that this is not Yuki Nagato at all, rather a completely different character who just happens to have the same name and seiyuu.  Of course, it\u2019s pointless to get indignant or make any sort of grand philosophical argument on this basis, because this entire show is clearly meant to be some half-assed wish fulfillment for everyone who wanted more of shy Yuki-chan from the movie.  I\u2019m certainly not put out by this show in any way, especially since I have to admit to being one of those people, but it\u2019s important to recognize that, regardless of the extent of my enjoyment, this show doesn\u2019t need to exist and is a pale imitation at best of proper Haruhi canon.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure where else to fit this in, but the OP bears a striking similarity to \u201cHare Hare Yukai.\u201d  Needless to say, it doesn\u2019t quite achieve the same effect (there\u2019s no dance or anything), and sometimes the obvious points of comparison can become grating, but it\u2019s catchy and all right.  While I\u2019m mentioning miscellaneous information, I wouldn\u2019t call this a proper spoiler, but it IS something that happens, so anyone preferring not to learn any more useless but perplexing information for the time being ought to skip to the next paragraph.  There is an episodes-long arc in which Yuki almost gets hit by a car (\u201calmost\u201d as in \u201cdoesn\u2019t really get hit by a car, so\u2026  ?\u201d) and as a result her personality changes.  The show tries to push the idea that this traumatic (read: non-traumatic) event has transformed \u201cDisappeared\u201d Yuki Nagato into the original Yuki Nagato of the Haruhi Suzumiya series, which would be a questionable move in the best possible case because that Yuki Nagato, as wonderful and beloved a character as she is, would have a very hard time being a protagonist.  Her thought process is known barely to Kyon and not at all to anyone else in the world, and her nonexistent emotional range and cryptic worldview cripple any chance the audience would have at identifying with her, even as a mere viewpoint.  Moreover, since this latest version of Yuki Nagato has the same character design as Disappeared Yuki and is still surrounded by bland shadows of real characters, all this questionable narrative shift does is throw this show into even sharper contrast with the Haruhi Suzumiya canon.  Now we have Original Yuki, Disappearance Yuki, Disappeared Yuki, and Disappeared Original Yuki, all of whom are very distinct from each other, and the baffling plot device that could have at best made for a single-episode gag turns into one-fourth of the show\u2019s total run and elicits some kind of existential crisis.  The show really begins putting on airs around this point in time, and the conceit that this Yuki Nagato, even as a mute, emotionless automaton, is comparable to the original Yuki Nagato only drives the whole enterprise further into the ground.  By then, we\u2019re just watching a failed attempt to half-recreate an entirely different show, which we could very easily watch instead of this.  Instead of Haruhi Suzumiya: The Movie: The Alternate Universe: The Show, it\u2019s Haruhi Suzumiya: The Movie: The Alternate Universe: The Show: The Original Universe: The Alternate Version: The Mini-Arc.  STOP.  The so-called finale of this show is only made more inconceivably stupid by the runaway plot that preceded it, and while I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t see it coming, I did burst out laughing and recount aloud how much of a waste of time this whole thing had been.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve probably wasted too many words spelling out what would be obvious to most people from a glance, but I can\u2019t say I have any real \u201ccritique\u201d to offer because serving up real quality seems to be outside the goals of this show.  It knows that it\u2019s a vehicle for mediocre fan service and exists to put a Yuki Nagato-like figure in the most generic situations possible; this show doesn\u2019t aspire to be anything more, and I\u2019m pretty okay with that, although its practically surreal tangents do occasionally make it frustrating, and its repeated stabs at the ordinary fail even to hit that mark and simply remind me of how much better of a show Haruhi was.  It\u2019s not awful or offensive; it\u2019s worth spelling out just what this show entails, as I have above, purely to alleviate any misconceptions, but it would be silly to levy any serious criticism against it.  If you can learn to treat The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan as something less than a regular TV anime, something more akin to a series of sketches or a simple cartoon, and if you don\u2019t mind the widening gulf between this show\u2019s protagonist and the normal Yuki presented in The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, and if you can find it in yourself to enjoy a show that is essentially a parody of generic high school anime that doesn\u2019t seem to realize it\u2019s a parody (and a pretty lame one at that), then you might be able to enjoy this show.  The best thing I can say about The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is that it pushed me to rewatch The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, which is admittedly a pretty strong plus, except for the fact that the best parts of this show are the memories of another show.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t waste your time.

The embrace heroine love the hero of the story but she doesn't have any brave to say bout her feeling .  I'm little bit bored bout the story cause the supporting look more powerful than the heroine. but start when the heroine get accident and the heroine characteristic is changed, from now, the new characteristic also love the same guy. The new characteristic know that she doesn't have much time so she deliver her feeling to the hero and after that the real characteristic ofheroine is back. 'The story should done in this scene' I thought. But it continue and I feel bored again. That't all bout my review. Thanks for read this kind of shitt \ud83d\ude0a \\n",

            "content": "I am fairly newly back into anime after about a 10 year hiatus, and Haruhi Suzumiya (melancholy and disappearance) were one of the first on my watch list. It was after watching those and finishing on the movie did I want more from the characters, and especially more about the 'normal' Yuki shown in the film \u2014 so this seemed like a logical step.\r\nI preface the rest of the review with the statement that I really enjoyed it, but that I don't think it really was a good/great anime, and I do not think I would have watched it if not for the personal interestgenerated by my enjoyment of the Haruhi Suzumiya series and movie. To outline some of the reasons for both my enjoyment and my consideration of it as a mediocre anime in general:\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n\u2014 If you have watched the movie before watching this (a must in my opinion), there are questions left surrounding Yuki character, especially considering the scene after the credits. It is very enjoyable to have another series exploring that situation with 'normal' Yuki in a 'normal' world. She is a very likeable character in that she is cute looking (youthfully doe eyed and child-like), shy, clumsy, good natured, and child-like in her actions. I found myself wanting her to succeed in her plans to have a relationship with Kyon (one of the big plot points of the series); if you disagree with this opinion then this may not be the anime for you as it depends a lot on this for you to have the patience to make it through. What should be noted is that her character here (and predicament) is quite different to the one found in the movie, it is more stereotypically high school romance-esque in my opinion.\\n\r\n\u2014 There are quite a few comedic moments that play on the characters of the Suzumiya series, as well as knowing references to it too. This series can act as a good opportunity to spend more time with these characters and see them within new situations. They are much the same but without any kind of supernatural sub plot, and I actually enjoyed their company a bit more as the bullying Haruhi is toned down a lot, and she seems more caring and personable in this series.\\n\r\n\u2014 The music is great in this series, it includes quite a few pieces of impressionist European music (Ravel, Satie-esque, etc.) that add to the passing of time and allowing feelings and bonds to grow.\\n\r\n\u2014 The animation can be really pretty at times with more colour than the original series and the movie, the characters are more cute as well (although also more generic) and it is genuinely quite nice to be in their company doing a lot of the mundane things that are portrayed in the movie (up to a point).\\n\r\n\u2014 Dub is really good, with the original English voice cast back again.\\n\\n\r\nThe mediocrity:\\n\r\n\u2014 The plot really is very basic and the whole series is based around the hope of things happening between the two characters, but the problem really comes down to how nothing really gets in the way of it (this is true up until about episode 11). The pacing can be really slow sometimes with scenes and scenarios being repeated and drawn out to fill time it seems, it would feel like all the interesting events would be put at the start and ends of each episode to facilitate viewers to return.\\n\r\nProbably the most disappointing thing to happen to the plot comes in the lack of any kind of resolution to the many plot-lines of the series. I understand this is done to allow future material to be added, but some kind of balance could have been struck better. As alluded to above, around episode 11 (more than half way through) something interesting happens to Yuki's character (relating to the title), and this brings up some very interesting questions of identity and the self. This is handled very well with her relationships with others being an interesting stimulus for Yuki's character, and gave me hope for the rest of the series, but after around 3 episodes everything is pretty much back in tone to the first 10 episodes and the only implications come between Kyon and Yuki, giving them more excuses to put off their relationship, this is the point where it went from wanting of the relationship to boredom. It takes so much dependence on the stereotype of the aloof character not being to admit their feelings, but it would have been so much better if he explained something at least something to her! The end is frustrating and feels like its only intent is to allow for more material in the future.\\n\r\n\u2014 The animation, even though I said I enjoyed some aspects of it, is quite bland. Even though the characters are quite cute now, they look similar to a lot of modern series. The animation is also lazy at times, focusing on static objects to save money, and also being inconsistent sometimes with the characters (there is a point where Kyon moves his head and it looks like is face is about to fall off).\\n\r\n\u2014 The varying tone: other then the plot this is my biggest problem with this series, it seems to change in tone and intent all the time! For example the first few episodes are very tense with various silly romantic moments happening by chance to clumsy Yuki (they knowingly refer to these in the hopes to make it better), making me think its more Shojo in tone with Yuki as the main character trying to make her feelings for Kyon known, but at the same time battling her shyness. Later the show plays more to a guy demographic with T&A all over, now focusing more on Kyon being around all these anime babes, these same anime babes that we were meant to be enjoying for their personality not their bodies (or so I thought). It moves between the two before launching into another type of plot (episode 11 point) where it moves to big themes of sense of identity, self and what constitutes a person, where many of the characters conveniently disappear for a while, which then goes in depth into Yuki and Kyon and this time they spend together and their heart warming relationship. Then, it goes back to being a beach episode with anime babes in swimsuits! It left me confused about what the series was trying to do and also annoyed me as I signed up for the character focused romance part with a bit of comedy, not boring fan service-y parts.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nThe series is too varied in tone and plot for me to recommend it to anyone who doesn't like the original series and movie, and even then I am unsure if it would appeal to all as it focuses a lot on the characters and not on a supernatural plot. The thing is that the characters outside of Yuki, and partly Kyon, are just played as they are in the original series and are put into normal situations with quite a lot of boring conclusions.\\n\r\nIn my mind the reasons to watch this are if you are particularly fond of the 'normal' version of Yuki from the movie, and would like to see a more high school romance stereotypical version of her in romantic situations with a less snarky Kyon and going on more normal adventures with Haruhi, then it's good enough to make it through enjoying a number of sequences. I felt that it had a lot more potential considering the material of the earlier content, it was not explored anywhere near as much as it could have been (or should have been).",

But even more than that, there's almost no twists to the story whatsoever, almost every situation in the show was already exploited in the original story but with a much better execution and especially with better writing.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore almost every plot device and character struggle in the show was ripped straight from the original work and given a simple make-over.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nAnother big problem with this anime is the fact there's no protagonist. Nagato the main character is very weak in terms of personality so the story balances around various different characters never making a statement of whose story are we actually watching.\\n\\n\r\nEven worse, Nagato barely has any character development. From the first episode to the last she is exactly the same person, the very shy girl in the beginning is the exact same very shy girl by the end.\\n\\n\r\nBut is not just Nagato that suffers from lack of development, despite the diverse and rich cast of characters absolutely no one in the show is developed in any significant way. The cast of characters that were previously so compelling and witty (especially Kyon) are now a poor shadow of their former selves.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound/Soundtrack: 6\\n\\n\r\nNo problem in terms in terms of sound effects as everything sounded fine but the soundtrack on the other hand is very unremarkable, although it reuses some tunes from the previous anime to give a sense of familiarity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe art is different than the previous installments and for the worse in my opinion. While there's nothing particularly bad about it, it made some characters completely different from before and made others look generic.\\n\\n\r\nBut besides that  both the art and the animation looked fine and competent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile i somewhat enjoyed the show, especially the humor, it's hard  not to compare it to the previous works that were to me much more compelling in every single way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score/ Conclusion: 5\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to recommend this show, if it existed by itself  it would be a perfectly fine experience.\\n\r\nBut since it just feels like a mediocre fan-service to milk the fans of the franchise my advice is to adjust your expectations.\\n\\n",

They've taken the characters, rewritten it without any supernatural, took away the main draw (Haruhi) from most of the show, then created a superficial, horribly written character in Yukki Nagato.  The only respite that the story had was for a few episodes when Yukki went to the book-reading and confident girl that was somewhat reminiscent of the girl in the original series.  \r\nAnd then the worst part?  They walked all over the original story and turned it into a derivative anime.  Standalone, it's decent.  But knowing what thecharacters were in the previous show, this was disgusting to watch as the characters just threw away all of their individuality, leaving Kyon as the only respectable character in the end.  Even Haruhi was marginalized.  \\n\\n\r\nLastly, they tore down the most beautiful relationship that existed between Haruhi and Yukki.  They hinted at it but never took it anywhere, treating her as a side character that can be disposed of.  One of the most famous and wonderfully-written characters cast aside as trash.  \\n\\n\r\nJust tragic.  If you have any respect for the original show, don't watch this.

There was nothing even remotely interesting about this series. Like being promised cake but getting some old candy instead.\r\nThe art wasn't the best but that can be forgive, what I can't forgive is the lack of creativity!\r\nThe spark that the charters hadwas gone in place of boring clich\u00e9s.\\n\r\nThe charters where average, the music was average, everything was just average..there was nothing spectacular about this series. Just another slice of life with nothing really goes on.\\n\r\nOverall I guess my disappointment stems from expecting something different than a generic \"slice of life\". Or at least expecting more with all the materials and story lines that could have been used, especially from the writers. Yes I know it's suppose to be taken place in an \"alternate dimension\" where everyone is normal but...I just feel like an opportunity was missed. Like it could have been an awesome \"What if\" story following the movie- what if Kyon decided to stay in the normal world or something like that.\\n\r\nThe only appeal I can see is if you are a huge fan of the franchise and love the charters. (If you picked it up without knowing anything about the rest of the books there would be a lot of hidden jokes and themes missed in this book). There are 3 things you would have to do to enjoy this manga:\\n\r\n1. Have read/ watched \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\"\\n\r\n2. Watched \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\"\\n\r\n3. Overall be a HUGE Yuki fan\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked this series good for you- more power too you! You at least were able to get more enjoyment.

            "content": "There exist few franchises as divisive as the Haruhi series. When the initial anime adaptation came out back in '06, the anime community either hailed it or loathed it. Then came a 3 year hiatus until the second season was finally released. Now this time just about everyone hated Haruhi, mostly because Kyoani thought it smart to adapt the endless eight short story from the light novels (this story being one of MANY in a rather small book, just bare that in mind) into an eight episode monstrosity of an arc, where the same thing happens in every episode with extremely minuscule changes in dialogue.Naturally, people dropped the show outright. Only the wonderkin that was the movie adaptation of the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya managed to keep the idea of a Haruhi season a somewhat realistic possibility. However, we have yet to see a proper continuation of the series, and so we have The Disappearence of Nagato Yuki-Chan, an adaptation of a spin-off manga where the rather enjoyable sci-fi aspects of the series are cast aside for the traditionally trope school life romance anime. The only thing really keeping the show fresh and interesting is the combination of my own nostalgia for the series and a decent \"twist\" arc that manages to incorporate some aspects of the old Haruhi franchise. But in all reality, the show is overall a weak offering.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise, Yuki-Chan doesn't really manage to pick-up to around midseason. We start off with our protagonist Yuki Nagato, a shy video game playing introvert who shares none of the original Nagato's traits or mannerisms. She's in the literature club, and thanks to the recent additions of Kyon and Ryoko Asakura, the club is finally safe from being shut down. Now she's free to never read a book in the club room ever again. Woot. Anyways, the show's story leads along an extremely trodden path. Its all your standard fare slice of life show, with just enough blushing and stammering to slap a romance tag on as well. The only reason I found it enjoyable was only due to its virtue as a Haruhi spin-off. I love Haruhi and its characters, and seeing them interact in this way was pretty much only enjoyable on a fan-service level. So pretty much, unless you're a Haruhi fan, you're like not to enjoy this. The best part of the story is still only enjoyable if you're familiar and fond with the OG show. So in short, story is cliche but its fun if you wanna see Haruhi and Kyon have a basic ass romantic moment together and then see it go nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single character in this show is the OG show's basic vanilla ass counterpart. Kyon isn't nearly as snarky or funny as he usually is. Itsuki is not mysterious and two-faced, he's just overly kind and rigid. Haruhi is a little less of a bitch, but she's still manic, pushy, and overly energetic (still bae). Mikuru is exactly the same, but she can't say \"That's classified\" anymore so that kinda sucks. Yuki is no longer quiet because she just doesn't talk much, she's quiet because she's the shy, mousy girl now. We already have one of those already (the m in mousy is for Mikuru), but hey, party on guys. Their interactions are fun to watch, if only for the reason I stated above. So yeah solid enough, if cliche as heck. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound wise the show is different from the original in some major ways. Due to the production house swap, artistically Nagato Yuki-Chan differs greatly from its elder show. Its a much more cutesy style, in a way, emphasizing less the \"cute\" aspects of the situation and characters for a more calm and soft feeling. The show looks and feels like a warm blanket. I like it. Animation is low budget, unfortunately, being just good enough to be satisfactory. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors tapped for Yuki-Chan are, praise be, the original cast in both Japanese and English. This is one show I (emphasis on I) love dubbed. Crispin Freeman, Michelle Ruff, Wendee Lee, Johnny Yong Bosch, the gangs all here kids. Japanese dub is good too, I just use english for nostalgia reasons. So still dope. Finally, the soundtrack unfortunately pales in comparison to the OG show, and fails in its own right. It just lacks any memorable tracks. The OP and ED are nothing of note either. Really here its just poor to average. \\n\\n\r\nAll around, Nagato Yuki-Chan kind of sucks. Its not bad, but standing as its own show rather than a fanservice-y spin-off of Haruhi causes everything to fall apart. So end judgement; Nagato Yuki-Chan is a somewhat below average slice of life romance offering that only offers nostalgia value. It's really just-\\n\\n\r\n6/10 Fair",

            "content": "The Haruhi Suzumiya series was a very meta series that took many of the commonalities of high school manga and anime and took them literally. Taking the idea of the main girl of those types of series being treated as someone more divine than the others and making it a reality was the basis of the entire series. The entire show felt like it catered to the every whim of said god-like figure because they did. It's their world and we're watching it. That's what makes Haruhi Suzumiya so special as a series.\r\nSo what happens when you take all the meta away and make itinto a typical high school show? You get Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu.\\n\\n\r\nMany tropes you'd normally see in these types of shows are there and they don't call any thinking of the viewer into question. It's tiring to see shows that revolve around a club doing anything that doesn't involve their club's activities, a forced relationship that goes nowhere, and fanservice scenes. That's not to say Haruhi didn't do these things, but most of the time, they were either subverted or not brought to the table at all. \\n\\n\r\nIt's very clear that Kyon and Haruhi are the OTP in the main timeline, but the problem is Kyon isn't in love with Haruhi, which is what leads to them not being a couple. In this universe, however, Kyon loves Nagato but is unsure of himself for a near 3 episodes before actually doing something. And of course it culminates at a fireworks festival, because it's a high school anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this show difficult to invest in is about 3 episodes in when Haruhi takes over the literature club. It becomes very apparent in the next few episodes that Kyon and Haruhi have much better chemistry than Kyon and Nagato, yet the show insists on forcing the idea. Kyon even admits he's attracted to Haruhi's figure towards the end of this series while Haruhi admits she's grateful for Kyon's role in her life, making a relationship seem very healthy. When Kyon confesses at the end, Haruhi has her back turned as though she's unhappy with his decision. It's very tough to sell a show that wants to force a romance that isn't even the best possible romance.\\n\\n\r\nWe get a brief tease of the Nagato we all know and love around the middle of the show when Nagato gets hit by car-kun, because of course. In that, it's so obvious how much more likable this Nagato is. She isn't reliant on Ryoko or Kyon for anything and is very independent. She's not a good protagonist to follow, but it was so nice to see her for as brief the time was. Of course, this show had to bring the otaku Nagato back. I have nothing against otakus since I am one myself (if you want to call it that), but this character was painful to watch compared to, say, Illya from the Prismaverse as opposed to the Stay Night universe.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if I've ever seen a show so keen on telling us this is a different story from what we know and love than this show. It's in the OP's lyrics. I also see a lot of scenes and dialogue exchanges in this show and the question \"Haven't I heard this before?\" immediately comes to mind. However, I will say I had my happy ending when the last episode repeated as it started. I can't say too much but let's just say it is a bad end for fans of the series. The unfortunate side of this is that this show is actively spitting in the face of fans of a certain character. This is not a good thing, even though I got a massive kick out of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was not a good show. It takes place in the universe that \"Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu\" told us is wrong and undesirable. Go read the rest of the LNs instead, it's a much better use of your time.",
